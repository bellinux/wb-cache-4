5|$|Durio <b>sensu</b> <b>lato</b> has 30 {{recognised}} species. Durio {{sensu stricto}} comprises 24 of these species. The 6 species included in Durio s.l. are now {{considered by some}} to comprise their own genus, Boschia. Durio s.s. and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial {{difference between the two}} is that anther locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s.s. These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, Cullenia. These three genera together form a clade that is characterized by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Liliaceae {{has a very}} complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it {{became one of the}} largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms <b>sensu</b> <b>lato</b> and sensu stricto are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, s.l. and s.s.) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. Liliaceae s.s..|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} London, Stearn {{produced}} a steady output of publications {{during his years}} at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952). These covered {{a wide range of}} topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on Vinca, Epimedium and Lilium. Within two years of joining the Library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale Woodcock and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae <b>sensu</b> <b>lato.</b> While at the Library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the Code of Botanical Nomenclature (see Botanical taxonomy).|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests. It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce. Other locations where the false chanterelle has been recorded include Africa, Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca <b>sensu</b> <b>lato.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five monocot orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic {{is similar to that}} found in lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family, Liliaceae <b>sensu</b> <b>lato</b> or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E

5|$|Hoagland and Davis (1987) {{subsequently}} {{completed a}} thorough analysis, based on electrophoresis, shell morphology, and internal anatomy, of the succineids at Chittenango Falls. They divided Succinea into two genera, keeping the Old World Succinea in the genus and elevating the New World Succinea, of the Section Novisuccinea including ovalis and chittenangoensis, to the genus level. They also {{determined that the}} Old World Succinea putris is probably a species complex and that the gray morph, although closely related to Succinea putris <b>sensu</b> <b>lato,</b> is a distinct species, which they designated Succinea sp. B. Based on these factors, the species designation Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is considered valid. Both species have been observed with red and gray morphs, bringing into question whether the earlier separation truly represented taxonomic distinctiveness. Currently, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, Succinea sp. B, and 3–4 Oxyloma spp. {{are considered to be}} the only succineid species present at Chittenango Falls. In 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey (T. King, unpublished data) amplified and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase I region of mitochondrial DNA and the ITS-1 region of nuclear DNA in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and Succinea sp. B. The results (sequence divergence of 10–15 percent) suggest large differences between the two species. No hybridization was observed.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum <b>sensu</b> <b>lato</b> included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

Phleum is a distinct lineage that is not closely allied to any other included Alopecurinae genus.

5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus <b>sensu</b> <b>lato</b> (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified.
