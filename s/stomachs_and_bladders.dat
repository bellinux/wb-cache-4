40|$|Cluster {{detection}} {{has become}} {{an important part of}} the agenda of epidemiologists and public health authorities, the identification of high- and low-risk areas is fundamental in the definition of public health strategies and in the suggestion of potential risks factors. Currently, there are different cluster detection techniques available, the most popular being those using windows to scan the areas within the studied region. However, when these areas are heterogeneous in populations’ sizes, scan window methods can lead to inaccurate conclusions. In order to perform cluster detection over heterogeneously populated areas, we developed a method not based on scanning windows but instead on standard mortality ratios (SMR) using irregular spatial aggregation (ISA). Its extension, i. e. irregular spatial aggregation with covariates (ISAC), includes covariates with residuals from Poisson regression. We compared the performance of the method with the flexible shaped spatial scan statistic (FlexScan) using mortality data for <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> cancer for 8, 098 Spanish towns. The results show a collection of clusters for <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> cancer similar to that detected by ISA and FlexScan. However, in general, clusters detected by FlexScan were bigger and include towns with SMR, which were not statistically significant. For bladder cancer, clusters detected by ISAC differed from those detected by ISA and FlexScan in shape and location. The ISA and ISAC methods could be an alternative to the traditional scan window methods for cluster detection over aggregated data when the areas under study are heterogeneous in terms of population. The simplicity and flexibility of the methods make them more attractive than methods based on more complicated algorithm...|$|R

Subjects/Methods: Forty-eight breastfeeding infants were measured at 2, 5, 9 and/or 12 months (n= 62 sessions) within 1 - 2 min before the start and after the end of breastfeed. Median (IQR) time between measurements was 24 (20. 0 - 30. 0) min. Resistance measurements at 0 and 50 kHz, and infinite frequency (R 0, R 50 and R inf) and resistance of intracellular water (R icw) were analysed with customised infant settings. Milk intake was measured by test weights. Free-water volumes and free-water change were determined from <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> volumes calculated from ultrasound images. Results: Small pre-to-post-feed changes (median (IQR) : R 0 - 3. 7 (- 14. 8, 14. 3); R 50 0. 3 (- 10. 4, 15. 0); R inf 2. 8 (- 13. 3, 35. 5); R icw 20. 8 (- 98. 1, 290. 9)) were not significantly different from zero (R 0 : P= 0. 92; R 50 : P= 0. 48; R inf: P= 0. 32; R icw: P= 0. 097).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{migrants}} have lower cancer mortality rates compared to the Australian-born population, particularly for colorectal and breast cancers, which are associated with an affluent lifestyle. This study seeks to update knowledge in this field by examining mortality from colorectal, stomach, lung, melanoma, breast <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> cancers, as well as all cancers combined between 1981 and 2007. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Average annual age and sex-standardised mortality rates were calculated for each region of birth, period of death registration and cancer site. RESULTS: Generally, mortality rates declined over the study period for most conditions for the majority of migrant groups. Notable exceptions included migrants from South Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe who experienced a significant increase in mortality due to all cancers combined and Australian-born individuals who recorded a significant increase in mortality due to melanoma of the skin. Migrants generally had more favourable cancer mortality outcomes, particularly for colorectal cancer and melanoma. Migrants from Southern Europe, South Eastern Europe, Chinese Asia and Southern Asia had the greatest advantage. However, migrants displayed higher rates of <b>stomach,</b> lung <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> cancers than the Australian-born population. CONCLUSION: The migrant advantage can in part be explained by the protective effects of diet, lifestyle and reproductive behaviours. Possible explanations for why some migrants display greater mortality from <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> cancer include the consumption of abrasive, salted and preserved foods and higher rates of smoking. Greater emphasis should be placed on targeting at-risk migrant groups through screening and education programs at migrant resource centres and community groups. The study calls for further research to explain the observed trends, which has the potential to uncover important risk and protective factors. Olga Anikeeva, Peng Bi, Janet E.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Focused Impedance Method (FIM) {{based on}} 8, 6 and 4 {{electrode}} configurations have been innovated and developed {{for measuring the}} electrical impedance of a localised zone in a volume conductor, all based on tetrapolar impedance technique. The zone localization in FIM has been visualized through equipotential distributions, current density at the target point and perturbation produced at the potential measuring electrodes. The predicted behaviour has been verified though phantom measurements and analytical techniques by different groups. FIM is particularly sensitive and useful if the electrical impedance of a target object in the sensitive zone changes between two sets of measurements. This can be either due to a physical change in the target object, or, if its impedance has frequency dependence, through {{a change in the}} measurement frequency. In medical applications FIM is being developed for studying <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying, localized lung function, detection of cervical and oral cancer, etc. FIM may have applications in industry to study physical mixtures of liquids and gases in pipelines and tanks, in geology to detect groundwater and other minerals, in oceanography, and in many other applications.

30|$|This {{study had}} the {{limitation}} {{that the choice}} to acquire early dynamic imaging over the heart to measure radiotracer pharmacokinetics with high temporal resolution from left-ventricular blood pool regions precluded acquisition of whole-body biodistribution information in the first hour after injection. To allow for collection of urine and give the subjects a rest break from the scanner, {{the first of two}} trunk PET/CT scans were commenced at 2  h post-injection. For calculation of radiation dosimetry estimates, the distribution of radioactivity in the regions not represented in the initial dynamic data was assumed to be static (accounting for radioactive decay) between the time of injection and the 2 -h time point. This assumption may lead to error in the dosimetry estimates, although the very slow blood clearance kinetics after 1  h (Fig. 2) and the very similar biodistribution pattern seen and 2 and 3.5  h PET/CT scans (Table 2) suggests that there is a minimal 18 F-TFB redistribution in the body once the tracer is taken up in tissues. Indeed, O′ Doherty et al.

Case Report: A 59 -year old woman was referred to our hospital with intermittent pain in the lesser pelvis for about three months. She had undergone laparotomy for cholecystectomy 24 years ago and adnexectomy more than 30 years ago. CT-scan and MRI indicated a presacral tumor, most likely compatible with a presacral teratoma.

It was more active on the <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> <b>bladder</b> {{than the other two}} drugs tested. Physostigmine and neostigmine had very similar actions characterised by: (i) A slight rise in blood pressure after therapeutic doses. Evidence is produced indicating that {{this may be due to}} adrenaline secretion. (ii) Very little effect on the heart rate, salivary secretion or bronchioles. (iii) Little effect on the stomach of the dog or donkey. Increased strength of the contractions of the rumen and reticulum. Marked stimulation of the large intestine in all species. The impression was gained that neostigmine produced purgation in equines and dogs with less signs of colic than did physostigmine.
