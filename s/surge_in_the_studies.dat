40|$|Background: Recent {{decades have}} seen a major <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of {{interspecific}} variation in functional traits in comparative plant ecology, {{as a tool to}} understanding and predicting ecosystem functions and their responses to environmental change. However, this research has been biased almost exclusively towards vascular plants. Very {{little is known about the}} role and applicability of functional traits of non-vascular cryptogams, particularly bryophytes and lichens, with respect to biogeochemical cycling. Yet these organisms are paramount determinants of biogeochemistry in several biomes, particularly cold biomes and tropical rainforests, where they: (1) contribute substantially to above-ground biomass (lichens, bryophytes); (2) host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, providing major soil N input (lichens, bryophytes); (3) control soil chemistry and nutrition through the accumulation of recalcitrant polyphenols (bryophytes) and through their control over soil and vegetation hydrology and temperatures; (4) both promote erosion (rock weathering by lichens) and prevent it (biological crusts in deserts); (5) provide a staple food to mammals such as reindeer (lichens) and arthropodes, with important feedbacks to soils and biota; and (6) both facilitate and compete with vascular plants. • Approach: Here we review current knowledge about interspecific variation in cryptogam traits with respect to biogeochemical cycling and discuss to what extent traits and measuring protocols needed for bryophytes and lichens correspond with those applied to vascular plants. We also propose and discuss several new or recently introduced traits that may help us understand and predict the control of cryptogams over several aspects of the biogeochemistry of ecosystems. • Conclusions: Whilst many methodological challenges lie ahead, comparative cryptogam ecology has the potential to meet some of the important challenges of understanding and predicting the biogeochemical and climate consequences of large-scale environmental changes driving shifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cryptogam components of vegetation composition. © The Author 2007.

One of the most interesting problem discussed in these spaces is the Dirichlet energy problem [4, 5].

It is found that the generation of deep surge is independent of the presence of classic surge. Classic surge limit cycles originate at a Hopf bifurcation and are found to terminate at a saddle loop. The occurrence of stable classic surge oscillations depends on the relative locations of the Hopf bifurcation point and the saddle loop. By modeling the effect of rotational disturbances at the compressor inlet as a perturbation to the compressor characteristic, it is shown that the rotational disturbance introduced by preswirl, inlet guide vanes, or air injection, can be used to manipulate the location of the bifurcation points so as to avoid stable classic surge...|$|R

40|$|On March 11, 2011, {{a tsunami}} struck low-lying land along Sendai Bay, where no tsunami had hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 200 years.

There {{are two kinds of}} pumps, motor and diesel pumps. Even diesel pumps need electricity to start up and control their power. If a pump is inundated by salt water, all electric parts will be short-circuited. Although the diesel mechanisms can be reused after being washed by fresh water, the electric parts of both types of pump must be replaced. The switchboard for the pumps must also be replaced. If damages are caused only by salt inundation, the electric parts of both types of pump must be replaced. Temporary recovery was done by manually controlling the pumps because the automatic pump control system was difficult to restore. The mean recovery time was one month for electric pumps and two months for diesel pumps. For pumps that were broken by external force, quick recovery was abandoned.

The damages to buildings were mainly governed by the type of material and location on the coast. At some pumping stations, the tank for desorption prevented external forces from acting on the buildings. These results show that the tsunami safety of drainage pumping stations could be improved by increasing the resistance to salt inundation and appropriately locating the tank for desorption...|$|R
40|$|WORKSHOP THEME Recently, {{there has}} been a <b>surge</b> of {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of <b>the</b> languages of the Middle East, especially Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Pashto, Kurdish and Urdu. This sudden and urgent interest is manifested by the availability of funding for rapid development of practical systems for processing large volumes of data in these languages. Computational applications for proper name identification, entity recognition, categorization, information retrieval, summarization, machine translation and other implementations are currently in high demand. This {{comes at a time when}} advances in formal and computational linguistics over the last fifty years are being consolidated, while work on machine learning and statistical methods has been showing great promise. There exists a considerable body of work in computational linguistics specifically targeted to these middle eastern languages. Much of the research and development has been the result of initiatives by individual research establishments or industry firms. Furthermore, the usage of the Arabic script gives rise to certain issues that are common to all these languages despite their being of distinct language families. Hence, these languages share properties such as the absence of capitalization, right to left direction, lack of clear word boundaries, complex wor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe current {{epidemic}} of obesity and overweight {{has caused a}} <b>surge</b> of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of adipose tissue formation. Much {{progress has been made}} <b>in</b> defining <b>the</b> transcriptional networks controlling the terminal differentiation of adipocyte progenitors into mature adipocytes. However, the early steps of adipocyte development and the embryonic origin of this lineage have been largely disregarded until recently. In mammals, two functionally different types of adipose tissues coexist, which are both involved in energy balance but assume opposite functions. White adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in energy expenditure. WAT and BAT can be found as several depots located in various sites of the body. Individual fat depots exhibit different timing of appearance during development, as well as distinct functional properties, suggesting possible differences in their developmental origin. This hypothesis has recently been revisited through large-scale genomics studies and in vivo lineage tracing approaches, which are reviewed in this report. These studies have provided novel fundamental insights into adipocyte biology, pointing out distinct developmental origins for WAT and BAT, as well as for individual WAT depots. They suggest that the adipose tissue is composed of distinct mini-organs, exhibiting developmental and functional differences, as well as variable contribution to obesity-related metabolic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Relaxin is a {{peptide hormone}} that exerts {{numerous}} effects {{in a variety}} of tissues across a broad range of species. Although first identified more than 75 years ago interest in relaxin biology has waxed and waned over the years consistent with peaks and troughs of new experimental data on its wide-ranging biological effects and advances in relaxin enabling technologies. Recent insights into species-dependent differences in relaxin biology during pregnancy have once again stimulated a relative <b>surge</b> of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of relaxin's reproductive biology. Identification and pharmacological characterization of orphaned relaxin receptors and exploration of its paracrine effects on pregnancy using genomic and proteomic technologies have succeeded in fueling current interest in relaxin research. Primates and non-primate vertebrates exhibit very disparate profiles of relaxin genomics, proteomics and functional biology. Non-human primates appear to exhibit a very close similarity to humans with respect to relaxin reproductive biology but the similarities and subtle differences are only just beginning to be understood. We, and others, have shown that relaxin produces significant changes to the non-human primate endometrium during the peri-implantation period that are consistent with relaxin's long perceived role as a paracrine modulator of pregnancy. The purpose of this review is to summarize the reproductive biology of relaxin in non-human primates with a specific emphasis on the paracrine role of ovarian and endometrial relaxin during embryo implantation and early pregnancy. </p...|$|R
40|$|In an open channel, {{steady flow}} {{conditions}} may be achieved when the discharge and boundary conditions remain constant for a reasonable period of time. The operation of any regulation device (e. g. gate) {{is associated with}} some unsteady <b>surge</b> motion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present <b>study,</b> new velocity profiling measurements were performed systematically under controlled flow conditions. Both steady and unsteady measurements were conducted in a relatively large laboratory facility. An ensemble-averaged technique was applied in unsteady flows to investigate positive surges. The experiments were repeated 25 (or 50) times for each controlled flow condition {{and the results were}} ensemble-averaged. The quality and accuracy of the Profiler data set were validated against data collected with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, in both steady and unsteady rapidly-varied flows. A careful sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the appropriate number of runs. The results indicated that the selection of 25 runs was suitable for ensemble-averaging in rapidly-varied unsteady flows. Some instrumental error was observed however with the velocity profiler. Outside the boundary layer, the Profiler tended to produce errors in terms time-averaged velocity data and velocity fluctuations for a number of points in a profile. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> demonstrated that <b>the</b> propagation of positive surges is a highly unsteady turbulent process, and the performance of ADV Vectrino II Profiler in such an unsteady turbulent flow was satisfactory, provided that a careful validation was undertaken for all Profiler outputs...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{properties}} of the visual-gestural modality impose a homogenizing effect on sign languages, leading to less structural variation in sign language structure as compared to spoken language structure. However, until recently, research on sign languages was limited to a number of (Western) sign languages. Before we can truly answer the question of whether modality effects do indeed cause less structural variation, it is necessary to investigate the similarities and differences that exist between sign languages in more detail and, especially, to include in this investigation less <b>studied</b> sign languages. <b>The</b> current research climate is testimony to a <b>surge</b> of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of a geographically more diverse range of sign languages. The volume reflects that climate and brings together work by scholars engaging in comparative sign linguistics research. The 11 articles discuss data from many different signed and spoken languages and cover a wide range of topics from different areas of grammar including phonology (word pictures), morphology (pronouns, negation, and auxiliaries), syntax (word order, interrogative clauses, auxiliaries, negation, and referential shift) and pragmatics (modal meaning and referential shift). In addition to this, the contributions address psycholinguistic issues, aspects of language change, and issues concerning data collection in sign languages, thereby providing methodological guidelines for further research. Although some papers use a specific theoretical framework for analyzing the data, the volume clearly focuses on empirical and descriptive aspects of sign language variation...|$|R
