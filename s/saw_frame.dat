50|$|Hacksaw blade specifications: The {{most common}} blade is the 12 inch or 300 mm length. Hacksaw blades have two holes near the ends for {{mounting}} {{them in the}} <b>saw</b> <b>frame</b> and the 12 inch / 300 mm dimension refers to the center to center distance between these mounting holes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piercing}} saw {{is often}} used with a V-board, {{also known as a}} birdsmouth board, which is a wooden board with a [...] "V" [...] shaped cutout in one end. In use, the V-board is clamped to the bench so that the section with the cutout hangs over the edge. This allows the work to be held down flat whilst shapes are cut into it. Either the work or the <b>saw</b> <b>frame</b> may be rotated. The V-cutout allows the saw blade to pass through the work unimpeded. When eventually worn or damaged, the board is easily replaced.|$|E

50|$|The {{substantially}} intact Elgin Vale sawmill is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} steam driven softwood sawmill, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. Located adjacent to a creek for water and {{in close proximity to}} well timbered areas, the mill is positioned below sloping ground to assist the movement of logs. Internally, the layout and the sequence designed to maximise the efficient movement and cutting of logs within the sawmill remain: the long open-sided tin and timber shed, log ramp, breakdown saw, number one and two <b>saw,</b> <b>frame</b> saw, docking benches, waste chute, rails and trolleys. Below the main floor are the boiler, engine and attached drive equipment that provide the power for the operations on the main floor.|$|E
40|$|The drive {{mechanism}} (24) controls the {{to and fro}} movement of the saw-frame (2) clamping the saw blade. The <b>saw</b> <b>frame</b> is set by a setting machine (12), and is movable {{in a straight line}} in relation to a frame-guide (8). The {{drive mechanism}} {{is in the form of}} a linear direct drive motor (26). The saw blade has diamond segments and is braked by a damper including an energy accumulator. ADVANTAGE - Stone materials such as granite, marble or cement-bound materials, are cut at a higher speed...|$|E

50|$|De Eenhoorn is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four <b>sawing</b> <b>frames,</b> one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra <b>sawing</b> <b>frame.</b> The rearmost <b>sawing</b> <b>frame</b> was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the earlier}} buildings, {{the engine room}} and its annexe and the gas {{producer}} room are of two distinct types of construction. The engine room is constructed of a <b>sawn</b> timber <b>frame</b> with a trussed roof structure. Both walls and roof sheeting have been replaced at least in parts. The amenities wing east of the engine room is similarly of <b>sawn</b> timber <b>frame</b> construction. The amenity rooms are clad in corrugated galvanised iron externally and lined internally with composition board. The workshop, constructed in 1934 is a <b>sawn</b> timber <b>framed</b> with trussed roof clad in corrugated iron without internal lining. By contrast, the gas producer rooms are constructed of large timber posts set directly {{into the ground and}} to which a <b>sawn</b> timber <b>frame</b> is attached. The building is clad with corrugated iron sheeting. Roof trusses, supporting corrugated roof sheeting, are themselves supported at mid-span by hardwood poles.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of operating <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> maintenance and usage of saw blades. In the introductory part, historic development and improvement of <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> in the Czech Republic and abroadis gradually dismantled. The second part focuses on the theoretical analysis of the process of cutting <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> Next part deals with technical - technological characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> The cutting mechanism and also the usage of the machineis described there. Next part is focused on categorization of cutting <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> according to a frame diameter and from the kinematic point of view. The next section describes the methods of division by <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> as well as {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the machines. The following section focuses on the cutting tool of <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> its definition and characteristics. In this section, a saw blades, its distribution, shape and geometry are described. The final part deals with maintenance of saw blades, compensation and removal of local defects of internal stress, subsequent control of internal tensions, as well as distributing of the blades. Further more, this part deals with grinding wheels for sharpening of saw blades and mistakes that occurduring the sharpening of the saws...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} work is Reasons for employer accidents in timber works. My work {{is divided into}} two parts the theoretical and the empirical. In the theoretical part there are some explanations for general characteristic in technological processes, further I comment sorts of woods devices. The main attention is focused on a band saw and a frame saw. Factors affecting or causing (during their interactions) accidents in work are also discussed. A labour protection during work with band <b>saw</b> and <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> and working environments effects for safety are mentioned in the last part of experimental section. The empirical part is focused on statistical evaluation of dates in question sheets. The main reasons for accidents in woods factories using band <b>saws</b> and <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> are established. The most important factors of accidents (and their relevance) are exploring and finally analyzed...|$|R

50|$|The {{windmill}} {{was built}} around 1680 in Dordrecht, {{where it was}} known as Het Spinnewiel (The spinning-wheel). In 1854 the mill was moved to Numansdorp and the name was changed to Mijn Genoegen (My pleasure). Two of the three wooden <b>sawing</b> <b>frames</b> were replaced by cast iron frames in 1854; the wooden windshaft was replaced with cast iron in 1887. In Numansdorp the mill was continuously owned by the Verboom family until the museum bought the mill in good condition from the owner.|$|R

50|$|A <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> or sash saw {{is a type}} of saw which {{consists}} of a relatively narrow and flexible blade held under tension within a (generally wooden) rectangular frame (also called a sash or gate). They are used for cutting wood or stone. The blade is held perpendicular to the plane of the frame, so that the material being cut passes {{through the center of the}} <b>frame.</b> <b>Frame</b> <b>saws</b> for use with wood are rip saws operated as a hand saw or powered in a sawmill. <b>Frame</b> <b>saws</b> used for cutting stone were powered saws in stone mills.|$|R

40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter. Fundamental to the {{understanding}} of furniture is an interest in the continuities and changes in the use of tools, and the application of techniques to furniture making. The development of tools over a long period established ‘type-forms’ that often remain the basis of hand tools (and in many cases powered versions) that are used today. Although most tools could be purchased from tool suppliers, there has been, and still is, a tradition of furniture-makers devising and making their own versions of tools for their own use. These included for example, bevels, braces, clamps, scratch stocks, moulding boxes, <b>saw</b> <b>frames,</b> gauges, lathes, planes and squares. This article briefly traces the development of the various processes and associated tools, from cutting out and shaping, construction and assembly and decoration in the period 1600 - 1840...|$|R
