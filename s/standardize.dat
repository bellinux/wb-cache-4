40|$|Standards {{have become}} {{critical}} to {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) as they become complex and pervasive. We propose a process theory framework to explain anticipatory <b>standardizing</b> outcomes post hoc when the <b>standardizing</b> process is viewed as networks of events. Anticipatory standards define future capabilities for ICT ex ante in contrast to ex post <b>standardizing</b> existing practices or capabilities through de facto standardization in the market. The theoretical framework offers the following: a) a lexicon {{in the form of the}} ontology and typology of <b>standardizing</b> events; b) a grammar, or a set of combination rules, for <b>standardizing</b> events to build process representations; c) an analysis and appreciation of contexts in which <b>standardizing</b> unfolds; and d) logic yielding theoretical explanations of <b>standardizing</b> outcomes based on the analysis of process representations. We show how the framework can help analyze standardization data as networks of events as well as explain <b>standardizing</b> outcomes. We illustrate the plausibility of the approach by applying it to wireless standardization to explain <b>standardizing</b> outcomes...|$|R

The relationship of good teaching to history and the corollary of research and teaching to defeat irrational thinking are considered. The paper also addresses what students and parents can do when they are confronted with <b>standardized</b> testing. <b>Standardized</b> tests are characterized by "intellectual bias, irrationalism, racism, fatuous anticommunism, witless patriotism, the worship of capital, the fear of sexuality, and the justification of the way things are.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this mixed-methods {{retrospective}} {{study was to examine}} the effectiveness of a training intervention for <b>standardized</b> patients to improve their verbal feedback to medical students. Although feedback is acknowledged as important for medical student development, actual interventions to improve effective feedback to medical students are scarce in the literature.; In the 2006 - 2007 academic year, the <b>Standardized</b> Patient Program at the Keck School initiated a revised training protocol for <b>standardized</b> patients playing patient cases in the Year I and Year II Introduction to Clinical Medicine interviewing workshops. Assessment instruments consisted of a <b>Standardized</b> Patient Training Satisfaction Questionnaire, a Faculty Workshop Feedback Form, student online evaluations of the workshops, and a Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Patient Feedback form. The <b>Standardized</b> Patient Training Satisfaction Questionnaire measured the knowledge, skills and confidence of the <b>standardized</b> patients in providing verbal feedback. The Faculty Workshop Feedback Form assessed whether the <b>standardized</b> patients followed the seven steps for providing verbal feedback as taught in the intervention. The student online evaluations determined if the post-intervention <b>standardized</b> patient feedback was more useful than the pre-intervention feedback. The Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Feedback form was utilized by two independent raters to score the feedback given to the medical students from video review of the workshops.; Descriptive statistics from the <b>Standardized</b> Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Faculty Workshop Feedback Form and student online evaluations indicated <b>standardized</b> patients provided effective verbal feedback post-intervention. However, direct observation by two independent raters of videos of workshop feedback revealed that <b>standardized</b> patients often omitted feedback steps.; The main conclusion reached was that although three of the four assessment instruments indicated the <b>standardized</b> patients provided quality feedback, it cannot be determined conclusively if the improved feedback was the effect of the feedback intervention in the revised training protocol. Direct observations of the independent raters must be considered as the <b>standardized</b> patients had less than satisfactory scores on the Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Patient Feedback form, indicating a lower quality of feedback. Further research with psychometrically sound instruments is needed to delineate variables contributing to the knowledge and skills of SPs as they learn to provide quality verbal feedback...|$|R
