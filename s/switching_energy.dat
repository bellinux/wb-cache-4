30|$|It {{is noted}} that the context <b>switch</b> <b>energy</b> {{overhead}} decreases {{with the increase of}} the number of context switches. In fact, to switch from one process to another, the state of each process should be saved in a data structure named process control block (PCB). The energy overhead of the creation of the PCB is accounted with the context <b>switch</b> <b>energy</b> overhead and is divided between the context switches so that if the number of context switches increases the average Ecs per context switching decreases. Also, when the scheduling policy used is SCHED_FIFO, the context <b>switch</b> <b>energy</b> overhead {{is more important than the}} energy for the SCHED_RR scheduling policy. In fact, under the round robin scheduling policy, the processor assigns time slices (quantum) to each process. So, before the context switches that we generate, there is another context switches that occurred automatically due to the expiration of the quantum of the process P 1. Consequently, the PCB is created during the automatic context <b>switch.</b> The <b>energy</b> overhead of the PCB creation is not accounted with the energy of the context switch that we generate: Ecs. But, under the FIFO scheduling policy, the processor does not switch automatically from the process P 1 to P 2 only if P 1 terminates its execution so that the energy overhead of the PCB creation is accounted with Ecs.|$|R

40|$|SiC Schottky Barrier diodes (SiC SBD) {{are known}} to oscillate/ring in the output {{terminal}} when used as free-wheeling diodes in voltage-source converters. This ringing is due to RLC resonance among the diode capacitance, parasitic resistance, and circuit stray inductance. In this paper, a model has been developed for calculating the <b>switching</b> <b>energy</b> of SiC diodes {{as a function of}} the switching rate (dIDS/dt of the commutating SiC MOSFET) and temperature. It is shown that the damping of the oscillations increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing dIDS/dt.

Although the <b>switching</b> <b>energy</b> in the current switching phase decreases with increasing switching rate, the <b>switching</b> <b>energy</b> of the voltage and ringing phase increases with the switching rate.

40|$|PiN diodes {{are known}} to {{significantly}} contribute to <b>switching</b> <b>energy</b> {{as a result of}} reverse-recovery charge during turn-off. At high switching rates, the overlap between the high peak reserve-recovery current and the high peak voltage overshoot contributes to significant <b>switching</b> <b>energy.</b> The peak reverse-recovery current depends on the temperature and switching rate, whereas the peak diode voltage overshoot depends additionally on the stray inductance. Furthermore, the slope of the diode turn-off current is constant at high insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) switching rates and varies for low IGBT switching rates. In this paper, an analytical model for calculating PiN diode <b>switching</b> <b>energy</b> at different switching rates and temperatures is presented and validated by ultrafast and standard recovery diodes with different current ratings. Measurements of current commutation in IGBT/PiN diode pairs have been made at different switching rates and temperatures and used to validate the model.
