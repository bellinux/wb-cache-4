5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
25|$|Benzothiazinone, NS6180, {{is a novel}} class KCa3.1 channel {{inhibitor}} in development. Through {{a number}} of in vitro experiments, NS6180 was qualified for KCa3.1 channel inhibition. In vivo experiment of DNBS (2,4 - dinitrobenzene <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid)</b> induced rat colitis, a frequently used animal model for inflammatory bowel disease, showed comparable efficacy and greater potency than sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Many {{nucleophilic}} substitutions occur {{more easily}} not with bare pyridine but with pyridine modified with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, or <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> fragments that then become a leaving group. So fluorine {{is the best}} leaving group for the substitution with organolithium compounds. The nucleophilic attack compounds may be alkoxides, thiolates, amines, and ammonia (at elevated pressures).|$|E

25|$|<b>Sulfonic</b> <b>acids,</b> {{which are}} organic oxyacids, are {{a class of}} strong acids. A common example is p-toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid).

50|$|<b>Sulfonic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are much}} {{stronger}} acids than the corresponding carboxylic acids. p-Toluenesulfonic acid, with a pKa of −2.8, {{is about a}} million times stronger acid than benzoic acid, with a pKa of 4.2. Similarly, methanesulfonic acid, pKa = −1.9, is also about one million times stronger acid than acetic acid. Because of their polarity, <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acids</b> tend to be crystalline solids. They are also usually colourless and nonoxidizing, which is convenient. Because of their high acidity, <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acids</b> are often soluble in water or exhibit detergent-like properties.|$|R
25|$|Taurine is {{conjugated}} via its amino {{terminal group}} with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid {{to form the}} bile salts sodium taurochenodeoxycholate and sodium taurocholate. The low pKa of taurine's <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> group ensures this moiety is negatively charged in the pH ranges normally found in the intestinal tract, thus it improves the surfactant properties of the cholic acid conjugate.|$|E
25|$|Under Friedel–Crafts {{reaction}} conditions, arenes {{react with}} sulfonyl halides and <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> anhydrides affording sulfones. Commonly used catalysts include AlCl3, FeCl3, GaCl3, BF3, SbCl5, BiCl3 and Bi(OTf)3, among others. Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization occurs with 2-phenyl-1-ethanesulfonyl chloride, 3-phenyl-1-propanesulfonyl chloride and 4-phenyl-1-butanesulfonyl chloride on heating in nitrobenzene with AlCl3. Sulfenyl and sulfinyl chlorides also undergo Friedel–Crafts–type reactions, affording sulfides and sulfoxides, respectively. Both aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides {{can be prepared}} from arenes through reaction with thionyl chloride {{in the presence of}} catalysts such as BiCl3, Bi(OTf)3, LiClO4 or NaClO4.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E

2500|$|A {{more recent}} water channel model was {{proposed}} based on simulations of small-angle X-ray scattering data and solid state {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} studies.

2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{product is}} an -SO2F-containing thermoplastic that is extruded into films. Hot aqueous NaOH converts these sulfonyl fluoride (-SO2F) groups into sulfonate groups (-SO3−Na+). This form of Nafion, {{referred to as}} the neutral or salt form, is finally converted to the acid form containing the <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (-SO3H) groups. [...] Nafion can be cast into thin films by heating in aqueous alcohol at 250°C in an autoclave. [...] By this process, Nafion can be used to generate composite films, coat electrodes, or repair damaged membranes.|$|E
2500|$|Disulfide {{bonds in}} {{proteins}} are formed by oxidation of the thiol groups of cysteine residues. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds. [...] More aggressive oxidants convert cysteine to the corresponding sulfinic acid and <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Cysteine residues play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins, {{which increases the}} rigidity of proteins and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous). [...] Inside the cell, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues within a polypeptide support the protein's tertiary structure.

2500|$|Taurine (...) , or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that is widely distributed in animal tissues.

Taurine has many fundamental biological roles, such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. Taurine is unusual among biological molecules in being a <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid,</b> while the vast majority of biologically occurring acids contain the more weakly acidic carboxyl group.

2500|$|The {{molecular}} weight of Nafion is uncertain due {{to differences in}} processing and solution morphology. [...] The structure of a Nafion unit, shown {{at the top of the}} page, illustrates the variability of the material; for example, the most basic monomer contains chain variation between the ether groups (the z subscript). [...] Conventional methods of determining {{molecular weight}} such as light scattering and gel permeation chromatography are not applicable because Nafion is insoluble, although the molecular weight has been estimated at 105–106 Da. [...] Instead, the equivalent weight (EW) and material thickness are used to describe most commercially available membranes. The EW is defined as the weight of Nafion (in terms of molecular mass) per <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> group. [...] For example, Nafion 117 indicates a material with 1100 g EW and 0.007inches in thickness. [...] In contrast to equivalent weight, conventional ion-exchange resins are usually described in terms of their ion exchange capacity (IEC), which is the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of the equivalent weight, i.e., IEC = 1/EW.|$|E
