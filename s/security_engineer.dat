A [...] "Binh Tram" [...] was the {{equivalent}} of a regimental logistical headquarters and was responsible for securing a particular section of the network. While separate units were tasked with <b>security,</b> <b>engineer,</b> and signal functions, a [...] "Binh Tram" [...] provided the logistical necessities. Usually located one days march from one another, commo-liaison units were responsible for providing food, housing, medical care, and guides to the next way-station. By April 1965, command of the 559th Group devolved upon General Phan Trọng Tuệ, who assumed command of 24,000 men in six truck transportation battalions, two bicycle transportation battalions, a boat transportation battalion, eight engineer battalions, and 45 commo-liaison stations.
