40|$|Neuroticism {{and genetic}} {{variation}} in the serotonin-transporter (SLC 6 A 4) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene are risk factors for psychopathology. Alterations in the functional integration and segregation of neural circuits have recently been found in individuals scoring higher on neuroticism. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate how genetic risk factors impact functional network organization and whether genetic risk factors moderate the association between neuroticism and functional network organization. We applied graph theory analysis on resting-state fMRI data in a sample of 120 women selected based on their neuroticism score, and genotyped two polymorphisms: 5 -HTTLPR (S-carriers and L-homozygotes) and COMT (rs 4680 -rs 165599; COMT risk group and COMT non-risk group). For the 5 -HTTLPR polymorphism, we found that subnetworks related to cognitive control show less connections with other subnetworks in S-carriers compared to L-homozygotes. The COMT polymorphism moderated the association between neuroticism and functional network organization. We found that neuroticism was associated with lower efficiency coefficients in visual and somatosensory-motor subnetworks in the COMT risk group compared to the COMT non-risk group. The findings of altered topology of specific <b>subnetworks</b> <b>point</b> to different cognitive-emotional processes that may be affected in relation to the genetic risk factors, concerning emotion regulation in S-carriers (5 -HTTLPR) and emotional salience processing in COMT risk carriers...|$|R
40|$|To address {{computational}} “scale-up” {{issues in}} modeling large {{regions of the}} cortex, many coarse-graining procedures have been invoked to obtain effective descriptions of neuronal network dynamics. However, because of local averaging in space and time, these methods do not contain detailed spike information and, thus, cannot be used to investigate, e. g., cortical mechanisms that are encoded through detailed spike-timing statistics. To retain high-order statistical information of spikes, we develop a hybrid theoretical framework that embeds a <b>subnetwork</b> of <b>point</b> neurons within, and fully interacting with, a coarse-grained network of dynamical background. We use a newly developed kinetic theory for {{the description of the}} coarse-grained background, in combination with a Poisson spike reconstruction procedure to ensure that our method applies to the fluctuation-driven regime {{as well as to the}} mean-driven regime. This embedded-network approach is verified to be dynamically accurate and numerically efficient. As an example, we use this embedded representation to construct “reverse-time correlations” as spiked-triggered averages in a ring model of orientation-tuning dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{stabilization}} properties of networks that {{are composed of}} “displacement elements”. Each displacement element is defined by an integer K, called the displacement of the element, an input variable x, and an output variable y, where the values of x and y are non-negative integers. An execution step of this element assigns to y the maximum of 0 and K + x. The objective of our discussion is to demonstrate that two principles {{play an important role}} in ensuring that anetworkN is stabilizing, i. e. starting from any global state, network N is guaranteed to reach a global fixed point. The first principle, named consistent fixed points, states that if a variable is written by two subnetworks of N, then the values of this variable, when these two <b>subnetworks</b> reach fixed <b>points,</b> are equal. The second principle, named negative gain, states that the sum of displacements along every directed loop in network N is negative. ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the result}} of three years of work and {{research}} around GNSS permanent stations and Networks, GNSS data processing and GNSS surveys technics and methodologies for several applications. It is possible to associate the main field of the research to the two main goals of GNSS Networks: Realize a Reference system and distribute it to the users community. Earth surface is continuously changing due to several phenomena, which may be distinguished in periodic and irreversible phenomena. With respect to periodic phenomena a mean position of a point on Earth surface can be defined. With respect to irreversible phenomena each point occupies a specific position just for an infinitesimal instant: estimated coordinates of a point (spatial referencing) must be also time referenced. A Reference System (RS) is, at first, defined by mathematical/physical laws rules. Then, a realization (Reference Frame, RF) follows, by physical and geometrical measurements. Terrestrial reference systems are needed to georeference the positions of points located on the Earth. They can be distinguished in: · Global Reference Systems They are defined on the whole planet and realized by global networks of fundamental points. Fundamental points coordinates are estimated by spatial geodesy techniques. · Local Reference Systems They are defined at the local scale (continental or regional) and realized by <b>subnetworks</b> of fundamental <b>points.</b> Fundamental points coordinates are estimated by terrestrial geodesy techniques. In this category is possible to mention the ED 1950 (for Europe) and ROMA 1940 (for Italy). Local reference systems, since they born before spatial geodesy, are nowadays decreasing of importance in terms of points georeferencing, but they still have historical significance and are used in cartographic applications. After the birth of spacial geodesy, like GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), it was possible to define and realize global reference systems. The nodal point of this innovation is the realization of the global reference system by GNSS permanent stations networks. During the Ph. D. activities a deep analysis of global reference systems research was carried out. In particular, GNSS data processing techniques and skills were acquired. This aspect of the research achieved the goal with the author involvement, as Geodesy and Geomatics Group member, into the realization by the Italian Military Geographic Institute (IGM) of the European Reference System in Italy. The switch form the old static realization (IGM 95) to a GNSS permanent station based realization was made official and published by IGM in February 2009 with the National Dynamic Network (RDN) presentation: 100 GNSS permanent stations homogenously distributed in the Italian Country. Also the official permanent station of the La Sapienza Rome University, M 0 SE, of which maintenance and inclusion in the European Permanent networ...|$|R
