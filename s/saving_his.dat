6000|$|When he saith {{he is able}} to save, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession, he addeth {{saving to}} saving; <b>saving</b> by <b>his</b> life to <b>saving</b> by <b>his</b> death; <b>saving</b> by <b>his</b> {{improving}} of <b>his</b> blood to <b>saving</b> by <b>his</b> spilling of his blood. He gave himself a ransom for us, and now improves that gift in the presence of God by way of intercession. For, as I have hinted already, the high priests under the law took the blood of the sacrifices that were offered for sin, and brought it within the veil, and there sprinkled it before and upon the mercy-seat, and by it made intercession for the people to an additional way of saving them; the sum of which Paul thus applies to Christ when he saith, 'He can save, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession.' ...|$|R
