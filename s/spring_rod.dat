40|$|Improved energy-absorbing {{wheels are}} under {{development}} {{for use on}} special-purpose vehicles that must traverse rough terrain under conditions (e. g., extreme cold) in which rubber pneumatic tires would fail. The designs of these wheels {{differ from those of}} prior non-pneumatic energy-absorbing wheels in ways that result in lighter weights and more effective reduction of stresses generated by ground/wheel contact forces. These wheels could be made of metals and/or composite materials to withstand the expected extreme operating conditions. As shown in the figure, a wheel according to this concept would include an isogrid tire connected to a hub via <b>spring</b> <b>rods.</b> The isogrid tire would be a stiff, lightweight structure typically made of aluminum. The isogrid aspect of the structure would both impart stiffness and act as a traction surface. The hub would be a thin-walled body of revolution having a simple or compound conical or other shape chosen for structural efficiency. The <b>spring</b> <b>rods</b> would absorb energy and partially isolate the hub and the supported vehicle from impact loads. The general spring-rod configuration shown in the figure was chosen because it would distribute contact and impact loads nearly evenly around the periphery of the hub, thereby helping to protect the hub against damage that would otherwise be caused by large loads concentrated onto small portions of the hub...|$|R

50|$|The basic Chamberlin has a piano-style keyboard. Underneath each key is an {{individual}} tape-playing mechanism. Each tape is prerecorded with various musical instruments or special effects. When the player presses down a key, a pressure pad pushes the tape on to a tape head and a pinch roller beneath the key catches the tape and pulls it forward into storage box (or on to a roller mechanism). As this occurs {{the sound of the}} tape is heard through an amplified speaker. When the player releases the key, the sound stops, and the tape rewinds by either metal <b>spring</b> <b>rods</b> (as on the early Chamberlins) or by a return-roller mechanism (as on the later M1 models). Each tape is only a few seconds long (8 seconds on many units).|$|R
