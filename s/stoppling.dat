60|$|He {{took the}} silver <b>stopple</b> from the bottle, {{and with a}} practised hand, tremulous as it was with age, so that {{one would have thought}} it must have shaken the liquor into a perfect shower of misapplied drops, he dropped--I have heard it said--only one single drop into the goblet of water. It fell into it with a {{dazzling}} brightness, like a spark of ruby flame, and subtly diffusing itself through the whole body of water, turned it to a rosy hue of great brilliancy. He held it up between his eyes and the light, and seemed to admire and wonder at it.|$|R
60|$|He {{clutched}} the bottle meanwhile voraciously, miserly, eagerly, furiously, {{as if it}} were his life that he held in his grasp; angry, impatient, as if something long sought were within his reach, and not yet secure,--with longing thirst and desire; suspicious of the world and of fate; feeling as if an iron hand were over him, and a crowd of violent robbers round about him, struggling for it. At last, unable to wait longer, just as the apothecary was tottering away in quest of a drinking-glass, the Colonel took out the <b>stopple,</b> and lifted the flask itself to his lips.|$|R
60|$|From {{time to time}} {{we saved}} a wreck ourselves, a box or barrel, {{and set it on}} its end, and {{appropriated}} it with crossed sticks; and it will lie there perhaps, respected by brother wreckers, until some more violent storm shall take it, really lost to man until wrecked again. We also saved, at the cost of wet feet only, a valuable cord and buoy, part of a seine, with which the sea was playing, for it seemed ungracious to refuse the least gift which so great a personage offered you. We brought this home and still use it for a garden line. I picked up a bottle half buried in the wet sand, covered with barnacles, but <b>stoppled</b> tight, and half full of red ale, which still smacked of juniper,--all that remained I fancied from the wreck of a rowdy world,--that great salt sea on the one hand, and this little sea of ale on the other, preserving their separate characters. What if it could tell us its adventures over countless ocean waves! Man would not be man through such ordeals as it had passed. But as I poured it slowly out on to the sand, {{it seemed to me that}} man himself was like a half-emptied bottle of pale ale, which Time had drunk so far, yet <b>stoppled</b> tight for a while, and drifting about in the ocean of circumstances; but destined erelong to mingle with the surrounding waves, or be spilled amid the sands of a distant shore.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Well, then, that's {{half the}} battle, and {{you ought to}} be into your dress-suit in five minutes; but you're an {{intellectual}} man, and your fingers are all thumbs, and so I'll give you ten minutes. Hello! What's this?" [...] In speaking of shaving, Campbell has mechanically cast his eye towards the bureau, and has gradually become aware of the half-tumbler of water and the decanter of whiskey which Roberts has left standing there. He pounces upon the decanter, pulls out the <b>stopple,</b> and applies his nose to the mouth. [...] "Ah, ha! This is the milk in the cocoanut, is it? No wonder you slept soundly, and had sweet dreams? Well, Roberts!" ...|$|R
6000|$|However, I {{must not}} be frittering away the reader's time with these details. I {{did not intend to}} go into any detail at all, at first, but it is the failing of the true ceramiker, or the true devotee in any {{department}} of brick-a-brackery, that once he gets his tongue or his pen started on his darling theme, he cannot well stop until he drops from exhaustion. He has no more sense of the flight of time than has any other lover when talking of his sweetheart. The very [...] "marks" [...] on the bottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a gibbering ecstasy; and I could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about whether the <b>stopple</b> of a departed Buon Retiro scent-bottle was genuine or spurious.|$|R
30|$|Researchers in {{the past}} (e.g., Cooper and Dewe 2004; Makhbul and Khairuddin 2013) have been debating on the usage of the term “stress”. The earlier social {{psychological}} stressors to be studied and dominated {{the early history of}} work stress are known as role ambiguity and role conflict. They have been viewed as critical elements for two decades and are probably still the most frequently measured causes of work stress (Cooper and Dewe 2004). Sources of job stress comprise the organizational climate caused by the leadership style of supervisors. Some researchers have suggested that the research of work-related stress should comprise variables that show the organizational norms and expectations operating within the workforce, like leadership style and the lacking of ability of employees to apprehend the demands of his or her job (e.g. Ryska 2002; <b>Stoppler</b> 2011).|$|R

The work was commissioned 2008 by the Ruhr.2010 (European Culture Capital 2010) and the Semperoper, Dresden, where it was performed on 20 November 2010. A performance lasts for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. The conductor Steven Sloane (who was also the music director of the Ruhr.2010 festival) first performed the work. Pierre Audi directed, the cast included Hanna Herfurtner as Gisela, Fausto Reinhardt as Gennaro and Michael Dahmen as Hanspeter. The Semperoper team included the conductor Erik Nielsen and the director Elisabeth <b>Stöppler,</b> with Nadja Mchantaf as Gisela, Giorgio Berrugi as Gennaro and Markus Butter as Hanspeter.|$|R
40|$|Mattfeld {{performs}} a search space {{analysis for the}} Job Shop Problem before he develops a Genetic Algorithm. Finally he refines this algorithm resulting in a parallel genetic search approach. The benefit of this book is twofold. It gives a comprehensive survey of recent advances for both, production scheduling and Evolutionary Algorithms in the didactic way of a textbook. Moreover, it presents an efficient and robust optimization strategy which can cope with varying constraints and objectives of real world scheduling problems.

2500|$|The soda-acid {{extinguisher}} {{was first}} patented in 1866 by Francois Carlier of France, which mixed {{a solution of}} water and sodium bicarbonate with tartaric acid, producing the propellant CO2 gas. A soda-acid extinguisher was patented in the U.S. in 1881 by Almon M. Granger. His extinguisher used the reaction between sodium bicarbonate solution and sulfuric acid to expel pressurized water onto a fire. A vial of concentrated sulfuric acid was suspended in the cylinder. Depending {{on the type of}} extinguisher, the vial of acid could be broken in one of two ways. One used a plunger to break the acid vial, while the second released a lead <b>stopple</b> that held the vial closed. Once the acid was mixed with the bicarbonate solution, carbon dioxide gas was expelled and thereby pressurized the water. [...] The pressurized water was forced from the canister through a nozzle or short length of hose.|$|R

60|$|Next, it seem'd {{nothing more}} {{difficult}} to give an intelligible reason, why Cork is a body so very unapt to suck and drink in Water, and consequently preserves it self, floating {{on the top of}} Water, though left on it never so long: and why it is able to stop and hold air in a Bottle, though it be there very much condens'd and consequently presses very strongly to get a passage out, without suffering the least bubble to pass through its substance. For, as to the first, since our Microscope informs us that the substance of Cork is altogether fill'd with Air, and that that Air is perfectly enclosed in little Boxes or Cells distinct from one another. It seems very plain, why neither the Water, nor any other Air can easily insinuate it self into them, since there is already within them an intus existens, and consequently, why the pieces of Cork become so good floats for Nets, and <b>stopples</b> for Viols, or other close Vessels.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] Pinney exulted. [...] "They're first-rate. You needn't {{be afraid}} to read the letter!" [...] Pinney's exultation came partly from his {{certainty}} {{that it was really}} Northwick, and partly from the pleasure he felt in reassuring him; he sympathized with him as a father. His pleasure was not marred {{by the fact that he}} knew nothing of the state of Northwick's family, and built his assertion upon the probability that the letter would contain nothing to alarm or afflict him, [...] "Like a glass of water?" [...] he suggested, seeing Northwick sit inert and helpless on the steps of the inn-porch, apparently without the force to break the seal of the letter. [...] "Or a little brandy?" [...] Pinney handed him the neat leather-covered flask his wife had reproached him for buying when they came away from home; she said he could not afford it; but he was glad he had got it, now, and he unscrewed the <b>stopple</b> with pride in handing it to Northwick. [...] "You look sick." ...|$|R
50|$|Puberty usually occurs {{from the}} ages of 10 to 16 {{years of age and}} varies between boys and girls with girls {{normally}} starting earlier than boys (Shiel, <b>Stoppler</b> 2012). During the time of puberty is when sexual maturation starts to occur. Numerous physical changes happen during the period of puberty. Girls start to develop breasts, have growth of pubic hair and eventually begin having menstrual cycles. Boys have an enlargement of testicles and penis, growth of pubic hair, deepened voices and muscular development. Along with physical changes during puberty there are many mental changes happening. During the adolescence stage of life, boys and girls start developing thoughts related to sexual identity and start to explore and experiment with sexual behaviors. This stage of life is when sexual maturation starts to develop and one’s gender identity and sexual orientation is being developed. This is a timeframe that can possibly become confusing for the youth going through this stage of adolescence. Feelings of frustration, anxiety or depression may occur. This could be the first signs of disorder during sexual maturation.Sexual maturity is a natural progression during the pubertal stages of adolescence. It is the timeframe where youth explore and experience sexual thoughts, situations and behaviors which ultimately lead to the identification of their gender and sexual orientation. During this timeframe abnormal feelings and thoughts can affect the progression of maturity. These abnormal occurrences would be identified as sexual maturation disorder.|$|R
60|$|What is {{the pill}} which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or thy great-grandfather's, but our {{great-grandmother}} Nature's universal, vegetable, botanic medicines, by {{which she has}} kept herself young always, outlived so many old Parrs in her day, and fed her health with their decaying fatness. For my panacea, instead {{of one of those}} quack vials of a mixture dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out of those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to carry bottles, let me have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will not drink of this at the fountainhead of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some and sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket to morning time in this world. But remember, it will not keep quite till noonday even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the <b>stopples</b> long ere that and follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no worshipper of Hygeia, who was the daughter of that old herb-doctor Æsculapius, and who is represented on monuments holding a serpent in one hand, and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimes drinks; but rather of Hebe, cup-bearer to Jupiter, who was the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce, and who had the power of restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth. She was probably the only thoroughly sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that ever walked the globe, and wherever she came it was spring.|$|R
40|$| MK:Smart citizen {{engagement}} workshops, are: •	MotionMap {{must have}} a measurable {{positive impact on the}} sustainable economic development of the city, partly by reducing time and productivity lost in traffic but mainly by creating new business opportunities in smart transport. •	Through the provision of user information, MotionMap should encourage positive changes in transport-related behaviour that increase the sustainability of the transport system while improving {{the quality of life of}} the users. •	Secure a sound revenue stream, so that services can remain available after 2016. The new sources of revenue can be public or private, but there must be a sound economic case for continued funding of MotionMap. •	While participation of government, academia and industry is central to the success of MotionMap, we must go beyond the triple helix in order to avoid “Big Brother” and “Little Brother” scenarios. We will pursue the “Wikipedia model”, meaning that we will not provide a centrally-planed service. Instead, we intend to link our urban sensing system to an open data hub. •	Active contribution of data by citizens will be sought. so we must identify models for the creation, capture and fair distribution of value which are compelling and inclusive. In all smart city urban sensing systems there is a real danger of technical solutions migrating towards Big Brother centralization. It is possible to have Big Data without Big Brother, but a wiki approach is not one existing players find easy. 1. 	REFERENCES [1]	Allwinkle, S. and Cruickshank, P.
