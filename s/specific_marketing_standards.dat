40|$|The article {{considers}} the <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> for enterprises and higher educational {{institutions in the}} EU and Ukraine. The basic components {{of the formation of}} the <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> in our country and the European Union member countries are identified, some legislative restrictions on advertising in certain EU countries are systematized. The features of the EU standards are determined. The main idea of the article is to examine the European <b>marketing</b> <b>standards,</b> determine the level of their adaptation to the national ones, as well as collect data on the effectiveness of the application of <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> to higher educational institutions, provide quality education and establish collaboration with the European partner universities. The general understanding of the quality of education, use of harmonized approaches and evaluation criteria is important for the European integration. The majority of national organizations have a number of difficulties associated with the undeveloped system of indicators oriented towards the client and other interested parties. The application of the EU <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> sets an appropriate vector of development for the domestic economy and opens up new competitive opportunitie...|$|R

Allowing for a non-linear relationship between different indicators of labor market flexibility and FDI inflows revealed that {{some degree of}} labor <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> and regulations may be attractive for foreign investors. Results strongly suggest that foreign investments to and from different countries and in different sectors are affected differently by different aspects of labor <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> and regulations. foreign direct investment, labor market flexibility...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} existing work {{on building}} design through {{a focus on}} one important yet understudied form of regulation: <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>standards</b> are agreed upon definitions of ‘necessary’ provision in buildings and are fundamental in ‘formatting’ markets and determining {{the value of a}} building in the market. The paper presents a case study of the design of ten commercial offices in London, UK, the effects of <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> on the designs and on the potential for the development of lower energy buildings. Theoretically, the paper integrates literatures on <b>standards,</b> institutions and <b>markets</b> to argue that <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> do important ‘work’ in design processes that requires closer scrutiny. In particular, we show that market standards: are an important form of normative and cultural regulation in the field of commercial office design; format and act as calculative devices in property markets; and result in forms of knowledge diminution that break the relationship between building design and occupiers’ practices. Together, these effects result in particular designs being legitimised and valued, and lower energy designs being delegitimised, devalued and pushed to the periphery of the attention of commercial office designers...|$|R

40|$|What {{explains}} {{the creation and}} strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> through the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) ? This thesis addresses this question by analyzing the creation and strengthening of four of IOSCO’s international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> between 1991 and 2010 relating to the following issues: the governance of cross-border financial crime, the objectives and principles of domestic securities market regulation, the regulation of credit rating agencies, and the regulation of hedge funds. This thesis argues that the creation and strengthening of these standards {{is derived from the}} role and influence of three different political actors: the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states. The role and influence of these different political actors differs across issue areas and across time. To account for the differentiated sources of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards,</b> this thesis proposes a Principal-Agent (PA) analytical framework. Domestic legislatures (the principal) delegate to securities regulators (the agent) the authority to oversee and regulate domestic securities markets by granting regulators specific forms of statutory authority. Exercising discretion within this act of delegation, domestic securities regulators act together in a transgovernmental network to create and strengthen international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> They are prompted to act by threats to the integrity and stability of developed financial centers from under-regulated or ineffectively regulated foreign financial centers, as well as by new policy preferences of domestic legislatures seeking to regulate previously unregulated financial market actors. Domestic legislatures also use multiple agents to ensure that agents act consistent with their policy preferences: their concerns about the costs of under-regulated foreign jurisdictions can generate direct pressure from states on international financial regulatory institutions to strengthen the implementation of international financial standards. This thesis makes an empirical contribution to existing literature by analyzing previously understudied international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> This thesis also makes a theoretical contribution to both IPE literature and PA theory within International Organization (IO) literature. For IPE literature, this thesis establishes a theoretical framework that accounts for the differentiated role and influence of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states in the creation and strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> For PA theory within IO literature, this thesis highlights the role of the principled professional interests of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators in creating and strengthening international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
