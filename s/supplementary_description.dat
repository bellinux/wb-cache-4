40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to remove}} a kind of ambiguity in a text understanding system based on simulation. The system simulates some events mentioned in text on a world model and observes {{the behavior of the}} model during the simulation. Through these processes, it can recognize the other events mentioned implicitly. However, in case the system infers plural number of possible world, it can't decide which one is consistent with the context. We deal with such ambiguities. The ambiguities, in some cases, can be removed by considering contextual information. To remove the ambiguities in the simulation, we define three heuristics based on the characters of the explanatory descriptions and propose an algorithm of &quot;looking ahead&quot;. We implement,ani experimental system. Accqrding to the,algorithm, the system finds out the <b>supplementary</b> <b>descriptions</b> in the following sentences and removes the ambiguities by using the contents of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>descriptions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ostracod}} family Cylindroleberididae {{is based}} on the genus Cylindroleberis Brady, 1868, and has a complicated nomenclatural history. The type species of Cylindroleberis is Cypridina mariae Baird, 1850. Baird described only the carapace, which had been considered lost. Thus, there was no reference point for the concept C. mariae or the genus Cylindroleberis. Baird’s material has now been found in the Natural History Museum, London, U. K., and is illustrated here. To clarify the taxonomic status of C. mariae and Cylindroleberis, specimens were obtained from near the type locality, and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>description</b> is presented. This includes description of appendages, particularly the first antenna and mandible, which contain important diagnostic characters.

40|$|During the Late Miocene (Tortonian or Pannonian {{regional}} stage), {{at around}} 11. 6 Ma, a glacioeustatically-driven sea-level fall caused the final {{closure of the}} Paratethys Ocean and Lake Pannon was formed in central Europe. The lake was initially brackish, but slowly freshened and became slightly alkaline. These unusual changes in water chemistry produced the radiation of a characteristic assemblage of gonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts.

From this material, Achomosphaera brevis sp. nov., Seriliodinium? imperfecta sp. nov. and Spiniferites hennersdorfensis sp. nov. were apparently endemic to the Central Paratethys during the Late Miocene.
