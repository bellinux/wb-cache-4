Just measuring Iluvatar required five climbers for over 20 days. Iluvatar has 134 reiterated trunks, more than any except the Redwood Creek Giant.

50|$|In {{undisturbed}} forest, decayed windfallen <b>stemwood</b> {{provides the}} most favourable seedbed for germination and survival, moisture supply being dependable, and the elevation of seedlings somewhat above the general level of the forest floor reduces the danger of smothering by leaves and snow-pressed minor vegetation; nor is such a microsite likely {{to be subject to}} flooding. Advantages conferred by those microsites include: more light, higher temperatures in the rooting zone, and better mycorrhizal development. In a survey in the Porcupine Hills, Manitoba, 90% of all spruce seedlings were rooted in rotten wood.|$|E
50|$|The seeds remain viable {{for less}} than one year, and are {{dispersed}} in two ways. One is by water; the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife; squirrels eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20-75 cm (up to 100 cm in fertilized nursery conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, Bald-cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased {{by the time the}} trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false rings of <b>stemwood</b> caused by variable and stressful growing environments.|$|E

40|$|Several {{important}} {{characteristics such}} as density, acoustic velocity, modulus of elasticity and tracheid dimensions are examined in <b>stemwood,</b> branchwood and rootwood in young (age 3 and 7) Pinus radiata. <b>Stemwood</b> air-dry density decreases little from ground level {{to the top of}} the tree falling gradually from 415 kg/m³ to 405 kg/m³. Branchwood air-dry density is higher than <b>stemwood</b> density. The branchwood density is approximately 480 kg/m³ close to the stem and then decreases sharply to ca. 410 kg/m³ near the branch tips. Rootwood density at 12 % moisture content is similar to <b>stemwood</b> density ranging between 420 and 405 kg/m³. Density varies from stemroot junction to root tip in lateral roots (420 to 405 kg/m³) but changes little along tap roots (405 kg/m³) In <b>stemwood,</b> the air-dry modulus of elasticity increases from ground level (ca. 2. 5 - 3. 5 GPa) to approximately 4 metres (ca. 5. 5 - 6. 5 GPa) and then decreases thereafter to 7 metres (ca. 2. 5 - 3. 5 GPa). The air-dry MOE of branchwood decreases linearly with tree height up the stem from approximately 4. 5 GPa at 1 metre to 3 GPa at 6 metres. Roots are the least stiff part of the tree. The air-dry MOE value decreases along roots from the stem-root junction (ca. 1. 9 GPa) to the root tip area (0. 5 GPa) in lateral roots, and from 1. 4 GPa to 0. 4 GPa in tap roots. In <b>stemwood</b> and rootwood the tracheid dimensions change with distance from ground level in both directions with significant different patterns. For <b>stemwood,</b> the tracheid length decreases with height up the stem. The mean tracheid length is approximately 1. 70 mm at breast height whereas it is 1. 55 mm and 1. 40 mm at 2. 4 metres and 4. 6 metres respectively. Rootwood tracheids are much longer (nearly double) than <b>stemwood</b> tracheids. The tracheid length increases with increasing distances from the stem-root junction. The mean tracheid length adjacent to the stemroot junction area is approximately 2. 2 mm whereas for the middle and root tip areas it is 2. 6 mm and 3. 3 mm respectively. Compression wood is a common feature of stem and branchwood. However, this atypical tissue is absent in roots except in some restricted instances where compression wood extends a short distance from the stem down into the root. Branchwood in green condition can be used to predict volume-weighted <b>stemwood</b> qualities at 12 % moisture content when specific conditions are applied (select a straight portion of first branch segment from the largest diameter branch at breast height, R 2 = 0. 64). However, this approach has little practical appeal as equally good or better correlations can be obtained using Fakopp on standing trees (R 2 = 0. 75). Therefore future work should focus solely on the use of time of flight instruments such as Fakopp on <b>stemwood...</b>|$|E
40|$|We know {{surprisingly}} little about whole-tree nonstructural carbon (NSC; primarily sugars and starch) budgets. Even less well understood is the mixing between recent photosynthetic assimilates (new NSC) and previously stored reserves. And, NSC turnover times are poorly constrained. We characterized {{the distribution of}} NSC in the <b>stemwood,</b> branches, and roots of two temperate trees, and we used the continuous label offered by the radiocarbon (carbon- 14, 14 C) bomb spike to estimate {{the mean age of}} NSC in different tissues. NSC in branches and the outermost <b>stemwood</b> growth rings had the 14 C signature of the current growing season. However, NSC in older aboveground and belowground tissues was enriched in 14 C, indicating that it was produced from older assimilates. Radial patterns of 14 C in <b>stemwood</b> NSC showed strong mixing of NSC across the youngest growth rings, with limited 'mixing in' of younger NSC to older rings. Sugars in the outermost five growth rings, accounting for two-thirds of the <b>stemwood</b> pool, had a mean age 5 yr.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of nonstructural carbon (NSC) to growth, metabolism and storage remains poorly understood, but {{is critical for}} the prediction of stress tolerance and mortality. We used the radiocarbon (14 C) ‘bomb spike’ as a tracer of substrate and age of carbon in <b>stemwood</b> NSC, CO 2 emitted by stems, tree ring cellulose and stump sprouts regenerated following harvesting in mature red maple trees. We addressed the following questions: which factors influence the age of <b>stemwood</b> NSC?; {{to what extent is}} stored vs new NSC used for metabolism and growth?; and, is older, stored NSC available for use? The mean age of extracted <b>stemwood</b> NSC was 10 yr. More vigorous trees had both larger and younger <b>stemwood</b> NSC pools. NSC used to support metabolism (stem CO 2) was 1 – 2 yr old in spring before leaves emerged, but reflected current-year photosynthetic products in late summer. The tree ring cellulose 14 C age was 0. 9 yr older than direct ring counts. Stump sprouts were formed from NSC up to 17 yr old. Thus, younger NSC is preferentially used for growth and day-to-day metabolic demands.

40|$|Adaptive {{strategies}} to improve tree water-use efficiency (WUE) {{are required to}} meet the global demand for wood in a future drier climate. A large-scale throughfall exclusion experiment {{was set up in}} Brazil to study the interaction between water status and potassium (K) or sodium (Na) availability on the ecophysiology of Eucalyptus grandis trees. This experiment focused primarily on the changes in aboveground net primary production, stand water use, phloem sap and leaf δ 13 C, net CO 2 assimilation and stomatal conductance. The correlations between these response variables were determined to gain insight into the factors controlling water-use efficiency in tropical eucalypt plantations. The intrinsic WUE in individual leaves (the ratio of net CO 2 assimilation to stomatal conductance) was estimated at a very short time scale from the leaf gas exchange. Sap flow measurements were carried out to assess the WUE for <b>stemwood</b> production (the ratio of wood biomass increment to stand water use). Averaged over the two water supply regimes, the <b>stemwood</b> biomass 3 years after planting was 173 % higher in trees fertilized with K and 79 % higher in trees fertilized with Na than in trees with no K and Na addition. Excluding 37 % of the throughfall reduced <b>stemwood</b> production only for trees fertilized with K. Total canopy transpiration between 1 and 3 years after planting increased from about 750 to 1300 mm y− 1 in response to K fertilization with a low influence of the water supply regime. K fertilization increased WUE for <b>stemwood</b> production by approx. 60 % with or without throughfall exclusion. There was a strong positive correlation between phloem sap δ 13 C and short-term leaf-level intrinsic WUE. Whatever the water and nutrient supply regime, the gas exchange WUE estimates were not correlated with WUE for <b>stemwood</b> production. Phloem sap δ 13 C and leaf δ 13 C were therefore not valuable proxies of WUE for <b>stemwood</b> production. The allocation pattern in response to nutrient and water supply appeared to be a major driver of WUE for <b>stemwood</b> production. In areas with very deep tropical soils and annual rainfall < 1500 mm, our results suggest that breeding programs selecting the eucalypt clones with the highest growth rates tend to select the genotypes with the highest water-use efficiency for wood production.

40|$|Methods of {{estimating}} <b>stemwood</b> volume from ICESat / GLAS lidar waveforms are explored for a mixed temperate forest, the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, UK. Previous {{methods have}} used maximum canopy height estimations incorporating a {{digital terrain model}} (DTM) and requiring calibration using a sample of within-footprint tree heights. This study focuses on deriving methods which do not require such supplementary data. Maximum canopy height is estimated as the distance between Signal Begin and the ground peak within the waveform. The ground peak is determined using the centroid of either Gaussian Peak 1 or 2, identified by whichever has the greatest amplitude. This canopy height estimation was used to isolate {{the region of the}} waveform returned from the vegetation, from which heights of cumulative energy percentiles were calculated. For the tallest species within footprints, <b>stemwood</b> volume estimates for conifers produced R 2 of 0. 59, RMSE 98. 3 m 3 /ha and for broadleaf species, R 2 of 0. 75, RMSE 59. 1 m 3 /ha were found. <b>Stemwood</b> volume estimates taking account of the mixed species composition within stands were also calculated.

Various protease treatments followed by hot-water extraction were found to be suitable in lowering the N-content of hemp <b>stemwood</b> by up to 70 %.

40|$|South Africa {{lags behind}} {{the rest of}} the world with regard to the {{availability}} of allometric biomass information. There is a complete lack of site specific allometric data for Pinus radiata in the southern Cape region, impeding investment in the renewable energy sector. This shortcoming was addressed by developing up-scalable, single tree biomass models. These models quantify the aboveground biomass of rotation age P. radiata grown in the southern Cape across a range of site conditions. The models use diameter at breast height (DBH) to predict the aboveground component biomass. A nutrient loss risk potential was assigned to each biomass component. Nineteen trees were destructively harvested using a full fresh weight sampling approach. Basic density was determined using a water displacement method, while Newton’s volume equation was used for <b>stemwood</b> volume determination. Log linear models were simultaneously regressed through seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) using the “Systemfit” R statistical package to force component additivity. A categorical variable was applied to the models, grouping the data into two Site Index (SI) based categories, namely “Low” SI and “Medium to High” SI, to account for inter-site variability. The corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) and coefficient of determination (R 2) was used to determine the goodness of fit of the models. The McElroy R 2 for the SUR system was 0. 95. Biomass models were developed that are able to predict various tree component masses at high levels of certainty within site and stand attribute ranges similar to this study. The importance of accurate, site specific wood basic density was demonstrated by its substantial weighting on stem and hence total biomass. Results showed that the <b>stemwood</b> mean basic density range was between 503 kg m- 3 and 517 kg m- 3 for the “Low” SI sites and 458 kg m- 3 for the “Medium to High” SI sites.

30|$|We {{used this}} {{information}} to initialise the European Forest Information SCENario model (EFISCEN; version 4.1) (Sallnäs 1990; Verkerk et al. 2016). EFISCEN is a large-scale forest resource model that projects forest resource development at regional to national level {{and can be used}} to estimate the theoretical potential of forest biomass supply, based on the age-structure, growing stock and increment of the resource and controlled by management actions. A basic management regime defines the period during which thinning can take place and a minimum age for final felling. These regimes can be regarded as constraints on the total harvest level and they were defined based on forest management regimes according to handbooks and national experts (Nabuurs et al. 2007; UNECE-FAO 2011). For countries where inventory data referred to the state of the forests before 2010 (see Dees et al., 2017 a), we ran EFISCEN until 2010 using historical roundwood production (FAOSTAT 2015) to which we added 12 % bark (UNECE-FAO 2010). To estimate the theoretical forest biomass potential, the EFISCEN model was subsequently used to iteratively assess the theoretical felling potential of <b>stemwood</b> for 2020 (see Verkerk et al. 2011 for details). To correct for harvesting losses, we used data on fellings and removals (UNECE-FAO 2000) to calculate the fraction of harvest losses for coniferous and broadleaved species separately and used {{this information to}} estimate the amount of <b>stemwood</b> that could be removed as logs during thinnings and final fellings.

40|$|A non-foliated area (or ‘bare inner core’) {{develops}} {{in the interior}} of tree crowns as the size of the crown increases during stand development. We examined the relationship between mean bare core volume and both stand density and mean crown volume, and its association with the production of <b>stemwood</b> volume for two conifer species, Pinus contorta var. latifolia and Abies lasiocarpa. Mean bare core volume decreased with absolute stand density and increased with mean crown volume for both species. As crown size increased, so did the proportion of total crown volume occupied by the bare core. Small bare core volumes were associated with small, efficient crowns, and large bare core volumes were associated with large, less efficient crowns. Mean bare core volume was negatively related to the mean ratio of crown surface area to volume but was not correlated with an index of crown slenderness, two characteristics which are assumed to be important in the development of crop tree ideotypes. The small mean bare core volume and associated increased efficiency of <b>stemwood</b> production at high stand densities increased per hectare productivity for both species, thereby indicating how differing density management regimes influence stand production...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in a 25 year old Scots pine spacing trial, {{established}} with grafted clones at four different spacings. The oven-dry weight of the different aboveground parts of the tree (i. e. stem, large and small branches, needles and cones) was assessed separately. With closer spacing, the relative proportion of cones and of large branches per tree decreased, while the dry matter increment allocated to <b>stemwood</b> increased gradually from 11. 7 to 28. 5 percent. Without competition, the dry matter allocated to cones was nearly similar to that of current <b>stemwood</b> increment. On a unit area basis, the dry matter weight allocated to cones did not change sig-nificantly at different density levels and remained between 0. 6 and 1. 0 tonnes per ha. The highest total biomass per unit area was measured at maximum stand density (98. 2 t/ha), where stem number is regulated by natural mortality (self-thinning). A slightly positive effect of competition on height growth was detectable only when the trees were young. The results show the plasticity of Scots pine architecture in relation to spacing in the early phases of stand development...|$|E
40|$|Two {{stands in}} a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) {{plantation}} were established in southeastern Louisiana in 1981 at three initial planting densities (1. 2 x 1. 2 m, 2. 4 m., and 3. 6 x 3. 6 m). Height, height {{to the base of}} the live crown, and DBH measurements taken in consecutive years, coupled with allometric equations, yielded estimates of annual stand level foliage, branchwood, and <b>stemwood</b> biomass increment in each plot. <b>Stemwood,</b> branchwood, first-year foliage, second year foliage, and litter tissues were obtained in each plot and analyzed for nitrogen concentration, and were used to provide estimates of annual foliar nitrogen retranslocation and above-ground nitrogen demands. Also, estimates of relative provide estimates of annual foliar nitrogen retranslocation and above-ground nitrogen demands. Also, estimates of relative fine-root product for two collection periods were obtained in each plot by the coring method. Results indicated that stand density influenced stand-level partitioning to various above-ground component types. As partitioning patterns changed at different levels of stand density, the subsequent demand for nitrogen needed to produce the various components also changed. Changes in above-ground nitrogen demand were subsequently reflected in corresponding changes in fine-root biomass...|$|E

40|$|Forest canopy {{structure}} is {{strongly influenced by}} stand density due to changing competitive interactions among the individual trees and in turn directly influences <b>stemwood</b> volume production. The structure and dynamics of forest canopies, particularly {{in relation to the}} production of <b>stemwood,</b> were examined in unmanaged, even-aged stands of two dissimilar tree species, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. The analysis of structure-production relationships was guided by a conceptual model which generated hypotheses and led to examination of assumptions incorporated in the model. Mean crown dimensions were related to stand density through a negative exponential function for both species, but because of differing shade­tolerances, mean crown size of lodgepole pine was affected more by increasing density than was mean crown size of subalpine fir. More importantly, examination of the model assumptions indicated that adequate characterization of canopy structure should account for the influence of both crown shyness and stand height. Stand density also influenced the amount and distribution of leaf area in these forest stands. The more plastic mean leaf area of lodgepole pine led to a constant leaf area index over a range of density and, thus, was consistent with conventional wisdom which assumes closed canopied forest stands support stable leaf area indices across a wide range of densities. The less plastic mean leaf area of subalpine fir, however, led to positive correlation between leaf area index and density. Changes in mean crown dimensions and mean leaf area influenced the production of <b>stemwood</b> volume such that large mean crown sizes were less efficient than small mean crown sizes. The decrease in efficiency was attributed to accumulation of large branch biomass in large crowns to support foliage far from the stem. Increased support costs were indicated by the increasing proportion of crown volume which was nonfoliated as mean crown size increased. The assumption that accumulated branch biomass was responsible for the observed declines in efficiency for forest trees was reinforced by a comparison of structure-production relationships for lodgepole pine and the annual Helianthus annuus L...|$|E

30|$|Simulation {{results suggest}} climate change {{will lead to}} a modest {{increase}} in long-term <b>stemwood</b> biomass production (6.1 to 12.1 % after 30 to 60  years). The positive impact of climate change was largely attributable to both a lengthening of the growing season and an increase in nutrient-cycling rates. The increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations associated with the different emission scenarios led to an increase in water-use efficiency and a small increase in productivity. While the model predicted an overall increase in dry-season moisture stress, it did not predict increased levels of drought-related mortality.|$|E

40|$|Growth {{characteristics}} of selected Picea rubens Sarg. (red spruce) and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (balsam fir) crop trees were studied in a northern conifer forest {{to determine the}} effects of precommercial thinning (PCT) 25 years after initial treatment. Two measures of growth efficiency (GE, growth per unit of growing space) were examined: <b>stemwood</b> increment (dm 3) per unit of projected leaf area (PLA) (m 2) and <b>stemwood</b> increment (dm 3) per unit of crown projection area (CPA) (m 2). Stem form differences were evaluated by comparing stem taper between species and treatments. Branch diameters were measured between 1. O- 2. 0 meters above breast height (BH, 1. 37 m (4. 5 ft)) for each crop tree, and the number and size of branches and the ratio of knots were determined. Volumes of all crop trees were calculated using Smalian's formula (Avery and Burkhart 1994) applied to different geometric forms of the tree to estimate total cubic foot volume from diameter measurements up the tree bole. The efficacy of Honer's (1967) volume equation for estimating total cubic foot volume from diameter at BH (DBH) and total height (THT) was tested by comparing measured values to the estimated values. Differences in tree stability were determined by comparing height to diameter ratios (IUD) of all the crop trees by species and treatment...|$|E
