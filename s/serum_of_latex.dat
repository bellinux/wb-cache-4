40|$|Objective: To {{synthesize}} silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by green methods using <b>serum</b> <b>latex</b> <b>of</b> Calotropis procera at 80 °C {{and evaluate}} them against bacteria, dermatophytes and phytopathogenic fungi comparing with the activity <b>of</b> untreated <b>latex.</b> Methods: The synthesis of AgNPs {{was performed by}} mixing 3 % latex serum extract with the same volume of silver nitrate (2 mmol/L) solution in round flask and heating in water bath at 80 °C. Characterization of silver particles were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of the green synthesized AgNPs was determined against bacteria, dermatophytes and phytopathogenic fungi and compared to the crude untreated latex by agar-well diffusion methods. Results: Biosynthesis <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> silver nanoparticles was successfully obtained by green method. The formation of AgNPs has been confirmed by UV-vis, TEM microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. TEM analysis showed that synthesized AgNPs are highly stable spherical shaped particles, well dispersed with a diameter ranged from 4 nm up to 25 nm and an average size of 12. 33 nm. AgNPs showed strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia sp.) and antifungal activity against Trichophyton rubrum, Candida albicans and Aspergillus terreus. Conclusions: It can be concluded that <b>serum</b> <b>latex</b> <b>of</b> Calotropis procera was found to display strong potential for the synthesis of AgNPs as antimicrobial agents through rapid reduction of silver ions (Ag+ to Ag 0). The green synthesized AgNPs were found to show higher antimicrobial efficacy than crude latex...|$|R

40|$|Increases in {{vascular}} permeability and angiogenesis {{are crucial}} events to wound repair, tumoral growth and revascularization of tissues submitted to ischemia. An increased vascular permeability allows {{a variety of}} cytokines and growth factors to reach the damaged tissue. Nevertheless, the angiogenesis supply tissues {{with a wide variety}} of nutrients and is also important to metabolites clearance. It has been suggested that the natural latex from Hevea brasiliensis showed wound healing properties and angiogenic activity. Thus, the purpose of this work was to characterize its angiogenic activity and its effects on vascular permeability and wound healing. The <b>serum</b> fraction <b>of</b> the <b>latex</b> was separated from the rubber with reduction of the pH. The activity <b>of</b> the dialyzed <b>serum</b> fraction on the vascular permeability injected in subcutaneous tissue was assayed according Mile`s method. The angiogenic activity was determined using a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay and its effects on the wound-healing process was determined by the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model. The serum fraction showed evident angiogenic effect and it was effective in enhancing vascular permeability. In dermal ulcers, this material significantly accelerated wound healing. Moreover, the serum fraction boiled and treated with proteases lost these activities. These results are in accordance with the enhancement of wound healing observed in clinical trials carried out with a biomembrane prepared with the same natural latex.

The {{water vapor permeability}} <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> films was found to decrease with diethyl phthalate to a minimum value and then to increase with diethyl phthalate at higher concentrations.
