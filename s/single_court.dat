25|$|A {{separate}} Court of Criminal Appeal {{had been}} established in 1908. In 1966 this was merged with its older namesake, establishing the present-day structure of a <b>single</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal with two Divisions (Civil and Criminal).|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Parliament {{passed the}} Federal Court Act which {{abolished}} the Exchequer Court {{and created a}} new court, the Federal Court of Canada. That Court had two divisions: the Federal Court – Trial Division, and the Federal Court – Appeal Division. Although the two divisions had different functions, they were {{all part of a}} <b>single</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
25|$|All courts, except justice courts (town {{and village}} courts), are {{financed by the}} state in a <b>single</b> <b>court</b> budget. During 2009, the {{judiciary}} had approximately 1300 judges, 4.6 million new cases, and a budget in excess of $2.5 billion. Currently it has a $2 billion budget, 3,600 state and locally paid judges and over 15,000 nonjudicial employees in over 300 locations around the state.|$|E

25|$|The {{new legal}} {{structure}} provided a <b>single</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, which heard appeals {{from all the}} various Divisions of the new unified High Court of Justice. It only heard civil cases (opportunities for appealing in criminal cases remained limited until the 20th century). In its early days, the Court of Appeal divided its sittings between Westminster Hall for appeals from the Common Law divisions, and Lincoln's Inn for Chancery, Probate, Divorce and Admiralty appeals, with five Lords Justices. After {{the opening of the}} Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 the Court of Appeal transferred there, where it remains. As well as the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, any previous Lord Chancellors, the Lord Chief Justice, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division and the Master of the Rolls could also hear cases, although in practice only the Master of the Rolls did so.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolonged}} thirteen-year {{political and}} legal battle, Figueroa v. Canada ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected {{in a number of}} members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the Green Party. Never before had a <b>single</b> <b>court</b> challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates’ deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties – regardless of political differences – on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to democratic choice.|$|E
500|$|In some {{specialized}} {{areas of}} the law, cases are assigned to a court of appeals that possesses expertise in that area of the law. For example, Congress created the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as an exclusive federal court of appeals for patent cases. Congress noted that consolidating cases in a <b>single</b> <b>court</b> of appeals would [...] "strengthen the United States patent system {{in such a way}} as to foster technological growth and industrial innovation." [...] Because of its role as a specialist court, circuit splits rarely exist between the Federal Circuit and other circuit courts of appeal. In his opinion in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., Justice David Souter observed that avoiding conflicting rulings among circuit courts in patent law cases benefits the economy by providing legal certainty to businesses.|$|E

500|$|Evans {{and another}} footballer, Clayton McDonald, were tried at the Crown Court at Caernarfon after being indicted {{of the rape}} of a 19-year-old woman, who was deemed too drunk to consent, at a hotel near Rhyl in May 2011. Evans was convicted on 20 April 2012 {{and was sentenced to}} five years' imprisonment. He was {{eligible}} for release after serving half of that sentence. During his incarceration, Evans worked as a painter and decorator in the prison in order to afford a healthy diet. In August 2012, Evans was refused leave to appeal against the conviction by a <b>single</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal of England and Wales judge and the full court upheld the decision in November. [...] Evans continued to maintain his innocence and in November 2013 recruited a new legal team to attempt to clear his name.|$|E

2500|$|Of all her {{influence}} on culture, Eleanor's time in Poitiers between 1168 and 1173 {{was perhaps the}} most critical, yet very little is known about it. Henry II was elsewhere, attending to his own affairs after escorting Eleanor there. Some believe that Eleanor's court in Poitiers was the [...] "Court of Love" [...] where Eleanor and her daughter Marie meshed and encouraged the ideas of troubadours, chivalry, and courtly love into a <b>single</b> <b>court.</b> It may have been largely to teach manners, something the French courts would be known for in later generations. Yet the existence and reasons for this court are debated.|$|E

50|$|South Africa has a <b>single</b> {{national}} <b>court</b> system, and {{the administration}} of justice {{is the responsibility of}} the national government. At present the jurisdictional boundaries of the High Courts do not correspond entirely with the provincial boundaries; the Superior Courts Bill currently before Parliament will rationalise the courts so that there is a <b>single</b> High <b>Court</b> division in each province.|$|R
2500|$|Today {{three states}} still have {{separate}} courts {{for law and}} equity; the most notable is Delaware, whose Court of Chancery is where most cases involving Delaware corporations are decided. However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and New Jersey) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a <b>single</b> <b>court.</b> Besides corporate law, which developed out {{of the law of}} trusts, areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included wills and probate, adoptions and guardianships, and marriage and divorce. Bankruptcy was also historically considered an equitable matter; although bankruptcy in the United States is today a purely federal matter, reserved entirely to the United States Bankruptcy Courts by the enactment of the United States Bankruptcy Code in 1978, bankruptcy courts are still officially considered [...] "courts of equity" [...] and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code.|$|E
2500|$|Charles V, king of Spain, Naples, and Sicily and Holy Roman Emperor, {{handed over}} the kingdom of Spain to his son Philip II and the Empire to his brother Ferdinand I in 1558, ending the {{domination}} of western Europe by a <b>single</b> <b>court,</b> but the Spanish taste for sombre richness of dress would dominate fashion {{for the remainder of}} the century. [...] New alliances and trading patterns arose as the divide between Catholic and Protestant countries became more pronounced. The severe, rigid fashions of the Spanish court were dominant everywhere except France and Italy. Black garments were worn for the most formal occasions. Black was difficult and expensive to dye, and seen as luxurious, if in an austere way. [...] As well as Spanish courtiers, it appealed to wealthy middle-class Protestants. [...] Regional styles were still distinct. The clothing was very intricate, elaborate and made with heavy fabrics such as velvet and raised silk, topped off with brightly coloured jewellery such as rubies, diamond and pearls to contrast the black backdrop of the clothing. Janet Arnold in her analysis of Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe records identifies French, Italian, Dutch, and Polish styles for bodices and sleeves, as well as Spanish.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court is}} {{rectangular}} and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit {{a court to}} be marked for singles only. [...] The doubles court is wider than the <b>singles</b> <b>court,</b> but both are of same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.|$|R

6000|$|What {{good would}} a {{proclamation}} of emancipation from me do, especially {{as we are}} now situated? I {{do not want to}} issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a <b>single</b> <b>court,</b> or magistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can we feed and care for such a multitude? General Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command. They eat, and that is all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again? for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off. They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River a few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it! For instance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help, and sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it. What could I do? ...|$|E
