5000|$|The {{combination}} of equipment within the <b>switchgear</b> <b>enclosure</b> {{allows them to}} interrupt fault currents of thousands of amps. A circuit breaker (within a <b>switchgear</b> <b>enclosure)</b> is the primary component that interrupts fault currents. The quenching of the arc when the circuit breaker pulls apart the contacts (disconnects the circuit) requires careful design. Circuit breakers fall into these five types: ...|$|E

Achieve (1) agreement regarding necessary changes to either SRP-LR or NEI 95 - 10, (2) understanding of how NEI will reflect resolution of outstanding issues in NEI 95 - 10, and (3) understanding of how NEI will reflect NRC positions which it does not agree with in NEI 95 - 10 1. An example in Section 4. 1. 1, paragraph 4 of NEI 95 - 10, rev. 2 states “ [...] . the component boundary between an electrical cable and a <b>switchgear</b> <b>enclosure</b> is {{at the point where}} the cable enters the <b>switchgear</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Electrical cables inside the <b>switchgear</b> <b>enclosure</b> are part of the switchgear and are inspected and maintained as part of the switchgear”. However, this is not consistent with the SRP-LR, Table 2. 1 - 2 for Complex Assemblies, which refers to a prior review that would have the component boundary for the cable at the point where it connects inside the enclosure, not at the point where it enters the enclosure. Please make conforming changes to NEI 95 - 10. 2. NEI removed Appendix C “Examples to Demonstrate the License Renewal Process...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} author discuss main {{facilities}} of switchgear-rooms placed into metallic containers based on ISO containers primary used for transport. In {{the beginning of}} this thesis, author writes about the basic requirements needed for realization of switchgear-rooms placed into metallic containers. Paragraph includes parameters of ISO containers, benefits and necessary modifications of containers for substations. Author continues with environment impact of this solution. In the next paragraph author describes most important electrical devices, machines and components such as HV and LV ABB switchgears, transformers and other used devices and components. Next part deals with dimensions of holes for cables, air-conditioning and ventilators and calculations for light and air-conditioning proposal for concrete substation solved for SNOS in Salavat. Final part includes DIAlux export to show light intensity in different nodes of grid in <b>switchgear</b> room. <b>Enclosure</b> contains pictures and photographs for a better understanding of this unique solution and tables for proposal of heat profits from walls...|$|R
