5|$|Initially, <b>Sanders</b> <b>and</b> KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E

5|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} funds himself, Brown {{convinced the}} financier Jack C.

The contract included a lifetime salary for <b>Sanders</b> <b>and</b> the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark.|$|E
5|$|The early {{versions}} {{of both the}} screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson being replaced. The casting employed famous actors and musicians Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, George <b>Sanders</b> <b>and</b> Louis Prima, as well as Disney regulars such as Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley and Verna Felton, and the director's son, Bruce Reitherman, as Mowgli.|$|E

In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise, and Gary Trousdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris <b>Sanders,</b> <b>and</b> Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, and many others.|$|E

5|$|Though he was {{considered}} a top prospect, the Reds held him out of winter league baseball during the 1995–96 offseason. The Reds added Deion <b>Sanders</b> <b>and</b> Rubén Sierra to their outfield competition for the 1997 season, prompting Mottola to question the Reds commitment to him. After he spent the 1997 season in the minors, the Reds traded Mottola to the Texas Rangers for a player to be named later in April 1998. He {{spent most of the}} 1998 season with the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), but suffered a broken thumb that required surgery, limiting his season.|$|E

5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion <b>Sanders,</b> <b>and</b> Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E

5|$|During the {{unsuccessful}} {{attack of}} the 5th Cavalry Division on Nazareth {{in the early morning}} of 20 September, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group commanding three Ottoman armies, Generalleutnant (comparable to a British Major General) Otto Liman von Sanders escaped to Damascus, travelling via Tiberias, Samakh and Deraa. He alerted the garrisons he passed to the advance of the EEF and ordered the establishment of a rearguard line. The line was to run from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around the shore of the Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. Two main roads and the railway lines to Damascus, would be protected and time gained {{for the development of the}} defence of Damascus, if the garrisons were not defeated. Von <b>Sanders</b> <b>and</b> three senior Yildirim Army Group staff officers reached Tiberias during the afternoon of 20 September.|$|E
