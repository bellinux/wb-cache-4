5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|The station {{would have}} had an {{efficiency}} of 46%, which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal-fired power stations, equates {{to a reduction in}} carbon dioxide (CO2) of 23% per unit of electricity generated. The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective catalytic reduction, to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line).

The analysis makes use of the Impact Pathway Approach combined with the data transfer methodology. The plant, which is expected to contribute 4 800 MW of additional electricity to the South African grid is found to have modest health impacts, partly due to the limited additional pollutant emissions expected at the plant.

40|$|Background and Aim   The oxides of sulphur {{are among}} those {{chemical}} substances that are increasingly used and their consumption is even growing in different places everyday. Sulphuroxides are used in chemical industries, paper manufacturing, printing rollers, recovering burned (consumed) coal, supplying and producing sulphuric acid, and in bleaching liquids. Determination and evaluation of the accumulation rate of sulphor oxides and sulphoric acid mists through personal breathing zone, and sources emission from occupational areas of the petrochemical complex.     Methods   Sampling (NO= 32) was done from the working places and ambient using ASTM D 4490 method for the measurement of source pollutants and the standard method of NIOSH.   Appendix VIII for pollutants measurement of the breathing zone. Measurement and evaluation of the samples from the occupational areas were performed during the two working shifts (morning and the afternoon) at the ground floor and {{the first floor of}} the building.     Results   The average concentrations for <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxides</b> at the ground floor over the working   time of both shifts (in the morning and in the afternoon) were 0. 011 PPM and 0. 015 PPM,  respectively. In addition, the average concentrations for the same shifts at {{the first floor of the}}   building were 0. 019 PPM and 0. 014 PPM, respectively. The average concentrations of sulphuric acid mists at the ground floor for the morning and afternoon shifts were 0. 36 mg/m 3 and 1. 47 mg/m 3 and at the first floor they were 0. 66 mg/m 3 and 1. 35 mg/m 3,respectively. The results of measurements for <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxides</b> gas revealed that contact with this gas in the Units of 300 and 600 was less than the permitted limit from NIOSH for the exposed workers to permissible exposure limit contacts (PEL TWA= 2 PPM). Further, the rate of working contact had a significant correlation with each of the indicators of both shifts and the place where this contact accured (P< 0. 001). The measurement results of sulphoric acid mists also revealed that the rate of contact with the mists for the workers being exposed to the gas in the Units of 300 and 600 in the morning shift was less and in the afternoon shift was more than the permissible limit from NIOSH (PEL TWA= 1 mg/m 3). In addition, the rate of working contact with sulphoric acid mists in terms of the working time and place showed a significant correlation (P< 0. 001).     Conclusion   It is concluded that the assumption " the amount of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxides</b> is beyond PEL in the breathing zone of workers "is disproved; and also the assumption that" the rate of sulphuric acid mist concentration is more than the permissible limit in the workers breathing zone in the afternoon shift is confirmed while in the morning shift is disprove...|$|R

5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a major}} problem in Sri Lanka due to rapid urbanization and development of industries. In Sri Lanka, the quality of air has a profound impact on the economy. The most obvious of these impacts is related to health problems associated with poor air quality and the corresponding cost of medical care and treatment. Over the last 15 years, the demand for petroleum products has risen at an annual average rate of about 5 %. Therefore it is important to build air quality models, which are mathematical descriptions of the concentration of pollutants. In this study the dispersion of air pollutants of petroleum refinery process in Sapugaskanda, Sri Lanka was modeled using two dimensional advection-diffusion equations. The finite difference method was used to solve the problem. The pollutant dispersion of Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen <b>Dioxide</b> and <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Dioxides</b> was studied. The effects of parameters such as wind velocity and stack height were investigated. Simulation was carried out using a C program. A MATLAB program was applied to visualize the result. According to the study, dispersion pattern of pollutants showed that the extent of diffusion is dependent of meteorological conditions such as wind speed and source characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Increase in ammonia emissions; {{whole time}} series {{adjusted}} downwards. In 2015 slightly more ammonia was emitted than in 2014 and the ceiling {{set by the}} European Union was met (128 kilotons). It was more because both cattle numbers and fertilizer use increased, whereas low emission housing systems for pigs and poultry partly countered this. Furthermore, total ammonia emissions between 1990 and 2015 have been adjusted downwards. This is because new insights have been made into the data used to calculate emissions, called emission factors. For example, from 2008 onwards, the annual amount of ammonia emitted by fertilizer use was 4 kilotons lower than previously calculated. The new insights were recommended by an international scientific review, performed {{at the request of}} the Minister for Agriculture. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxides</b> and non-methane volatile organic compounds continue to decrease slightly; the Netherlands are, therefore, complying with the ceilings in this regard. Besides the substances mentioned above, the report also includes emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. The emissions of most of these substances have decreased during the 1990 - 2015 period. The downward trend may, in particular, be attributed to cleaner fuels, cleaner car engines and to emission reductions in industry. This is concluded by the Informative Inventory Report 2017, drawn up by RIVM and partner institutes which collaborate to annually analyse and report emission data. This is obligatory to member states. The analyses are used to support Dutch policy...|$|R

5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of Life Cycle Analysis {{is to try}} and {{evaluate}} the environmental impact of a device (or process), taking into account all the important contributing factors over its life. This can include the construction impacts and end of life issues, as well as any impact during the actual “use-phase” of the device. In the context of retail refrigeration, by far the dominant environmental impact results from the use of energy to run the refrigeration plant. This also applies to almost anything that uses a large amount of energy during its operation. It is distinct from, e. g. the environmental impact of a building material (bricks, concrete, etc.) where the major lifetime impact issues from the production processes before use. However, although the “use-phase” of refrigeration plant dominates the lifetime environmental impact, the remaining impacts are still very significant. A detailed breakdown of the impacts is given later in this chapter. An important point to note when talking of environmental impacts is that often these are in fact potential environmental impacts. For example, certain processes generate gases which can be harmful to human health, or perhaps potentially affect the global temperature. However, {{there is a great deal}} of uncertainty in many of the mechanisms that are affected by pollution, and whether a pollutant would have the opportunity to cause harm, and it is therefore essential to be aware that what we calculate in LCA are potential environmental impacts. This does not undermine the value of LCA, but recognizes and clarifies the basis on which LCAs are conducted. LCA attempts to include all significant, potential environmental impacts. These impacts can be of a disparate nature, e. g. the effect on the ecological well-being of a forest (for wood production), and the direct impact on human health (e. g. <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide’s</b> effect on lung cancer). This leads to the question of how to compare different types of impact and whether a single index of environmental impact can be calculated. It is only by weighting different impact types that we can produce such a single indicator of overall impact. The idea is straightforward, but the weightings are entirely subjective, albeit that they may be decided on by an expert panel. It is important to remember this subjective nature of the single environmental impact index and to be aware of what weightings were used in arriving at it...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview of available experimental, thermodynamic, and molecular data on Au aqueous speciation, solubility, and partitioning in major types of geological fluids in the Earth's crust, from low-temperature aqueous solution to supercritical hydrothermal-magmatic fluids, vapours, and silicate melts. Critical revisions of these data allow generation of a set of thermodynamic properties of the AuOH, AuCl− 2, AuHS, and Au(HS) − 2 complexes dominant in aqueous hydrothermal solutions; however, other complexes involving different sulphur forms, chloride, and alkali metals may operate in high-temperature sulphur-rich fluids, vapours, and melts. The large affinity of Au for reduced sulphur is responsible for Au enrichment in S-rich vapours and sulphide melts, which are important gold sources for hydrothermal deposits. Thermodynamic, speciation, and partitioning data, and their comparison with Au and S contents in natural fluid inclusions from magmatic-hydrothermal gold deposits, provide new constraints on the major physical-chemical parameters (temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, redox) and ubiquitous fluid components (<b>sulphur,</b> carbon <b>dioxide,</b> arsenic) affecting Au concentration, transport, precipitation, and fractionation from other metals in the crust. The availability and speciation of sulphur and their changes with the fluid and melt evolution are the key factors controlling gold behaviour in most geological situations...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{all three}} main carbon capture {{technologies}} (post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion) {{can produce a}} CO 2 dominant stream, other impurities {{are expected to be}} present in the CO 2 stream. The impurities in the CO 2 stream can adversely affect other processes of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) chain including the purification, compression, transportation and storage of the CO 2 stream. Both the nature and the concentrations of potential impurities expected to be present in the CO 2 stream of a CCS-integrated power plant depend on not only the type of the power plant but also the carbon capture method used. The present paper focuses on the predictions of impurities expected to be present in the CO 2 stream of an oxy-coal combustion plant. The main gaseous impurities of the CO 2 stream of oxy-coal combustion are N 2 /Ar, O 2 and H 2 O. Even the air ingress to the boiler and its auxiliaries is small enough to be neglected, the N 2 /Ar concentration of the CO 2 stream can vary between ca. 1 % and 6 %, mainly depending on the O 2 purity of the air separation unit, and the O 2 concentration can vary between ca. 3 % and 5 %, mainly depending on the combustion stoichiometry of the boiler. The H 2 O concentration of the CO 2 stream can vary from ca. 10 % to over 40 %, mainly depending on the fuel moisture and the partitioning of recycling flue gas (RFG) between wet-RFG and dry-RFG. NOx and SO 2 are the two main polluting impurities of the CO 2 stream of an oxy-coal combustion plant and their concentrations are expected to be well above those found in the flue gas of an air-coal combustion plant. The concentration of NOx in the flue gas of an oxy-coal combustion plant can be up to ca. two times to that of an equivalent air-coal combustion plant. The amount of NOx emitted by the oxy-coal combustion plant, however, is expected to be much smaller than that of the air-coal combustion plant. The reductions of the recirculated NOx within the combustion furnace by the reburning mechanism and the char-NO reactions are the main reason for a smaller amount of NOx emitted by the oxy-coal combustion plant. The concentration of SO 2 in the flue gas of an oxy-coal combustion plant can be up to six times to that of an equivalent air-coal combustion plant if the recycling flue gas is not desulphurized. The flue gas volume flow rate of an oxy-coal combustion plant is much smaller (Oxy-coal combustion Carbon capture CCS impurities Nitrogen oxides <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxides</b> Flue gas composition...|$|R
