50|$|The Sigma 30mm 1.4 EX DC HSM lens has unusual optical properties. With most {{photographic}} lenses, vignetting is {{drastically reduced}} by <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> the aperture by about 1 f-stop. This lens {{has a more}} linear response to <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> the aperture. To reduce vignetting by about one half, it is required to <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> the aperture by over 3 full f-stops. The optical resolution properties of this lens are also unique. Most lenses are typically sharp {{in the center of}} the image frame, and softer in the edges. This problem is typically solved by <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> the lens. This lens has little response to such an effort. When <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> by over 4 stops, the edges of the frame are still soft. However, the center resolution of the lens is high when used wide open, and becomes exceedingly high when the lens is <b>stopped</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

40|$|In case of fire in an atrium, smoke {{produced}} {{is recognized}} as one of the major hazards for the occupants because of open spaces present in an atrium. The effect of varying the <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> depth at fire compartment on smoke contamination in upper balconies of an atrium has been investigated in this paper. Correlation to predict the smoke contamination in upper balconies of an atrium in the presence of 0. 5 m deep <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> structure has also been developed. This correlation is compared with correlations developed for 1 m deep <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> and without <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> structure by past research. The comparison results showed that when the depth of <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> structure increase, smoke contamination in upper balconies of an atrium also increases. The results also showed that smoke contamination in upper balconies of an atrium decreases when the ratio of w/d increases. The comparison of correlations from 1 m and 0. 5 m deep <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> showed that the difference in smoke contamination increases when w/d < 3. By comparing the correlations from 0. 5 m deep <b>down</b> <b>stand</b> and no <b>down</b> <b>stand,</b> there is very small difference in smoke contamination from both case but it is applicable for w/d < 3...|$|R
25|$|Lens aberrations are ignored. Including {{the effects}} of aberrations is nearly impossible, because doing so {{requires}} knowledge of the specific lens design. Moreover, in well-designed lenses, most aberrations are well corrected, and at least near the optical axis, often are almost negligible when the lens is <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> 2–3 steps from maximum aperture. Because lenses usually are <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> at least to this point when DOF is of interest, ignoring aberrations usually is reasonable. Not all aberrations are reduced by <b>stopping</b> <b>down,</b> however, so actual sharpness may be slightly less than predicted by DOF formulas.|$|R
50|$|The FG's {{metering}} system {{is controlled by}} a micro-computer which measures center-weighted brightness, using a sensitive silicon photodiode (SPD) sensor. The {{metering system}} performs 'instant <b>stop</b> <b>down</b> metering', where the meter reading is taken after the lens is <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> but before the mirror flips up and the shutter opens.|$|R
50|$|As a lens is <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> {{from its}} maximum (widest) aperture, most lens aberrations (spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism) are decreased, but lens {{diffraction}} increases. The effect {{is that for}} most lenses, the balance between the decreasing aberrations and the increasing diffraction effects of <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> the lens means that lenses have an optimum aperture for best results, often about three <b>stops</b> closed <b>down</b> from maximum aperture, so for a lens with a maximum aperture of ƒ/2.8, ƒ/8 would be the optimum aperture.|$|R

25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> to where most aberrations are well corrected, <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|R
50|$|The lens is {{consistently}} sharp throughout its zoom range, softening up {{only at the}} extreme corners of the image. Vignetting is noticeable at F4, but <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> generally resolves this issue. Strong pin-cushion distortion, though largely corrected in-lens, is apparent throughout the frame when shooting in RAW. Chromatic aberration is mildly apparent at the extreme ends of the image when the aperture is <b>stopped</b> <b>down</b> while at the extreme ends of the lens' zoom range.|$|R

25|$|These {{two types}} have {{different}} characteristics, and may occur together. Axial CA occurs throughout {{the image and}} is specified by optical engineers, optometrists, and vision scientists in the unit of focus known widely as diopters, and is reduced by <b>stopping</b> <b>down.</b> (This increases depth of field, so though the different wavelengths focus at different distances, they are still in acceptable focus.)

However, <b>stopping</b> <b>down</b> improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8.
