500|$|At {{the time}} of the C5's launch, Sinclair {{described}} the C15 as having [...] "a futuristic design with an elongated 'tear-drop' shape, a lightweight body made of <b>self-coloured</b> polypropylene and a single, possibly 'roller' type rear wheel". It would have been launched at the 1988 International Motor Show in Birmingham following a development programme costed at £2 million. Unlike the relatively conventional technology used in the C5, Sinclair intended to use sodium sulphur batteries with four times the power-to-weight ratio of lead-acid batteries to give the C15 much greater speed and range – over [...] on a single charge. It would have had approximately the same dimensions as a conventional small car, measuring [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. However, it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise. In the event they did not, due to thermal problems. Neither the C10 nor the C15 ever left the drawing board.|$|E
60|$|They {{picked up}} {{the trail of the}} wire on the steps and {{followed}} it down the avenue, taking care not to touch it with their feet. It was easy enough to follow, for the wire, if not bright, was <b>self-coloured,</b> and showed clearly. They followed it out of the gateway and into the avenue of Diana's Grove.|$|E
6000|$|Dahlias {{propagated}} by tubers {{under the}} hot climate of St. Domingo vary much; Sir R. Schomburgk gives {{the case of}} the [...] "Butterfly variety," [...] which the second year produced on the same plant [...] "double and single flowers; here white petals edged with maroon; there of a uniform deep maroon." [...] (11/77. 'Journal of Proc. Linn. Soc.' volume 2 Botany page 132.) Mr. Bree also mentions a plant [...] "which bore two different kinds of <b>self-coloured</b> flowers, as well as a third kind which partook of both colours beautifully intermixed." [...] (11/78. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 8 1832 page 94.) Another case is described of a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a white flower streaked with purple. (11/79. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1850 page 536; and 1842 page 729.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Druggett or drugget is [...] "a coarse {{woollen fabric}} felted or woven, <b>self-coloured</b> or printed one side". Jonathan Swift refers to being [...] "in druggets drest, of {{thirteen}} pence a yard".|$|E
50|$|Traditional Hardanger {{embroidery}} is {{worked with}} a thread colour that matches the fabric, usually white or cream. Using <b>self-coloured</b> thread enhances both the sculptural nature of the stitches and the details in the intricate filling stitches. Many contemporary designs, however, do make use of coloured, variegated and overdyed threads to great effect.|$|E
50|$|The colour may be {{metallic}} (<b>self-coloured</b> or variegated in {{a pleasing}} pattern and similar on each side), orange or calico. Also {{may be in}} full black colour. Metallic colours should appear as burnished metal, extending into the fins. Calico fish should have a blue background with patches of violet, red, orange, yellow and brown, spotted with black.|$|E
5000|$|The Active, {{introduced}} in May 2003, features black <b>self-coloured</b> bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, radio/cassette player, driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS {{and the front}} passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100 cc [...] "FIRE" [...] engine and a five-speed gearbox.|$|E

Its main attraction is the bright variegated foliage, green, bronze and pink. Only about 40 cm in height.|$|E
5000|$|It also {{optionally}} used <b>self-coloured</b> plastic bumpers. This technology {{came from}} the PSA Peugeot-Citroën / Renault / French government ECO 2000 project. The production version was much more conservative than the original 'one box' design prototype, that was closer to the Eco 2000 styling after negative reactions in focus groups. The [...] "one-box" [...] city car eventually came to market with the early '90s Renault Twingo.|$|E

5000|$|The factory made render has an {{advantage}} over the site mixed render in that {{the composition of the}} render and all the raw materials are closely controlled and accurately measured. [...] Supplying a render in this way allows the manufacturer to include performance enhancing additives into the formulation. Whilst many site mixed renders are subsequently painted, factory made renders can be supplied as a wide variety of <b>self-coloured</b> products, eliminating the additional expense of painting.|$|E
5000|$|Oriental Longhairs {{feature a}} long, tubular, Oriental-style body {{but with a}} longer silky coat. The range of {{possible}} coat colours includes everything from <b>self-coloured</b> (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke (silver undercoat), shaded or tipped, tabby or white. The eyes are almond shaped. The preferred eye color for Oriental Longhairs is green; except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be odd-eyed (two different colored eyes).|$|E
5000|$|The Hamburg is a {{small or}} {{medium-sized}} breed. Cocks weigh [...] and hens about , with slender legs and a neat rose comb. Ring size is [...] for cocks and [...] for hens. Eleven different colour varieties are recognised in Germany and Holland, including Silver Spangled, Golden Spangled, Golden Pencilled, Citron Pencilled, Silver Pencilled, White, Black and Citron Spangled; six of these {{are included in the}} American standard of perfection. Pencilled breeds are smallest and <b>self-coloured</b> birds are largest. There are also Bantam Hamburgs.|$|E
50|$|Shells {{are often}} {{constructed}} of 6-8 wood plies (often using different woods e. g. mahogany and falkata — birch or maple {{are commonly used}} for single-wood plies), solid wood (turned) or man-made materials (e. g. fibreglass, pressed steel, acrylic glass, resin-composite). Wood or composite shells can be finished by laminating in plastic in a large variety of colours and effects (e. g. sparkle or polychromatic); natural wood may be stained or left natural and painted with clear lacquer. Steel is usually chromed, fibreglass <b>self-coloured</b> and acrylic glass tinted or clear.|$|E
50|$|The summer uniform {{consisted}} of an amethyst below the knee, waisted dress with <b>self-coloured</b> belt and deep purple buttons closing the bodice front. The bodice also had pleated insets over the bust {{to allow for}} the growth of the girls. The ensemble was completed by brown laced shoes, beige socks or 40 denier stockings, amethyst gloves and a white straw hat with amethyst gross grain ribbon around the crown and edge; {{there were a couple of}} rows of amethyst and gold straw stripes in the brim of the hat.|$|E
50|$|The Lotus Seven was {{designed}} with racing in mind, and lightness was of primary concern to Chapman. A front-mounted engine driving {{the rear wheels}} (a similar layout to most cars of the day) and a very lightweight steel spaceframe was covered with unstressed aluminium panel bodywork. The body panels were mainly flat to avoid the expense of more elaborate curved bodywork, and the simple cloth lined plastic doors were hinged from the windscreen. The nose-cone and wheel arches were originally aluminium parts, but these were replaced in the later S2 and S3 models with painted or <b>self-coloured</b> fibreglass.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicles}} {{first used}} pin hook couplings to couple up and create trains. Locomotives had a moulded coupling 'eye' at each end, while rolling stock had one 'hook' coupling and one 'eye' coupling {{on the other}} end. In 2002, the vehicles were updated to use U-hook couplings, with less 'give', but they were more prone to breakage. The majority of locomotive models and some road vehicles had a diecast metal body with a moulded plastic chassis and plastic wheels. The bodies were fully painted and lined. They were free-wheeling although the chassis was rigid (locomotives were not fitted with separate bogies), and a steam locomotive's tender {{was part of the}} same moulding as its body. Models of coaches and trucks were assembled from <b>self-coloured</b> plastic mouldings, with some surface detail (such as coach sides) being applied using self-adhesive labels.|$|E
50|$|A smooth coated, almost square, {{medium-sized}} bulldog-type dog {{of athletic}} build. Despite his compact body, the Continental Bulldog is mobile and of staying power; his respiration even {{at full speed}} is noiseless. His weight, depending on his height, is between 20 and 30 kg.The head is less massive {{than that of the}} English Bulldog. The forehead is flat to slightly domed, wrinkles existing but not too distinct. The underbite not so pronounced as that in the English Bulldog. Short and strong but not as short as {{to give the impression that}} the head sits directly on the shoulders. Well arched neck line. Regular and fluid movement, good advancement of the forelegs, spacious thrust of the hind legs. The coat is smooth, short, with or without an undercoat. All colours which are accompanied by a dark nose are allowed. <b>Self-coloured,</b> brindled or in combination with white, with or without black mask.|$|E

5000|$|The Scottish Deerhound {{resembles a}} rough-coated Greyhound. It is however, larger {{in size and}} bone. Height of males from 30 to 32 inches (75-80 cm) or more, weight 85 to 110 pounds (40-50 kg); height of females from 28 inches (70 cm) upwards, weight from 75 to 95 pounds (35-43 kg). It {{is one of the}} tallest sighthounds, with a harsh 3-4 inch long coat and mane, {{somewhat}} softer beard and moustache, and softer hair on breast and belly. It has small, dark [...] "rose" [...] ears which are soft and folded back against the head unless held semi-erect in excitement. The harsh, wiry coat in modern dogs is only seen in <b>self-coloured</b> various shades of gray (blue-gray is preferred). Historically, Deerhounds also could be seen with true brindle, yellow, and red fawn coats, or combinations. 19th century Scottish paintings tend to indicate these colours were associated with a wire haired coat, but, with show breeders preferring a longer coat, these genes now appear to be lost. A white chest and toes are allowed, and a slight white tip to the tail; a white blaze on the head or a white collar are not accepted. The head is long, skull flat, with little stop and a tapering muzzle. The eyes are dark, dark brown or hazel in colour. The teeth should form a level, complete scissor bite. The long straight or curved tail, well covered with hair, should almost reach the ground.|$|E

40|$|A. Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (inadequate) A report of bladder cancer in three amateur anglers with exposure to chrysoidine-dyed maggots 1 stimulated reports of four further cases 2, 3 and two case-control studies 4, 5. A study in Yorkshire, UK, used an existing large-scale bladder cancer case-control study (over 900 pairs) and made further enquiries regarding fishing, maggots and dyes used on {{or in the}} maggots. The relative risks were 0. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 - 2. 3) based on five exposed cases {{for the use of}} bronze (surface-coloured) maggots, and 2. 0 (0. 6 - 6. 2) based on nine exposed cases for yellow maggots (ready or <b>self-coloured)</b> 4. A study in the West Midlands, UK, was smaller (202 pairs) but showed a higher percentage of use of dyed maggots (14 % of cases, 8 % of controls). A three-fold excess risk was noted for the use of bronze maggots {{for more than five years}} 5. This study almost certainly included five cases from the previous case reports that stimulated the case-control studies, but this factor is unlikely to remove the statistically significant excess risk. B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animaIs (limited) Chrysoidine was tested for carcinogenicity in single experiments in mice and rats by oral administration only. ln mice, it produced liver-cell adenomas and carcinomas, leukaemia and reticulum-cell sarcomas. The experiment on rats was inadequately reported 6. c. Other relevant data No data were available on the genetic and related effects of chrysoidine in humans. It was mutagenic to bacteria 7...|$|E
