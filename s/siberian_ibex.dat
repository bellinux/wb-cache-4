25|$|Over 6000 animal fossil {{elements}} were discovered at the cave, representing at least 20 different species. The remains of marmot, gray wolf, red fox, bear, horse, cave hyena, wooly rhinoceros, reindeer, steppe bison, red deer, <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex</b> and argali sheep were commonly found inside the cave, {{with a heavy}} presence of cave hyena and wooly rhinoceros remains. Some beaver, Panthera spelaea and red wolf remains were also discovered.|$|E
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex</b> and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|E
50|$|It feeds {{primarily}} on <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes,</b> arkhar, argali, roe deer, maral and wild boar, {{as well as}} musk deer and reindeer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes</b> live mostly {{above the}} tree line, {{in areas of}} steep slopes and rocky scree. Their habitat {{consists}} of a mixture of high altitude tundra, alpine meadows, and regions of semidesert. In the Gobi Desert, they may be found on hills as low as 700 m, but they are more commonly found between about 2000 and 5000 m in summer, descending to lower, sometimes sparsely forested, slopes during the winter.Most <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes</b> are seen in central and northern Asia, Afghanistan, western and northern China (Primarily Xinjiang), north-western India, south-eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, eastern Uzbekistan, Mongolia, northern Pakistan, and south-central Russia.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{living at}} high elevations, {{sometimes}} at the vegetation line and {{well above the}} tree line, <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes</b> seek out lower slopes during the winter in search of food. They have also been known to seek out tree lines on hot days, {{but they do not}} enter forested areas, preferring to return to their alpine habitat when the weather has cooled. When snow is heavy, they have to paw away snow to reach the vegetation below.|$|R
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex.</b> Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
2500|$|Most Marco Polo sheep {{live in the}} Pamir Mountains region {{adjacent}} to the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and China. Their elevation ranges from [...] above sea level. The subspecies lives mainly in the northwestern part of the Hunza district of Pakistan along the Chinese border, inhabiting the Kilik Mintaka border and the northwestern area of Khunjerab National Park. Marco Polo sheep also inhabit the Wakhan Corridor, along the Afghanistan border. They share much of their habitat with animals such as the <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Markhor stand [...] at the {{shoulder}}, [...] {{in length}} and weigh from [...] They have the highest maximum shoulder height among the species in the genus Capra, but is surpassed {{in length and}} weight by the <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex.</b> The coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black colour, and is smooth and short in summer, while growing longer and thicker in winter. The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Markhor are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to [...] long, and up to [...] in females. The males have a pungent smell, which surpasses that of the domestic goat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{landscape}} includes woodlands, alpine meadows, glaciers and lakes, including Big Almaty Lake. Remarkable trees include apricot, maple, and apple. A {{total of}} 300 {{species of birds}} and animals have been recorded from the Ile-Alatau National Park. [...] The park is home to snow leopards, Central Asian lynx, Tian Shan brown bears, Central Asian stone martens, <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes,</b> bearded vultures and golden eagles. Other notable bird species found in Ile-Alatau National Park include Himalayan snowcock, ibisbill, Eurasian scops owl, and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. The park also protects specific species of deer whose antlers {{are believed to have}} medicinal properties.|$|R
50|$|The {{colouration}} is also variable, {{from dark}} brown to light tan, with some reddish individuals. There {{is usually a}} stripe of darker hair down {{the centre of the}} back and onto the tail, and some males have saddle-like patches on the back in the winter. The undersides are paler, and, in the winter, mature males becoming much darker with white patches. Females and infants are generally more bland in colour than the adult males, and do not always have the stripe down the back. <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes</b> typically moult between April and July, developing their paler summer coat, which continues to grow and become darker as the year progresses, reaching the full winter condition around December.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>ibexes</b> {{are large}} and heavily built goats, {{although}} individual sizes vary greatly. Males are between 88 and 110 cm in shoulder height, and weigh between 60 and 130 kg. Females are noticeably smaller, with heights between 67 and 92 cm, and weights between 34 and 56 kg. The nose is straight in profile, the neck short, and the back straight. The neck is also particularly thick and muscular in males, but much less so in females. Both sexes have beards, although the male's beard is more pronounced, and those of females are sometimes absent altogether. Both sexes also possess a large scent gland, about 3 cm across, beneath the tail.The female's horns are relatively small, and grey-brown in colour, measuring an average of 27 cm long. Those of fully-grown males are black and typically measure about 115 cm, although in extreme cases they can grow to 148 cm. Both sexes have circular rings around their horns that represent annual growth, but males also have large transverse ridges along the front surface. The exact shape of the horns varies considerably between individuals.|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{wild goat}} species are {{allopatric}} (geographically separated)—the only geographical overlaps are the wild goat (Capra hircus) with the East Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica cylindricornis), and the markhor (Capra falconeri) with the <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex</b> (Capra siberica). In both cases, the overlapping species do not usually interbreed in the wild, but in captivity, all Capra species can interbreed, producing fertile offspring.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>ibex</b> (Capra sibirica) is {{a species}} of ibex that lives in central Asia.
