2500|$|Dorothea is a Saint Theresa, born in {{the wrong}} century, in provincial Middlemarch, who {{mistakes}} in her idealistic ardor, [...] "a poor dry mummified pedant [...] {{as a sort of}} angel of vocation". Middlemarch is, in part, a Bildungsroman—a literary genre focusing on the psychological or moral growth of the protagonist—in which Dorothea [...] "blindly gropes forward, making mistakes in her sometimes foolish, often egotistical, but also admirably idealistic attempt to find a role" [...] or vocation, with which to fulfil her nature. Lydgate is equally mistaken in his choice of marriage partner, because his idea for a perfect wife is someone [...] "who can sing and play the piano and provide a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> for her husband to rest after work". He therefore marries Rosamond Vincy, [...] "the woman in the novel who most contrasts with Dorothea", with the result that he [...] "deteriorates from ardent researcher to fashionable doctor in London".|$|E
60|$|To his {{surprise}} he alighted on a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion,</b> {{and then he}} scrambled quickly {{to his feet and}} looked around him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Rollo, seating himself {{upon the}} <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> {{on one of}} the seats, [...] "is not this superb? I am very glad I did not take a second-class car." ...|$|E
60|$|The seat {{in front}} was vacant, and in a trice the old sailor had it turned over and himself ensconced in the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions,</b> {{opposite}} Richard.|$|R
60|$|In {{the shaded}} {{seclusion}} of her room, buried face down deep among the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> on her couch, Madeline Hammond lay prostrate and quivering under the outrage she had suffered.|$|R
5000|$|... "The point was, if I {{had filled}} the torture chamber with the comfy chair and <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> from Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition sketch for a laugh, {{that would have}} been an obscenity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it lovely?" [...] {{answered}} Goldfin. [...] "This is my bed, and {{you shall}} have the shell between Silver-tail and me. See! it {{is lined with}} mother-of-pearl, and has a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> of our best sea-weeds to lie on." ...|$|E
60|$|Although the boy {{had told}} me that it was but ten feet to the floor below I {{experienced}} the same thrills as though I were hanging above a bottomless pit. Then I released my hold and dropped--four feet to a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> of sand.|$|E
60|$|Directly {{opposite}} my cage was {{the throne}} of Issus. Here the horrid creature squatted, surrounded by a hundred slave maidens sparkling in jewelled trappings. Brilliant cloths of many hues and strange patterns formed the <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> covering of the dais upon which they reclined about her.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} went upstairs, {{and she found}} the {{mistress}} and master sitting on a couch of marble spread with <b>soft</b> <b>cushions,</b> and they asked her, 'Well, old woman, what do you want?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Very {{soon the}} bridegroom came back, {{bringing}} with him carpets and <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> {{for the house}} of his bride. And {{as he entered the}} town Dschemila's father met him, saying, 'Greeting to you. She is dead.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was called cavea, 'cage'; {{and it had}} <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> or beds. The mode of basterna's passed from Italy into Gaul, and then into other countries. Modern coach or stagecoach transportation has its origins in the basterna.|$|R
60|$|As I {{sat on the}} <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> I {{could not}} help but {{speculate}} on all that had transpired within the last few hours. Early in the morning my mind had been free from care that was anyway deep; now I was a fugitive, not knowing which way to turn or what to do.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "thank you" [...] {{was almost}} inaudible, and no wonder, for poor Hans had fainted. There he lay under the huge {{bulk of the}} gorilla, just his nose and mouth {{appearing}} between the brute's body and its arm. Had {{it not been for}} the <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> of wet moss in which he reclined, I think that he would have been crushed flat.|$|E
6000|$|The ragged hole {{had changed}} to a little arched door, painted red. On either side stood a green tub, with a tall oleander in full bloom; from the arch above hung a great bunch of gay flowers; and before the {{threshold}} lay a letter directed to [...] "Signor Giovanni Morris," [...] in a childish hand. As soon as he recovered from the agreeable shock of this splendid transformation scene, Johnny sank into his chair, where a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> had been placed, and read his note, with little sighs of rapture at the charming prospect opening before him.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy placed <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> in {{a corner}} for Billina and her chicks, and had just {{returned}} to the Throne and seated herself when the playing of the royal band outside the palace announced the approach of distinguished guests.|$|R
60|$|But {{the moment}} they and the princess had seated {{themselves}} on the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions,</b> river and boats vanished, and the princess and the ambassadors vanished too. Instead the snails and grasshoppers and water-rats stood round the frog in their natural shapes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Au Bois," [...] said George Flack to the coachman, {{leaning back}} on the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions.</b> For a few moments after the {{carriage}} had taken its easy elastic start they were silent; but he soon began again. [...] "Was that lady one of your new relatives?" ...|$|R
60|$|Much {{pleased with}} her new pets, Daisy took them in her apron, and, {{followed}} by their confiding mamma, marched to the house, and established them in the old cradle {{which used to be}} hers. Pussy got in also; and, when they were settled on a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion,</b> Daisy rocked them gently to and fro. At first Mrs. Purr opened her yellow eyes, and looked rather anxious: but, as nothing uncomfortable happened, she composed herself, and soon quite liked the motion; for she fell asleep, and made a pretty picture as she lay with her downy white babies on her downy white breast.|$|E
60|$|The {{houses of}} the vast Plaza {{were lost in the}} night. High up, like a star, there was a small gleam in one of the towers of the cathedral; and the equestrian statue gleamed pale against the black trees of the Alameda, like a ghost of royalty {{haunting}} the scenes of revolution. The rare prowlers they met ranged themselves against the wall. Beyond the last houses the carriage rolled noiselessly on the <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> of dust, and with a greater obscurity a feeling of freshness seemed to fall from the foliage of the trees bordering the country road. The emissary from Hernandez's camp pushed his horse close to Charles Gould.|$|E
60|$|The {{rain that}} had begun with the morning still poured on {{steadily}} in the afternoon. After one look out of the window, Regina decided on passing {{the rest of the}} day luxuriously, in the company of a novel, by her own fireside. With her feet on the tender, and her head on the <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> of her favourite easy-chair, she opened the book. Having read the first chapter and part of the second, she was just lazily turning over the leaves in search of a love scene, when her languid interest in the novel was suddenly diverted to an incident in real life. The sitting-room door was gently opened, and her maid appeared in a state of modest confusion.|$|E
60|$|That night Dorothy {{slept in}} a {{pleasant}} little bed-chamber next to that occupied by Ozma of Oz, and Billina perched upon {{the foot of the}} bed and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as did Dorothy upon her <b>soft</b> <b>cushions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>Cushions</b> is a 1927 American comedy film {{directed}} by Edward F. Cline and featuring Boris Karloff. It is a comic take by actor and producer Douglas MacLean on the 1911 Kismet play and 1920 silent film. It's listed as being lost by Arne Andersen's Lost Film Files website.|$|R
60|$|Within, pillowed on <b>soft</b> <b>cushions,</b> {{and covered}} with a mantle woven of white natural fleece sprigged with tiny sprays of pine wrought in gold, lay the body of a woman--none other than my {{beautiful}} visitor. She was marble white, and her long black eyelashes lay on her white cheeks as though she slept.|$|R
60|$|So May {{sat on his}} fuzzy back as on a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion,</b> and {{his strong}} legs and sharp claws carried him finely over the rough, steep places, while Blue-bird and Skip went beside her, and Iris flew in front to show the way. It was a very hard journey, and poor fat Brownie panted and puffed, and often stopped to rest. But May was so {{surprised}} and charmed with the lovely clouds all about her that she never thought of being tired. She forgot the world below, and soon the mist hid it from her, {{and she was in}} a world of sunshine, sky, and white clouds floating about like ships in a sea of blue air. She seemed to be riding on them when one wrapped her in its soft arms; and more than once a tiny cloud came and sat in her lap, like a downy lamb, which melted when she tried to hold it.|$|E
6000|$|Upon my Life Sir Nevis I am pique'd [...] That I {{have so far}} panted tugg'd and reek'd [...] To do {{an honor}} to your old bald pate [...] And now am sitting on you just to bait, [...] Without your paying me one compliment. [...] Alas 'tis so with all, when our intent [...] Is plain, and {{in the eye of}} all Mankind [...] We fair ones show a preference, too blind! [...] You Gentle man {{immediately}} turn tail-- [...] O let me then my hapless fate bewail! [...] Ungrateful Baldpate have I not disdain'd [...] The pleasant Valleys--have I not madbrain'd [...] Deserted all my Pickles and preserves [...] My China closet too--with wretched Nerves [...] To boot--say wretched ingrate have I not [...] Left my <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> chair and caudle pot. [...] 'Tis true I had no corns--no! thank the fates [...] My Shoemaker was always Mr. Bates. [...] And if not Mr. Bates why I'm not old! [...] Still dumb ungrateful Nevis--still so cold! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the head}} of the terrace, under an open and beautifully carved {{pavilion}} of wood, stood two gigantic soldiers, having the red dagger blazoned on their white robes. Between them was a black cushion, and on the cushion a black heap. At first, staring out of the bright sunlight at this heap in the shadow, the brethren wondered what it might be. Then they caught sight of the glitter of eyes, and knew that the heap was a man who wore a black turban on his head and a black, bell-shaped robe clasped at the breast with a red jewel. The weight of the man had sunk him down deep into the <b>soft</b> <b>cushion,</b> so that there was nothing of him to be seen save the folds of the bell-shaped cloak, the red jewel, and the head. He looked like a coiled-up snake; the dark and glittering eyes also were those of a snake. Of his features, in the deep shade of the canopy and of the wide black turban, they could see nothing.|$|E
60|$|Hetty rose, {{hiding the}} effort it cost her, {{and when he}} had shaken up the cedar twigs into a <b>softer</b> <b>cushion</b> sank gratefully down on them. Then she turned her face aside that he might not see the little flush that crept into it as he gravely tucked the coarse brown blanket round her.|$|R
60|$|The {{first act}} of the Witch {{was to make the}} boy drink a potion which quickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep. Then the Tin Woodman and the Woggle-Bug bore him gently to the couch, placed him upon the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions,</b> and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view.|$|R
60|$|Everything about Ozma {{attracted}} one, and she inspired {{love and}} the sweetest affection rather than awe or ordinary admiration. Dorothy {{threw her arms around}} her little friend and hugged and kissed her rapturously, and Toto barked joyfully and Button-Bright smiled a happy smile and consented to sit on the <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> close beside the Princess.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind strikes her dulcimers; the groves give a shout; the {{hurricane}} {{is only an}} hysterical laugh; and the lightning that blasts, blasts only in play. We must laugh or we die; to laugh is to live. Not to laugh {{is to have the}} tetanus. Will you weep? then laugh while you weep. For mirth and sorrow are kin; are published by identical nerves. Go, Yoomy: go study anatomy: there is much to be learned from the dead, more than you may learn from the living and I am dead though I live; and as soon dissect myself as another; I curiously look into my secrets: and grope under my ribs. I have found that the heart is not whole, but divided; that it seeks a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> whereon to repose; that it vitalizes the blood; which else were weaker than water: I have found that we can not live without hearts; though the heartless live longest. Yet hug your hearts, ye handful that have them; 'tis a blessed inheritance! Thus, thus, my lord, I run on; from one pole to the other; from this thing to that. But so the great world goes round, and in one Somerset, shows the sun twenty-five thousand miles of a landscape!" ...|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{outside the}} palace walls, the poor White Duck swam {{up and down}} the pond; and near it laid three eggs, out of which there came one morning two little fluffy ducklings and a little ugly drake. And the White Duck brought the little creatures up, and they paddled after her in the pond, and caught gold-fish, and hopped upon the bank and waddled about, ruffling their {{feathers}} and saying 'Quack, quack' as they strutted about on the green banks of the pond. But their mother used to warn them not to stray too far, telling them that a wicked witch lived in the castle beyond the garden, adding, 'She has ruined me, and she will do her best to ruin you.' But the young ones did not listen to their mother, and, playing about the garden one day, they strayed close up to the castle windows. The witch at once recognised them by their smell, and ground her teeth with anger; but she hid her feelings, and, pretending to be very kind she called them to her and joked with them, and led them into a beautiful room, where she gave them food to eat, and showed them a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> on which they might sleep. Then she left them and went down into the palace kitchens, where she told the servants to sharpen the knives, and to make a great fire ready, and hang a large kettleful of water over it.|$|E
6000|$|There was no sulking, however. Rosemary {{was pale}} and quiet the next day, but beyond that Ellen could detect no {{difference}} in her. Certainly, she seemed to bear Ellen no grudge. It was stormy, so no mention was made of going to church. In the afternoon Rosemary shut herself in her room and wrote a note to John Meredith. She could not trust herself to say [...] "no" [...] in person. She felt quite sure that if he suspected she was saying [...] "no" [...] reluctantly he would not take it for an answer, {{and she could not}} face pleading or entreaty. She must make him think she cared nothing at all for him and she could do that only by letter. She wrote him the stiffest, coolest little refusal imaginable. It was barely courteous; it certainly left no loophole of hope for the boldest lover--and John Meredith was anything but that. He shrank into himself, hurt and mortified, when he read Rosemary's letter next day in his dusty study. But under his mortification a dreadful realization presently made itself felt. He had thought he did not love Rosemary as deeply as he had loved Cecilia. Now, when he had lost her, he knew that he did. She was everything to him--everything! And he must put her out of his life completely. Even friendship was impossible now. Life stretched before him in intolerable dreariness. He must go on--there was his work--his children--but the heart had gone out of him. He sat alone all that evening in his dark, cold, comfortless study with his head bowed on his hands. Up on the hill Rosemary had a headache and went early to bed, while Ellen remarked to St. George, purring his disdain of foolish humankind, who did not know that a <b>soft</b> <b>cushion</b> {{was the only thing that}} really mattered, ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were in a}} {{beautiful}} stable {{in the rear of}} Ozma's palace, where the wooden Sawhorse--very much alive--lived in a gold-paneled stall, and where there were rooms for the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, which were filled with <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> for them to lie upon and golden troughs for them to eat from.|$|R
2500|$|In the Monty Python comedy team's Spanish Inquisition sketches, an inept Inquisitor group {{repeatedly}} {{bursts into}} scenes after someone utters the words [...] "I didn't expect {{a kind of}} Spanish Inquisition", screaming [...] "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" [...] The Inquisition then uses ineffectual forms of torture, including a dish-drying rack, <b>soft</b> <b>cushions</b> and a comfy chair.|$|R
60|$|That evening I went to Giulia. I {{found her}} lying full length on a divan, her head sunken in <b>soft</b> <b>cushions.</b> She was {{immersed}} in reverie. I wondered {{whether she was}} thinking of me, and I went up to her silently, and, bending over her, lightly kissed her lips. She gave a cry, and a frown darkened her eyes.|$|R
