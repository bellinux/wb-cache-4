40|$|The thesis called "The Future of <b>Solar</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plants</b> in the Czech Republic" is {{oriented}} to {{the characteristics of}} production of electric energy in <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> which are supported by many legislative incentives. We are currently standing in the situation of reducing energy tariffs for production of electricity from <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in most European countries because of their unbearable impact on consumers and national budgets. The aim of this thesis is to analyze impacts of the energy tariffs for solar energy and to explain increase of installed capacity of <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> by forming a model for calculating financial return of an investment in construction of solar panels. The thesis {{points out that the}} incentives are still very high and interest in construction of <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> will probably endure even in the future as long as these favorable legislative conditions are set.

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{concluded}} that the average large photovoltaic plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year.

5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
