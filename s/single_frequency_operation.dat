40|$|The {{ionosphere}} is {{a significant}} error source of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) error budget. Ionosphere induced range errors vary from a few to tens of meters at the zenith. Since the ionosphere is a dispersive medium, the most part of the ionospheric delay can be eliminated through linear combination of dual-frequency observables. However, <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operations</b> require additional ionospheric information for the signal delay or range error corrections. To aid <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operations</b> the Global Positioning System (GPS) broadcasts 8 coefficients in the navigation message to drive the Ionospheric Correction Algorithm (ICA). Similarly, for ionospheric correction the global navigation satellite system Galileo transmits 3 correction coefficients as driver parameters of the electron density NeQuick model. The GLONASS satellite navigation system does not broadcast ionospheric correction parameters and therefore a standalone GLONASS <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> band receiver cannot correct the ionospheric delay. However, if the receiver includes a GPS/Galileo receiving unit, the ionospheric delay of the GLONASS signal can be corrected using broadcasted ionospheric parameters. In the present work, we present an ionospheric correction algorithm called Neustrelitz TEC broadcast model NTCM-BC {{which can be used}} {{as an alternative to the}} GPS-ICA or Galileo-NeQuick. Like the GPS-ICA or Galileo-NeQuick, to drive the NTCM-BC, 9 ionospheric correction coefficients need to be uploaded to the satellite vehicles (SVs) for broadcasting via the navigation message. Our investigation using worldwide ground GPS data from a quiet and a perturbed ionospheric and geomagnetic activity period of 17 days each shows that the 24 hour prediction performance of the NTCM-BC is better than the GPS-ICA in a global average. During quiet ionospheric condition, the mean and standard deviation of the 3 D position errors are found to be about 40 and 20 cm less for the NTCM-BC compared to the GPS-ICA, whereas during perturbed condition the estimates are found about 70 and 35 cm less for the NTCM-BC...|$|R

In the present work, we propose an alternative ionospheric correction algorithm called Neustrelitz TEC broadcast model NTCM-BC that is also applicable for global satellite navigation systems. Like the GPS ICA or Galileo NeQuick, the NTCM-BC can be optimized {{on a daily basis}} by utilizing GNSS data obtained at the previous day at monitor stations. To drive the NTCM-BC, 9 ionospheric correction coefficients need to be uploaded to the SVs for broadcasting in the navigation message. Our investigation using GPS data of about 200 worldwide ground stations shows that the 24 hour ahead prediction performance of the NTCM-BC is better than the GPS ICA and comparable to the Galileo NeQuick model. We have found that the 95 percentiles of the prediction error are about 16. 1, 16. 1 and 13. 4 TECU for the GPS ICA, Galileo NeQuick and NTCM-BC, respectively, during a selected quiet ionospheric period whereas the corresponding numbers are found about 40. 5, 28. 2 and 26. 5 TECU during a selected geomagnetic perturbed period.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) require {{mitigation}} of {{ionospheric propagation}} errors because the ionospheric range errors might {{be larger than}} tens of meters at the zenith direction. Taking advantage of the frequency dispersive property of ionospheric refractivity, the ionospheric range errors can be mitigated in dual-frequency applications {{to a great extent}} by a linear combination of carrier phases or pseudoranges. However, <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> GNSS <b>operations</b> require additional ionospheric information to apply signal delay or range error corrections. To aid <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operations,</b> the Global Positioning System (GPS) broadcasts 8 coefficients as part of the navigation message to drive the Ionospheric Correction Algorithm (ICA) also known as Klobuchar model. We presented here an ionospheric correction algorithm called Neustrelitz TEC model (NTCM) which can be used as complementary to the GPS ICA. Our investigation shows that the NTCM can be driven by Klobuchar model parameters to achieve a significantly better performance than obtained by the mother ICA algorithm. Our research, using post processed reference total electron content (TEC) data from more than one solar cycle, shows that on average the RMS modelled TEC errors are up to 40 % less for the proposed NTCM model compared to the Klobuchar model during high solar activity period, and about 10 % less during low solar activity period. Such an approach does not require major technology changes for GPS users rather requires only introducing the NTCM approach a complement to the existing ICA algorithm while maintaining the simplicity of ionospheric range error mitigation with an improved model performance...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of single frequency vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSELs). Numerous cavity designs are reported, exploiting some uniqtie features for <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operation.</b> A small VECSEL cavity configuration is reported utilising a positive curvature mirror in reverse to create a' 6 mm cavity where the air gap between the mirror surface and VECSEL wafer act as an etalon, which induces <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operation.</b> A 7 nm tuning range has been shown with maximum output of 19. 4 mW. Thermal modelling was undertaken to analyse how the removal of the VECSEL's substrate could increase the thermal efficiency for high power operation. Another small cavity design of length 50 mm was created, producing a high power, compact single frequency VECSEL. Using a birefringent filter and solid etalon <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operation</b> was achieved. A tuning range oflOnm was achieved with output powers of 271 mW. Extensive mapping of the pump profile and eventual manipulation of this resulted in the M 2 of the laser of 1. 1 being reduced to 1. 02. In addition an air etalon system was constructed. to eliminate walk-off losses experienced by the solid etalon. This resulted in a 20 nm tuning range. Frequency doubling of an 850 nm VECSEL using KNb 03 is reported with 1. 3 mW of 425 nm being achieved, corresponding to an efficiency of 3. 2 %/W.

40|$|Ionosphere can {{adversely}} affect radio signals that propagate through the ionosphere. Due to this, ionosphere is {{considered as a}} major error source for space-based radio systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and remote sensing radars. To aid <b>single</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>operations</b> the Global Positioning System (GPS) and global navigation satellite system Galileo broadcast ionospheric correction coefficients in the navigation message. The GPS/Galileo updates ionospheric coefficients every 24 hours that means the given corrections are predictions 24 hours ahead [Hoque et al. 2015]. Ionosphere induces propagation delay on signal which is directly proportional to the ionospheric total electron content called TEC. Therefore, {{the knowledge of the}} TEC and its prediction is of great importance for any radio systems that deals with trans-ionospheric signals. The GNSS signals propagate through the ionosphere on their way to receivers on the Earth’s surface. On one hand GNSS signals are affected by the ionosphere and on other hand when signals are transmitted in two or more frequencies they can effectively be used to estimate the ionospheric TEC utilizing the dispersive property of the ionosphere. An important characteristic of the GPS constellation is that the same satellite appears in the same part of the sky with a period of approximately 4 minutes less than one day. During this period a GPS satellite completes exactly two orbits in inertial space whereas the Earth completes one revolution. This brings the same ray path geometry when looking to the same satellite from a location on Earth. This repetition is known to be used in mitigating local multipath noises in the received signals. In the present study we found that this repetition can be successfully used for predicting TEC along a receiver-satellite link. The main source of ionospheric ionization is the solar extreme ultra violet (EUV) radiation at wave lengths < 130 nm. In addition to the photoionization by EUV radiation, energetic particles from the solar wind and cosmic rays contribute to the total ionization but to a much lesser extent. Thus, the TEC which is an integral measure of the electron density depends on local time, geographic / geomagnetic location, geomagnetic conditions, season and solar activity level. The daytime TEC values frequently exceed the nighttime values by one order of magnitude...|$|R
