5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas.</b> He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas.</b> A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> {{that arose}} in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural rights (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers individual liberty {{to be the most}} important goal, because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.|$|E

25|$|By the 19th century, {{acupuncture}} {{had become}} commonplace {{in many areas}} of the world. Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century. Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, pulse diagnosis, and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves. In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's idea {{of solving}} the {{controversy}} was that the demand curve could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based on the consumer problem of maximizing utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly Long run and short run. This <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard microeconomics texts, even though Marshall himself was highly skeptical {{it could be used}} as general model of all markets.|$|E

Classically, sociometry involves techniques for identifying, organizing, and giving feedback on specific interpersonal preferences an individual has.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I shall discuss, first, the {{contrast}} between certain religious and philosophical ideas reflected in the system of constitutional law which emerged from the French Revolution {{of the eighteenth century}} and certain religious and philosophical ideas reflected in the system of constitutional law which emerged from the English Revolution of the seventeenth century; and second, the tensions between those two contrasting <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> as reflected in the system of constitutional law which emerged from the eighteenth-century American Revolution. The contrast between these two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas,</b> and also {{the contrast between}} the English system of constitutional law which developed after 1640 and the French system of constitutional law which developed after 1789, have been obscured by {{the use of the term}} 2 ̆ 2 Enlightenment 2 ̆ 2 to embrace both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> as reflected in both types of constitutional law. Prior to the mid-twentieth century, this English term was used only occasionally. In recent decades, however, it has been used indiscriminately to refer to philosophies and times as far apart from each other as those of the early seventeenth-century France of Descartes and the mid-eighteenth-century France of Diderot, as well as the England of John Milton or Matthew Hale and the England of Thomas Paine or Jeremy Bentham over a century later. Indeed, some American historians have even spoken of an 2 ̆ 2 American Enlightenment, 2 ̆ 2 which is surely a distortion...|$|R

500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to have lunch with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E
2500|$|An {{ideology}} is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> that constitute one's goals, expectations, and actions.
