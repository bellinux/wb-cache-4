40|$|Nowadays {{there exist}} {{various kinds of}} <b>special</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{designed}} for some purposes, which are different from regular vehicles in overall dimension and design. In that case, accidents such as overturning will lead to large economical loss and casualties. There are still no technical specifications to follow to ensure the safe operation and driving of these <b>special</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Owing to the poor efficiency of regular maintenance, it is more feasible and effective to apply real-time monitoring during the operation and driving process. In this paper, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are used to monitor {{the safety of a}} z-type <b>special</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Based on the structural features and force distribution, a reasonable structural health monitoring (SHM) scheme is presented. Comparing the monitoring results with the finite element simulation results guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the monitoring results. Large amounts of data are collected during the operation and driving progress to evaluate the structural safety condition and provide reference for SHM systems developed for other <b>special</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
