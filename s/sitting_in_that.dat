500|$|Richard {{herself has}} been less {{complimentary}} about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's [...] "changing character" [...] and [...] "depressing final storyline". In {{an interview with the}} Biography Channel she explained: [...] "I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> chair in the corner. That's what [...] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now... There was so much history with that family." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 2, 1921, Masterson {{attended}} {{his last}} heavyweight championship fight, the so-called [...] "Million Dollar Gate", promoted by Tex Rickard, in which Jack Dempsey defended (and retained) his title of heavyweight {{champion of the}} World. Three months later on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart (1864-1946) visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together {{on the roof of the}} New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to sit in his chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: [...] "I did so, and he stood beside me. Mr. Masterson was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call." [...] Hart subsequently cast a Masterson lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923.|$|E
