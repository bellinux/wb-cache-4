Due to temporarily disconnected situations the synchronisation and consistent transaction processing are key issues.

40|$|Abstract. The crux of {{injection}} mold manufacturing optimize scheduling {{is the job}} time dispatching in operation level. In the {{injection mold}} manufacturing process, many factors should be considered. The <b>holiday</b> <b>arrangement</b> and the machine’s duty time policy should be calculated in the searching of job time span. Generally, the different machine resources have the different duty time policies. So the available time span of machines is noncontinuous and the daily available time length is different. To a single mold part, the different operations may be made in different plant. The transportation time will change the scheduling result a lot. A Web Service is designed for the transportation time evaluation. An operation job time dispatching algorithm for injection mold manufacturing is proposed. It can be invoked to support the decoding of the GA chromosome representation. Foreword Injection mold manufacturing scheduling should be made before the mold production.

Only for a change--not at all because I was trying to weaken the impression you had produced on me! After a while I returned to England. Only because I was tired of traveling--not at all because your influence drew me back! Another interval passed; and luck turned my way, for a wonder. The drawing-master's place became vacant here. Miss Ladd advertised; I produced my testimonials; and took the situation. Only because the salary was a welcome certainty to a poor man--not at all because the new position brought me into personal association with Miss Emily Brown!

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores {{the relationship between}} a childless married couple and their dog by looking at this phenomenon through a social constructionistic viewpoint. Human animal interaction has been studied in various different research scenarios, where this interaction was seen as enhancing health or well being in both the human and animal. This study focused on a more “human” role that an animal could play in the lives of people by becoming a family member and how this role affects the family as a whole. The research was conducted to determine whether a childless married couple could experience a fulfilling caring relationship with a dog within this formed family unit. Four elements that are commonly found in a caring relationship were identified and looked at as to whether they can also be found in the relationship that develops between a childless married couple and their dog. The four elements, love, attachment, need fulfilment and ritualisation also formed the broad predetermined themes investigated in this study. The participants were requested to complete an open-ended questionnaire in which the questions explored the relationship between the married couple and their dog. The data received from these questionnaires was then analysed through content analysis by using the predetermined themes as a framework but also allowing further themes and sub themes to develop from the research data. The participants indicated that they experienced the fulfilment of various needs in the relationship they have with their dog. This need fulfilment included the need for a family, the need for companionship, the need to be needed and the need for gratitude. Ritualisation occurred in the form of disciplinary methods and various set activities like fixed eating, sleeping and grooming times. The participants viewed their relationship with their dog as one that is formed out of mutual love and attachment. The feeling of love was expressed through companionship, trust and physical contact as well as the use of nicknames for their dog and by showing pride in their dog. A strong attachment also existed between the participants and their dogs. This attachment could be seen in the participants’ <b>holiday</b> <b>arrangements</b> that were usually made to accommodate the dog as well as the fact that they missed their dogs and believed their dogs to have also missed them when they were separated. They could become so attached to each other that they might experience separation anxiety and grief at the loss or the thought of losing their dogs. The four elements of caring were thus found in {{the relationship between a}} childless married couple and their dog. The existence of these elements suggests that a caring relationship can be formed between a childless married couple and their dog. This caring relationship can have positive emotional and physical influences on both the people and their dogs. Dissertation (M (Research Psychology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Judges are {{far from}} being a pampered lot, argues Sebastian De Brennan THE ‘outrageous luxury’ of senior Australian judges {{receiving}} holidays of up to seven weeks has been much commented on recently. The NSW Opposition legal affairs spokesman, Andrew Tink, is among those who say that current judicial <b>holiday</b> <b>arrangements</b> are a waste of taxpayers’ money, and others have said that such arrangements are out of step with contemporary workplace practice. But is questionable whether this is an accurate assessment of the situation or simply the usual rhetoric aimed at securing political mileage. For example, the media was quick to jump on the fact that former NSW Supreme Court judge Jeff Shaw, who recently resigned after crashing his car while allegedly four and a half times over the legal limit, had taken a trip to New Zealand earlier in the year at a cost of $ 4000 to taxpayers. Precisely what the link was between the car accident and judicial holidays nobody ventured to say, nor did any one bother {{to point out that the}} object of the trip was for he and other judges to attend a professional conference aimed at enhancing judicial skills. Before making blanket statements against judges we should not forget that Mr Shaw represents only one of the 46 full-time Supreme Court judges listed on the Lawlink NSW website, and for the large part judges are among the most exemplary members of the community. As a law graduand who had the opportunity to work as an intern with a Supreme Court Judge of NSW, I can only disagree with the suggestions that ‘judges are a pampered lot’ (see the Australian, 3 December 2004, p 15). During that internship I was required to sit through a trial in which the accused was charged with defrauding the Commonwealth government to the tune of $ 2 million through tax evasion. The trial, which was by no means atypical, went on for six weeks and was certainly one of the most exhausting mental experiences I have had to endure. It appeared that I was not the only one who had a tough time staying attentive: some of the jury panel dozed off only three days into the trial. All the while the judge for whom I worked remained astutely alert in what can only be described as a painstaking and arduous court case. Indeed, the judge concerned (like many of the judicial officers on his floor) seemed to spend most of his evenings in chambers writing up judgments, and it was not unusual to see many of them studiously researching over the weekend. Finally, it cannot be forgotten that most senior judges are paid significantly less on the bench than they were when they roamed the courts as Queen’s Counsel. This may pose great questions about the nature of our legal system, but until someone comes up with a superior one we should be wary of catchcries for radical change. The reality is that judicial officers, like academics, nurses, doctors and many other public sector employees, are being asked to do much more with less as part of a counterproductive culture of economic rationalisation. Despite the benefits heralded by its proponents, the result in the legal context has been continued backlogs, an inferior standard of justice and people being kept in gaol for longer than they should be. The argument that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ is a real one. But it must be recognised that this has as much to do with inadequate funding on behalf of governments and the concomitant reductions in real terms of funding to Legal Aid and community legal centres, as it does judicial vacations. The sooner policy makers and the public alike recognise this, the sooner we will arrive at a more efficacious justice system. Reducing judicial holidays is not the answer. One only has to sit through a trial, or see first hand how hard most judges’ work, to realise that four to seven weeks holiday is pretty well deserved. • Sebastian De Brennan is a research associate with the Australian Expert Group in Industry Studies, College of Law and Business, University of Western Sydney Photo: Linda Macpherson/ iStockphoto. co...|$|R

40|$|The {{archives}} of Canterbury Cathedral, {{in common with}} most cathedrals and collegiate churches, hold a number of 17 th- and 18 th-century part-books which give {{a clear idea of}} the repertoire in the cathedral at that time. As usual, they include music in common currency, but also a number of pieces which seem never to have travelled beyond Canterbury’s precincts, composed by the incumbent organists of the day, including Daniel Henstridge and William Raylton. The archives also hold some fascinating source material which complements the music, contributing to a fuller understanding of the ecclesiastical, musical and social milieu in which it was composed and sung. Twenty-four “Dean’s Books” and “Chapter Act Books” record the Dean and Chapter’s deliberations – and disagreements – for a period of 200 years from 1694, and a series of “Precentor’s Books” patiently record the many absences of Minor Canons and Lay Clerks for the same period, and beyond. The result paints a fascinating picture of the clergy, men and boys who performed the daily offices (twice a day, every day of the year, without <b>holidays)</b> and the <b>arrangements</b> made behind the scenes for their care – or lack of it. Considering some of the appalling behaviour – including thieving choristers and utterly reprehensible men – it is quite remarkable that the Anglican liturgical tradition was maintained, and this paper will attempt to bring these remarkable sources together, along with some later perspectives...|$|R

This survey is a thirteen year follow-up survey of a large national sample {{of men and women}} who graduated from British universities in 1960. The graduates involved were those who took part in an earlier survey undertaken in 1966 (SN: 67036 National Survey of 1960 University Graduates, 1966 - 1967). This second survey deals largely with their activities since that date. The issues examined are employment patterns, including information on the particular problems of working women with families, family life, family building patterns and internal and overseas migration. The information is in sufficient detail to facilitate comparisons between this cohort and other groups, between sub-groups within the cohort and to look at change over a period of time. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Career profile: starting date, date of leaving, nature of duties, number of subordinates, industry, employer's business before/after marriage. Membership of professional societies, conferences attended, publications, experience of employment overseas, country. Reason for changing post, change in ideas about family size and career, intended family size at marriage/now, reasons for change in desired family size. Arrangements for children during working hours/school <b>holidays,</b> maternity leave, <b>arrangements</b> for children under three/three-five. Woman's responsibilities, time spent at home, reasons for return to work, non-employed mother's intentions, hours preferred, conditions facilitating work, obstacles to career development.

40|$|Teachers {{who work}} fulltime in {{community-based}} childcare settings {{are responsible for}} the care and education of children who range in age from babies to children aged 5 years of age. Teachers working in this capacity commonly care for children for extended periods of time, acting 'in loco parentis' as they respond to children throughout the day. Teachers who work in such settings experience their work within a particular working reality. They tend to have shorter <b>holidays,</b> <b>staggered</b> breaks and longer face to face hours with children than others who work with young children in early childhood education. Furthermore, recent moves to professionalize the sector have created increased accountability for all teachers in early childhood education, including those who work in childcare. The present study interviewed 6 teachers who work in community-based settings. Teachers were asked to talk at length about their work. They were encouraged to communicate what their work was like and how they experienced it. They were asked to describe in detail an actual day in their work and to recount particular stories that epitomized their views and their experiences. The interview transcripts were then analysed to make explicit how teachers understood and made meaning in their work. In-depth analysis of the interviews revealed eight discourses that were significant in the teachers' work. These were: a normative mother care discourse, a child-centred discourse, a professional discourse, a team-player discourse, a manager of the day, people and environment discourse, a child-in-context discourse and a forum for care discourse. The particular nature of the discourses that were identified threw light on the work of teachers and the experiences that the teachers consequently had. The discourses were analysed in relation to the current literature and in relation to the material realities of the teachers' work. Certain world-views were seen to be opened up to the teachers from their positions within discourses. The positions that teachers took up in the various discourses were explored in regard to the kinds of relationships that teachers made with children and with parents/whānau and in regard to care of their own self. The study concludes by advocating for increased awareness of the discourses that constitute the work. It is important that teachers understand how certain subject positions are available to them in particular discourses and how these subject positions offer a particular view of the world. Also, as teachers take up positions, certain ways of being with children and with parents open up, and other ways of being with children and parents/whānau close down...|$|R
