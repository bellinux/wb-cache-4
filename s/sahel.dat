5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the <b>Sahel</b> only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the <b>Sahel</b> is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Species {{such as the}} Senegalese {{grasshopper}} (Oedaleus senegalensis) and the African rice grasshopper (Hieroglyphus daganensis), {{both from}} the <b>Sahel,</b> often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.|$|E
5|$|Further {{south in}} Mali, the Great Mosque of Djenné, a {{dramatic}} example of <b>Sahel</b> mudbrick architecture. {{was built in}} 1907, based {{on the design of}} an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler Seku Amadu had let the previous mosque collapse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} live {{sedentary}} {{people such as}} the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential social unit is the lineage. In the <b>Sahel</b> sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the <b>Sahel</b> drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Senegal's {{independence}} was declared on August 20, 1960, {{and after the}} dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the <b>Sahel</b> in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.|$|E
5|$|The serval is {{confined}} to Africa – it is rare in northern Africa and the <b>Sahel,</b> but widespread in southern Africa, where their range is reportedly expanding. In northern Africa, the serval is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless <b>Sahel</b> further north.|$|E
5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern <b>Sahel,</b> south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African <b>Sahel</b> {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence.|$|E
5|$|The serval prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds and tall grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. It {{is rare in}} northern Africa and the <b>Sahel,</b> but widespread in southern Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the serval as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Though they {{maintained}} a formal neutrality policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the <b>Sahel</b> led the French to adopt policies that aimed {{to prevent the spread}} of Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.|$|E
5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The <b>Sahel,</b> The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the <b>Sahel</b> region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire conquered most of Palestine {{from the}} Mamluks after the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1517. As {{the army of}} Sultan Selim I moved south towards Egypt, Tarabay ibn Qaraja, {{chieftain}} of the Bani Hareth, a Bedouin tribe from the Hejaz, supported them by contributing guides and scouts. When the Mamluks were completely uprooted and Selim returned to Istanbul, the Tarabays were granted the territory of Lajjun. The town eventually became {{the capital of the}} Sanjak ("District") of Lajjun, which {{was a part of the}} province of Damascus, and encompassed the Jezreel Valley, northern Samaria, and a part of the north-central coastline of Palestine as its territory. It was composed of four nahiyas ("sub-districts") (Jinin, <b>Sahel</b> Atlit, Sa'ra, and Shafa), and encompassed a total of 55 villages, including Haifa, Jenin, and Baysan.|$|E
5|$|The desert nomads {{were also}} traders. The Sahara {{is a very}} large expanse of land {{stretching}} from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. Trade routes were developed linking the <b>Sahel</b> in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards. Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells. Several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the Sahara between the 8th and 18th centuries. Traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles, shipping and air freight, but caravans still travel along routes between Agadez and Bilma and between Timbuktu and Taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the <b>Sahel</b> in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
5|$|Chad is a {{landlocked}} country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern {{reaches of the}} Sahara Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the <b>Sahel.</b> It borders Libya to the south, Niger to the east, Sudan to the west, and the Central African Republic to the north. Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960, when it declared independence. Some four years later, the former French colony made its début at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. For the next three decades, Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese-backed rebels; the civil war ended in 1990, although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008. During Chad's greatest era of instability, athletes from the country {{did not attend the}} 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the <b>Sahel,</b> the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The <b>Sahel,</b> the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless <b>Sahel</b> are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the <b>Sahel.</b> There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E
25|$|A {{possibility}} {{causing the}} variation is the <b>Sahel,</b> {{a strip of}} semi-arid land on the southern border of the Sahara. When rain amounts in the <b>Sahel</b> are higher, the volume of dust is lower. The higher rainfall could make more vegetation grow in the <b>Sahel,</b> leaving less sand exposed to winds to blow away.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, summer {{rainfall}} in the <b>Sahel</b> {{has been}} increasing; {{this has been}} associated with an increase in vegetation, forming what has been called a 'greening' of the <b>Sahel.</b> The observed increase in rainfall is accounted for by enhancements in the African easterly jet, which is known to induce wet anomalies. A 2011 study found that the positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves accompanied the northward migration of the <b>Sahel</b> rainband.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sahel,</b> a {{broadening}} {{coastal plain}} along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, {{is among the}} world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the <b>Sahel,</b> between the Dorsal {{and a range of}} hills south of Gafsa, are the Steppes. Much of the southern region is semi-arid and desert.|$|E
25|$|Surviving {{contemporary}} {{records of}} climate in the <b>Sahel</b> begin with early Muslim travellers {{in the early}} Medieval Warm Period. These suggest that <b>Sahel</b> rainfall was relatively low in the 7th and 8th centuries and then increased substantially from about 800 AD. There was a decline in rainfall from about 1300 AD, but an increase again around 200 years later.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sahel</b> {{has long}} {{experienced}} {{a series of}} historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The <b>Sahel</b> region is a climate zone sandwiched between the African Savannah grasslands {{to the south and}} the Sahara desert to the north, across West and Central Africa. While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased {{from the end of the}} 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the <b>Sahel</b> nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The most recent drought occurred in 2012.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{study by}} NOAA {{scientists}} {{suggests that the}} Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over <b>Sahel,</b> while a cold phase reduces it. The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, assuming a 70-year cycle (following peaks in ≈1880 and ≈1950), will peak around 2020. A 2009 study found further evidence for {{a link between the}} AMO and West African drought. Later, a 2013 study found that the East Atlantic (EA) mode also modulates <b>Sahel</b> summer rainfall and further indicated that operational climate forecasting was unable to capture this EA impact on the <b>Sahel.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1973, The United Nations Sahelian Office (UNSO) {{was created}} to address the {{problems}} of drought in the <b>Sahel</b> region following the West African <b>Sahel</b> drought of 1968-73. In the 1990s, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was adopted and UNSO became the United Nations Development Programme's Office to Combat Desertification and Drought, as its scope broadened to be global rather than only focused on Africa.|$|E

25|$|The first rain gauges in the <b>Sahel</b> {{date from}} 1898 and they reveal {{that a major}} drought in the 1910s, {{accompanied}} by large-scale famine, was followed by wet conditions during the 1920s and 1930s, reaching a peak with the very wet year of 1936. The 1940s saw several minor droughts — notably in 1949 — but the 1950s were consistently wet, and expansion of agriculture to feed growing populations characterised this decade. Many have thought this contributed to {{the severity of the}} subsequent <b>Sahel</b> droughts.|$|E
