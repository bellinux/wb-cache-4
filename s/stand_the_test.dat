5|$|The {{establishment}} of Constantinople served {{as one of}} Constantine's most lasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity. Numerous churches were built across the city, including the Hagia Sophia which was built {{during the reign of}} Justinian the Great and remained the world's largest cathedral for a thousand years. Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople; accommodating tens of thousands of spectators, the hippodrome became central to civic life and, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the epicenter of episodes of unrest, including the Nika riots. Constantinople's location also ensured its existence would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time; for many centuries, its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam. During most of the Middle Ages, {{the latter part of the}} Byzantine era, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} year {{saw more}} intensive collecting by Walcott. He {{and his two}} sons systematically investigated every stratum of rock to locate {{the source of the}} block they had found the previous summer. They eventually identified the productive layers, including the Phyllopod bed, in what would become the Walcott Quarry. They began to excavate this outcrop, sending blocks by pack horse to Walcott's wife, who split the shale and prepared fossils for transportation downhill to Field, and onwards by rail to Washington. While reporting his finds in the following year, Walcott first coined the term 'Burgess Shale', proposing it to form a facies within the Stephen Formation. These reports covered many now-familiar animal genera, although few of Walcott's proposed classifications would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time; they were also Walcott's final publications on Burgess Shale animals.|$|E

[...] Writing for the foundation, Jim O'Neal noted that [...] "regardless of mythology and rock 'n' roll renditions, Johnson's record was indeed a powerful one, a song that would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time on its own". [...] In 1998, it received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award to acknowledge its quality and place in recording history. In 1995, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed Cream's [...] "Crossroads" [...] as one of the [...] "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll". [...] Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number three on its [...] "Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reactions}} among {{film critics}} were mixed. Some {{wrote that the}} plot took {{a back seat to}} the film's special effects, and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action/adventure movie. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time. Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace. Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "Blade Crawler", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as [...] "science fiction pornography". Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in [...] "human terms".|$|E
500|$|Alt Sounds writer Candice Haridimou {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 94% out of 100% and praised the album's lyrical content. She said the {{political}} nature of the album also uses emotional dramatisation to capture the listener, particularly in songs like [...] "Devil's Island". Haridimou states the song [...] "drives remorse into the cold hearts of those involved. It’s a severe and poignant song that will <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time." [...] Ryan Bird, in an otherwise positive review of Daybreaker, criticised it upon first hearing it; he said it struggled to settle into any distinctive rhythm or groove. However, Bird concluded his review by saying, [...] "but despite its relative (and relatively few) faults. 'Daybreaker' represents a victory for a band who some had once been so eager to write off, suggesting that maybejust maybethey've got {{what it takes to}} bring both sides [...] together".|$|E

500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was {{impressed}} with the album and said that [...] "Madonna, with the help of Price, [...] has succeeded at creating a dance-pop odyssey with an emotional, if not necessarily narrative, arc — and one big continuously-mixed F you to the art-dismantling iPod Shuffle in the process." [...] He compared the album to Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's studio album X (2007), saying [...] "Comparisons to X, Kylie Minogue's own discofied comeback album from 2007, are inevitable". Alan Light from Rolling Stone declared that the album illustrated that [...] "Madonna has never lost her faith {{in the power of the}} beat." [...] However, he opined that [...] "Confessions on a Dance Floor won't <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time like her glorious early club hits, but it proves its point.

500|$|Matt Tuck {{spoke to}} Daniel Marez of Metal Hammer in March 2009 about the band's {{progress}} on writing and recording their third album. Tuck stated {{that there were}} four or five songs that were finished and that [...] "usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I’m trying to write the vocals as I write the music." [...] Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is [...] "a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time [...] than both the previous things we've done." [...] In a January 2010 interview with Rock Sound, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled Fever, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to The Poison rather than Scream Aim Fire and contain no ballads.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its unconventional context-sensitive systems. IGN credited Rare {{for reducing}} the number of items to collect and simplifying the moves with context-sensitive pads, stating that they [...] "help keep the action shifting, refreshing, and always exciting." [...] In contrast, Edge remarked that the context-sensitive moments [...] "threaten to make the title little more than a procession of barely connected and puerile minigames." [...] Game Revolution criticised the game's simplistic action, short length and linear nature. Similarly, GameSpot noted that the game's linearity [...] "cuts its length considerably". The game's camera system was criticised by several reviewers. Geraint Evans of N64 Magazine felt that it does not allow players to properly judge their position within their surroundings, while GameSpot remarked that it can get caught on objects or refuse to obey commands. The multiplayer was described as inventive and was praised for its numerous options. GameSpot, however, remarked that the multiplayer modes add some longevity to the game, but most [...] "fail to <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{follow-up}} It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} pursued a different direction, content-wise. According to Chuck D, {{they sought to}} make a more thematically focused work and to condense Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's theory of [...] "Color Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy)" [...] into an album-length recording, [...] "telling people, well, color's an issue created and concocted {{to take advantage of}} people of various characteristics with the benefit of a few". He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with Billboard, [...] "We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance". Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so we set out to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time", says Joseph.|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time, but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, {{the sound of a}} briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

500|$|SEAL Team 10's quick-reaction force (QRF) commander. Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely. There's no purpose in me going out and firing an M4 in this case." ...|$|E
500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time with such confidence".|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{music and}} choreography have {{inspired}} numerous performers. Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: [...] "Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's {{one of those}} gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, {{that people want to}} believe in... there's not that many superstars that <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> of time." [...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance. Kesha, Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Crystal Kay, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna, and Brazilian singer Kelly Key have all named her an inspiration, while others such as Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas of TLC, Cassie, Nicki Minaj, Keri Hilson, and DJ/singer Havana Brown, have all expressed desire to emulate her. Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that [...] "s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor." [...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built." ...|$|E
