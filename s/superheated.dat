5|$|Geothermal energy {{comes in}} either vapor-dominated or liquid-dominated forms. Larderello and The Geysers are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer {{temperatures}} from 240 to 300°C that produce <b>superheated</b> steam.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a <b>superheated</b> column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use <b>superheated</b> steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure <b>superheated</b> steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} belief that <b>superheating</b> can occur only in pure substances. This is untrue, as <b>superheating</b> has been {{observed}} in coffee and other impure liquids. Impurities do prevent <b>superheating</b> if they introduce nucleation sites (rough areas where gas is trapped); for example, sand tends to suppress <b>superheating</b> in water. Dissolved gas can also provide nucleation sites {{when it comes out}} of solution and forms bubbles. However, an impurity such as salt or sugar, dissolved in water to form a homogeneous solution, does not prevent <b>superheating.</b> Other liquids are known to <b>superheat</b> including 2% milk and almond milk.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the grain refinement of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys by <b>superheating.</b> The results obtained from analyzing the cooling curves of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys before and after <b>superheating</b> reveal that <b>superheating</b> increases the nucleation temperature of commercial purity Mg- 9 %Al alloys, and the resultant grain size corresponds to {{the change in the}} nucleation temperature. Detailed microscopic examination suggests that <b>superheating</b> does not obviously change the chemistry of the intermetallic particles in the Mg- 9 %Al alloys studied. The temperature-solubility theory can reasonably explain the observations about <b>superheating</b> made in this study. It follows that {{an increase in the number}} density of nucleant particles is probably the key reason responsible for grain refinement by <b>superheating...</b>|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 c {{shows the}} {{profiles}} of <b>superheat</b> {{degree in the}} IJT and annuli and in the MT and AT. It is observed that (1) <b>superheat</b> degree in annuli increases {{at first and then}} begins to decrease with well depth. (2) <b>Superheat</b> degree in the IJT decreases rapidly from wellhead to the depth of 100  m, and then, the <b>superheat</b> degree decrease is gradual. In fact, in the case of CDTW, <b>superheat</b> degree in IJT and annuli is influenced not only by the injection conditions at wellhead, but also by the heat transfer between the IJT and annuli. For example, when the SHS in annuli absorbs heat from SHS in the IJT, the latter is just like a heat resource that can transfer heat to annuli, causing the <b>superheat</b> degree in annuli to increase with well depth. (3) The decrease rate of <b>superheat</b> degree in MT from wellhead to the depth of 100  m is smaller than that in IJT. This is because the heat transfer rate from MT to AT is smaller than that from IJT to annuli. As a result, <b>superheat</b> degree in AT has a small increase from wellhead to the depth of 50  m compared with that in annuli.|$|R
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become <b>superheated,</b> i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. <b>Superheated</b> liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a <b>superheated</b> boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E
40|$|The {{semi-solid}} slurry of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy was {{manufactured by}} low <b>superheat</b> pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring. The effects of pouring temperature and stirring {{power on the}} semi-solid slurry making process were investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} semi-solid slurry to satisfy rheocasting requirement can be made by a combination of low <b>superheat</b> pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring. The pouring temperature (or <b>superheat)</b> and the stirring power significantly affect the morphology and the size of primary α-Al, while there is no obvious effect of the stirring time on primary α-Al. Compared with the samples made by low <b>superheat</b> pouring without stirring, the nucleation rate, particle morphology and grain size of primary α-Al in A 356 Al alloy are markedly improved by a process of applying both low <b>superheat</b> pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring. Under the condition of weak electromagnetic stirring applied, the pouring temperature with low <b>superheat</b> can be equivalently to reach the effectiveness obtained from the even lower pouring temperature without stirring...|$|R
40|$|Vapour {{compression}} refrigeration {{systems are}} widely used refrigeration method in industries as well as domestic applications from a long times. There were many improvements made to get higher performance of such systems. In this paper we discuss about improvement way of such systems by useful <b>superheating</b> of refrigerant before entering to the compressor. The analysis shows that how could increase the performance of vapour compression systems by useful <b>superheating</b> occurring in evaporator to producing extra refrigerating effect. This might be possible if the heat absorbed for <b>superheating</b> purpose produce the additional cooling effect. The <b>superheating</b> of refrigerant also provide the safe working condition of compressor. The working conditions are: condenser and evaporator pressures of 7. 2 bar and 2. 2 bar respectively, R- 12 used as a refrigerant and <b>superheating</b> of 10 ℃. The analytical comparison shows the way to give the preference to such <b>superheating</b> under the working conditions mention above...|$|R

5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by <b>superheated</b> air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the <b>superheated</b> water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make <b>superheated</b> steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
30|$|Figure  10 {{shows that}} <b>superheat</b> degree in IT {{decreases}} {{with the increase}} in injection pressure. However, <b>superheat</b> degree in annuli increases slightly {{with the increase in}} injection pressure. This means that the injection pressure does little effect on <b>superheat</b> degree of SHS that is injected into oil layer. But the amount of SHS injected into oil layer increases significantly with the increase in injection pressure, as shown in Fig.  11.|$|R

A new flash boiling spray model whose {{atomization}} criterion {{based on}} the void fraction and <b>superheat</b> while evaporation model {{based on the}} dual-zone method is established to simulate the flashing sprays. The model function is implemented in KIVA program. Flash boiling spray model predicts spray penetration and spray cone angle and its development trend, in good agreement with the experimental results. The model has a good capability in simulating flash sprays at low <b>superheat</b> conditions, which breakup is controlled by void fraction, as well as high <b>superheat</b> transition process. It can also predict flare flashing sprays to some extent at higher <b>superheat</b> conditions...|$|R

5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and <b>superheated</b> steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E
5|$|Warbrick married Harriet Burt {{with whom}} he had one daughter, and he later worked as a tourist guide in the Rotorua area, where his brother Alfred was the Chief Government Guide. On 30 August 1903, while working with his brother in the {{geothermal}} region of the area, Joe Warbrick was killed. The Waimangu Geyserthen the largest geyser in the worldunexpectedly erupted with Joe Warbrick and several tourists in the vicinity; four of them, including Warbrick, were killed instantly by the <b>superheated</b> water ejected during the eruption before they were swept towards Lake Rotomahana. Joe Warbrick had warned one of the tourists not to venture too close to the geyser; however she insisted on moving closer to get a better photograph. Warbrick accompanied her, and barely two minutes later the geyser erupted and killed the entire party.|$|E
25|$|Gases are soluble in <b>superheated</b> {{water at}} {{elevated}} pressures. Above the critical temperature, water is completely miscible with all gasses. The increasing solubility of oxygen in particular allows <b>superheated</b> water {{to be used}} for wet oxidation processes.|$|E
30|$|In {{the limit}} of a {{perfectly}} wetting system, i.e., θ = 0 °, the <b>superheat</b> required {{would be the same}} as for homogeneous nucleation since ϕ = 1, while for an extreme non-wetting system, i.e., θ = 180 °, no <b>superheat</b> is required for spontaneous bubble growth from a microcavity since ϕ = 0. This relationship makes it possible to estimate the difference in <b>superheat</b> required for surfaces with two different contact angles assuming all other properties the same.|$|R
40|$|The <b>superheating</b> {{behaviour}} of embedded particles {{induced by}} semicoherent interfaces {{has been observed}} in many circumstances. In this paper, a phenomeno-logical model for melt nucleation on misfit dislocations at a semicoherent interface is proposed. A kinetic limit for semicoherent-interface-induced <b>superheating,</b> which is in good agreement {{with the results of}} experiments and computer simulations, is derived from this model. Calculations and analyses based on the model reveal that melting prefers to initiate at the semicoherent interface and that <b>superheating</b> of embedded particles is possible for a melt nucleation contact angle less than 90. Among the matrix-dependent parameters, the contact angle and the shear modulus of the matrix are found to be dominant in determining the <b>superheating</b> of embedded particles. 1...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} found {{during the last decade}} that a {{nanoscale}} melting of metal has very distinctive features compared to its microscale counterpart. It has been observed that a highly non-equilibrium state can result in extreme <b>superheating</b> of a solid state, which cannot be explained well by thermodynamic theories based on equilibrium or nucleation. An endeavor to find the <b>superheating</b> limit and mechanisms of melting and <b>superheating</b> becomes more complicated when various physical phenomena are involved at the similar scales. The main goal of this research is to establish a multiphysics model and to reveal the mechanism of melting and kinetic <b>superheating</b> of a metal nanostructure at high heating rates. The model includes elastodynamics, a fast heating of metal considering a delayed heat transfer between electron gas and lattice phonon and couplings among physical phenomena, and phase transformation incorporated with thermal fluctuation. The model successfully reproduces two independent experiments and several novel nanoscale physical phenomena are discovered. For example, the depression of the melting temperature of Al nanolayer under plane stress condition, the threshold heating rate, 10 ^ 11 K/s, for kinetic <b>superheating,</b> a large temperature drop in a 5 nm collision region of the two solid-melt interfaces, and a strong effect of geometry on kinetic <b>superheating</b> in Al core-shell nanostructure at high heating rate...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{visualizations}} {{and thermal}} performance studies of pool {{boiling heat transfer}} on copper foam covers were performed at atmospheric pressure, with the heating surface area of 12. 0 mm by 12. 0 mm, using acetone as the working fluid. The foam covers have ppi (pores per inch) from 30 to 90, cover thickness from 2. 0 to 5. 0 mm, and porosity of 0. 88 and 0. 95. The surface <b>superheats</b> are from - 20 to 190 K, and the heat fluxes reach 140 W/cm(2). The 30 and 60 ppi foam covers show the periodic single bubble generation and departure pattern at low surface <b>superheats.</b> With continuous increases in surface <b>superheats,</b> they show the periodic bubble coalescence and/or re-coalescence pattern. Cage bubbles were observed to be those with liquid filled inside and vented to the pool liquid. For the 90 ppi foam covers, the bubble coalescence takes place at low surface <b>superheats.</b> At moderate or large surface <b>superheats,</b> vapor fragments continuously escape to the pool liquid. Boiling curves of copper foams show three distinct regions. Region I and II are those of natural convection heat transfer, and nucleate boiling heat transfer for all the foam covers. Region III is that of either a resistance to vapor release for the 30 and 60 ppi foam covers, or a capillary-assist liquid flow towards foam cells for the 90 ppi foam covers. The value of ppi has an important effect on the thermal performance. Boiling curves are crossed between {{the high and low}} ppi foam covers. Low ppi foams have better thermal performance at low surface <b>superheats,</b> but high ppi foams have better one at moderate or large surface <b>superheats</b> and extend the operation range of surface <b>superheats.</b> The effects of other factors such as pool liquid temperature, foam cover thickness on the thermal performance are also discussed.
