25|$|An order {{served by}} the United States Department of Transportation on May 20, 2016 {{determined}} that Merced Regional Airport had failed to meet certain eligibility criteria during Fiscal Year 2015 and, thus, no longer eligible for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program. A tentative waiver from the EAS requirements for Fiscal Year 2015 was granted on August 29, 2016. Effective November 1, 2016, the Essential Air Service program grants Boutique Air an annual contract <b>subsidy</b> <b>rate</b> of $2,991,546 for service between Merced and LAX/OAK for a two year period ending on July 31, 2017.

We show that spillovers, hence the <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates,</b> need not be monotonic. We show that when <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> are increasing, their growth rate has to be paced by the growth rate of the present cost of the adoption of the new technology. We also show that increasing <b>subsidies</b> <b>rates</b> cannot produce the desired effect of accelerating adoption if the social cost of public funds is relatively high; hence first-best subsidy adoptions are not always viable.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} optimal {{abatement}} <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> should be differentiated across firms {{according to the}} (actual or imputed) marginal damages created by a firm’s emissions. When <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> are developed under a limited budget, we find they may be optimally differentiated to target, in addition to marginal damages, features such as abatement costs, income transfer, and producer participation. The degree to which <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> optimally target these other features depends on how the subsidy is implemented, or more specifically, on how benchmarks for pollution abatement are defined.

40|$|Tertiary {{education}} in the U. S. requires large investments that are risky, lumpy, and welltimed. Tertiary education is also heavily subsidized. Our model suggests that despite adverse selection arising from encouraging poorly prepared students to enroll, observed collegiate subsidies improve outcomes substantially relative to the fully decentralized case. This result occurs because increases in <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> for college education generate reductions in college failure risk without alteringmean returns. We find that this mechanism is robust, and that tertiary <b>subsidy</b> <b>rates</b> well in excess of those observed in the U. S. can be justified by failure risk alone...|$|R
