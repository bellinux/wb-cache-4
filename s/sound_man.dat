25|$|In December 1936, Mel Blanc joined , {{which was}} {{producing}} theatrical cartoon shorts for Warner Bros. After <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> Treg Brown {{was put in}} charge of cartoon voices, and Carl Stalling became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin, who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was Picador Porky (1937) as the voice of a drunken bull. He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced Joe Dougherty as Porky Pig's voice in Porky's Duck Hunt, which marked the debut of Daffy Duck, also voiced by Blanc.|$|E
25|$|According to Black Flag's {{engineer}} and live <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> Spot, a nearly complete version of Damaged was recorded at Golden Age Studios with Dez Cadena doing vocal duties. This session {{is where the}} tracks for the Six Pack EP came from. No official version of {{the remainder of this}} recording session has ever been released, although unlicensed copies have circulated in tape trading circles for years. A comparison of the unreleased Dez Cadena sessions with the released LP suggests that the vocal cadence and presentation of the Cadena sessions were used as a reference by the band prior to recording the final album.|$|E
25|$|This {{required}} the Steadicam {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the <b>sound</b> <b>man.</b> The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.|$|E

25|$|The {{company that}} hired him for Tonight for Sure {{brought him back}} to re-cut a German film titled Mit Eva fing die Sünde an {{directed}} by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for The Bellboy and the Playgirls, also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|E
25|$|In 1963, aged eighteen, Fassbinder {{returned}} to Munich {{with plans to}} attend night school with the idea to eventually study theatrical science. Following his mother's advice, he took acting lessons and from 1964 to 1966 attended the Fridl-Leonhard Studio for actors in Munich. There, he met Hanna Schygulla, who {{would become one of}} his most important actors. During this time, he made his first 8mm films and took on small acting roles, assistant director, and <b>sound</b> <b>man.</b> During this period, he also wrote the tragic-comic play: Drops on Hot Stones. To gain entry to the Berlin Film School, Fassbinder submitted a film version of his play Parallels. He also entered several 8mm films including This Night (now considered lost), but he was turned down for admission, as were Werner Schroeter and Rosa von Praunheim who would also have careers as film directors.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} the first of the series to {{actively}} feature a member of the documentary crew interacting with the characters on screen; before the episode was aired, showrunner Greg Daniels stated that this episode would begin to reveal who was behind the documentary. Originally, the idea to have a <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> named Brian comfort Pam when she was crying was proposed by former series actress and writer Mindy Kaling. According to an interview with B. J. Novak, she had proposed it during the show's third season. The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom operator. Brian's character is named after the series' actual boom mic operator, Brian Wittle. Wittle played the part of one of the annoyed parents at Cece's recital. Ben Silverman also appears as Issac, one of Jim's coworkers at Athlead. This marks Silverman's third appearance, after cameoing in the episodes [...] "Here Comes Treble" [...] and [...] "Suit Warehouse".|$|E
2500|$|In October 1918 Foch told Derby that Robertson was [...] "a far <b>sounder</b> <b>man</b> than Wilson" [...] with {{a greater}} grasp of {{strategic}} detail, but less {{able to keep the}} British Cabinet on side. Foch had earlier told Spears [...] "Robertson builds small, but he builds solid".|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason to}} {{experiment}} with mixing was rivalry among sound systems. <b>Sound</b> systems' <b>sound</b> <b>men</b> wanted the tracks they played at dances to be slightly different each time, so they would order numerous copies of the same record from a studio, each with a different mix.|$|R

500|$|The next meet-up between Harrison and Dylan {{occurred}} in August 1969, when {{the latter was}} in England to appear at the Isle of Wight Festival with the Band. Harrison wrote [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] at that time – a song that Harris describes as [...] "a sweet acknowledgement of Dylan's shyness". In its review of the Beatles' Abbey Road album (1969), Time magazine highlighted [...] "Something" [...] as the best track and identified Harrison's time with Dylan as having [...] "helped him achieve a new confidence in his own musical personality" [...] beside the traditionally more dominant Lennon and McCartney. During the same period, according to engineer and producer Glyn Johns' recollection in his book <b>Sound</b> <b>Man</b> (2014), Dylan {{expressed an interest in}} recording an album with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Harrison and Keith Richards were enamoured with the idea, Johns continues, but McCartney and Mick Jagger [...] "both said absolutely not".|$|E
500|$|A few {{innovative}} commercial directors immediately saw {{the ways}} in which sound could be employed {{as an integral part of}} cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word [...] "knife" [...] would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, [...] "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the <b>sound</b> <b>man,</b> 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'" [...] Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.|$|E
2500|$|Satriani {{started playing}} in a San Francisco-based band called the Squares, where he {{continued}} to network and make musical connections (Squares <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> John Cuniberti co-produced his second album). [...] He was {{invited to join the}} Greg Kihn Band, who were on the downside of their career, but whose generosity helped Satriani pay off the overwhelming credit card debt from recording his first album Not of This Earth.|$|E

2500|$|TVS {{maintained}} small news {{studios in}} Brighton, Reading and Poole. [...] Each studio {{had a single}} camera and a cut down version of the interview set to enable down the line interviews.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Kemp, the crew {{consisted of the}} director a cameraman and <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> with the director doubling as a second cameramen.

Of the crew's status in the unit, Kemp commented: [...] "Everyone said, [...] "The soldiers are there to protect you." [...] F*** off! They are looking after themselves, {{and that they were}} never under any illusion that he would be regarded as a just another group of soldiers. The crew were to get no preferential treatment and experienced the same conditions and routine as the soldiers While the Vikings are a mechanized infantry unit of the 12th Mechanised Brigade, much of the filming followed dismounted operations carried out on foot.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, she {{was asked}} to play the lead role in the stage {{production}} of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. That summer, she toured for four weeks in the stage production, performing across the country. She had her own float in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade that year. She also posed for a revealing photo in the men's magazine Oui. In 1983, she married her <b>sound</b> <b>man,</b> Al Winters, 22 years her junior. In 1984, she appeared in the play Bring It On Home. In 1986, she made her screen debut in the science fiction film The Aurora Encounter. In 1984, West released her final studio album, Just Dottie. This album was not very successful; all three of the singles that it contained failed to chart in the Top 40. Her last chart hit, [...] "We Know Better Now", reached only number 53 in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time she started playing with a Colby Street group that, when she {{performed}} with them at the Sky River Rock Festival (Tenino, Washington in 1968 and 1969), called themselves [...] "Dr. Humbead's New Tranquility String Band and Medicine Show". The band consisted of Sue Draheim, Jim Bamford, Mac Benford, and Will Spires and owed its name to their manager and <b>sound</b> <b>man</b> Earl Crabb (aka [...] "The Great Humbead"); by the time Mike Seeger arranged for them to be recorded for the Folkways Berkeley Farms album in 1970, they'd shortened the charming but cumbersome name to simply [...] "The New Tranquility String Band". Performing with the band, her photograph appeared on the poster for the 1968 Berkeley Folk Music Festival.

In March 1987, the single V (Severina) with a guest vocal from Julianne Regan was released. Back in England, Adams returned to the band to play a handful of European festivals, and two support dates in Leeds and Edinburgh on U2's The Joshua Tree Tour. A live video entitled Crusade was released, capturing the band and their noisy audience at the early stage of their career. It coincided with the release of The First Chapter in June 1987, a collection of the material from the first two EPs.|$|E
