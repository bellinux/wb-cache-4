5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's reign {{is known}} as the Elizabethan era. The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the {{seafaring}} prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.|$|E
5|$|Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help {{further the}} spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661–672), whereupon they {{presented}} a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a differential gear) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; <b>such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Ennin (794–864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814–891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.|$|E
5|$|Several tombs of antipopes were desecrated and destroyed, {{often by}} their rival claimants, shortly after their creation. For example, Pope Innocent II razed Santa Maria in Trastevere (one {{of the main}} Marian basilicas {{and one of the}} oldest churches of Rome) to the ground and was {{eventually}} buried over the spot once occupied by the tomb of his rival, Pope Anacletus II. Others survived centuries, only to be destroyed during conflicts such as the French Revolution and the War of the Spanish Succession, a fate common to some non-extant papal tombs. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the tomb of Antipope Felix V (the last historical antipope), who was buried with most of his predecessors as Count of Savoy in Hautecombe Abbey.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{a source}} of {{internal}} conflict within nations, water has caused external tension between sovereign states.

25|$|Although volunteers {{joined the}} 'Snowies' {{as they passed}} through smaller towns and villages, massive civil receptions at the larger centres celebratised the 'Snowy' recruits, which was {{intended}} to entice further 'eligibles' at the meetings to do likewise. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with recruit Timothy McMahon, who despite volunteering to march with the Men from Snowy River at Michelago, was employed by recruiting staff to dramatically 'volunteer' at several of these receptions in order {{to appeal to the}} patriotism of the crowd, and lure other volunteers into enlisting.|$|E

With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as budżet. Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by Samuel Linde includes the following Anglicisms: foksal (after London's suburb of Vauxhall; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), galon, klub, kwakier, piknik, poncz, rum and porter.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the Japanese government's {{position}} is that the proper avenues for further claims are {{the governments of the}} respective claimants. As a result, every individual compensation claim brought to Japanese court has failed. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in regard to a British POW who was unsuccessful in an attempt to sue the Japanese government for additional money for compensation. As a result, the British Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs.

25|$|Although {{there are}} a number of schools that taught {{painting}} during India's history, there is great similarity among them to evoke charming, romantic scenes. The scenes may include moonlight or lanterns to set an amorous mood. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for 19th century artist, Chokha, who enjoyed making night paintings like Escapade at Night: A Nobleman Climbs a Rope to Visit his Lover. In that painting Chokha captures the tension of lover climbing several stories into a house with many people and a sleeping guard. Chokha also liked to capture twilight hunting scenes. He astutely conveyed the effects of lighting variation between twilight and the darkest night.|$|E
25|$|The sori are pale brown, {{resembling}} {{those of}} the parent species. The chromosome number of the sporophyte is 2n = 108; it is a triploid. As a hybrid triploid, A.×trudellii is unable to undergo meiosis to form spores, and its spores are typically abortive and sterile. <b>Such</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in examinations of Georgia, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania material by Wherry and Paul Kestner in 1932. Both found only sterile spores. However, the species has been observed, particularly along the lower Susquehanna River, to form colonies, suggesting that it undergoes independent reproduction. This has been hypothesized to occur by apogamy, yielding triploid spores and gametophytes which then grow directly into {{a new generation of}} triploid sporophytes.|$|E
