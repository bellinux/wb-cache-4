The {{technology}} of CO 2 sequestration {{is connected with}} the necessity of drilling wells, which construction is adapted to aggressive CO 2 rich environment. Recipes of cement slurries, used nowadays in carbohydrates production wells, are prepared without considering corrosion occurrence caused by affection of acidic environments originating from carbonate acid radicals. Although increased resistance to sulfates is typical for these cements, this does not guarantee any resistance to corrosive effects of CO 2. Density, fluidity, filtration, Marsh Funnel viscosity and rheological parameters measurements (with a twelve-ranged viscometer FANN) were carried out. Using Rheosolution Software, a proper rheological model for each recipe was matched. Corrosive effect on cement rock was obtained through keeping samples in pressure tanks containing compressed CO 2 {{for the period of}} 180 and 360 days. Directly after taking the samples out of the tanks, flexural and compressive strength tests were carried out with the use of hydraulic press. The results were compared and differences between the samples from CO 2 and samples taken from water environment according to API recommendations were presented. The corrosion effect on the samples from both environments was presented with microscopic images. Lengthening of the <b>slurry</b> <b>thickening</b> time and improvement of the slurry fluidity were obtained thanks to adding the third generation superplastifier produced by BASF Polska Sp. z o. o.

40|$|Mine {{tailings}} {{are typically}} silt-sized materials derived from mineral processing, which are conventionally pumped as an aqueous <b>slurry,</b> <b>thickened</b> tailings or tailings paste to a tailings storage facility, usually a surface impoundment. On discharge, an aqueous tailings slurry forms a delta, {{on which the}} tailings particles undergo hydraulic sorting, sedimentation and self-weight consolidation, and desiccation on exposure to evaporation. Their fine particle size and slurried form result in a wet, soft deposit. Thickened tailings undergo reduced sorting, sedimentation and consolidation, while tailings paste undergoes minimal segregation, sedimentation and consolidation. The conventional rehabilitation of tailings involves the placement of a soil cover on the tailings surface, which may have limited bearing capacity, making placement of the cover problematic. Reliance is often placed on the strengthening of the tailings surface due to desiccation crusting to provide sufficient bearing capacity to support a cover and the equipment used to place it. In cases where surface desiccation has not occurred or is insufficient, {{it may be possible}} to place a cover progressively by hydraulic or mechanical means or, in cold climates, to place the cover on frozen tailings.

To ensure the best quality of cementing, {{a thorough understanding of}} well parameters is essential, as well as behaviour of cement slurry (especially at high temperatures) and application of proven cementing techniques. Many cement jobs fail because of bad job planning. Well cementing without regarding what should be accomplished, can lead to well problems (channels in the cement, unwanted water, gas or fluid production, pipe corrosion) and expensive well repairs. Cementing temperature conditions are important because bot-tomhole circulating temperatures affect <b>slurry</b> <b>thickening</b> time, arheology, set time and compressive strength development. Knowing the actual temperature which cement encounters during placement allows the selection of proper cementing materials for a specific application. Slurry design is affected by well depth, bottom hole circulating temperature and static temperature, type or drilling fluid, slurry density, pumping time, quality of mix water, fluid loss control, flow regime, settling and free water, quality of cement, dry or liquid additives, strength development, and quality of the lab cement testing and equipment. Most Portland cements and Class J cement have shown suitable performances in geot-hermal wells. Cement system designs for geothermal wells differ from those for conventional high temperature oil and gas wells in the exclusive use of silica flour instead of silica sand, and the avoidance of fly ash as an extender.

The inlet gas velocity ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 36 ft/sec. The demonstration was conducted at a pilot scale of 5 T/D. Catalyst activation with CO/N{sub 2 } proceeded well. Initial catalyst activity was close to the expectations from the CAER autoclave runs. CO conversion of about 85 % was obtained at the baseline condition. The catalyst also showed good water-gas shift activity and a low {alpha}. At high productivity conditions, reactor productivity of 136 grams of HC/hr [...] liter of slurry volume was demonstrated, which was within the target of 120 [...] 150. However, mass transfer limitations were observed at these conditions. To alleviate these limitations and prevent excessive thickening, the slurry was diluted during the run. This enabled operations under kinetic control later in the run. But, the dilution resulted in lower conversion and reactor productivity. A new reactor internal heat exchanger, installed for high productivity conditions, performed well above design,and the system never limited the performance.

In the coupled sedimentation-consolidation model, the transition zone was numerically modeled between a maximum suspension void ratio corresponding to the initial development of a distinct slurry microstructure and a structural void ratio referring {{to the development of a}} soil skeleton transferring effective stresses.

To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle.

The basic differential equation for such electroforced sedimentation is derived by use of Kobayashi's equation which describes a flow in a porous material under an electric field. The relation among local hydraulic excess pressure, solid compressive pressure and gravitational torce on solid particles is also obtained. Based on the theory, the larger the porosity of sediment, the greater the flow rate of electroosmosis; the electroosmotic flow at the settling surface is accordingly the largest among those at any layers in the sediment. An abnormal compaction of the layer near the settling surface is consequently due to the difference between flow rates at the surface and any layer under the surface. The theoretical change of porosity distribution and sediment height with time of Mitsukuri-Gairome clay compares favorably with experimental observations...|$|R

Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The <b>slurry</b> is then <b>thickened,</b> exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extensive}} {{research and development}} activities, the problem of gas tightness in annular cementing of deep wells has not been comprehensively solved in conformance with present demands. It is known from practical experience, for example, that leakage may occur in cementation over short distances. Besides possible cementing failures, the problems of gas migration are also aggravated by the setting and hardening behavior of hydraulic cements and the resulting hydration volume reduction. Many authors agree that swelling cements, which show a real expansion of their outer dimensions, can help to solve the present problems by filling up existing void spaces in the annulus and improving the bonding at the formation/cement and cement/pipe interfaces. This applies especially to the cementing of horizontal wells, where cavities form preferentially at the top because of gravity and thus also can result {{in the creation of}} long leak channels. The object of the present work was the ascertainment of the efficiency in principle for swelling cements based on CaO and MgO additives under simulated borehole conditions. Besides the usual characteristics of cement <b>slurries</b> (rheological parameters, <b>thickening</b> time, filtrate loss) and cement stones (compressive strength, shear bond strength, permeability), special emphasis has been placed on the swelling behavior (matrix expansion, beginning and duration of the swelling phase) of such formulations. For this purpose, specialized equipment has been developed and constructed for continuous measurements of the swelling behavior. With CaO cements, real expansion by up to 10 percent has been demonstrated under hydrostatic pressures up to 120 MPa. The swelling behavior depends on the timing between hydration rate of the swelling additive and the degree of hydration of the structure-forming cement. Hydration of the swelling additive generally results in increased porosity of the cement stone. However, restrained expansion led to a reduction in pore size. As a consequence, the shear bond strengths increase considerably in part, and the system permeabilities (cement-pipe) decrease. The properties of the cement slurries are also influenced by the CaO and MgO swelling additives. (orig.)

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{optimisation}} of mineral processing operations the rheological properties of slurries must be determined as accurately as possible under the conditions that closely resemble actual site conditions. The rheology of particles suspended in Newtonian fluids is well documented. However, the rheology of particles in non-Newtonian fluids {{has not been the}} subject of much investigation till now. The work conducted here attempts to fill this gap in knowledge. The rheological properties of slurries are heavily dependent on the solids concentrations and particle-solid interaction. At low solids concentrations, constant viscosity and Newtonian behaviour is observed, but as solids concentration increases the rheological behaviour becomes increasingly complex and non-Newtonian with viscosity becoming dependent on the shear rate. The nature of the non-Newtonian behaviour depends on the solid concentration, particle shape, particle size, particle size distribution and the suspending liquid rheological properties. The suspension/slurry may develop a yield stress and become time dependent in nature as structures develop within the fluid at higher solids concentrations. This study however, is primarily focused on the measurement of the rheological properties, where it is assumed that the fluid will be fully sheared and that the rheological properties will be unlikely to change with time. Shear <b>thickening</b> behaviour of <b>slurries</b> was the focus of this work. The aim was to investigate the slurry concentration region where shear thickening occurs. The first objective of the project was to develop a fluid analogue which will have similar rheological behaviour to that of concentrated tailings from gold mines {{so that it can be}} used as a test material to simulate the flow behaviour of the tailings in a pipe. The second objective of this project was to enable the prediction of flow behaviour in the pipe loop under certain conditions using the fluid analogue for slurry from Sunrise dam. In order to achieve the objectives, experiments were carried out to obtain a fluid analogue of a shear <b>thickening</b> <b>slurry.</b> CSL 500 and SR 200 rheometers were used for the characterisation of different fluid analogues and shear <b>thickening</b> mineral <b>slurries.</b> Malvern Sizer, model: mastersizerX v 1. 1, was used to obtain particle size distributions. A mini pipe loop system, located in the laboratory of the Rheology and Materials Processing Centre (RMPC) was used to get pipe line flow data for comparison with the rheometer data. A few fluid analogues with different suspending medium and different concentrations of glass spheres was tested before finally using, 48 vol% glass spheres in 1. 8 wt% CMC solution as a fluid analogue for the mineral tailings obtained from Sunrise dam, WA. For comparison between the pipe line and rheometer data, all pipe line data (in the form of 8 V/D) were converted to rheometer data (in the form of du/dr) using the Robinowitsch-Mooney equation. The above comparison indicated that it is possible to produce fluid analogue to simulate the flow behaviour of Sunrise dam slurry using a shear thinning suspending medium with high concentration of glass particles.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} transport of suspensions is frequently encountered in industry. A typical example is mine tailings which is transported from the dewatering plant to the tailings disposal area {{through an open}} channel. In recent years, because of water shortages and environmental and economic issues, tailings system facilities are changing, and thickening of mineral processing plant tailings slurry to achieve high solids content at discharge is becoming common. As a consequence, with increasing concentration, tailings material becomes more viscous and non-Newtonian in nature, and its flow behaviour becomes complex {{and more difficult to}} predict. Thickened tailings transport is of significant importance in the design of tailings disposal management. Having been dewatered, tailings often travel a long distance to the disposal site. As long as the terrain allows gravity flow, one economical alternative to a pipeline is to utilize an open-top flume to convey the tailings material. The flume can be either artificial channel with commonly used cross sections (e. g. trapezoidal, rectangular, and semi-circular) or natural valley. The design of such a flume depends on the rheological characteristics and flow mechanism of <b>thickened</b> <b>slurry.</b> Therefore, understanding of free surface flow behaviour and characterisation of thickened tailings material is highly important to design the tailings management facilities appropriately. This knowledge is currently lacking and doesn&rsquo;t lead to generally accepted design procedure. This study focuses on the analysis of non-settling thickened tailings free surface flow. It was aimed at developing new approaches in artificial channels flow. The study covers laminar, transitional and turbulent regimes of fluid flow. Since the fluid mechanics, in general, is a fundamentally analytical-experimental engineering science, model development is based on the analytical analysis and the observation of non-Newtonian fluid flow through the semi-pilot constructed flume at RMIT University (4. 8 meters long 100 mm width). In the laminar regime, a new Reynolds number has been developed to predict the flow of non-Newtonian mining <b>thickened</b> tailings <b>slurries</b> in open channels. This model targets to appropriately evaluate the frictions forces caused by material viscosity in the laminar regime. For transitional and turbulent flows, two new analytical models have been developed. Unlike the existing models (Haldenwang and Slatter, 2006, Haldenwang et al., 2010, Burger et al., 2010 a, Burger et al., 2015), the new models have been analytically derived using the open channel velocity profile measured by Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) for a Newtonian fluid. It is believed that, in addition to the viscous sublayer existing in both pipe flow and open channel flows, two distinctive flow regions (1) inner (log law) and (2) outer are observed in an open channel flow, while on the other hand in the pipe flow only the inner region with logarithmic velocity profile is formed. Flow transitional from laminar to transition regimes are also studied. A new model is presented {{based on the assumption that}} at the limit of the transitional flow, the laminar shear velocity (approaches the turbulent regime shear velocity (. However, the transitions from the transition to the turbulent flow was not studied in this thesis. A new experimental data set has been compiled for this thesis. The experimental results along with 2 other independently collected sets, of relevant experimental data, i. e Haldenwang (2003) and Burger et. al. (2010), are used to validate the new models and the existing models reported in the literature. It was found that the new models, except the transitional loci determination model, provide a considerably better prediction over the existing models. In the laminar regime, it is shown that the newly defined Reynolds number achieves better estimation of the friction at the boundary and average velocity when compared with the experimental data. In the transitional and turbulent regimes, the new models give better flow behaviour prediction when compared to that of Haldenwang-Slatter (2010) model - even for the dataset from which the Haldenwang-Slatter model was developed. The same was observed for the Burger et al. (2015) model using the Burger et al. (2014) dataset.
