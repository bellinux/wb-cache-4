40|$|At {{the end of}} 1982, Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil) {{withdrew from}} its Libyan oil {{exploration}} and production concessions. Subsequently, Mobil filed an arbitration claim against the Libyan Government, alleging that government action had effectively destroyed the economic value of Mobil 2 ̆ 7 s concession. This arbitration raises substantial questions of transnational contract law. Part I of this Note provides the factual background to the Mobil-Libya dispute and {{a review of the}} major issues involved. Part II discusses the right of a host government to set export prices. Part III considers whether a host government may take unilateral action even though the concession agreement includes a <b>stabilization</b> <b>clause.</b> Part IV examines the issue of 2 ̆ 2 creeping expropriation. 2 ̆ 2 Part V analyzes the effect of the doctrine of permanent sovereignty over natural resources on the issues raised by the Mobil-Libya dispute. The Note concludes that when an oil concessionaire continues to operate in the host state for an extended period following the host government 2 ̆ 7 s alleged breach of contract, the concessionaire should be held to have effectively waived its claims for breach of the concession agreement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the foreign investment protection regime and policy of Israel, analyzes the central features of its bilateral investment treaties (BITs), {{and argues that}} {{time has come to}} use these treaties as a tool to attract foreign investment to the country, in particular in the energy sector. It shows that until now, BITs have been concluded mainly with developing and transition-economy countries and as a means to protect Israeli investors in those countries. This policy has been based on the perception that only developing countries with politically unstable regimes and corrupt or non-independent judiciaries need such treaties, while Israel can rely on its good reputation of being a democratic state, based on the rule of law, with a free-market economy and a well-reputed judiciary to attract FDI. The paper argues that not only is this viewpoint incompatible with current trends in International Investment Law where more and more BITs are concluded between developed countries, it must also be revised on the background of what has occurred in Israel {{over the last few years}} in the energy sector. The paper describes the long saga of the regulatory changes in relation to the natural gas sector, ever since huge offshore gas fields were discovered, including the Supreme Court’s rulings on the changes of the tax regime and on the <b>stabilization</b> <b>clause,</b> and analyses its impact on the investment climate. The paper presents original data on this impact and suggests policy recommendations based on the analysis of the situation...|$|E
40|$|Lawyers, {{economists and}} social {{scientists}} alike have {{for a number of}} years agreed that foreign investment has the potential to act as a catalyst for the enjoyment of an individual's fundamental human rights, particularly in developing countries. This article discusses and critically analyses corporate human rights obligations and the lack thereof under <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> in foreign investment contracts. The balance of this article is devoted to exploring three main issues relating to corporate human rights obligations and <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses.</b> First, <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> in foreign investment agreements are examined in relation to corporate obligations and responsibility for fundamental human rights. In doing so the substantive and procedural dimension of <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> is analysed. Second, using the concrete examples of the Mineral Development Agreement between Mittal Steel and the Government of Liberia Mittal Steel Agreement and of the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Project as case studies, this article considers an application of <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> in foreign investment contracts in relation to the fundamental human rights obligation of states and of corporations. Third, a proposal for reform in the form of a fundamental human rights clause is introduced. To be clear, the argument here is that the fundamental human rights obligations of investors, particularly of corporations, must be included in foreign investment agreements...|$|R
40|$|Globalisation has {{blurred the}} {{artificial}} borders that exist between economies and societies around the world. The activities of corporations in this globalised environment have often {{served as the}} catalyst for human rights violations; {{due to the lack}} of institutional protection, some corporations are able to exploit regulatory lacunae and the lack of human rights protection. It appears that the paradigmatic change demands an equal emphasis of rights and obligations of corporations. This article discusses and critically analyses corporate human rights obligations and the lack thereof under <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> in foreign investment contracts. First, <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> in foreign investment agreements are examined in relation to corporate obligations and responsibility for fundamental human rights.

40|$|Stability of {{existing}} agreements {{is the major}} means of investment protection {{at the disposal of}} multinational oil companies. This is achieved by inserting <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> to ensure that future changes in policy or legislation of the host country does not affect the existing agreement. Multinational oil companies are nevertheless confronted by the reality that <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> do not in fact provide the requisite immunity against host government action. On the part of host countries, it is recognized that their right to enjoy maximum benefits and to avoid adverse consequences from the exploitation of petroleum cannot be compromised on the ground that stability is an express term of the agreement. Therefore, renegotiation {{in the event of a}} fundamental change of circumstances surrounding the agreement appears to be a viable option for both parties to a petroleum agreement. Hence, this research examines the twin concepts of stability and renegotiation and their significance in international petroleum contracts...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is beset with risks that can threaten the commercial viability of extractive companies. These risks also pose {{a danger to}} the economies of countries and the jobs {{of the men and women}} on the ground. Some of these risks are unavoidable and come part and parcel with extracting hydrocarbons. However, fiscal risk is something that can be managed and thereby minimized ? for the good of both the state hosting the resource and the extractive company. A number of tools exist to manage this risk; this study looks at the fiscal stabilisation clause as it is a particularly popular option for investors. The study takes a qualitative approach through an investigation into literary works and explores how and why the fiscal <b>stabilization</b> <b>clause</b> has become a popular option for fiscal risk management. These clauses have been heavily criticized by various stakeholders and yet they remain as relevant today as when they were first shaped in the 20 th century. The study also looks at the controversy surrounding the validity of such clauses by examining various legal sources ? particularly doctrinal writings and international arbitration rulings. The investigation reveals a shift in the stabilisation clause?s scope, and more importantly its objective, over the years. Drafters as well as legal opinion seems to be at odds with the restrictive nature of yesteryear clauses, which may unjustly tie the hands of a host state ? and as such a more balanced approach is sought. These considerations lead to the main thrust of the study which is to determine what practical drafting steps can be taken to ensure the efficacy of these clauses. The focus leans on the most pertinent substantive components that such a clause should contain to ensure the risks and benefits of resource development are shared fairly. The procedure and objective of the renegotiation mechanism contained the clause is particularly important as it is this key ingredient that makes or breaks the fiscal stability of a project. The study builds on extensive writings on the subject and attempts to build a body of best practice in this regard. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

50|$|One {{addition}} to many contracts between governments and investors is a Stabilisation Clause, which insulates investors from {{the effect of}} changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government’s ability to change any regulations {{that would have a}} negative economic impact on the investment. While advantageous for businesses, these <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project.|$|R
40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} in the mining and oil industries is invariably fostered through the signing of concession agreements between the host State and the investor. Such concessions may contain fiscal incentives, to encourage the flow of FDI. However, such concessions are also susceptible to alteration by the host State, once the investment has been sunk. This may include increasing taxes or outright nationalization. To avert this, investors will often insist on the insertion of <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses.</b> These clauses constitute an undertaking {{on the part of}} the host State, that they will not take any administrative or legislative action that would adversely affect the rights of the investor. Such clauses are well recognized by arbitral tribunals and the unilateral abrogation of these clauses, will have pecuniary consequences. Not only will the host State have to pay damnum emergens but also lucrum cessans as part of the compensation package to the investor. Such a position promotes efficiency as per the efficient breach theory, by discouraging the State from terminating concession agreements unless they will make some money, even after compensating the investor for lost future profits. However, this ultimately renders <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> inflexible because they preclude the host State from pursuing legitimate public functions. Such a position, necessitates some form of contractual flexibility. However, the legitimate expectations of the investor also ought to the protected. The means of achieving this balance is by the inserting renegotiation clauses in the concession agreements...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse how contractual stabilization devices have evolved since the late 1990 s, based on a survey of 20 countries and a review of the literature and evidence on <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses.</b> Although fiscal stability is a commonly cited attribute of a desirable upstream petroleum regime, one of the commonly observed features of existing regimes is the lack of stability. The paper studies the major triggers that push host governments to revise the fiscal terms to which they originally agreed with investors; amongst various economic and political factors, one of the obvious drivers is the oil price. Chasing the price of oil, however, is a burdensome and inefficient strategy, as oil is an internationally traded commodity where short-term price volatility is the norm. The paperâs three broad conclusions include: First, classical stabilization models have not been successful in practice; Second, the more modern clauses are more likely to treat changes in fiscal terms symmetrically, and may be equally beneficial to governments and oil companies; Third, modern <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> can allow policymakers to consider the overall tax system and its impact on revenue and growth, without worrying about the specific impact on the oil and gas sector, and without penalizing investors in the sector. Fiscal stability clauses in developing countries will remain a key feature of contractual agreements and oil and gas laws for years to come. However, the effectiveness of the more modern clauses in achieving the desired outcome remains as questionable as that of previous stability models, particularly in countries which continue to lack the administrative capability to enforce these mechanisms, and where government policy in general and investment laws and the judiciary in particular lack credibility...|$|R
40|$|Scholarly {{literature}} (and political discussion) of <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> {{tends to}} assume that the aim of these clauses is to place limits on the exercise of sovereign power by States who are contracting parties. It is then argued either that this works to evil, in restraining due development of ethical, environmental and human rights standards in the countries concerned or else that they are ineffective, since sovereignty cannot be contractually limited, and are therefore useless. This article argues that neither of these positions is correct; rather, the clauses provide for financial adjustment between contracting parties when legal changes are made by the State co-party, thus facilitating risk management {{on the part of the}} non-State co-party. The greater certainty thereby engendered permits the non-State party to agree to the contract at a cost more favourable to the State party than might otherwise be the case...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the triumph}} of neoliberalism, trade and {{investment}} {{are considered to be}} the dominant routes to economic and social development. This has further enhanced the power of transnational corporations. Developing countries are increasingly expected to secure foreign investment to stimulate their economies and lift the local population out of poverty. However, foreign investment also has implications for protection and enjoyment of human rights. Transnational corporations manage their risks by imposing <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> on host countries that constrain their ability to protect and enhance human rights. Conventional accounting and corporate social responsibility reports seem to be unable to respond to the emerging agenda on human rights. This paper seeks to stimulate debates about the protection and enjoyment of human rights by drawing attention to the way corporations constrain governments and people through clauses in investment agreements. Some evidence is provided through an examination of an investment agreement relating to the Chad?Cameroon oil and pipeline project. The paper calls for the production of counter accounts to challenge the hegemony of corporations and create spaces for the enjoyment of human rights...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{discusses}} {{what is the}} scope of Umbrella Clauses. State undertakings must satisfy the condition of being investment. That is the first requirement of applicability of investment regime to state undertakings. Despite state undertakings was seen as wide concept (by some tribunals) {{the language of the}} clause and prevailing view support undertakings must be limited to contractual undertakings (in practice some viewed that Umbrella Clause can be extended to municipal law obligations)). However, for the purpose of attribution of contracts under international law, states must be involved. But international obligation only arises when state abuses its contractual undertaking. When contracts are concluded by private parties, the investor must demonstrate that that private party was exercising the element of governmental function when it entered into on behalf of particular state. And also, breach must arise from the exercising of granted public function. This will narrow the types of contractual undertakings to licenses, concessions or <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses.</b> This means, even though certain commercial contracts can qualify to be an investment does not necessarily elevate these kind of contracts under international law. Because of absence of any exercising of governmental function while entering into such contracts. Those contracts nature just commercial and investor will provide some service for certain amount of pay...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral {{investment}} treaties are {{agreements between}} sovereign states that give broad protections to investors and investments made within {{the jurisdiction of}} the other state. The prevailing view in the academy and practice is that developing countries sign bilateral investment treaties in order to reassure investors from developed states that their investments will be safe from changes in domestic law. Without these 2 ̆ 2 credible commitments, 2 ̆ 2 investors would be deterred from making investments, depriving developing countries of foreign capital. This Article disputes that view by demonstrating that foreign investors and host states effectively contract around the risk of changes in the law. This Article applies transaction cost economic theory to the most comprehensive empirical study of <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses</b> (provisions intended to manage post-investment changes in domestic law) recently conducted {{under the auspices of the}} World Bank 2 ̆ 7 s International Finance Corporation. The analysis shows that investors and states demonstrate principles of efficient contracting even without the protections of bilateral investment treaties. This finding adds to current research focusing on the 2 ̆ 2 credible commitment 2 ̆ 2 story. The Article concludes that (1) BITs can be explained as instruments developed and developing states use in their competition for markets and capital and (2) differences in the reasons states execute BITs raise significant doubts about conclusions drawn based on aggregate phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Investment in privatized {{utilities}} {{leads to}} a very particular form of political risk [...] the risk that regulatory conditions change and special taxes are imposed, all measures within the sovereign powers of the state. The normal forms of protection against political risk (investment insurance, <b>stabilization</b> <b>clauses,</b> international investment treaties and international arbitration clauses) have not yet {{caught up with the}} emergence of new forms of political risk. The 1997 UK windfall tax announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in that year 2 ̆ 7 s budget speech is a case in point. This issue is not limited purely to the contemporary UK situation, but illustrates a structural situation which can, and is likely to be repeated wherever utilities are privatized, regulated and exposed to special industry taxes. Such actions are usually undertaken by a new government composed of parties hitherto opposed to privatization, which will be able to combine its previous opposition, and the values therein articulated with the ever present need of governments for new revenue to finance its political popularity objectives. This paper surveys shortly the possible responses by international law, mainly principles and practice of international investment protection, to situations which have recently arisen in the world privatization laboratory (the UK) and situations which are likely to arise in the many countries which currently copy the UK privatization model, once new governments come to power. The UK situation is of particular interest since in the absence of constitutional, federal or judicial constraints the prevailing concept of parliamentary supremacy means that any legal recourse can only be had from external sources of law...|$|R
