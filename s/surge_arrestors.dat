40|$|Power Transformers are {{subjected}} to lightning strokes, which causes the voltage at the secondary side to rise abruptly. The main aim of the report is to investigate the voltage at the medium and low voltage side in electrical system of a power plant when the high voltage power transformers {{are subjected}} to lightning strokes. Based on modelling and simulations implemented in EMTP/ATPDraw, the voltage at the 15. 75 kV, 6 kV and 0. 4 kV is determined to ensure if the transferred over-voltage is within the basic insulation level (BIL) of the connected equipment. Transformer frequency model, <b>surge</b> <b>arrestor,</b> cables and transmission tower are arranged in a single environment of EMTP/ATPDraw.

The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low voltage circuit breaker.

From there an overhead electrode line on wooden poles runs first in Northeast, than in Northern direction until Ruokalho, where it meets the overhead line with two high voltage conductors. From Ruokalho to Rauma static inverter plant the electrode line is fixed {{on a small}} crossbar above the high voltage conductors of Fenno-Skan and serves as ground conductor. In opposite to a normal ground conductor it is mounted on insulators equipped with <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors.</b>|$|E
50|$|High-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) {{transmission}} lines are either monopolar or bipolar systems. With bipolar systems a conductor arrangement with one conductor {{on each side}} of the tower is used. On some schemes, the ground conductor is used as electrode line or ground return. In this case it had to be installed with insulators equipped with <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors</b> on the pylons in order to prevent electrochemical corrosion of the pylons. For single-pole HVDC transmission with ground return, towers with only one conductor can be used. In many cases, however, the towers are designed for later conversion to a two-pole system. In these cases, often conductors on both sides of the tower are installed for mechanical reasons. Until the second pole is needed, it is either used as electrode line or joined in parallel with the pole in use. In the latter case the line from the converter station to the earthing (grounding) electrode is built as underground cable, as overhead line on a separate right of way or by using the ground conductors.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate new and laboratory-aged samples of surge arresters and anchorage polymeric insulators, for 12 and 24 kV networks, which are used by the Rio Grande Energia (RGE). Power Utility Polymeric compounds were analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG), Dynamic-Mechanic Analysis (DMA), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) to verify changes in the insulator properties due to degradation occurred during the experiments. The analyses were carried out before and after 6 months of aging in laboratory devices (weatherometer, 120 °C, salt spray, immersion in water). After the aging experiments, high-voltage electrical tests were also conducted: a radio interference voltage test and, simultaneously, the total and the internal leakage currents were measured to verify the surface degradation of the polymeric material used in the housing. The impulse current test was applied with current values close to 5, 10 and 30 kA, in order to force an internal degradation. Results showed that only surface degradation is detected at the polymer. The main properties of the parts were not affected by the aging.

40|$|Electricity is a {{necessity}} of the modern life due to its everywhere usage. Its proper continuity depends on {{the reliability of the}} equipments used in power system. The transformer is one of the basic components which are commonly used in the power system, generation, transmission or distribution. Its high cost and difficult maintenance highlights its importance in power system. Proper protection is necessary to protect this costly equipment from any damage. Therefore, surge arresters are installed near to the transformer to protect from high voltages. However, during lightning and switching of circuit breakers, re-strikes and pre-strikes during opening and closing of a circuit breaker may lead to a broad band frequency spectrum of overvoltages. Such overvoltages may have an oscillating character and lower amplitude at the transformer terminals. In addition they may arrive at the transformer input without any changes in amplitude and waveform so the <b>surge</b> <b>arrestor</b> will not able to detect any overvoltages near the terminals {{as well as at the}} input sides.. If the oscillating frequency component of the external overvoltage is equal to the natural frequency of the windings, then the magnitude of the internal resonance overvoltage has its maximum value. Therefore, overvoltages generated in transients and switching stages in electrical power equipment may be dangerous for the insulating system despite the applied overvoltage protection. The resonance frequencies for transformer winding have been experimentally determined. The frequency band taken into account was between 10 Hz and 10 MHz, in addition the band has been divided into lower frequency band (10 Hz- 200 KHz) and higher frequency band (200 KHz- 10 MHz). Then applying sinusoidal waves with the resonance frequencies, voltage stresses on different nodes along the winding have been located. From these voltages stressed nodes it was concluded that the stressed nodes are shifting from centre of the winding towards the upper part of the winding as from lower to higher resonance frequencies. After that the voltage distribution at different resonance frequencies was analyzed. At lower frequency band, the voltage stress between turn to ground in terms of standing wave was observed whereas at higher frequency band inter layer stress was the concluded result. Voltage stress on different nodes under wider frequency was also investigated where the same behavior was seen. Step responses were also applied at the input to investigate the resonance frequencies and their voltage stressed along the length of the windings. Finally the results for sinusoidal wave and step response were compared...|$|R

Through simulation, {{the nature}} of overvoltage transients caused by the redistribution of stored energy following the clearance of a fault is illustrated.

40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the failures of 88 kV line <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors</b> at an Eskom Distribution substation. The surge arrestor failed when one phase of the transmission line was open circuited and all three phases were not isolated by the protection relays. The transformer was lightly loaded and a surge arrestor blocked the neutral path to the ground. The investigation used a modified version of an equivalent circuit proposed by Marti [1]. Transformer magnetising losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer magnetising reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined volt drops across the open circuited phase of the transformer magnetising reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the magnetising reactance of the open circuited phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation. This resonance is characteristic of the fundamental frequency ferroresonance condition [2]...|$|E

Some black-box models of the spray drying process have been designed and evaluated to find a solution for the problem. After evaluating the collected data it has been found that variations in the supply voltage causes control difficulties for the operator. A cascade control system was designed, consisting of three PI control loops designed with lambda tuning. The disturbance in the supply voltagewas used as a feed forward in the control system. At the end of the project the control system was installed, and tests were made to verify the functionality of the regulator. It was shown that most of the variations in the moisture of the powder could be eliminated using small resources, through purchase of a process controller and four power meters.

40|$|Distribution Transformers are {{costly and}} {{critical}} equipments in electricity distribution network. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has nearly 24, 500 number of distribution transformers installed island wide which {{are connected to}} 11 kV or 33 kV Medium Voltage (MV) networks to meet the present power demand of consumers. Failure of a distribution transformer results to interruption of power supply to the consumers and involve high expenditure in repair or replacement of transformer. Hence protection of distribution transformer is very important. Transformer failure rate of the CEB is nearly 2. 5 % where internationally acceptable level is less than 2 %. When a Distribution Transformer is failed, it is replaced with a new transformer, {{but there is no}} proper method established by the CEB to analyze the cause of failure. A detailed investigation of failed transformer is vital important to understanding the actual failure scenario and prevent further incidents. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify main causes of distribution transformer failures and propose measures to minimize those failures. This thesis presents the CEB distribution substation installation practices and practical situation of distribution substations which would be the causes for failures. Detail investigation procedure for failed transformers was established in order to find out actual cause for each transformer failure. Through the literature review, different failure modes were identified for each transformer component and common transformer failure causes are lightning, short circuit faults in network, aging, overloading, oil leaks, loose connections and bad workmanship. Failed transformers during the year 2011 were inspected in order find the root causes for failures. It was observed that lightning and overloading are the major causes for transformer failures in Southern Province. It was observed that 28 % of transformer failures are due to lightning and 25 % are due to overloading. Onsite investigations were carried out and failed transformers were opened whenever necessary to identify the exact causes for failures. Several tests were done before opening failed transformers such as insulation resistant test, polarization index test, ratio test and LV short circuit test. To minimize transformer failures, several measures were proposed.

40|$|A {{dispersed}} {{storage and}} generation system consists {{of both a}} source of energy for conver-sion to electricity and a means to interconnect this unit to the electric utility system. Most dispersed generators connected to the utility distribution system are less than 5 MW. A new emerging problem arises when a utility circuit breaker is opened while a capacitor-bank bus and load bus is energized very near a dispersed storage and generation unit. A new resonant- detecting relay will be developed that {{has the ability to}} trip if dangerously high o-nominal frequency voltages are produced at the capacitor-bank bus or load bus during this condition (self-excitation). Self-excitation may lead to severe overvoltages, and may induce undesirable transients in neighoring circuits (low power and control circuits being particularly vulnerable) on the connected network. It can create harmonics that can fail <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors</b> or cause transformer saturation.

The electricity consumers in Sri Lanka, especially {{those who live in}} areas with high isokeraunic levels, suffer considerable damages to their electrical appliances due to lightning. The objective of this project is to assist the electricity distribution authorities in finding remedial measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the consumers. Beregala in Avissawella, an area severely affected by consequences of lightning, was selected for the study. Two low voltage distribution lines that run across a rural mountainous area were identified for the modeling purpose. The type of conductor, average span of the line and typical electrical loads connected to the line were taken into consideration in modeling the line.

40|$|The {{research}} performed {{under this}} grant has been principally devoted to understanding and quantifying {{the relationship between}} the macroscopic electrical transport properties of ZnO based materials and the properties of their grain boundaries. Two forms of polycrystalline ZnO have been extensively investigated, polycrystalline thin films, such as are used as optically transmitting, conducting electrodes and as piezoelectric films, and polycrystalline bulk forms, such as are widely used as <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors.</b> The former are essentially two-dimensional and the latter three-dimensional. The research has included both simulation and experimental studies. The simulation studies have been primarily addressing how the macroscopic properties of bulk ZnO ceramics are determined by the electrical and crystallographic properties of their grain boundaries. The behavior of varistors has been the focus since the highly nonlinear electrical characteristics provide an opportunity to test the models in much greater detail than is possible if the characteristics were simply ohmic. Furthermore, there is a continuing desire to improve varistor characteristics, such as the sharpness of the switching voltage and the degree of nonlinearity, so the effect of grain boundary variations on these parameters have been specifically addressed and found to quantitatively depend on the variation in both grain size and grain boundary barrier height. New methods of quantifying the effect of microstructural variations on the I-V characteristics have been introduced. The simulations have included both electrical network methods and effective medium methods. During the course of the research, the studies were extended to describe electrical breakdown, specifically on how microstructural variations lead to current localization which in turn leads to a form of electrical discharge failure, a common form of failure of varistors under electrical loading...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{neutrino}} oscillations at short baselines {{contain an}} intriguing set of experimental anomalies {{that may be}} suggestive of new physics such as the existence of sterile neutrinos. This three-part thesis presents research directed towards understanding these anomalies and searching for sterile neutrino oscillations. Part I contains a theoretical discussion of neutrino coherence properties. The open-quantum-system picture of neutrino beams, which allows a rigorous prediction of coherence distances for accelerator neutrinos, is presented. Validity of the standard treatment of active and sterile neutrino oscillations at short baselines is verified and non-standard coherence loss effects at longer baselines are predicted. Part II concerns liquid argon detector development for the MicroBooNE experiment, which will search for short-baseline oscillations in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab. Topics include characterization and installation of the MicroBooNE optical system; test-stand measurements of liquid argon optical properties with dissolved impurities; optimization of wavelength-shifting coatings for liquid argon scintillation light detection; testing and deployment of high-voltage <b>surge</b> <b>arrestors</b> to protect TPC field cages; and software development for optical and TPC simulation and reconstruction. Part III presents a search for sterile neutrinos using the IceCube neutrino telescope, which has collected a large sample of atmospheric-neutrino-induced events in the 1 - 10 TeV energy range. Sterile neutrinos would modify the detected neutrino flux shape via MSW-resonant oscillations. Following a careful treatment of systematic uncertainties in the sample, no evidence for MSW-resonant oscillations is observed, and exclusion limits on 3 + 1 model parameter space are derived. Under the mixing assumptions made, the 90 % confidence level exclusion limit extends to [...] ., and the LSND and MiniBooNE allowed regions are excluded at > 99 % confidence level. by Benjamin J. P.
