25|$|Most of {{the land}} in Djibouti is desert. However, {{wildlife}} vegetation is made up of semi-desert grassland, <b>shrub</b> <b>land</b> and succulent scrub. Coastal area consists of desert and mangrove. Dry evergreen forests are in the mountains of Mount Goda in the Day National Park near Tadjoura and Mabla Mountains. On Mount Goda, near Tadjoura, there are rare giant juniper trees, acacias, and wild olive trees. However, most of the vegetation is typical of the desert and semi-desert, consisting of thorn scrubs and palm trees. 534 species of plants are recorded in the Goda and Mabla Mountains including a number of endemic species. Two species of particular interest are the Nubian tree (Dracaena ombet) and the Bankouale palm (Livistona carinensis) in the National Park. Other species reported as unique to Djibouti are: Aloe djiboutiensis, Aloe ericahenriettae, Euphorbia godana, Euphorbia amicorum, Phagnalon lavranosii, Cynoglossopsis somaliensis, Caralluma mireillae, Polygala goudahensis and Matthiola puntensis.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{effect of}} land use and land cover change (LUCC) on some soil {{physical}} and chemical properties at Ameleke micro-watershed, South Ethiopia. Satellite images of 1986, 2000 and 2006 were used to analyze LUCCs of the watershed. For the purpose of soil sampling, the watershed was divided in to three altitudinal belts, from each of which two sample sites were taken. From each sample site, composite soil samples were collected from agroforestry, crop land, grass <b>land</b> and <b>shrub</b> <b>lands</b> in three replications at 0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm depth and selected soil {{physical and chemical properties}} were analyzed. The result of the land use/cover analyses showed that agroforestry and crop lands occupy larger part of the upland while grass and <b>shrub</b> <b>lands</b> occupy larger part of the middle and lower altitude of the watershed. The change detection study revealed that from 1986 to 2006, crop land area increased from 23. 3 % to 31. 0 %; grass lands decreased from 25. 9 % to 14. 96 % and <b>shrub</b> <b>lands</b> decreased from 30. 3 % to 24. 25 %. Analyses of soil properties reveal that significant differences (p < 0. 05) in soil available K, TN, OC, OM, available P and soil texture and insignificant differences in soil pH and CEC among land use and land cover types. The difference in soil properties among land use and land covers is highly significant at 0 - 15 cm depth than at 15 - 30 cm depth. This study recommends assessment {{of land use}} and land covers at homestead level and sharing experiences for expansion of agro forestry type of land us...|$|R
