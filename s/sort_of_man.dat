5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the most}} zealous and untiring fieldsman I ever saw, the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who, if {{standing}} or fretting at deep square-leg, might be relied upon to back up cover-point on an emergency. Who that has experienced it will ever forget the sound, as of a mighty rushing steam-engine behind him, as he went to fetch a fourer when Inglis was on the war-path! His activity in very sooth covered not only much ground, but a multitude of other people's sins.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{engagement}} to Artie, Betty and Joe fall in love. When Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe and Betty's names on it, she telephones Betty and insinuates the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> that Joe really is. Overhearing, Joe invites Betty {{to come see}} for herself. When she arrives, Joe feigns satisfaction with {{his life as a}} kept man, but after Betty tearfully leaves, he packs to return to his old newspaper job. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him. He bluntly informs her that the public has forgotten her, there will be no comeback, and her fan letters are written by Max. As Joe walks away, Norma shoots him three times. He falls into the pool, ending the flashback.|$|E

"He {{talked with}} his attendants, as I suppose, upon the strange superficiality and {{unreasonableness}} <b>of</b> (<b>man)</b> {{who lives on}} the mere surface of a world, a creature of waves and winds, and all the chances of space, who cannot even unite to overcome the beasts that prey upon his kind, and yet who dares to invade another planet. During this aside I sat thinking, and then at his desire I told him <b>of</b> the different <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> He searched me with questions.

500|$|Savage {{was hired}} by MSNBC {{president}} Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, [...] "Is this the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who embodies the values of NBC?" [...] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage [...] "brash, passionate and smart," [...] and promised that he would provide [...] "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge." ...|$|E
500|$|The salvage court {{hearings}} {{began in}} Gibraltar on December 17, 1872, under Sir James Cochrane, {{the chief justice}} of Gibraltar. The hearing was conducted by Frederick Solly Flood, Attorney General of Gibraltar who was also Advocate-General and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty. Flood was described by a historian of the Mary Celeste affair as a man [...] "whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ", and as [...] "...the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who, once he had {{made up his mind}} about something, couldn't be shifted." [...] The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed, a belief picked up by the New York Shipping and Commercial List on December 21: [...] "The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere, and that alcohol is at the bottom of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E

500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Mantle played Maynard in Ben Bolt's TV movie, Second Nature, which starred Alec Baldwin in {{the leading}} role, and {{appeared}} in the first episode of the series Fortysomething. He portrayed Percy, described as a [...] "big, bashful Northern mill-worker who lives with his mum", in Patrick Sanford's stage production of Rattle of a Simple Man at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold, Flintshire. Gail Cooper of the Western Mail praised his performance and said: Mantle, better known as dishy and confident consultant Mike Barrett in Casualty, is cast completely against type as Percy, the 42-year-old virgin who admits to being only 35. His body language is superb: awkward, self-effacing, obsessively tidy – Coronation Street fans should think Roy Cropper {{if they want to}} imagine the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Percy is. In 2003, Mantle began filming The Bingo Club, one of five specially commissioned one-hour plays which were screened in January 2004 on BBC1. Co-starring Paula Wilcox and John McArdle, The Bingo Tales relates the story of three women facing romantic hardship and growing old. During production, Mantle fell on his face while shooting a fencing scene and was rushed to Selly Oak Hospital with a ruptured ligament in his leg.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, [...] "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity." [...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{has what}} scholar Cora Kaplan {{labelled}} in 2002 a [...] "curious" [...] legacy that {{has evolved over}} time: [...] "for an author-activist adept in many genres... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing". After the devastating effect of Godwin's Memoirs, Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the [...] "freakish" [...] Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a [...] "moral lesson" [...] to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.) One writer who never mentioned Wollstonecraft by name, but whose novels often contain allusions to her was Jane Austen. The American scholar Anne Mellor noted as example that the character of Wickham in Pride and Prejudice seems to be based upon the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> that Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce while the sarcastic remarks that Elizabeth Bennet makes about [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in the same novel closely echo Wollstonecraft's condemnation of [...] "female accomplishments" [...] in A Vindication of the Rights of Women; the balance between a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft had recommended in her novel Mary; the moral equivalence that Austen drew between slavery and the treatment of women in British society in Mansfield Park follows one of Wollstonecraft's favorite arguments; and presentation of Anne Eliot in Persuasion as better qualified to manage her family estate than her father also echoes a thesis of Wollstonecraft.|$|E

Known throughout ancient Greece, he was reputed to have mastered mathematics, astronomy and rhetoric; he boasted {{that he could}} speak on any subject at Olympia without preparation. [...] Plato presents him as setting himself up as an expert on Homeric criticism, and over-reaching his expertise. Hippias is exactly the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> Socrates complains about in the Apology, a man who develops expertise {{in one or more}} areas, and then imagines he knows everything.|$|E

Fadiman added [...] "it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao's reputation — as, for example Ted Kennedy's fudged Spanish exam at Harvard University tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this was the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules." ...|$|E
