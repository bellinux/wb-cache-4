5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982, Aloi and Ringler {{conducted}} a mark and recapture study in the patch of watercress where the <b>snails</b> appeared most densely. Using two methods (Jolly and Schnabel) and two models, they estimated {{a population of about}} 300 <b>snails</b> with a density of four <b>snails</b> per square meter of watercress habitat. These <b>snails</b> have subsequently been identified as Succinea sp. B, not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. A 1983 collection of 83 <b>snails</b> for use in electrophoretic studies resulted in removal of 24 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from the population; unfortunately, their identity was not verified at the time of collection, on top of which Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was thought to be more abundant than it actually was. The population of Succinea sp. B expanded rapidly to an estimate of more than 3,000 <b>snails</b> in 1984, whereas counts of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 1984 indicated the presence of approximately 100 adults. Counts of live Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from 1995 to 2001 yielded an average of five adults per survey with a high of 12 adults in 2001. and post-reproductive shell counts made {{at the end of each}} activity season from 1987 to 2001 generally identified 4 to 20 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis adults.

5|$|The <b>snails</b> mate from May through July, and {{lay eggs}} from June through July. They are hermaphroditic; however, {{it is unclear}} if self-fertilization is possible.

Generally, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not {{found to have a}} heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster, which is associated with egg masses of Succinea sp. B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. The young <b>snails</b> hatch in 2 to 3 weeks, measuring barely 2mm. It is still unclear when the <b>snails</b> mature, although Grimm (1981) believes they reach maturity in five to eight months, or the spring following hatching.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor <b>SNAIL</b> 1 {{is a master}} regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. <b>SNAIL</b> 1 is a very unstable protein, and its levels are regulated by the E 3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP 1 that interacts with <b>SNAIL</b> 1 upon its phosphorylation by GSK- 3 β. Here we show that <b>SNAIL</b> 1 polyubiquitylation and degradation may occur in conditions precluding <b>SNAIL</b> 1 phosphorylation by GSK- 3 β, suggesting that additional E 3 ligases participate in the control of <b>SNAIL</b> 1 protein stability. In particular, we demonstrate that the F-box E 3 ubiquitin ligase FBXl 14 interacts with <b>SNAIL</b> 1 and promotes its ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation independently of phosphorylation by GSK- 3 β. In vivo, inhibition of FBXl 14 using short hairpin RNA stabilizes both ectopically expressed and endogenous <b>SNAIL</b> 1. Moreover, the expression of FBXl 14 is potently down-regulated during hypoxia, a condition that increases the levels of <b>SNAIL</b> 1 protein but not <b>SNAIL</b> 1 mRNA.

40|$|Background: While <b>Snail</b> is a zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor that triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, {{it has also}} been reported to be indirectly regulated by estrogen receptor a (ERa) and {{to be involved in the}} transcriptional repression of the aromatase gene. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of <b>Snail</b> expression in node-negative invasive ductal carcinomas. Methods: We analyzed <b>Snail</b> mRNA expression levels in 86 node-negative invasive ductal carcinomas by real-time quantitative RT–PCR and studied whether <b>Snail</b> mRNA expression correlates with clinicopathological factors. Results: No correlation was found between <b>Snail</b> mRNA expression and ERa protein expression levels. However, we observed that none of the 34 patients showing low <b>Snail</b> mRNA expression developed distant metastasis while 6 of 52 (12 %) showing high expression of <b>Snail</b> mRNA did. The level of <b>Snail</b> mRNA expression was not found to be significantly correlated with clinico-pathological factors.
