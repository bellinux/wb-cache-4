5|$|Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park, {{which is}} located at the lower extreme of <b>Sulphur</b> Creek, {{supports}} far more native species than the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek watershed (see Wildlife of Aliso Creek for detail).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sulphur</b> Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into <b>Sulphur</b> Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of <b>Sulphur</b> Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. <b>Sulphur</b> Creek is located in a crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sulphur</b> Creek Reservoir is {{the primary}} {{recreational}} facility in the watershed and {{is said to be}} one of the largest fisheries of Southern Orange County. The lake is annually stocked with bluegill, catfish, and bass. Aside from the reservoir, there is no body of water in the watershed that is navigable. There are several other parks in the watershed; these are Crown Valley Park, <b>Sulphur</b> Creek Park, and others. A paved trail follows <b>Sulphur</b> Creek from near the terminus of Crown Valley Park to near its mouth at Alicia Parkway.|$|E
5|$|Cask {{conditioned}} Stones used Challenger hops, and was dry hopped with English Goldings. It {{was described}} as having an aroma of hops, <b>sulphur</b> and grapefruit, with a salty, moreish and zesty taste.|$|E
5|$|Drax has opted {{in to the}} Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) {{and thus}} is {{permitted}} to continue operating beyond 2015. The use of flue gas desulfurisation ensures that the limits on <b>sulphur</b> dioxide emissions are not exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in <b>Sulphur</b> Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century. These floods wiped out many of the remaining riparian areas lining waterways in the watershed. Despite the massive environmental degradation in the <b>Sulphur</b> Creek watershed, it is not biologically dead, yet and still supports some native species. Work is under way in the watershed to remove non-native species and restore native riparian vegetation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{too many}} horses and mules died of {{diseases}} or old age {{before they even}} reached the battlefield and the army ordered an inquiry. In 1917, Vizzini was sentenced to 20 years in first instance for fraud, corruption and murder, but he was absolved thanks to powerful friends who exonerated him. He made his fortune {{on the black market}} during World War I, and expanded his activities to the <b>sulphur</b> mines. As a representative of a consortium of <b>sulphur</b> mine operators, Vizzini participated in high-level meetings in Rome and London concerning government subsidies and tariffs, next to such men as Guido Donegani of Montecatini chemical industries and , Finance minister during Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (<b>Sulphur</b> Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the <b>Sulphur</b> Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at <b>Sulphur</b> Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southwest}} of Aliso Creek, <b>Sulphur</b> Creek historically lay in {{the territory of the}} Acjachemen Indian group, whose main population center was actually farther south, at the confluence of San Juan and Trabuco creeks.|$|E
5|$|Long {{took the}} lead in {{preparing}} the explosives, telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The bombs were made from cannon shot, carbon, <b>sulphur</b> and saltpeter, which were then wrapped together.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sulphur</b> Creek {{watershed}} includes {{parts of}} Laguna Niguel Regional Park and Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park. Despite its heavy pollution and increasing population of exotic species, {{for much of}} its length the creek is a riparian corridor.|$|E
5|$|The {{back cover}} and inside sleeve by Paul Postle depict <b>sulphur</b> fields in Iceland, {{where much of}} the album was recorded. Postle also took photos of the band rehearsing for the gatefold.|$|E
5|$|This uplift {{changed the}} course of <b>Sulphur</b> Creek to run north to Aliso Creek, instead of flowing south to Salt Creek (see Watershed).|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or <b>sulphur</b> as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme <b>sulphur</b> covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the <b>sulphur</b> of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Sulphur</b> Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While <b>Sulphur</b> Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
5|$|After {{being hired}} by {{a law firm}} in Granby, Colorado, Roberts {{returned}} to school to earn a J.D. from the University of Colorado in 1986. She worked as an attorney {{in private practice in}} Granby and Hot <b>Sulphur</b> Springs, specializing in estate, probate and business law.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2006, the Nashville Sounds {{had planned to}} leave Herschel Greer Stadium for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms {{on a plan to}} finance its construction. Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep it close to Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about {{the construction of a new}} ballpark—later called First Tennessee Park—were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm Populous as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the Cumberland River, the North Gulch area, and <b>Sulphur</b> Dell. <b>Sulphur</b> Dell, the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised <b>sulphur</b> in the fuel, as he believed, then removing <b>sulphur</b> in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{defeat for}} Congress, Mount ruled out another {{campaign}} for the House seat, {{but she said she}} may later seek another statewide office.When Mount left the Senate in 2012, she was succeeded by a Democrat-turned-Republican, former State Representative Ronnie Johns of <b>Sulphur,</b> who ran unopposed for the open seat.|$|E
5|$|Java is a {{relatively}} small island compared to Sumatra, {{but it has a}} higher concentration of active volcanoes. There are 45 active volcanoes on the island excluding 20 small craters and cones in the Dieng volcanic complex and the young cones in the Tengger caldera complex. Some volcanoes are grouped together in the list below because of their close location. Mount Merapi, Semeru and Kelud are the most active volcanoes in Java. Mount Semeru has been continuously erupting since 1967. Mount Merapi has been named as one of the Decade Volcanoes since 1995. Ijen has a unique colourful caldera lake which is an extremely acidic natural reservoir (pH<0.3). There are <b>sulphur</b> mining activities at Ijen, where miners collect highly concentrated <b>sulphur</b> rocks by hand.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{building}} and its materials have started showing signs of damage and discolouration due to the air pollution. The pollutants such as <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and other emissions, have already affected the white marble of the nearby Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort Complex.|$|E
5|$|More skirmishes were fought at Bonsack and Mountain Cove, Virginia. The retreat route {{took the}} army through the {{communities}} of Salem, New Castle, and White <b>Sulphur</b> Springs. The army reached Charleston on July 1. Total losses were 940. For the 2nd West Virginia, the loss was 13 killed (4 near Salem, Virginia), 33 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the trails}} in the {{watershed}} are biking and equestrian trails {{located in the}} lower portion of the watershed, in the immensely popular Aliso Canyon and its tributary, Wood Canyon. Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail, the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek (Wood Canyon Creek). There is also a bikeway along <b>Sulphur</b> Creek and along parts of English Canyon.|$|E
5|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Kolkata. , <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and {{nitrogen}} dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter levels were high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Several tributaries of Aliso Creek—the Dairy Fork, Aliso Hills Channel, Munger Creek, {{and other}} smaller ones—have been {{replaced}} by storm drains. Wood Canyon Creek remains much like its original condition, despite degradation due to polluted water. <b>Sulphur</b> Creek has been channelized and diverted into culverts in several stretches, and English Canyon Creek has received some riprap stabilization and bank protection.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper <b>Sulphur</b> Creek (<b>Sulphur</b> Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and <b>sulphur</b> {{can establish}} avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and breeding grounds. Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that {{are incorporated into}} inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or blood.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of <b>sulphur</b> gases formed aerosols such as <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} ash {{has been found to}} be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% <b>sulphur.</b>|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and <b>sulphur.</b> (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the <b>sulphur</b> bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>sulphur</b> emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Willie Landry Mount (born August 25, 1949) is an American {{politician}} from Louisiana {{who served}} as a Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate from 2000 to 2012. She represented District 27, which includes parts of her native Lake Charles and the surrounding cities of <b>Sulphur</b> and Westlake. From 1993 to 1999, Mount was the first female to have served as the mayor of Lake Charles.|$|E
5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and <b>Sulphur</b> Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its <b>sulphur</b> yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
