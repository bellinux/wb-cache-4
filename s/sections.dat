5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half <b>sections</b> {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter <b>sections</b> only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter <b>sections</b> had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type <b>sections</b> is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half <b>sections,</b> while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
