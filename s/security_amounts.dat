60|$|Let us examine {{into the}} value of this {{security}} upon the principles of those who are more sober,--of those who think, indeed, the French Constitution better, or at least as good as the British, without going to all the lengths of the warmer politicians in reprobating their own. Their <b>security</b> <b>amounts</b> in reality to nothing more than this,--that the difference between their republican system and the British limited monarchy is not worth a civil war. This opinion, I admit, will prevent people not very enterprising in their nature from an active undertaking against the British Constitution. But it is the poorest defensive principle that ever was infused into the mind of man against the attempts of those who will enterprise. It will tend totally to remove from their minds that very terror of a civil war which is held out as our sole security. They who think so well of the French Constitution certainly will not be the persons to carry on a war to prevent their obtaining a great benefit, or at worst a fair exchange. They will not go to battle in favor of a cause in which their defeat might be more advantageous to the public than their victory. They must at least tacitly abet those who endeavor to make converts to a sound opinion; they must discountenance those who would oppose its propagation. In proportion as by these means the enterprising party is strengthened, the dread of a struggle is lessened. See what an encouragement this is to the enemies of the Constitution! A few assassinations and a very great destruction of property we know they consider as no real obstacles {{in the way of a}} grand political change. And they will hope, that here, if antimonarchical opinions gain ground as they have done in France, they may, as in France, accomplish a revolution without a war.|$|E
50|$|This {{assessment}} {{results in}} a determination of whether the privilege of self-insurance can be granted and what security is necessary. The security {{may be in the}} form of a bond from a licensed surety company, certificate of deposit, United States government obligations, letter of credit or cash, in the minimum amount of $750,000. Most <b>security</b> <b>amounts</b> are considerably higher than the minimum. The employer may also be required to carry excess coverage. If the applicant is a subsidiary of a larger corporation, a parental guarantee will usually be required. The Commission requires that even if self-insurance is subsequently surrendered or revoked, the security must remain in place to cover all outstanding liability for the period of self-insurance.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce IP (Intellectual Property) {{infringements}} in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration), many IP protection methods have been proposed. These methods have involved knowledge in fields of microelectronics, information hiding and embedded system. As a new field, IP protection can greatly reduce ownership misappropriation but it is faced with numerous challenges. On the basis of existing fundamental theories and engineering technologies, IP protection has rapidly developed in recent years. This study introduced IP protection in terms of concepts, characteristics and architecture. The challenges of IP protection technologies were analyzed. This study focused on the latest research improvement of IP protection technologies. The difficulties of digital watermarks on overhead, <b>security,</b> <b>amounts</b> were stated concretely.

30|$|For {{individuals}} {{who have not yet}} retired by 2010 and, thus, do not report a primary insurance amount in the 2006 or 2010 waves, we use prospective social <b>security</b> <b>amounts</b> as reported in the “Prospective Social Security Wealth Measures of Pre-retirees” by Kapinos et al. (2010). These provide prospective 2004 SS wealth measures for {{individuals who}} have not yet retired as of 2004. They report measures under three different scenarios, namely that the individual retires early, at normal retirement age, or at a late retirement age. If in 2006 (2010) they are younger than 70, we assume that they will begin claiming benefits at the normal retirement age and use the prospective measure for normal retirement age. If they are older than 69 in 2006 (2010), we assume that they will begin claiming benefits at the higher rate. We convert the 2004 values into 2010 dollars to provide an SS wealth measure consistent with all the other wealth values in the paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} {{debate about the}} role of business in armed conflicts has increasingly raised expectations as to governance contributions by private corporations in the fields of conflict prevention, peace-keeping and postconflict peace-building. This political agenda seems far ahead of the research agenda, in which the negative image of business in conflicts, seen as fuelling, prolonging and taking commercial advantage of violent conflicts, still prevails. So far the scientific community has been reluctant to extend the scope of research on ‘corporate social responsibility’ to the area of security in general and to intra-state armed conflicts in particular. As a consequence, there is no basis from which systematic knowledge can be generated about the conditions {{and the extent to which}} private corporations can fulfil the role expected of them in the political discourse. The research on positive contributions of private corporations to <b>security</b> <b>amounts</b> to unconnected in-depth case studies of specific corporations in specific conflict settings. Given this state of research, we develop a framework for a comparative research agenda to address the question: Under which circumstances and to what extent can private corporations be expected to contribute to public security?...|$|E

40|$|The area of {{software}} analysis, testing and verification is now undergoing a revolution {{thanks to the}} use of automated and scalable support for logical methods. A well-recognized premise is that at the core {{of software}} analysis engines is invariably a component using logical formulas for describing states and transformations between system states. One can thus say that symbolic logic is the calculus of computation. The process of using this information for discovering and checking program properties (including such important properties as safety and <b>security)</b> <b>amounts</b> to automatic theorem proving. In particular, theorem provers that directly support common software constructs offer a compelling basis. Such provers are commonly called satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Z 3 is the leading SMT solver. It is developed by the authors at Microsoft Research. It can be used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories such as arithmetic, bit-vectors, lists, records and arrays. This paper examines three applications of Z 3 in the context of invariant generation. The first lets Z 3 infer invariants as a constraint satisfaction problem, the second application illustrates the use of Z 3 for bit-precise analysis and our third application exemplifies using Z 3 for calculations. ...|$|E

The talk describes some of the technology behind modern SMT solvers, including the solver Z 3. Z 3 is currently mainly targeted at solving problems that arise in software analysis and verification. It has been applied to various contexts, such as systems for dynamic symbolic simulation (Pex, SAGE, Vigilante), for program verification and extended static checking (Spec#/Boggie, VCC, HAVOC), for software model checking (Yogi, SLAM), model-based design (FORMULA), security protocol code (F 7), program run-time analysis and invariant generation (VS 3). We will describe how it integrates support for a variety of theories that arise naturally {{in the context of the}} applications. There are several new promising avenues and the talk will touch on some of these and the challenges related to SMT solvers. Proceeding...|$|E

This study uses micro and macro data to examine the possible consequences of this loss of wealth on the consumption behavior of households. Micro data for Austria indicate that owing to unequal distribution, it is primarily the wealthier households that have been directly affected by the crisis. However, all households may be impacted by the consequences of the financial crisis via confidence effects, irrespective of whether they hold securities or not. Estimates based on macro data show that the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth of Austrian households is 0. 05 and thus within the international average. Results of Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) simulations using a macroeconometric model indicate that a decrease in wealth has a relatively minor effect on private consumption and economic growth in Austria. Moreover, this effect only occurs with a substantial lag. Due to the historic singularity of the current financial crisis, however, above all the indirect confidence effects could be more intense than estimated. wealth effects, financial wealth, marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, saving behavior, financial crisis...|$|R
