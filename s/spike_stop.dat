40|$|AbstractCyclin B 1, the {{regulatory}} component of M phase-promoting factor (MPF), is degraded during the metaphase-anaphase transition in an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) -dependent process [1]. MPF activity is stable in eggs, and a sperm-triggered Ca 2 + signal {{is needed to}} promote cyclin degradation [2]. In frogs, a single Ca 2 + spike promotes cell cycle resumption, but, in mammals, the Ca 2 + signal is more complex, consisting {{of a series of}} <b>spikes</b> that <b>stop</b> several hours after sperm fusion [3]. Using dual imaging in mouse eggs, we have examined how the Ca 2 + signal generates cyclin B 1 destruction using destructible and nondestructible GFP-tagged constructs. APC/C activity was present in unfertilized eggs, giving cyclin B 1 a half-life of 1. 15 ± 0. 28 hr.

Fox Sports commentator John Madden opined that the Patriots should {{run out the}} clock to end regulation time.

50|$|Ben {{talks to}} one of Glory's minions, who reminds him that he is just a human body {{encasing}} Glory's god form and that upon her full rejuvenation, he will die; Ben, knowing this, states that he will do anything {{in his power to}} keep his life, even destroying the Key (whom he knows to be Dawn). The Knights of Byzantium retrieve their crazed member from the hospital, who babbles that the Key is the Slayer's sister; their General, Gregor, orders the Knights to assemble for battle. Giles, driving the RV, talks with a motion-sick Xander about Buffy's state of mind. Depressed and worried about their future plans, Buffy is comforted by Dawn until the Knights attack (to the complete surprise of everyone but Buffy, who had never told the Scoobies about her earlier encounter with the Knights). A sword through the roof nearly kills Buffy, but <b>Spike</b> <b>stops</b> it with his bare hands.

When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until <b>Spike</b> <b>stops</b> her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|R
40|$|Fertilisation in ascidians {{triggers}} {{a series of}} periodic rises in cytosolic Ca²⁺ that are essential for release from metaphase I arrest and progression through meiosis II. These sperm-triggered Ca²⁺ oscillations are switched off at exit from meiosis II. Ascidian zygotes provided the first demonstration of the positive feedback loop whereby elevated Cdk 1 activity maintained these Ca²⁺ oscillations. Since then {{it has been reported}} that Cdk 1 sensitises the type I inositol trisphosphate [Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃] receptor in somatic cells, and that sperm-triggered Ca²⁺ oscillations in mousezygotes stop because the forming pronuclei sequester phospholipase C zeta that was delivered to the egg by the fertilising sperm. Here, using enucleation, we demonstrate in ascidian eggs that Ca²⁺ <b>spiking</b> <b>stops</b> at the correct time in the absence of pronuclei. Sequestration of sperm factor is therefore not involved in terminating Ca²⁺ spiking for these eggs. Instead we found that microinjection of the Cdk 1 inhibitor p 21 blocked Ca²⁺ spiking induced by ascidian sperm extract (ASE). However, such eggs were still capable of releasing Ca²⁺ in response to Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃ receptor agonists,indicating that ASE-triggered Ca²⁺ oscillations can stop even though the response to Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃ remained elevated. These data suggest that Cdk 1 activity promotes Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃ production in the presence of the sperm factor,rather than sensitising the Ca²⁺ releasing machinery to Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃. These findings suggest a new link between this cell cycle kinase and the Ins(1, 4, 5) P₃ pathway...|$|R

25|$|Five {{plays into}} the Jets' next drive, Patriots cornerback Jason Webster forced Cotchery to fumble a 9-yard reception; Guyton {{recovered}} the fumble at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The Patriots next possession featured an entirely shotgun, no-huddle offense, with a 17-yard Cassel scramble moving the Patriots back into Jets territory. Four plays later, a 47-yard Gostkowski field goal tied the game. Starting {{from their own}} 33-yard line after the Patriots directed the kickoff to linebacker David Bowens instead of to Washington, the Jets began {{what would be a}} 14-play drive with just over 10 minutes left in the game. The Jets then moved the ball to the Patriots' 7-yard line to set up a 3rd-and-7 with 3:38 left in the game. Favre's pass intended to Cotchery fell incomplete, but Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel was called for a defensive holding penalty, giving the Jets an automatic first down from the Patriots' 3-yard line. The Jets failed to score on two straight runs, while the Patriots used two timeouts to stop the clock after each play. On the third rushing attempt, Thomas Jones scored from a yard out to give the Jets a 31–24 lead with 3:10 left in the game. Cassel was sacked on second down of the Patriots' next drive, forcing them to punt on three-and-out but not having to use their timeout until the Jets' next possession, when they used it in conjunction with the two-minute warning to get the ball back with 1:04 left in the game after a Jets punt. Starting from their own 38-yard line, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 42-yard line on two Cassel completions; a <b>spike</b> <b>stopped</b> the clock at :36. A 17-yard Welker catch and another spike then put the Patriots at the Jets' 25-yard line with :23 left. A Koppen false start moved the Patriots back 5 yards, but a 14-yard Welker catch and another spike put the Patriots on the Jets' 16-yard line with 8 seconds to go. On the ensuing play, Moss was covered by former Patriots cornerback Ty Law, who returned to the Jets for a second stint with the team just days earlier after sitting out the first 10 weeks of the season. As Cassel eluded a pass rusher and moved into the flat, Moss looked for the pass from the near corner of the end zone. Cassel threw to Moss, who caught the pass just beyond the near pylon and fell out of bounds, giving the Patriots a 16-yard touchdown with 1 second remaining in the game. A booth review was called but determined Moss did indeed have possession and the necessary footing before he fell out of bounds, upholding the touchdown call and sending the game into overtime after the extra point.|$|R

40|$|SummaryVocal communicators such {{as humans}} and songbirds readily {{recognize}} individual vocalizations, even in distracting auditory environments. This perceptual ability is likely subserved by auditory neurons whose spiking responses to individual vocalizations are minimally affected by background sounds. However, auditory neurons that produce background-invariant responses to vocalizations in auditory scenes {{have not been}} found. Here, we describe a population of neurons in the zebra finch auditory cortex that represent vocalizations with a sparse code and that maintain their vocalization-like firing patterns in levels of background sound that permit behavioral recognition. These same neurons decrease or <b>stop</b> <b>spiking</b> in levels of background sound that preclude behavioral recognition. In contrast, upstream neurons represent vocalizations with dense and background-corrupted responses. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that sparse coding is mediated by feedforward suppression. Finally, we show through simulations that feedforward inhibition can transform a dense representation of vocalizations into a sparse and background-invariant representation...|$|R

5000|$|The weight drive used by Christiaan Huygens in {{his early}} clocks acts as a {{maintaining}} power. In this layout, the weight which drives the clock is carried on a pulley and the cord (or chain) supporting the weight is wrapped around another pulley which has spikes which allow the cord to turn the pulley without slipping. It is this pulley which turns the train of gears in the clock movement. The cord is kept in engagement with this pulley by a small tensioning weight which is also carried on its own pulley. The cord is endless and is looped over a fourth pulley before {{going back to the}} drive weight. The fourth pulley also has <b>spikes</b> to <b>stop</b> the cord slipping and has a ratchet that only allows it to turn in one direction. As the drive weight descends and turns the clock, the tensioning weight rises. When the drive weight needs to be re-wound, either the fourth pulley is turned directly to lift the weight or the cord supporting the tensioning weight is pulled down and draws the fourth pulley round with it. [...] The principle was later applied by the French clockmaker Robert Robin who automated the re-winding in his remontoire. The drive- and tensioning-weights were made much smaller and drove the escape wheel directly. It was re-wound by the main train of the clock which turned the fourth pulley and was controlled by a lever attached to the tensioning weight. When this had risen to its upper limit, it started the re-winding process. As the drive weight rose, the tensioning weight fell and at the bottom of its travel it stopped the re-winding.|$|R

40|$|We study a {{stochastic}} process describing the continuous time {{evolution of the}} membrane potentials of finite system of neurons {{in the absence of}} external stimuli. The values of the membrane potentials evolve under the effect of chemical synapses, electrical synapses and a leak current. The evolution of the process can be informally described as follows. Each neuron spikes randomly following a point process with rate depending on its membrane potential. When a neuron spikes, its membrane potential is immediately reset to a resting value. Simultaneously, the membrane potential of the neurons which are influenced by it receive an additional positive value. Furthermore, between consecutive spikes, the system follows a deterministic motion due both to electrical synapses and the leak current. Electrical synapses push the system towards its average potential, while the leak current attracts the membrane potential of each neuron to the resting value. We show that in the absence leakage the process converges exponentially fast to an unique invariant measure, whenever the initial configuration is non null. More interesting, when leakage is present, we proved the system <b>stops</b> <b>spiking</b> after a finite amount of time almost surely.

Realizing that Junior is the main threat to them, Spike, under orders from Mike, injures him by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, which even Kevin considers disgraceful, unsportsmanlike conduct. Witnessing from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns in tandem with overcoming personal problems, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or another one running towards the goal line when his little-seen dad has come to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21 all, the Giants make a goal line stand and <b>stop</b> <b>Spike.</b> With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls [...] "The Annexation of Puerto Rico," [...] inspired by one of Madden's plays at Super Bowl XI. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting [...] "Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!" [...] The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the hook and lateral from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.|$|R

Many interesting currents have been demonstrated by voltage clamping isolated lymphatic smooth muscle cells, but until now the role of these currents in the intact syncitium has not been studied. Methods and Results: Intracellular microelectrode recordings were made from smooth muscle of sheep mesenteric lymphatics to investigate the electrophysiological basis of lymphatic pumping. Approximately 50 % of the vessels exhibited spontaneous electrical activity, varying from regular oscillations in membrane potential to spike complexes. Spike complexes generally consisted {{of one or more}} action potentials superimposed on a slower depolarization or ‘plateau’ phase and were often preceded by a slow diastolic depolarization or ‘pre-potential’. Norepinephrine (5 μM) induced depolarizing events in quiescent preparations. Both agonist-induced oscillations and spike complexes were attenuated or completely abolished by 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 -APB); 10 – 100 μM). Cesium (1 mM) reduced the frequency of spontaneous firing by approximately 30 % by flattening the pre-potential phase. In addition to having a negative inotropic effect, 10 mM Cs+ also caused gradual membrane depolarization and prolonged the plateau. 1 μM nifedipine abolished spontaneous events while tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0. 5 – 1 μM) decreased the amplitude and maximum dV/dt of the <b>spike</b> upstroke or <b>stopped</b> activity completely. Spontaneously active segments of lymphatic vessel were inhibited by the chloride channel blocker, anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid (9 -AC; 250 μM 1 mM) suggesting that ICl(Ca) plays {{a significant role in the}} generation of spontaneous activity in this tissue. Penitrem-A (0. 1 μM) did not affect resting membrane potential but increased action potential amplitude and prolonged the plateau, suggesting that calcium-activated potassium current does not make a significant contribution to resting membrane conductance but is important in membrane repolarization following calcium influx during the action potential. In contrast 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP; 5 μM) caused significant membrane depolarization, suggesting the existence of an active 4 -AP-sensitive current at rest. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the currents found in isolated voltage-clamped cells from sheep mesenteric lymphatics do play a significant role in the shaping of spontaneous electrical activity of the intact syncitium.
