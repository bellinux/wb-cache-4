The team's average home {{attendance}} was 55,848 people during the season, slightly lower than in 1946 but <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in either the AAFC or NFL. Including away games, a total of 666,017 people saw the Browns play, a professional football record. Although the team was a major success on the field, the following season was even better for Cleveland. The team won all of its games in 1948 and a third straight AAFC championship.|$|E

Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E
5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E

25|$|Croft was (along with Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Joel Garner) part of {{the potent}} West Indian quartet of fast bowlers from the late 70s and early 80s. With his height (6'5"), he bowled bouncers and was very aggressive. He was renowned for bowling wide of the crease over the wicket and angling the ball in to right-handers. His {{approach}} to the wicket was unconventional and footage of Croft bowling around the wicket show him on a run-up more typical of a left-arm bowler. Croft's figures of 8/29 against Pakistan in 1977 are <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Test innings figures by a fast bowler from the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|The step {{up in the}} {{standard}} of cricket was evident, even in the B Grade, with the club struggling against strong seasoned teams like Blackburn, Box Hill, Croydon, Doncaster, East Burwood, Ringwood & Templestowe.

One highlight was Thomas Schubert taking 9/17 against Templestowe in 1909, a club record that would stand until 1996, and <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowling figures ever at Warrandyte Reserve.

Iowa earned {{its way to the}} CWS at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha with a 13–3 Big Ten record, which is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Big Ten winning percentage in Iowa baseball history. That record included another school record that still stands, an 11-game Big Ten winning streak. It was Iowa's first outright Big Ten baseball title since 1939, and the last one since, although the Hawkeyes did earn ties for the conference championship in 1974 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade deficit}} induced Buffett {{to enter the}} foreign {{currency}} market {{for the first time}} in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a gold standard for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:Stocks are probably <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.|$|E
25|$|West Indian captain Lloyd {{retired from}} Test cricket {{at the end}} of the 1984–85 series against Australia. In total Lloyd had captained West Indies in 74 Test matches, winning 36 of them. Vivian Richards was Lloyd's successor, and {{continued}} the run of success. Meanwhile, a change of old guard was also happening. Joel Garner and Michael Holding had retired by 1987. A major find was Curtly Ambrose, who was as tall as Garner and equally effective with the ball. Courtney Walsh, who made his first appearance in 1984, bowled with an action that resembled Holding. Ian Bishop also had a similar action, and was as good a bowler till injuries interrupted his career. Patrick Patterson was faster than all the rest, but had a short career. Marshall still was the finest fast bowler in the world. But the batting was beginning to show signs of weakness, despite the presence of Richards, Greenidge and Desmond Haynes. West Indies failed to qualify for the semifinals of the 1987 World Cup. By the end of the 1980s, while <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team in the world, they had lost the aura of invincibility that they had till the middle of the decade. Finding good replacements for senior players was again becoming a problem.|$|E

25|$|In the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference, the team, bannered by 6-ft 9-in hulking import Steve Thomas with Gary David and Arwind Santos, {{entered the}} Finals {{for the first}} time in {{franchise}} history. They then faced the crowd-darlings of Philippine basketball, the Barangay Ginebra Kings. During Game 1, Ginebra took the game via a 105–96 decision. The Express came roaring back in Game 2 by plastering the Kings to a 124-90 route. Game 3 was also bagged by the Express. However, the Kings managed to tie the series in Game 4 with a 90–77 win. In Game 5, Air21 squeaked past the Kings with a 76–73 dogfight and a 3–2 advantage in the series. Needing only one game to win the series and the very first championship of the team, Air21 was prevented by a depleted lineup of the Kings due to injury, and forced a deciding Game 7 with an 80–75 victory in Game 6. And in Game 7, with all the cards in place, the two teams fought gallantly to the finish, but the more experienced Ginebra showed resiliency and defeated the Express, denying them the title. Even with the shortcoming, it was <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> showing of the team since they entered the league in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Mycroft's {{form was}} to last into the 1876 season, {{when he was}} top bowler with 62 wickets and {{achieved}} best bowling of 9–25, a record which lasted nearly fifty years before being bettered by Billy Bestwick. He played several matches for MCC, and also appeared for Players and the North. At this time {{he found himself in}} an assembled team of cricketers in several Gentlemen vs. Players matches, Mycroft's fellow Players including past and future England Test representatives Arthur Shrewsbury, George Ulyett, John Selby, Tom Emmett, and Fred Morley. In the 1877 season, Mycroft took most wickets for Derbyshire with 63 and took five wickets in an innings eight times, but did even more deadly work for the MCC with 31 wickets at the extraordinary average of 7.29, and also was deadly in one innings for England against Kent and a powerful Gloucestershire team with W.G. Grace in his prime. In 1878, Mycroft played much less outside county cricket, taking only fifteen wickets, but took a career best 101 for Derbyshire. In the 1879 season he was down to 48 wickets for the club which was <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> total. He topped the wicket tally for Derbyshire in the 1880 season with 58 and took five wickets in an innings six times.|$|E
25|$|Over her career, {{she broke}} {{a number of}} French record ranging from the mile run to the 10,000 metres. Her first {{national}} record mark came in 1985, when she ran a time of 8:52.32 minutes for the 3000 metres. She improved this to 8:50.56 the following month and broke Patricia Deneuville's French mile record a month after that (registering a time of 4:39.35 mins). In July 1986 she lopped {{three and a half}} seconds off her 3000m mark, set a time of 5:39.00 mins for the 2000m, then bettered Joëlle de Brouwer's 5000 metres record by almost twenty seconds, setting a new standard of 15:32.92 mins. Two further improvements over 3000m and 5000m came in 1988, with runs of 8:44.19 and 15:18.24 mins respectively. She also beat Christine Loiseau's record over 10,000m that year. In 1990 she ran 15:16.44 mins for the 5000m, which was to be her last national mark over that distance. Her run of 31:51.68 minutes at that year's European Championships made her the first Frenchwoman to complete the event in under 32 minutes. Although her 2000m time is <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> set by a French athlete, all her records in other events were not long-standing: her 3000m was beaten by Marie-Pierre Duros after a year, her 10,000m mark was beaten by Rosario Murcia after two years, while her 5000m was broken after four years by Farida Fatès.|$|E
