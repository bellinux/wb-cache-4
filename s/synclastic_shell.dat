40|$|INTRODUCTION Looking {{around with}} the eyes of an {{architect}} and designer one is fascinated by the blossoms of orchids; of their beautiful elegant shapes and various colors. My first intention was to compare the <b>synclastic</b> <b>shell</b> shapes of the flowers with the forms of shells 1 built in quite another size and System together with Prof Heinz Isler. After further consideration of the facts {{it became clear that}} there is a remarkable difference between the big concrete shells and the light and translucent little petals of blossoms. Blossoms are short-living hydraulic erected structures. Their task and function is to care for their propagation by pollination with the help of insects which must be enticed by colors, by a fragrant and by the shape of the blossoms. The approach to the flowers leads directly to the world of botanic life with the fantastic and fascinating systems where nature builds by growing. For further optimization of our building methods {{it is very important to}} co...|$|E
40|$|Ever since Lucio Blandini {{developed}} a doubly curved <b>synclastic</b> <b>shell</b> with adhesively bonded glass components, {{the concept of}} building a self-supporting glass-only shell has almost become within reach. In the current contribution a small-scaled experimental concept is presented of a self-supporting anticlastic all-glass shell scale model, created {{by means of an}} adaptable mould. First, different manufacturing parameters of relatively small shells are investigated, such as mould type, glass supporting system and dimensions, oven temperature and shell curvature. Next, an adjustable mould for the bending of glass is developed, built and tested. With this mould it is possible to make glass panels synclastic and anticlastic in a great variety of forms. With this new moulding technique we were able to create different prototypes. They are forming the basis an intended larger shell, composed of smaller segments. The objective is to join the latter by using fusing techniques, which result is completely transparent monolithic all-glass shells. Therefore, additional experiments have been performed to explore different variants of glass fusion techniques to be applied for double curved glass shells...|$|E
