25|$|The {{abductor}} pollicis brevis (APB) originates on the scaphoid tubercle and the flexor retinaculum. It inserts to the radial <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> and {{the proximal}} phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the median nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|A <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> is a small, round bone that, as {{the name}} suggests, is shaped like a sesame seed. These bones form in tendons (the sheaths of tissue that connect bones to muscles) where {{a great deal of}} {{pressure}} is generated in a joint. The sesamoid bones protect tendons by helping them overcome compressive forces. Sesamoid bones vary in number and placement from person to person but are typically found in tendons associated with the feet, hands, and knees. The only type of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> that is common to everybody is the kneecap (patella, pl. patellae) which is also the largest of the sesamoid bones.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> in the hand, small ossified nodes embedded in tendons; {{the exact number}} varies between people: whereas a pair of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> are found at virtually all thumb metacarpophalangeal joints, <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> are also common at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (72.9%) and at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the little finger (82.5%) and the index finger (48%). In rare cases, <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> {{have been found in}} all the metacarpophalangeal joints and all distal interphalangeal joints except that of the long finger.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{variation}} {{of the total number of}} distinct bones in the human in the literature. This difference is mainly caused by the variable existence of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones.</b> <b>Sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> at the first MTP are seen regularly. In contrast additional <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> at the divond to fifth MTP are rare. We report a case of additional <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> at every metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) of both feet. A 22 -year-old female Caucasian presented with weight-dependent pain of the divond MTP of the left foot. In the radiographs of both feet additional <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> at every MTP could be seen. This case reports a very rare variation in human anatomy. A similar case has not been displayed to the academic society and therefore should be acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{report the}} {{prevalence}} {{and distribution of}} hand <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> in Chinese ethnic group and its left-right symmetry. Methods: A retrospective study involving hand radiographs taken in patients admitted to United Christian Hospital from January 2011 to June 2014. Exclusion criteria included previous hand fracture, inadequate radiological views and those of non-Chinese ethnic group. Results: A total of 307 hand radiographs (162 left and 145 right; 181 males and 126 females) in 266 patients were reviewed. Bilateral hand radiographs were available in 41 patients. Their mean age (± standard deviation) was 48. 8  ±  11. 3 years (range, 25 – 69 years). The total number of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> identified was 1, 641. <b>Sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> were found at the first metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) {{at a rate of}} 100 %, while the prevalence at the second MCPJ, third MCPJ, fourth MCPJ, fifth MCPJ as well as the first interphalangeal joint (IPJ) was 59. 0 %, 2. 93 %, 0 %, 47. 6 % and 28. 0 %, respectively. Bilateral hand radiographs showed 100 % symmetrical distribution of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> on right and left sides. Conclusion: This is the first study in Hong Kong to report prevalence of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> in the Chinese Population and identify the symmetry of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> in bilateral hands. The result revealed that the Chinese ethnic group had a higher prevalence of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> at the 2 nd and 3 rd MCPJ when compared with other ethnic groups. The distribution of <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> was symmetrical in bilateral hands...|$|R
25|$|The {{adductor}} pollicis {{also has}} two heads. The transversal head originates {{along the entire}} third metacarpal bone, while the oblique head originates on the carpal bones proximal to the third metacarpal. The muscle is inserted onto the ulnar <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It adducts the thumb, and assists in opposition and flexion. It is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} hallucis has two heads; {{a stronger}} oblique head which {{arises from the}} cuboid and lateral cuneiform bones and the bases of {{the second and third}} metatarsals; and a transverse head which arises from the distal ends of the third-fifth metatarsals. Both heads are inserted on the lateral <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> of the first digit. The muscle acts as a tensor to the arches of the foot, but can also adduct the first digit and plantar flex its first phalanx.|$|E
25|$|The flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) has two heads. The {{superficial}} head arises on the flexor retinaculum, {{while the}} deep head originates on three carpal bones: the trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. The muscle is inserted onto the radial <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It acts to flex, adduct, and abduct the thumb, {{and is therefore}} also able to oppose the thumb. The superficial head is innervated by the median nerve, while the deep head is innervated by the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).|$|E

25|$|The {{abductor}} hallucis stretches {{along the}} medial {{edge of the}} foot, from the calcaneus {{to the base of}} the first phalanx of the first digit and the medial <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone.</b> It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. Lateral to the abductor hallucis is the flexor hallucis brevis, which originates from the medial cuneiform bone and from the tendon of the tibialis posterior. The flexor hallucis has a medial and a lateral head inserted laterally to the abductor hallucis. It is an important plantar flexor which comes into prominent use in classical ballet (i.e. for pointe work).|$|E
25|$|The major {{bones of}} the leg are the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and {{adjacent}} fibula, and these are all long bones. The patella (kneecap) is the <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> {{in front of the}} knee. Most of the leg skeleton has bony prominences and margins that can be palpated and some serve as anatomical landmarks that define the extent of the leg. These landmarks are the anterior superior iliac spine, the greater trochanter, the superior margin of the medial condyle of tibia, and the medial malleolus. Notable exceptions to palpation are the hip joint, and the neck and body, or shaft of the femur.|$|E
500|$|Proboscideans {{experienced}} several evolutionary trends, such as {{an increase}} in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to [...] tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed {{to allow them to}} survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males.|$|E

2500|$|On August 8 at Saratoga Race Course, Carry Back {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in a specially arranged training match against the 1963 Kentucky Derby winner Chateaugay. Although Carry Back was beaten five lengths, Price claimed that he was [...] "not too disappointed" [...] by the performance. In his first competitive race, he finished second to Gushing Wind in the Buckeye Handicap at Randall Park two weeks later. The comeback appeared to have ended shortly afterwards when Carry Back sustained an injury (described as [...] "a chip in the <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> of his left ankle") when warming up for the Washington Handicap at Arlington Park. Price announced that the horse would be returned to stud but X-rays revealed that the injury was much less serious than first thought.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{bones are}} {{characterized}} by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width; and by an epiphysis, a rounded head {{at each end of}} the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones. [...] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> of the kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified long bones.|$|E

40|$|Normal and {{abnormal}} ultrasonographic {{images are}} presented of the proximal scutum (proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and palmar ligament) in the horse. Comparison between anatomical sections, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and ultrasound scans enabled the authors {{to establish the}} normal ultrasonographic anatomy of the palmar fetlock. Nine cases of proximal scutum injuries were identified ultrasonographically, of which 4 are illustrated. On normal limbs, the facies flexoria of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> appeared as a thin and regular hyperechoic line and the palmar ligament was regularly echogenic. Lesions of the proximal scutum, that could be documented ultrasonographically, included rupture of the palmar ligament, avulsion fractures of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and palmar ligament desmopathy. Thinning or degeneration of the palmar ligament, concurrent with osteolysis of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones,</b> were indicative of palmar ligament enthesopathy.

Kiedis has been battling through foot injuries since 2006 when he injured his foot onstage and finally was able to have surgery during a break in the band's tour in January 2012. During the surgery, Kiedis had a crushed <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bone</b> removed and a detached flexor tendon repaired. The band was able to resume their tour and kicked off the U.S. leg on March 29, 2012.

40|$|Background: Axial osteitis of the {{proximal}} <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament {{has been described}} in Friesian horses {{as well as in}} other breeds. The objectives of this study were to review the outcome of clinical cases of this disease in Friesian horses and analyse the pathology of the bone-ligament interface. Case records of Friesian horses diagnosed with axial osteitis of {{the proximal}} <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the period 2002 - 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Post-mortem examination was performed on horses that were euthanized (n = 3) and included macroscopic necropsy (n = 3), high-field (9. 4 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (n = 1) and histopathology (n = 2). Results: Twelve horses were included, aged 6. 8 +/- 2. 7 years. The hindlimb was involved in all cases. Lameness was acute in onset and severe, with a mean duration of 1. 9 +/- 1. 0 months. Three horses were euthanized after diagnosis; 9 horses underwent treatment. Two horses (22 %) became sound for light riding purposes, 2 horses (22 %) became pasture sound (comfortable at pasture, but not suitable for riding), 5 horses (56 %) remained lame. In addition to bone resorption at the proximo-axial margin of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones,</b> magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology showed osteoporosis of the peripheral compact bone and spongious bone of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and chronic inflammation of the intersesamoidean ligament. Conclusions: Axial osteitis of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones</b> and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the hindlimb of Friesian horses carries a poor prognosis. Pathological characterization (inflammation, proximo-axial bone resorption and remodelling of the peripheral compact bone and spongious bone of the proximal <b>sesamoid</b> <b>bones)</b> may help in unravelling the aetiology of this disease...|$|R
