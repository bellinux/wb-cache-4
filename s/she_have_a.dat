5|$|Amy starts {{working for}} Leyla and {{develops}} feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain {{and tries to}} make David jealous. When Alicia steals £500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek {{to thank him for}} his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her. When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her happiness is short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and clears the bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E
25|$|Ahurani(s) are not {{included}} in any list of yazatas, nor do they/does <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> day-name dedication in the Zoroastrian calendar. This may be because in later Zoroastrianism Aredvi Sura Anahita dominates as divinity of the waters, and it is to her that the hymn to the waters (the Aban Yasht) is dedicated.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July, {{after several}} BWCC inmates and staff {{expressed}} concerns about Anna's welfare, the prison's psychologist recommended that <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric evaluation, {{so that her}} mental health could be assessed. One week later, on 6 August, a BWCC officer also asked for an evaluation, to determine whether Anna could {{be placed in the}} community, rather than remain in the prison. Eventually, on 10 August, the prison psychiatrist recommended that she be taken to a hospital for a full assessment, to determine her mental health. Her report noted that Anna's behaviour was unusual, and she had poor hygiene and would behave inappropriately towards the guards, particularly the male ones. Anna was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane on 20 August, where doctors spent six days assessing her. She was returned to BWCC on 26 August, after doctors failed to diagnose her schizophrenia.|$|E

25|$|Matters are {{complicated}} further {{with the arrival}} of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and the secret daughter of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (though Jessica herself is unaware of her parentage). Jessica is presented to Leto as a gift from the Bene Gesserit, although the sisterhood has the ulterior motive of using the pair in their breeding program. At first, Leto refuses to {{have much to do with}} Jessica and tries to remain faithful to Kailea. However, as he and Kailea grow farther apart, he begins to seek out Jessica's company. Finally, Kailea is driven to make an attempt on Leto's life by having an explosive device planted on his skyclipper. At the last minute, Leto decides to take Victor and Rhombur along with him, and the boy dies instead. Leto is relatively unharmed, but Rhombur is reduced to little more than a charred lump of flesh. Fearing that Leto will guess that she is responsible for the death of their son and driven by guilt, Kailea kills her lady-in-waiting and then commits suicide by jumping out a window. The Tleilaxu offer to grow a ghola of Leto's deceased son in exchange for the barely alive body of Rhombur Vernius. Leto ultimately refuses, after much soul-searching, knowing that the Tleilaxu intend only harm towards House Vernius. Instead, Leto hires Dr. Wellington Yueh, an expert in the field of cybernetics, to fashion a cybernetic replacement body for Rhombur. Leto and Jessica fall deeply in love, leading Jessica to decide to conceive a son for Leto's sake, directly disobeying the Bene Gesserit's order that <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> daughter.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} song was mostly positive. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commended the balladry on Talk That Talk, paying particular attention to [...] "Fool in Love" [...] and [...] "Farewell", writing [...] "anyone questioning her motives need only hear ballads 'Farewell' and 'Fool in Love' to find out not only does <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heart, but she's without doubt been putting all of it into these past six years." [...] Robert Everett-Green for The Globe and Mail praised the song, writing [...] "Fool in Love rings down the curtain with a towering anthem that somehow squeezes fresh feeling from a tired lyrical concept." [...] Katherine St Asaph for Popdust emoted a mixed response to [...] "Fool in Love", giving the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five and writing that it is [...] "so-bad-it's-good". St Aspash praised [...] "Fool in Love" [...] composition and musical influences, but criticized the song as not providing [...] "dynamic variety" [...] amongst Talk That Talk material.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning complimented 30 Rock for Jack's {{search of}} his father plot, writing that they took it and [...] "rolled forward with energy and smarts and delivered one of the funnier episodes from the past several weeks." [...] Canning said that the other stories were [...] "also very fun", and having been a critic to Jane Krakowski's Jenna, Canning said that her appearance in [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was [...] "effectively funny without overdoing her self-centeredness." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 9.1 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote {{that this was a}} [...] "very funny episode, boosted by the ingenious casting of Alan Alda" [...] as Jack's biological father. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised 30 Rock for delivering [...] "comically" [...] with this episode, and observing there were good elements in it. Rabin opined that the casting of Alda as Jack's father was [...] "inspired", and gave [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] an A− grade rating. Entertainment Weekly contributor Aly Semigran was complimentary towards the episode, and appreciated the guest appearances from Alda and Steve Buscemi. Bruce Fretts for TV Guide Magazine said that [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was [...] "strong", and cited that it had [...] "quotable inside-TV digs... an instant chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda... and an infectious rendition of 'It Takes Two' by Liz and Pete." [...] Mike Moody of AOL's TV Squad hoped that [...] "someone on the show figure out" [...] {{what to do with the}} Jenna character, and suggested that <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> love interest [...] "that makes her mature or... makes her move away" [...] because Jenna's [...] "vacuous, selfish aging diva routine has gotten old already." [...] Moody, however, said that the best part of Tracy's story was the karate showdown between Donald and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz).|$|E

2500|$|The stage {{adaptation}} was Mailer's second [...] {{into the}} theater behind the adaptation of The Deer Park. The play takes its title from an FBI code name for Monroe.

[...] Mailer sees the fictional Monroe character in the play as [...] "having an immensely dialectical mind; no sooner does <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> thought, than she comes on its opposite. That's the way life presents itself to her - in contrasts and sudden shifts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{highlighted}} Davis's {{ability to}} shape her future artistic ventures, {{as not only}} did <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant role in influencing the decisions over her co-stars, the choice of director was predicated on a {{need to have a}} compliant individual at the helm. Davis previously had worked with Irving Rapper on films where he served as a dialogue director, but his gratitude for her support turned into a grudging realization that Davis could control the film. Although his approach was conciliatory, the to-and-fro with Davis slowed production and [...] "he would go home evenings angry and exhausted". The dailies, however, showed a [...] "surprisingly effective" [...] Davis {{at the top of her}} form.|$|E
