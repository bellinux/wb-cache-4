From this available information {{it was determined that}} Odontocyclops lack denary teeth, but do contain a lateral dentary shelf. The presence of the lateral dentary shelf combined with the quadrates being similar in morphology to other dicynodonts suggest that Odontocyclops used a propalinal <b>sliding</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanism.|$|R

It was found that EMG energy, an indicator of muscular effort expended, was 4. 7 times higher with the eye-level buttons for all three muscle groups. Ergonomic and safety engineering practices occasionally {{appear to be in}} conflict in the design of a safe and healthful workplace. Al-though the safety of the operator is of paramount importance, the design of an "ul-trasafe " workplace might require postures and motions that could have unfavorable long-term health consequences. For example, sheet metal fabrication requires a multitude of various size stamping and weld presses that must be equipped with guards or devices to assure operator safety. Some operations can be safeguarded with fixed barrier guards and <b>slide</b> <b>feeds.</b> However, as the metal-forming process continues through a press line, it becomes increasingly more difficult to design feed systems to assure proper place-ment of part to fixture. When operators must use their hands or a hand tool to orient parts directly on the dies, other means of safe-guarding must be employed.

LPB can provide deep compression for improved surface characteristics. The study focuses on the surface roughness, micro-hardness and surface integrity aspects on soft AISI 420 STAVAX ESR martensitic stainless steel AISI 420 material. This material is pronounced as difficult to cut materials like titanium, Inconel 718 etc. The investigation of surface integrity was done on this materials in terms of operating parameters like <b>sliding</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate and depth of penetration (DOP) identifying the predominant factors among the selected parameters. The steel balls used were cryogenically treated at sub zero temperature of - 176 degrees. Sub-surface micro-hardness study were also done to asses the depth of compression altered zone, surface roughness and surface hardness. The process can be applied to critical components effectively as the LPB process has cycle time advantages and also low investment cost. This can be also realized by introducing on high speed machines. This process was studied by using cryogenically treated different ball diameters at various operating parameters. This also improved on concentricity of work material. More the depth of compression produced low surface roughness at low <b>sliding</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate with larger ball diameter.

50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both <b>feed</b> <b>slides</b> and the <b>feed</b> tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|R

50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch.

40|$|Spatial Supervised Learning {{seeks to}} learn how to assign a label to each pixel in a spatial grid such as the pixels of remote-sensed images. The {{standard}} approach is to treat each grid cell separately and to use only the measured features of the grid cell to determine the assigned label. However, spatial data usually exhibits spatial patterns so that labels of nearby grid cells are correlated. It should be possible to learn this correlation and exploit it to improve the accuracy of the predicted labels. This project studies simple recurrent sliding window classifiers for this task. Recurrent <b>sliding</b> window classifiers <b>feed</b> their predicted output labels back as inputs when making predictions for adjacent grid cells. The project shows how to generalize sequential sliding window classifiers to spatial data and also studies the effectiveness of three ensemble methods: (a) voting among sliding windows that approach a given grid cell from multiple directions, (b) bagging, and (c) boosting. These methods are applied to the C 4. 5 decision tree algorithm and to the naive Bayes algorithm. The results show that for naive Bayes, an increase in the input and output context results in a significant improvement over the no-context approach, and this result is improved with boosting, while bagging has little effect.

40|$|Background: The {{world health}} {{organization}} in 2001 established the policy that neonates must be exclusively breastfed for six months,but {{studies have shown that}} fewer women upper than three months to give their babies milk. Although, education and management for a logical continuation of breast feeding is crucial. The present study compared the effectiveness of multimedia and routine educations on exclusive breast feeding in children less than six months of exclusive breast feeding was done. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 169 Gravid 1 women covered by health care systems were chosen via random sampling casually in the control and case groups (77 and 92 individuals, respectively). The intervention group completed 32 weeks of gestation to 6 months after delivery through the implementation of multimedia training programs about breast <b>feeding</b> (<b>slide,</b> educational videos, lecturing and pamphlets) were used for training and advice. While the control group was taught by conventional health centers (providing user instruction). Information required by valid and reliable questionnaires were collected. The data collected by SPSS 11. 5 software using descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and analytical statistics (mann Whitney and χ 2) were analyzed. In all cases p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The results showed in {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in terms of duration of exclusive breast feeding in follow up visits.

40|$|The fast tool servo (FTS) {{machining}} process provides an indispensable solution for machining optical microstructures with sub-micrometer form accuracy and a nanometric surface finish {{without the need}} for any subsequent post processing. The error motions in the FTS machining {{play an important role in}} the material removal process and surface generation. However, these issues have received relatively little attention. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the effect of error motions on surface generation in FTS machining. This is accomplished by the establishment of a model-based simulation system for FTS machining, which is composed of a surface generation model, a tool path generator, and an error model. The major components of the error model include the stroke error of the FTS, the error motion of the machine <b>slide</b> in the <b>feed</b> direction, and the axial motion error of the main spindle. The form error due to the stroke error can be extracted empirically by regional analysis, the slide motion error and the axial motion error of the spindle are obtained by a kinematic model and the analysis of the profile in the circumferential direction in single point diamond turning (SPDT) of a flat surface, respectively. After incorporating the error model in the surface generation model, the model-based simulation system is capable of predicting the surface generation in FTS machining. A series of cutting tests were conducted. The predicted results were compared with the measured results, and hence the performance of the model-based simulation system was verified. The proposed research is helpful for the analysis and diagnosis of motion errors on the surface generation in the FTS {{machining process}}, and throws some light on the corresponding compensation and optimization solutions to improve the machining quality.

40|$|Active {{anti-roll}} bars have recently found greater acceptance among premium car manufacturers and optimal {{application of this}} technology has emerged as an important field of research. This thesis investigates the potential of implementing active {{anti-roll bars}} in a passenger vehicle {{with the purpose of}} increasing customer value. For active anti-roll bars, customer value is defined in terms of vehicle’s ride comfort and handling performance. The objective with this thesis is to demonstrate this value through development of a control algorithm that can reflect the potential improvement in ride comfort and handling. A vehicle with passive anti-roll bars is simulated for different manoeuvres to identify the potential and establish a reference {{for the development of a}} control algorithm and for the performance of active anti-roll bars. While ride is evaluated using single-sided cosine wave and single-sided ramps, handling is evaluated using standardized constant radius, frequency response and sine with dwell manoeuvres. The control strategy developed implements a combination of <b>sliding</b> mode control, <b>feed</b> forward and PI-controllers. Simulations with active anti-roll bars showed significant improvement in ride and handling performance in comparison to passive anti-roll bars. In ride comfort, the biggest benefit was seen in the ability to increase roll damping and isolating low frequency road excitations. For handling, most significant benefits are through the system’s ability of changing the understeer behaviour of the vehicle and improving the handling stability in transient manoeuvres. Improvement in the roll reduction capability during steady state cornering is also substantial. In conclusion, active anti-roll bars are undoubtedly capable of improving both ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle. Although the trade-off between ride and handling performance is significantly less, balance in requirements is critical to utilise the full potential of active anti-roll bars. With a more comprehensive control strategy, they also enable the vehicle to exhibit different driving characteristics without the need for changing any additional hardware...|$|R
