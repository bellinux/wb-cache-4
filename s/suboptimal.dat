5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during <b>suboptimal</b> conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most of this part of the creek and its tributaries were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered <b>suboptimal.</b> A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with a naturally high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but the shelter can be open and simple. They tend to thrive in extremes of heat and cold and have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} <b>suboptimal</b> soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|The West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition {{measured}} several {{sites on}} Tangascootack Creek {{based on their}} habitat quality. The assessment measured 12 different values, including instream cover and {{the width of the}} riparian zone on a scale of 0 to 240. The site T-1 had a score of 203 and the site T-3 had a score of 198. Both were considered optimal habitats. However, T-2 had a score of 179, making it a <b>suboptimal</b> habitat.|$|E
5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and <b>suboptimal</b> dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a <b>suboptimal</b> control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The headwaters of West Branch Fishing Creek had a score of 191, tying West Creek for the highest-rated site in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. Most of West Branch Fishing Creek received a rating between 166 and 200, indicating optimal habitat quality. The lower reaches of the creek, however, received a rating of 113 to 165, indicating <b>suboptimal</b> habitat quality.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. <b>suboptimal</b> temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
25|$|Maize has <b>suboptimal</b> {{amounts of}} the {{essential}} amino acids tryptophan and lysine, which accounts for its lower status as a protein source.|$|E
25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of <b>suboptimal</b> atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode, after pacemaker implantation.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{there was}} {{considerable}} shock and disbelief when Stein demonstrated that, in terms of mean squared error , this approach is <b>suboptimal.</b> The result became known as Stein's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Windows 9x: An {{operating}} system that targeted consumers market. Discontinued because of <b>suboptimal</b> performance. (PC World called its last version, Windows ME, {{one of the}} worst products of all times.) Microsoft now caters to the consumers market with Windows NT.|$|E
25|$|Choline {{increases}} carnitine uptake and retention. Choline supplements are inexpensive, safe (probably even in {{all children}} requiring anticholinergics) and can provide spectacular {{evidence of the}} <b>suboptimal</b> efficiency of carnitine supplementation by increasing exercise tolerance, truncal tone and general well-being.|$|E
25|$|In the Kempinski v. Epishin game, {{both players}} made <b>suboptimal</b> moves. The {{superior}} side {{had no idea}} how to win and ended up stalemating several moves after the inferior side could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule.|$|E
25|$|Other hurdles exist when {{allowing}} the robot to use voice for interacting with humans. For social reasons, synthetic voice proves <b>suboptimal</b> as a communication medium, making {{it necessary to}} develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that neurocognitive, psychosocial, quality of life, growth, nutrition, bone pathology are slightly <b>suboptimal</b> even for patients who are treated and maintain their Phe levels in the target range, if their diet is not supplemented with other amino acids.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of {{pacemaker}} implantation, AV synchrony should be optimized {{to prevent the occurrence}} of pacemaker syndrome. Where patients with optimized AV synchrony have shown great results of implantation and very low incidence of pacemaker syndrome than those with <b>suboptimal</b> AV synchronization.|$|E
25|$|Maynard Solomon {{suggests}} that in keeping his grandson in his home, Leopold may have hoped to train yet another musical prodigy. Halliwell notes a different possibility, that conditions for child-rearing in the Berchtold household were distinctly <b>suboptimal.</b> For further details of this episode, see Maria Anna Mozart.|$|E
25|$|ROC {{analysis}} provides {{tools to}} select possibly optimal models and to discard <b>suboptimal</b> ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related {{in a direct}} and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.|$|E
25|$|In a {{recovering}} population in north-east Germany, a trade-off between {{the distance to}} neighbouring breeding pairs and to the nearest water body (the birds' favoured foraging habitat) was found. This indicates that pairs may be increasingly selecting <b>suboptimal</b> habitats to reduce competition as the population increases, and has implications {{in the management of}} such populations.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{must have}} early {{consultation}} with craniofacial and orthopaedic surgeons, when craniofacial, clubfoot, or hand correction is indicated to improve function or aesthetics. Operative measures should be pursued cautiously, with avoidance of radical measures and careful {{consideration of the}} abnormal muscle physiology in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. Unfortunately, many surgical procedures have <b>suboptimal</b> outcomes, secondary to the myopathy of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Most common annual {{vegetables}} have optimal germination temperatures between 75-90 F (24-32 C), {{though many}} species (e.g. radishes or spinach) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, {{as low as}} 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. <b>Suboptimal</b> temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.|$|E
25|$|After {{the game}} {{started with a}} French Defence, Levitsky made some <b>suboptimal</b> moves, and then a big mistake {{allowing}} Marshall to win a piece. Levitsky tried to counterattack, but Marshall's unexpected winning move put his queen—his most valuable piece—on a square where it could be captured by three of Levitsky's pieces. Legend says that this move immediately triggered a shower of gold.|$|E
25|$|Housing and {{management}} features common in modern dairy farms (such as concrete barn floors, {{limited access to}} pasture and <b>suboptimal</b> bed-stall design) {{have been identified as}} contributing risk factors to infections and injuries. New dairy farms being built now include non-slip flooring and other features designed to minimize risk to cows when moving between pens and to the milking parlor.|$|E
25|$|Many of the non-visual {{functions}} of vitamin A are mediated by retinoic acid, which regulates gene expression by activating nuclear retinoic acid receptors. The non-visual {{functions of}} vitamin A are essential in the immunological function, reproduction and embryonic development of vertebrates {{as evidenced by}} the impaired growth, susceptibility to infection and birth defects observed in populations receiving <b>suboptimal</b> vitamin A in their diet.|$|E
25|$|A pair {{of studies}} of the {{influence}} of poverty on the ability to reason about complicated issues requiring an immediate solution found that poverty directly impedes cognitive function. Financial worries appear to put a severe burden on one's mental resources so that they are no longer fully available for solving complicated problems. The reduced capability for problem solving can lead to <b>suboptimal</b> decisions and further perpetuate poverty.|$|E
25|$|Much code written {{today is}} {{intended}} to run on as many machines as possible. As a consequence, programmers and compilers don't always {{take advantage of the}} more efficient instructions provided by newer CPUs or quirks of older models. Additionally, assembly code tuned for a particular processor without using such instructions might still be <b>suboptimal</b> on a different processor, expecting a different tuning of the code.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} organic acidemias, GA1 causes {{carnitine}} depletion. Whole-blood carnitine {{can be raised}} by oral supplementation. However, this does not significantly change blood concentrations of glutarylcarnitine or esterified carnitine, suggesting that oral supplementation is <b>suboptimal</b> in raising tissue levels of carnitine. In the field of clinical nutrition, researchers {{come to the same}} conclusion, that oral carnitine raises plasma levels but doesn't affect muscle carnitine, where most of it is stored and used.|$|E
25|$|The {{flora and}} the fauna consist of taxa adapted to drought. Terrestrial fauna is scant; {{there are no}} truly native land mammals and only one native land bird – Kiribati's endemic reed-warbler, the bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis). The 1957 attempt to {{introduce}} the endangered Rimitara lorikeet (Vini kuhlii) has largely failed; a few birds seem to linger on, {{but the lack of}} abundant coconut palm forest, on which this tiny parrot depends, makes Kiritimati a <b>suboptimal</b> habitat for this species.|$|E
25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is <b>suboptimal.</b> Moreover, {{the concern is that}} imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|Caring in {{intimate}} relationships is {{the practice of}} providing care and support to an intimate relationship partner. Caregiving behaviours are aimed at reducing the partner's distress and supporting his or her coping efforts in situations of either threat or challenge. Caregiving may include emotional support (expressions of care, affection, sympathy, and encouragement) and/or instrumental support (provision of information, advice, and tangible resources). Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's psychological well-being, {{as well as the}} quality {{of the relationship between the}} caregiver and the care-recipient. However, certain <b>suboptimal</b> caregiving strategies may be either ineffective or even detrimental to coping.|$|E
25|$|This is an {{alternative}} way to perform an echocardiogram. A specialized probe containing an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient's esophagus. This allows image and Doppler evaluation from a location directly behind the heart. This {{is known as a}} transesophageal echocardiogram. Transesophageal echocardiograms are most often used when transthoracic images are <b>suboptimal</b> and when a more clear and precise image is needed for assessment. This test is performed {{in the presence of a}} cardiologist, registered nurse, and ultrasound technician. Conscious sedation and/or localized numbing medication may be used to make the patient more comfortable during the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Kinsey's {{parents were}} poor {{for most of}} his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey {{receiving}} inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including rickets, rheumatic fever, and typhoid fever. His health records indicate that Kinsey received <b>suboptimal</b> exposure to sunlight (often the cause of rickets, before milk and other foods were fortified with vitamin D) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being drafted in 1917 for World War I.|$|E
25|$|An hCG {{ratio of}} 0.87, that is, a {{decrease}} in hCG of 13% over 48 hours, has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 97% for predicting a failing PUL. The majority of cases of ectopic pregnancy will have serial serum hCG levels that increase more slowly than would be expected with an IUP (that is, a <b>suboptimal</b> rise), or decrease more slowly than would be expected with a failing PUL. However, up to 20% of cases of ectopic pregnancy have serum hCG doubling times {{similar to that of}} an IUP, and around 10% of EP cases have hCG patterns similar to a failing PUL.|$|E
25|$|The disease nagana or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has {{an enormous impact on}} the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and <b>suboptimal</b> dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Muni {{scheduled}} 20 trains per hour (TPH) through the Market Street Subway at peak periods, with all trains using the crossover west of Embarcadero station to reverse direction.. To allow for high frequencies {{on the surface}} branches, eastbound trains were combined at West Portal and Duboce Portal, and westbound trains split at those locations. Two-car N Judah trains and one-car J Church trains (each 10TPH) combined at the Duboce Portal, while two-car L Taraval trains (10TPH) alternately combined with two-car M Ocean View and K Ingleside (each 5 TPH) trains at West Portal to form four-car trains. However, this provided <b>suboptimal</b> service; many inbound trains did not arrive at the portals in time to combine into longer trains.|$|E
