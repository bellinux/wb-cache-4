40|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> {{construction}} has recently gained more confidence {{to be used}} as structural elements. A number of laboratory tests worldwide, show this system to be capable of supporting substantial service loads in case of proper baling, stacking, and plastering. In Egypt, growing attention is focused on examining this new trend of construction in order to solve the environmental pollution caused by burning millions of tons of straw every year. Two types of mobile <b>straw</b> <b>baling</b> mechanical powered <b>press</b> machines are commonly used in Egypt, private local small sized iron baling machines and Cicoria <b>straw</b> <b>baling</b> machines. These two baling systems have major differences in their end product physical properties, baling, and mainly their compressing techniques. Rare information is available about the mechanical characteristics of local bales. This paper is part of a pioneer national project aiming to use rice <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> in building. The research aims to identify the specifications and characteristics of locally produced rice <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> used for building. The bales are compressed under various compressibility conditions to identify the settlement that is expected to happen in most of the types of bales available in the market. Experimental studies are carried out on the effect of compressibility and baling on the quality of single un-rendered <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> in general, and particularly it's displacement under vertical load. These experiments are conducted on single un-rendered bales from different sources, by applying incremental vertical load, reaching 50 tons. Results of corresponding displacements of different types of bales from different sources are recorde...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> is an intensively discussed {{topic in the}} international <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> community. <b>Straw</b> <b>bales</b> are, by nature, highly heterogeneous and porous. They can have a relatively large range of density and the baling process can influence the way the fibres are organised within the <b>bale.</b> In addition, <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> have a larger thickness {{than most of the}} insulating materials that {{can be found in the}} building industry. Measurement apparatus is usually not designed for such thicknesses, and most of the {{thermal conductivity}} values that can be found in the literature are defined based on samples in which the <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> are resized. During this operation, the orientation of the fibres and the density may not be preserved. This paper starts with a literature review of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> thermal conductivity measurements and presents a measuring campaign performed with a specific Guarded Hot Plate, designed to measure samples up to 50 cm thick. The influence of the density is discussed thoroughly. Representative values are proposed for a large range of <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> to support straw-bale development in the building industry. aPropaille - région Wallone et PARI CduBoBi - Région Bourgogn...|$|R
40|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> {{building}} is an environmentally friendly building technique {{that has not}} yet reached the broad masses of the population. This thesis seeks answers to why <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building has not diffused more, using Everett M. Rogers renowned theory about diffusion of innovations. Qualitative research provides data about the attributes of this particular innovation, characteristics of early adopters of the innovation, as well as other aspects like communication channels and the social context, which could tell us something about why it has not become more popular. Perceptions and experiences about <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building in Norway and Denmark are examined through eight interviews with both <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> builders and <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> experts. A comparative analysis of Norway and Denmark is also provided. The main findings are that <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building s complexity, time- and labour-intensiveness, and its connection to an alternative lifestyle, are factors that are hindering the innovation s diffusion. There is also a lack of information and knowledge about it in society.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on general {{properties}} of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> as a building material which has been proven by buildings throughout {{the world to be}} an appropriate material choice. Still, there are many hesitations about using this alternative building material. The building techniques are relatively easy to learn and the performance of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> structures has a high value in terms of several aspects as long as general requirements are followed. The primary benefit of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> as a building material is its low embodied energy. It also has high thermal and sound insulation properties. Many previous research studies on <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building have been focused on structural stability, fire resistance and assessing moisture content in <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> {{which is one of the}} major issues. Therefore, special attention needs to be devoted to details to insure proper building safety. Render selection is especially crucial and an extremely important step in <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building, not only in matters concerning moisture but also structural capacity and fire protection. A major disadvantage of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> construction is its lack of material research. The paper is divided into three parts in which advantages and disadvantages of such a building are discussed. In the third part, results are presented for a survey in which correspondents emphasized the advantages and disadvantages of living in a <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ecological {{houses have}} become very popular lately due to an {{increasing}} concern regarding {{the reduction of the}} CO 2 emissions generated by the building sector. An ecological house is perceived as a building that enhances the environment rather than degrading it. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> houses are considered to be an ecological and energy efficient solution to the traditional houses. The research aimed to evaluate the use of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> in constructions. The experimental work included the mechanical and the hygrothermal behaviour of <b>straw</b> <b>bale,</b> i. e. compression test, moisture content and thermal conductivity determination on a <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> wall placed in climatic conditions specific for Romania.

40|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> {{construction}} {{is not a}} new idea. For ap-proximately 100 years, <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> have been stacked and plastered to create single storey buildings such as the 4 Cs building in Haliburton, Ontario (Figure 1) (Vardy et al. 2006). There are several hundred of these structures in Canada and the United States. As mentioned previously, <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> construction offers many advantages, but traditional <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> construction also has disadvantages that make it dif-fi cult to integrate with modern construction. Wall thicknesses and heights are highly variable, making it diffi cult to obtain level walls and straight corners. Bales must be protected during construction to en-sure they do not become wet. A U.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the ability {{of different types of}} cereal plant straw to resist decay. Proponents of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building claim that bale buildings reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere in a number of ways. The carbon contained in straw is locked within the building structure and is therefore not emitted to the atmosphere. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings are also highly energy efficient in terms of both construction inputs and heating once inhabited, thereby saving energy that would otherwise by sourced primarily from fossil fuels. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings are part of a global movement to mitigate global warming through more eco-positive approaches to human development. In order for <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, they need to be sustainable – they need to last. Currently, there is some doubt in the building industry regarding the ability of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> to resist decay in the long-term, particularly in temperate climates.

40|$|Abstract. Due to an {{increasing}} request for ecological building constructions, in particular <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings, a {{research in this}} regard has been performed at the Vienna University of Technology. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> construction is a new rediscovered building technology, which is an alternative to conventional construction technologies. The {{aim of this study}} is caring out of hygro-thermal simulation of a <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> wall construction to design as efficiently as possible <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> house. The choose of other construction elements for a thermal analysis (appropriate wall, roof and a base plate construction), was based on an extensive literature researche. For the examination of the building a timber frame construction has been selected. The <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> in this construction were plastered inside with clay plaster and externally with a combination of lime and clay plaster. The roof structure was designed as a green roof and insulated with <b>straw</b> <b>bales.</b> The base plate was also insulated with <b>straw</b> <b>bales.</b> To check the thermal behavior of the structures described above were thermal bridges calculated using a FEM program. The hygrothermal behavior was calculated with HAM 4 D building physic software, developed on the department for Buildings Physics and Sound Protection on Vienna University of Technology. Ecological and economic evaluation of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> construction was carried out with reference to the data from the literature. The performed thermal (with COMSOL) and the first hygrothermal calculations (with HAM 4 D Software) have demonstrated a very favorable performance of the proposed building components. The achieved low U-values of the components allow the construction of passive houses. The use of self-build-service in the construction process can reduce construction costs significantly. The use of ecological materials such as: straw, clay and wood allows a low cost recycling of building materials...|$|R
