25|$|Dunfermline is the {{principal}} shopping centre serving the western area of Fife and is the region's second largest town centre by floorspace. Retailing accounts for 18% {{of the total number}} of jobs in the town. A BID (Business Improvement District) scheme for the city centre has been in operation since 2009. The majority of shops and retail services in Dunfermline are concentrated in the town centre along a high street. The Kingsgate Shopping Centre is located on the pedestrianised section of the High Street giving Dunfermline a mix of modern and traditional shops. A major extension of the Kingsgate Shopping Centre was completed in 2008 improving and expanding the retail offer in the town by attracting a major department <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> and range of other smaller retailers. Other retail areas in Dunfermline exist at Carnegie Drive Retail Park to the north of the town centre and Halbeath Retail Park to the east of the town. A large neighbourhood centre with one of the towns major supermarkets was also built as part of the eastern expansion area of Dunfermline. The Fife Leisure Park, constructed in 1999 is adjacent to the M90 at Halbeath on the eastern outskirks of Dunfermline. The leisure park has a large cinema, a health club, bowling alley and a number of restaurants.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} activities for supermarket retailers is the creation and marketing of <b>store</b> <b>brands,</b> also known as private label brands. Given the increasing quality-equivalence between national <b>brands</b> and <b>store</b> <b>brands,</b> they have become direct competitors, and pricing decisions should take this into account. In most cases, national brands still possess some degree of pricing and market power over <b>store</b> <b>brands.</b> In this chapter, we define three components of market power for national <b>brands</b> versus <b>store</b> brands: (1) price premium; (2) volume premium; and (3) margin premium. Our chapter proceeds along the following lines. First, we delineate the factors that are {{the most important}} drivers of the three components of premium. Second, we discuss managerial implications about key success factors in the pricing of national <b>brands</b> and <b>store</b> <b>brands.</b> A key contribution of this chapter is that we incorporate emerging insights from the marketing literature on the pricing and market power of national <b>brands</b> versus <b>store</b> <b>brands.</b> Finally, we conclude by offering important future research directions...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally <b>store</b> <b>brands</b> in Australia {{are viewed}} with {{suspicion}} {{in regard to}} their quality and are usually purchased because of the "value for money" that they offer.

50|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty and store loyalty still remains unknown. Research suggests a non-monotonic {{relationship between}} <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty and store loyalty, positive up {{to a certain}} <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty level, after which it becomes negative. Current arguments recommend this relationship may relate to the competitive positioning of store brands, especially their price-quality positioning. The more Standard-oriented the <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> positioning, the more approving the effect of <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty appears to be on store loyalty. (Martos-Partal, M., & González-Benito, Ó. 2010). Price verse quality is a very important factor of the formation of <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> value and loyalty. There is a study that shows new evidence towards <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty through consumers who show different usage of these brands (heavy, medium and light buyers). The study evaluates the short and long term values of each segment of the customer, so the retailer can then recommend retail strategies for each segment (Rubio, N., Oubiña, J., & Gómez-Suárez, M. 2015). The key positioning of <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> is situated accordingly to their value for money which is a crucial part {{in the formation of the}} loyalty to these brands. The better the <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> usage, the better the direct effect of <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> value for money on <b>store</b> <b>brand</b> loyalty. This then means smaller indirect effect through smart shopping associations. (Rubio, N., Oubiña, J., & Gómez-Suárez, M. 2015).|$|E

The authors study {{the notion that the}} differential success of <b>store</b> <b>brands</b> in the United States and Europe is the higher <b>brand</b> equity that <b>store</b> <b>brands</b> command in Europe than in the United States. They use a framework based on consumer brand choice under uncertainty and brands as signals of product positions to conduct their analysis. More specifically, they examine whether uncertainty about quality (or the positioning of the brand in the product space); perceived quality of <b>store</b> <b>brands</b> versus national brands; consistency in store-brand offerings over time; and consumer attitudes toward risk, quality, and price underlie the differential success of <b>store</b> <b>brands</b> at least partially in the United States and Europe. The authors' model is estimated on scanner-panel data on laundry detergent in the U. S., U. K., and Spanish markets and on toilet paper and margarine data in the U. S. and Spanish markets.
