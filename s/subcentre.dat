40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} a city with access to two subcentres selling a {{differentiated}} product. The first <b>subcentre</b> has low free flow transport costs but is easily congested (near city centre, access by road). The second one has higher free flow transport costs but is less prone to congestion (ample public transport capacity, parking etc.). Both subcentres need to attract customers and employees by offering prices and wages that are sufficiently attractive to cover their fixed costs. In {{the absence of any}} government regulation, there will be an asymmetric duopoly game that can be solved for a Nash equilibrium in prices and wages offered by the two subcentres. This solution is typically characterised by excessive congestion for the nearby <b>subcentre.</b> We study the welfare effects of a number of stylised policies by setting up a general model and illustrating the model using competition between airports as an example. The first policy is to extend the road to <b>subcentre</b> 1. This policy will not necessarily lead to less congestion as more customers will be attracted by the lower transport costs. The second policy option is to add congestion pricing (or parking pricing etc.) for the congested <b>subcentre.</b> This will decrease its profit margin and attract more customers. The third policy is acceptable for politicians: providing a direct subsidy to the remote <b>subcentre,</b> reducing its marginal costs.

40|$|The {{presence}} of subcentres cannot {{be captured by}} an exponential function. Cubic spline functions seem more appropriate to depict the polycentricity pattern of modern urban systems. Using data from Barcelona Metropolitan Region, two possible population <b>subcentre</b> delimitation procedures are discussed. One, taking an estimated derivative equal to zero, the other, a density gradient equal to zero. It is argued that, in using a cubic spline function, a delimitation strategy based on derivatives is more appropriate than one based on gradients because the estimated density can be negative in sections with very low densities and few observations, leading to sudden changes in estimated gradients. It is also argued that using as a criteria for <b>subcentre</b> delimitation a second derivative with value zero allow us to capture a more restricted <b>subcentre</b> area than using as a criteria a first derivative zero.

The La-rich {{end of the}} compositional series La sub 8 sub - sub x Sr sub x Cu sub 8 O sub 2 sub 0 sub - subdelta was investigated, a tetragonal {{solid solution}}: 1 centre dot 38 (2) <= x <= 2 centre dot 4 (1) was prepared. This range is wider than previously reported, possibly due to longer reaction times used. An orthorhombic stoichiometric phase with composition La sub 6 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 9 sub 0 Sr sub 1 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 1 sub 0 Cu sub 8 O sub 2 sub 0 sub - subdelta was prepared in air at 1000 deg C.

La sub 6 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 4 Sr sub 1 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 6 Cu sub 8 sub - sub y M sub y O sub 2 sub 0 sub - subdelta (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mg) was prepared by the solid-state route at 1000 deg C; solid solution limits were y = 1 centre dot 15 (8) [Fe], y 0 centre dot 35 (2) [Zn] and y 0 centre dot 30 (10) [Mg]. The La sub 1 sub - sub x Ba sub x CoO sub 3 sub - subdelta, Nd sub 1 sub - sub x Ba sub x CoO sub 3 sub - subdelta and REBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta (RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) systems were prepared by the solid-state route with firing at 1100 deg C. For La sub 1 sub - sub x Ba sub x CoO sub 3 sub - subdelta, the results were in agreement with those in the literature. Materials exhibited a rhombohedral distortion for 0 <= x <= 0 centre dot 3, whilst 0 centre dot 4 <= x <= 0 centre dot 75 were cubic. For Nd sub 1 sub - sub x Ba sub x CoO sub 3 sub - subdelta, only NdCoO sub 3 sub - subdelta and Nd sub 0 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 5 Ba sub O sub 3 sub - subdelta were prepared phase-pure. Due to A-site ordering in Nd sub 0 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 5 Ba sub O sub 3 sub - subdelta, there was doubling of the c-axis, and the formula NdBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta is reported in the literature, and was utilised in this study. A wide variation in oxygen content with temperature, under both air and O sub 2, was observed for La sub 0 sub. sub 5 Ba sub 0 sub. sub 5 CoO sub 3 sub - subdelta and NdBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta. It appeared the materials were able to tolerate considerable oxygen loss and remain stable. For NdBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta, structural transitions occurred as oxygen content decreased; a tetragonal-orthorhombic (approx 300 deg C) and orthorhombic-tetragonal transition (approx 900 deg C) were observed. In REBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta (RE Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho) as RE size decreased, the oxygen content of samples prepared under the same conditions decreased, and a tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal transition occurred. The intermediate sized RE (Sm, Eu, Gd) materials exhibited the orthorhombic distortion. Post-reaction heat sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta was carried out to ascertain the effect of using different radiation sources (Cu K alpha sub 1 and Co K alpha sub 1), and the effect of refinement procedure on results. The choice of radiation was not an important factor, whereas refinement procedure was found to be an important variable. Results suggested that to obtain accurate Rietveld refinement results for La sub 4 BaCu sub 5 O sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta, the O U sub i sub s sub o 's {{should not be allowed to}} refine. treatments were carried out to vary oxygen contents. As oxygen content was decreased, the orthorhombic distortion was observed for larger RE ions (Pr, Nd). On increasing oxygen content, under HOP conditions, the orthorhombic distortion was observed for smaller RE ions (Ho, Dy, Tb). Rietveld refinement of NdBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta, with different oxygen contents, was carried out to try and ascertain the mechanism for the tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal transitions. It appeared that as O(1) vacancies increased, CoO sub 6 octahedra converted to CoO sub 5 square pyramids. As a consequence, the coordination of Nd decreased, and the attraction for O(3) sites increased. At a critical O(1) vacancy concentration, the Nd caused the 4 -fold O(3) site to split into two 2 -fold sites [O(3) and O(4) ], with the O(3) site moving closer to the Nd ion. The splitting of the site led to the orthorhombic distortion, which occurred at O sub 5 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 6, with a maximum at O sub 5 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 4 and disappeared around O sub 5 <b>subcentre</b> dot sub 2 sub 5. At a second O(1) vacancy concentration, the Nd coordination decreased sufficiently for the O(4) sites to be attracted; O(3) and O(4) once again become equivalent and the orthorhombic distortion was lost. Therefore, it seemed possible that the tetragonal-orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transitions were controlled by O(1) vacancy concentration and, the subsequent, Nd coordination. Rietveld refinement of La sub 4 BaCu sub 5 O A range of oxygen-deficient perovskites with compositions La sub 4 BaCu sub 5 O sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta, La sub 8 sub - sub x Sr sub x Cu sub 8 O sub 2 sub 0 sub - subdelta, REBaCo sub 2 O sub 6 sub - subdelta, and various doped analogues were synthesised. Materials were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction (ND), Rietveld refinement, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). La sub 4 BaCu sub 5 O sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta was found to be a stoichiometric phase, with no evidence of variable cation content. An oxygen content range of - 0 centre dot 3 (1) <= delta <= 0 centre dot 2 (1) was calculated from H sub 2 -reduction TG data. Results were in good agreement with those reported in the literature. However, from Rietveld refinement, the possible presence of CuO sub 4 square planes, in addition to CuO sub 6 and CuO sub 5 polyhedra, in the structure was suggested. La sub 4 Ba sub 1 sub - sub x Sr sub x Cu sub 5 O sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta was prepared; the solid solution ranges, 0 <= x <= 0 centre dot 11 (2) and 0 centre dot 56 (4) <= x <= 1 centre dot 0 were determined by quantitative EPMA. La sub 4 BaCu sub 4 MO sub 1 sub 3 sub + subdelta (M = Ni, Co, Fe) were prepared phase-pure; Rietveld refinement showed Ni and Fe preferentially substituted onto the 1 -fold octahedral site, whilst Co substituted onto both the 1 -fold octahedral and 4 -fold square pyramidal sites.

40|$|The {{immunization}} {{coverage of}} infants, children and women residing {{in a primary}} health centre (PHC) area in Rajasthan was evaluated both by lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) and by the 30 -cluster sampling method recommended by WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The LQAS survey was used to classify 27 mutually exclusive subunits of the population, defined as residents in health <b>subcentre</b> areas, {{on the basis of}} acceptable or unacceptable levels of immunization coverage among infants and their mothers. The LQAS results from the 27 subcentres were also combined to obtain an overall estimate of coverage for the entire population of the primary health centre, and these results were compared with the EPI cluster survey results. The LQAS survey did not identify any <b>subcentre</b> with a level of immunization among infants high enough to be classified as acceptable; only three subcentres were classified as having acceptable levels of tetanus toxoid (TT) coverage among women. The estimated overall coverage in the PHC population from the combined LQAS results showed that a quarter of the infants were immunized appropriately for their ages and that 46 % of their mothers had been adequately immunized with TT. Although the age groups and the periods of time during which the children were immunized differed for the LQAS and EPI survey populations, the characteristics of the mothers were largely similar. About 57 % (95 % CI, 46 - 67) of them were found to be fully immunized with TT by 30 -cluster sampling, compared with 46 % (95 % CI, 41 - 51) by stratified random sampling. The difference was not statistically significant. The field work to collect LQAS data took about three times longer, and cost 60 % more than the EPI survey. The apparently homogeneous and low level of immunization coverage in the 27 subcentres makes this an impractical situation in which to apply LQAS, and the results obtained were therefore not particularly useful. However, if LQAS had been applied by local staff in an area with overall high coverage and population subunits with heterogeneous coverage, the method would have been less costly and should have produced useful results...|$|E
