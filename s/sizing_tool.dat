40|$|Floating control {{facilities}} (FCFs) {{are designed}} to support fields using only subsea production system. Potential concepts, including Tension Leg Platform (TLP), Spar and semi-submersible can be selected as the FCFs. This paper discusses the philosophy of concept selection for FCFs. Two basic considerations for concept selection for FCFs are functional requirements and costs. Different structure types are first to be sized to meet the functional requirements for given water depths, environmental conditions and soil conditions. Then the costs for the procurement, construction, installation, hook up and commissioning for different concepts are estimated based on the sizes. Finally, the most cost-effective concept is chosen for further study to confirm the feasibilities of the concept by detailed analyses. Global <b>sizing</b> <b>tools</b> assisting concept selection have been developed by Ocean Dynamics LLC (Limited Liability Company) (ODL) over the past years. For a given concept, these <b>sizing</b> <b>tools</b> can find the optimized size based on costs to meet the functional requirements. Capabilities of the <b>sizing</b> <b>tools</b> cover the general layout, weight estimate (hull and deck), riser weight and stiffness estimate, loading conditions (transportation, normal operating, extreme, survival), hydrostatics and stability, natural periods, motions, air gap, environmental loads (wind, current, and mean wave forces), mooring sizing, cost estimate, and optimization based on the total costs. Two case studies in two different water depths, 140 m and 1200 m, are presented to illustrate the procedures and considerations in concept selection for floating control facilities. The FCFs used in the case studies are to support a Super Puma helideck, satellite communication equipment, an umbilical riser and option for a 3. 5 ” pipeline riser, with a total estimated topside payload as 400 Metric Ton (MT). ...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 2002 Missile Sciences Conference, Monterrey, CA, November 5 - 7, 2002. This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} a conceptual <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> for the design of tactical missiles. The <b>sizing</b> <b>tool,</b> called the Tactical Missile Design (TMD) spreadsheet, was developed to allow the user to quickly generate estimates of a missile configuration?s performance and other measures of merit such as lethality. This capability allows the user to get a first order estimate of a missile?s ability to meet a set of requirements and allows for fast trade-studies to quickly identify the performance drivers of a system. In order to generate reasonable estimates for missile range and speed, a <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> must have analysis methods for aerodynamics, propulsion, weight, and trajectory. In order for the <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> to remain useful for conceptual tradeoffs, these analyses must be robust enough to handle a wide range of inputs, yet simple enough to be executed quickly. The analysis methods were constructed with these requirements in mind. The aerodynamics analysis is based upon several physics-derived analytical expressions as outlined in the text ?Tactical Missile Design? by Eugene Fleeman. Propulsion uses a simplified cycle analysis to relate engine parameters (maximum inlet temperature, fuel heating value, expansion ratio) to overall specific impulse (Isp). The propulsion analysis can handle either air-breathing and solid-rocket systems, or a combination thereof. For trajectory, a constant flight path is assumed, with a boost, cruise, and coast phase. These straightforward analysis methods combine to produce a very powerful, yet robust, conceptual missile design tool. The paper first lays out the analysis methods, assumptions, and limitations in the Tactical Missile Design spreadsheet. Next, a comparison is made between the results of the TMD spreadsheet and the performance of historical missile systems. In addition, the paper explores some example trade studies to identify the drivers of a rocket and a ramjet missile system. Finally, the TMD spreadsheet is used to show how easily a tactical missile can be optimized at the conceptual level...|$|E

50|$|Scrapers are {{typically}} formed by chipping {{the end of}} a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America.
