5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are set in random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the British Band, and the Fox, Kickapoo, Sauk, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that later joined them, {{suffered}} unknown numbers of dead during the war. While some died fighting, others were tracked down and killed by Sioux, Menominee, Ho-Chunk, and other native tribes. Still others died of starvation or drowned during the Band's long trek up the Rock River toward {{the mouth of the}} Bad Axe. The entire British Band was not wiped out at Bad Axe; some survivors drifted back home to their villages. This was relatively <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> the Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk of the band. Many Sauk and Fox found return to their homes more difficult, and while some returned safely, others were held in custody by the army. Prisoners, some taken at the Battle of Bad Axe, and others taken by U.S.-aligned Native American tribes in the following weeks, were taken to Fort Armstrong at modern Rock Island, Illinois. About 120 prisoners – men, women, and children – waited until the end of August to be released by General Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many considering it a highlight from the album. Many reviewers complimented its production and clever interpolation of the DeBarge sample, while some criticized it {{for being too}} <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> an artist of Carey's caliber. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's 19th chart-topping single in the United States, the track only managed to reach a peak position of number fifty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Throughout other countries where it was released, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top forty in Japan and Slovakia, and peaking at numbers sixty-nine and eighty-four in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.|$|E

Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.|$|E

25|$|An appeal from Lakhuba, {{which was}} {{eventually}} unsuccessful, delayed proceedings but Ranjitsinhji was installed as Jam Sahib on 11 March 1907. The installation was relatively <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons as Nawanagar was poor; many items {{had to be}} borrowed from neighbouring states for the ceremony to reach the expected standard.

25|$|In 1925, Ontario's public {{electricity}} utility, {{established in}} 1906, the Ontario Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) (later Ontario Hydro) constructed {{what was then}} the world's largest hydroelectric plant, Queenston-Chippawa (now Beck 1). From this early beginning until the postwar economic boom of the 1950s, Ontario Hydro was able to meet growing demand for electricity by expanding its network of hydraulic generating facilities. Planning for Ontario's electricity system was relatively <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> two reasons: 1) electricity was coming almost entirely from hydroelectric power; and 2) the electricity system consisted of several smaller systems, making management considerably easier.|$|E
25|$|It {{is assumed}} that the move against Fort de la Knocque was a feint attack, {{intended}} to distract the French from the Siege of Namur which followed in July. Even if the Allies had managed to widen their small bridgehead, they had to advance through a marsh which {{it would have been}} <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> the French to defend. However, the author felt that it was a serious attack and not a feint, because the British and their Dutch allies were particularly interested in seizing places along the Flanders coast.|$|E

25|$|Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout {{with the}} QWERTY keyboard, {{is much more}} {{commonly}} used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, {{there is only one}} unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, regular tunings {{have equal}} {{intervals}} between the strings, {{and so they}} have symmetrical scales all along the fretboard. This makes it simpler to translate chords. For the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the fretboard. The diagonal movement of chords is especially <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> the regular tunings that are repetitive, in which case chords can be moved vertically: Chords can be moved three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning and chords can be moved two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} homomorphism is {{one that}} preserves all sups that exist, not just the finite sups, and likewise for infs. The category CABA of all CABAs and their complete homomorphisms is dual to the category of sets and their functions, meaning that it {{is equivalent to the}} opposite of that category (the category resulting from reversing all morphisms). Things are not so <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> the category Bool of Boolean algebras and their homomorphisms, which Marshall Stone showed in effect (though he lacked both the language and the conceptual framework to make the duality explicit) to be dual to the category of totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces, subsequently called Stone spaces.|$|E

25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system <b>simple</b> <b>for</b> the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E
