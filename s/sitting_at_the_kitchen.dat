500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{table when}} she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting. He {{then returned to the}} kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

The story ends with George grinning wickedly, imagining the kind of torture {{he will be able}} to inflict on his brother. It is not clarified if George has been possessed by the dead woman's spirit or has absorbed her evil powers to use as his own.|$|R

An episode seldom goes by without him delivering a moral to the story that is often incoherent, or has no relevance to the situation, and typically ends in a non sequitur. Occasionally, he displays prominent womanizing and male-chauvinistic behavior, which is sometimes rebuked by Brak's mom. In an Adult Swim New Year's Eve bumper in 2003, he revealed his name to be [...] "Javier".|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Bill Haley. [...] Haley said in a 1967 {{interview}} with Vancouver, British Columbia DJ Red Robinson that he {{got the idea for}} the song from hearing popular catchphrases used by teenagers at school dances where he and his band performed.

[...] (the latter also featured in a song called [...] "Go Go Go" [...] by The Treniers which music historian Jim Dawson suggests may have been an influence). Haley (and Marshall Lytle) incorporated both phrases into the song. He is said to have written it <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table while his wife prepared lunch.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{books written}} by Dexter were general studies text books.

I was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel." [...] Last Bus to Woodstock was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and Wagner reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots used false leads and other red herrings.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Chaos Symbol was me doodling <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> table and {{wondering}} what to tell Jim Cawthorn the arms of Chaos looked like.

I have since been told that it is an [...] "ancient symbol of Chaos" [...] and if it is then it confirms a lot of theories about the race mind. ... As far as I know the symbol, drawn by Jim Cawthorn, first appeared on an Elric cover of Science Fantasy in 1962, then later appeared in his first comic version of Stormbringer done by Savoy [...]|$|E
