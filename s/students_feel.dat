However, some <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> that the class has shortcomings; they {{say that it is}} pretty similar to a typical US history course, and that critical conversations about race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.|$|E

He made his <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> the worth of life; he told us that the Lord had sent each of us to do a special work, and that the proper preparation was necessary for that mission." [...] Among the students who studied under Maeser were George Sutherland, William H. King, Bryant S. Hinckley, James E. Talmage, George Albert Smith and J. Golden Kimball. He also inspired his family members; one of his sons, Karl Emil, studied under Maeser and went on to be a respected educator and school president. Maeser retired from Brigham Young Academy in 1892 to devote his time to his position as the Superintendent of Church Schools. He was succeeded by Benjamin Cluff.|$|E

As such, Akeelah is portrayed as [...] "undermotivated student", who [...] "nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac," [...] avoids showing her abilities. According to Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, the film shows [...] "the contradiction gifted <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> in an inhospitable environment." [...] Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post opined that Akeelah's sentence [...] "Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?" [...] is [...] "one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's education policies." [...] Writing in the English Journal, Amanda L. Hodges said it suggests a new approach on teaching with the [...] "50,000 coaches" [...] part; she declared it deconstructs the image of teachers [...] "as those who keep order and disseminate knowledge" [...] and shows that [...] "eaching {{is not an isolated}} activity that begins and ends at the classroom door." ...|$|E

2500|$|By using Piaget’s theory, {{educators}} {{focus on}} their students as learners. As {{a result of this}} focus, education is learner-center and constructivist-based to an extent. Piaget’s theory allows teachers to view students as individual learners who add new concepts to prior knowledge [...] to construct, or build, understanding for themselves. [...] Teachers who use a learner-centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions. They provide experience-based educational opportunities. These teachers also contemplate the learners’ individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning. Educators allow learners’ insights to alter the curriculum. They nourish and support learners’ curiosity. They also involve learners’ emotions and create a learning environment in which <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> safe.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers {{need to be aware of}} the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Trinity {{is one of}} the few {{colleges that}} {{continues}} the tradition of Formal Hall during the academic year; High Table dinners are usually held after Evensong on Wednesdays. Before the meal, one of the Student Heads or another positioned member of college (in order of precedence determined by seniority) is responsible for saying the Latin grace: Quae hodie sumpturi sumus, benedicat Deus, per Iesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. Amen. (May God bless what we are about to receive this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.) Formal Hall is marked by the enforcement of a number of regulations known as “Strachan Hall Etiquette”. The most evident of these is the dress code, of which Trinity’s distinctive academic gowns are the essential element for all members of college. In addition to the wearing of the gown, men are required to wear a jacket, collared shirt, long pants and a tie, as well as close-toed shoes. If a man of college has had the honour of being [...] "poored out", he is then permitted to wear his tie tied on the remains of his gown. For women of college, the dress code consists of a similar prohibition on open-toed shoes as well as a prohibition on short skirts and track pants. Although the dress code may look like an unnecessary burden to the casual observer, many <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> that it and other formalities lend a special atmosphere to the dinners that is not found in the rest of the university.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{banning of}} the kirpan was not {{proportionate}} to the objective. [...] It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations. [...] The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school. [...] The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely. [...] The thief would have to seize the claimant and look under the claimant's clothing. [...] Additionally, {{there was little to}} no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools. [...] Although cases involving airline security have resulted in {{the banning of}} kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different people who never know each other. [...] There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent. [...] As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. [...] Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. [...] The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. [...] The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism. [...] If some <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.|$|E

[...] The ITV News article reported that “Some black and ethnic minority students at a leading university have said they are unhappy about being taught by old white professors” The report itself investigated the reasons why a greater proportion of white students at SOAS attain a 2:1 or first class degree, compared to BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) students. Some participants within the report stated that there is an “over representation of white people among staff and students on some courses.” Furthermore, the BME participants highlighted the impact of the “whiteness of the curriculum than that of any other aspect of learning and teaching.” The report also stated that, “discussions dominated by ‘white male students’, made minority female <b>students</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened” and that “Having white students voice dominate was especially frustrating when the discussion was about political or theoretical interventions of people of color, or about racist violence.” One BME student also had issues with “white teachers teaching white students about black/brown people.” Some BME students felt silenced also “by the pressure to communicate using academic language that – for reasons of structural racism – was closer to the everyday speech of middle-class, white students than their own.” The report recommended that “All academics must be prepared to acknowledge that, no matter their research specialism, they are capable of racism, and should be prepared to discuss how.” Other recommendations included “Introduce mandatory unconscious bias workshops for all assessors and staff on recruitment or promotion panels.” ...|$|E
