5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> scenery.|$|E

25|$|In her {{new role}} as a Queen consort, Maria Isabella had neither {{ambition}} nor interest in government to be of any assistance to her placid husband.
