40|$|The {{flooring}} system with its {{connections to the}} supporting column significantly influences the technical quality and performance of the steel-concrete composite design and the overall economic viability of the construction. Expectations of technical and economic flexibility and cost-effectiveness that alternative feasible solutions may offer motivate research and development in this field. This study focuses on the behaviour of beam-column connections in a building frame consisting of slim floor beams. The principal purpose was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the engineering features of semi-continuous composite joints and to apply this knowledge in the design of structures frequently used in Finland. A new advanced structural design connecting a <b>slim</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> to a tubular steel column section filled with concrete was designed using an application of the semi-continuous concept. The design was implemented and the construction tested in a thorough empirical study. Experimental work included two tests on bare steel connections and four tests on composite connections with full-scale specimens. The two tests on the bare steel connections demonstrated the joint behaviour during the erection and concreting work of the floor. Four specimens of composite connections were then tested in order to learn the influence of the slab characteristics on the connection behaviour in terms of the amount of reinforcement used in the slab, the shear-to-moment ratio, and the concrete strength. A mathematical model for predicting the moment-rotation characteristics of the joint response was formulated based on the geometrical and mechanical joint properties and findings from the empirical study. In the model formulation the basic mechanism of force transfer within the components of a composite connection was applied. Derived from the model and validated by the experimental results simple and robust methods that can be used by the designers are proposed. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Os pisos mistos de baixa altura caracterizam um sistema estrutural em que há a incorporação, parcial ou completa, do perfil metálico (viga de aço) na laje de concreto, promovendo a redução da altura da seção e, consequentemente, o aumento da altura útil do pavimento. A incorporação do perfil de aço na laje de concreto garante revestimento ao aço contra o fogo, melhorando o desempenho da viga de aço frente às ações do fogo. Com a finalidade de avaliar o desempenho térmico e estrutural desta solução construtiva, foram desenvolvidos modelos numéricos das vigas parcialmente revestidas presentes nesse sistema estrutural em duas etapas distintas: Na primeira é realizada a análise térmica bidimensional no pacote computacional DIANA para a obtenção dos campos térmicos nas seções transversais das vigas em questão e, a partir daí, considerá-los em um processador de cálculo de momentos plásticos resistentes em todo o intervalo de tempo analisado, sendo então possível avaliar a perda da capacidade portante da seção em função do tempo de exposição ao fogo. A segunda etapa {{consiste}} na criação de modelos numéricos tridimensionais em elementos finitos no pacote computacional DIANA, com o qual é possível obter o comportamento estrutural da viga mista de aço e concreto quando exposta ao incêndio padrão, considerando então os efeitos relativos à inclusão do gradiente de temperatura tais como a perda das propriedades mecânicas, a expansão e a interação entre os materiais. Tendo em vista as funcionalidades do código computacional DIANA, diversos modelos foram construídos procurando atingir a melhor aproximação com os resultados experimentais apresentados na literatura associados ao menor custo computacional possível. Dessa forma, foram analisados casos com (1) interação parcial e total entre o aço e o concreto e com (2) diferentes modelos constitutivos para os materiais em questão. Por fim, os resultados obtidos com a análise numérica a partir do DIANA são comparados com os do método dos momentos plásticos, que por sua vez, apresentam um custo computacional bastante reduzidoSlim floor frames consists on {{structural system}} in which the steel beam is completely or partially inserted in a concrete slab, that is usually used in profiled steel decks systems. The main goal of the <b>slim</b> <b>floor</b> systems is to obtain a minimum height of the composite beam section and, consequently, achieve a higher height of the floor or a lower total height of the building. The partial encasement of the steel beam in the concrete slab provides a thermal protection, improving the behavior of the beam when subjected to fire. In order to evaluate the thermal and structural behavior of the <b>slim</b> <b>floor</b> system, numerical models considering partially encased beams, which {{can be found in the}} <b>slim</b> <b>floor</b> structures, were created. The numerical evaluation procedure was divided in two steps. In the first step, a two-dimensional thermal analysis is carried out using the general finite-element software TNO DIANA to obtain the temperatures gradient in the cross section during the fire exposure time and then, use the data in a computational code developed in FORTRAN which calculates the bearing capacity, over the exposure time, of the <b>slim</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> by means of the plastic moment capacity method, using the reduction factors associated to the mechanical properties of the materials presented in Eurocode 4. The second step consists in to develop three-dimensional numerical models using the software TNO DIANA and then obtain the complete structural behavior of the beam when subjected to a fire condition. Another aspect related to the loss of mechanical properties was also considered, such as the thermal expansion and the interaction between the steel and the concrete. In view of the DIANA functions, several models were developed in order to achieve a better approximation, a low computational cost, of some tests results presented in wide world literature. The cases of partial and complete interaction between the materials were analyzed, as well as the different constitutive models for them, so that the results obtained at the two steps were compared, and an evaluation of the methods was don...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{transferring}} {{mechanisms of}} composite shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> are different with the conventional headed shear studs, {{and have not}} been investigated previously. This paper presents the experimental and analytical studies of the shear transferring mechanisms with the aims to provide information on their shear resistance and behaviour. The composite shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> is {{a new type of}} composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> that consists of an asymmetric steel section with circular web openings and concrete slabs incorporated between the top and bottom flange. The unique feature of the web openings allows tie-bars, building services and ducting to pass through the structural depth of the <b>floor</b> <b>beam,</b> creating an ultra-shallow <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> structure. The shear connection of the composite shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> is formed innovatively by the web openings, as the in-situ concrete passes through the web openings may or may not include the tie-bars or ducting to transfer the longitudinal shear force. In total, 24 push-out tests were carried out to investigate the shear connection under the direct shear force. The effect of loading cycles on the shear connection was also investigated.

40|$|Purpose. The staged {{connections}} of {{the beams}} of railway bridge track-way have the simplest design, but some design flaws result in numerous defects. The purpose of the given work is to research the actual stress-train state of the point of connection of the stringers with the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> on condition of their staged interposition. It is also necessary to determine possible effect of coupled work of deck beam grid and booms on their stress-strain state. Methodology. To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to flange angles of stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and to fillets of lower flange angles of stringers in the points of their support on <b>floor</b> <b>beams.</b> To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s deflectometers, that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> in the middle of the span. Deflectometers were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface. Findings. Stress-strain state of the point of connection of the stringers with the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> on condition of their staged interposition was obtained and analyzed. Analysis indicates that, apart from vertical bending of the stringers and beams, there is a significant effect of horizontal bending of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and their torsion, that occur due to the coupled work of track-way beams and top booms, both for P 0 beam and for other beams.

While testing the span under the train load, there are significant additional stresses from horizontal bending of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and their torsion in the <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> flanges.

In order to examine the strengths of new sets, four scaled sets of one original set, and three new sets, have been manufactured and tested in loading experiments.

40|$|Steel {{concrete}} composite (SCC) flooring {{solutions are}} widely used nowadays as they are lightweight and are quick to erect. Recent research initiatives seek to develop <b>slim</b> <b>floors</b> by minimising the structural depth of the floor section. Ultra Shallow <b>Floor</b> <b>Beams</b> (USFBs) are used to reduce structural depth compared to traditional slabs (Fig 1). USFBs provide an overall reduction in floor-floor height. Concept is shown in Fig 2. It is expected that lightweight, thin and long span slabs will vibrate under certain loads. Resonance creates excessive floor vibrations when the floor’s natural frequency coincides with excitation frequencies e. g. walking, dancing, etc. The main aim was: To provide design guidelines of slabs with perforated USFBs. The objectives were as follows: To extract the dynamic properties of a bare steel perforated USFB. To generate the natural frequencies and modes shapes of the novel USFB slab by investigating the influence of concrete depth, support conditions and web opening spacing. To develop frequency design limits for various floor spans. To develop equivalent geometric properties for the USFB corresponding to the Euler Bernoulli beam of constant cross-section.

Optimized solutions development from {{point of view of}} minimized structural height, high load carrying capacity, simply and very fast erection, versatile utilization and standardized details creates a solid basis for successful and technically efficient usage, not only in scope of concrete, but also steel and composite constructional systems. Reliable solution of fire resistance up to R 180, proved by several realized fire tests and supported by appropriate design procedures, eliminates any needs for special on fire case oriented additional structural improvements. Design process in agreement with EC 3 and EC 4 covers with complexity all the relevant bearing capacity and structural stiffness questions for beams and also for supported slab elements.
