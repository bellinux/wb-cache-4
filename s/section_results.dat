The unusually long text, of four lines for the A section and {{two for the}} B <b>section,</b> <b>results</b> in Bach's solution to repeat {{the end of the}} first line (my eternal good) after all text of A, and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A', thus ending A and A' the same way.

The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the passepied character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: [...] "Bach's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited", and summarises: [...] "The 3/8 time signature, symmetrical phrasing and rapid string skirls combine to create a sense of a dance of abandonment." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{absorption}} {{of tens of thousands}} of Ethiopian Beta Israel, the State of Israel prepared two `Master Plans’ (Ministry of Absorption, 1985, 1991). The first was prepared in 1985, a year after the arrival of the first wave of immigrants. The second updated the first in response to the second wave of immigration in 1991 from Ethiopia. The first Master Plan contained an elaborate and detailed program. It covered issues of housing, education, employment and practical organization, together with policy guidelines regarding specific groups, including women, youths, and single -parent families. Like earlier absorption policies, it adopted a procedural approach which assumed that the immigrants were broadly similar to the existing majority population of Israel. The Plans were created with a firm belief in assimilation. As noted in this <b>section,</b> <b>results</b> have been disappointing and suggest that much greater attention needs to be paid to issues of ethnicity.|$|E

50|$|Palytoxin {{could be}} related to ciguatera seafood {{poisoning}} and thus give rise to a number of symptoms related to this poisoning.Clupeotoxism, poisoning after consuming clupeoid fish, is also suggested to be caused by palytoxin. Neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances are associated with clupeotoxism. The most common complication of palytoxin poisoning is rhabdomyolysis. This involves skeletal muscle breakdown and the leakage of intracellular contents into the blood plasma.Other symptoms associated with palytoxin poisoning in humans are characterized by a bitter/metallic taste, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mild to acute lethargy, paresthesia, bradycardia, renal failure, impairment of sensation, muscle spasms, tremor myalgia, cyanosis, and respiratory distress. In the fatal cases of palytoxin poisoning, the poisoning mostly results in death due to myocardial injury.Exposure to aerosols, as happened in Italy in 2005 and 2006 (see Incidents <b>section),</b> <b>results</b> mainly in respiratory illness. Other symptoms caused by these aerosols include fever associated with serious respiratory disturbances, such as bronchoconstriction, mild dyspnea, and wheezes, while conjunctivitis was observed in some cases. Palytoxin is also classified as a non-TPAtype tumor promoter.|$|E

50|$|The terrain {{varies from}} the mountainous island ranges where it {{originates}} to prairie. It is fed largely by snowmelt and has its highest flow {{rates in the}} spring and early summer. The Musselshell River Basin, including tributaries, drains 108268 acre. The South Fork has lots of brush, gravel bars, and clear water. The North Fork has willow trees and undercut banks. The Musselshell is about 60 ft wide at its confluence of the two forks. Three reservoirs built in the 1930s help control the river's flow: Bair Reservoir on the North Fork, Martinsdale Reservoir near the confluence, and Deadman's Basin on the main river between Shawmut and Ryegate. The river becomes wider in the 50 mi before Roundup. Honeysuckle, wild rose, willow, and cottonwood are common in this section. The river is about 100 ft wide in its last 90 mi, with increased choppiness and flow rate. The relatively more arid climate in this <b>section</b> <b>results</b> in less vegetation, more livestock grazing, and poorer soil. Additional tributaries of the Musselshell include: Middle Fork, Bozeman Fork, Dry Fork, American Creek Fork, Big Elk Creek, Careless Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Flat Willow Creek, Hopley Creek, Spring Creek, Swimming Woman Creek, and Willow Creek.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{strategy}} is to realize a higher-order (greater than 2) digital filter as a cascaded series of second-order [...] "biquadratric" [...] (or [...] "biquad") sections (see digital biquad filter). The advantage of this strategy is that the coefficient range is limited. Cascading direct form II <b>sections</b> <b>results</b> in N delay elements for filters of order N. Cascading direct form I <b>sections</b> <b>results</b> in N + 2 delay elements, since the delay elements of the input of any section (except the first section) are redundant with the delay elements of {{the output of the}} preceding section.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the last}} verse (The Judge's verdict), a {{distorted}} electric guitar enters, playing a leitmotif from the album, a melody first heard in [...] "Another Brick in the Wall" [...] (and most recently reprised in the outro to [...] "Waiting for the Worms"). Here, {{the theme is}} in the key of E minor (indeed, most expressions of this theme have been in E minor, rather than the D minor of [...] "Another Brick in the Wall"), and as in an earlier song from the album, [...] "Hey You," [...] it alternates between E minor (with the notes E, F♯, G, F♯) and A minor (A, B, C, B). However, while that section of [...] "Hey You" [...] alternated between E minor and A minor chords, here the overall tonality of the orchestration is really alternating between E minor and F major, {{in keeping with the}} introduction of the piece. This results in further tension, as the guitar, with its aggressive, distorted tone, is starting on the major third of the second chord, rather than the root as the listener would expect—and concluding on the tritone, B. This, combined with the bass line strictly staying on E and B in this <b>section,</b> <b>results</b> in a harmonic state that is significantly tense and unstable, leading to the explosive sound effect of the wall tumbling down.|$|E
