5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>Her</b> request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death. Julie also found out, so he panicked, and shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtship}} {{and marriage}} between Robert Browning and Elizabeth {{were carried out}} secretly, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> father would disapprove. After a private marriage at St Marylebone Parish Church, they honeymooned in Paris before moving to Italy, in September 1846, which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeth's loyal nurse, Wilson, who witnessed the marriage, accompanied the couple to Italy.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> {{voice was}} good and she liked the attention, {{becoming}} an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, The Diary of Anne Frank, when she was fourteen. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate if ever given the chance. To help achieve that goal, Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays, including some by Shakespeare and Ibsen, and also on her own, studied the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.|$|E

25|$|Eighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom—New Year's Day, 1871: On this {{occasion}} the Boston papers related that “...seldom {{is there an}} occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> prayers had been answered.|$|E
500|$|At the time, de Boer {{was busy}} working in Canada but was unknown {{as an actress}} in the United States. She was called to Los Angeles to {{audition}} in person based {{on the strength of}} the tape, where she performed a four and a half minute scene written specifically for the audition. It was later converted into a scene used in the episode [...] "". She thought she had ruined her audition when she nearly choked on a glass of water as executive producer Rick Berman entered the room and had to run to the bathroom, by which time she had already soaked her clothes and caused her mascara to run. But Behr praised her, saying [...] "We got a good vibe off her, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> part. She got it. And that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Falle {{convinced}} five of {{her friends}} who came from dysfunctional homes to join her in prostitution. Falle said that she and the other girls <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> age who had gone into prostitution had felt as though that was their only remaining option. She said they all tried to stay free of pimps, organized crime, and drugs, but eventually succumbed. Falle later said, [...] "We were prey for every paedophile, pervert, pimp and drug dealer that was out there." [...] The man who had recruited Falle in Chinatown became her pimp. Adults began advertising Falle's sexual services in newspapers. Falle engaged in both indoor and outdoor prostitution, working as an escort, in strip clubs, and at massage parlours. At the legal establishments where she engaged in prostitution, escort drivers engaged in organized crime, selling guns, alcohol, cocaine, and stolen goods and pimping children in massage parlours.|$|E

500|$|Ray's full 243-page {{report was}} {{unsealed}} and made public on October 18, 2000, {{three weeks before}} the Senatorial election. [...] It confirmed that neither Hillary Clinton nor David Watkins would be indicted. [...] It included some new detail, including a somewhat unsubstantiated claim from a friend of Watkins saying that the First Lady had told Watkins to [...] "fire the sons of bitches." [...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings.|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E

2500|$|Twitty {{was also}} criticized for making what have been {{deemed to be}} {{inconsistent}} and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn). [...] According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born editor of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, Aruba Today, who befriended Holloway {{in the early days}} of the investigation, Holloway pandered to tabloid television and her [...] "behavior was odd from the get-go". Renfro noted that [...] "Holloway immediately concluded that her daughter had been kidnapped and made no effort to check hospitals or police", adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on Joran van der Sloot, Twitty [...] "was telling TV interviewers that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> daughter had been gang-raped and murdered".|$|E
2500|$|As police {{descended on}} the neighborhood, a local woman walked up to MacArthur Boulevard {{to see what the}} commotion was about. She noticed the {{burgundy}} Buick, and recalled seeing Mixon in the car during the previous few days. She also knew that Mixon's sister lived in a two-bedroom, ground-level apartment at 2755 74th Avenue, just a block from where the motorcycle officers were shot. Although <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> life would be in danger if she were labeled a [...] "snitch", the woman decided to give this information to an officer she recognized. The information was then relayed to Lieutenant Christopher Mufarreh, who was investigating Mixon's possible whereabouts independently, by an off-duty police lieutenant. Without consultation or coordination with his superiors, Mufarreh ordered a SWAT team to converge on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Both of Melville's grandfathers were {{heroes of}} the Revolutionary War. Major Thomas Melvill (1751–1832) had taken part in the Boston Tea Party, and his {{maternal}} grandfather, General Peter Gansevoort (1749–1812), was famous for having commanded the defense of Fort Stanwix in New York in 1777. Melville found satisfaction in his [...] "double revolutionary descent." [...] Major Melvill sent his son Allan (Herman's father) not to college but to France {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth century, where he spent two years in Paris and learned to speak and write French fluently. He subscribed to his father's Unitarianism. In 1814, Allan married Maria Gansevoor, who was committed to the Dutch Reformed version of the Calvinist creed of her family. The severe Protestantism of the Gansevoort's tradition ensured that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> Bible well, in English as well as in Dutch, the language she had grown up speaking with her parents.|$|E

2500|$|Peña {{participated in}} the 2012 Summer Olympics in London {{as one of the}} {{favorite}} competitors for her execution of the movement with the highest difficulty in the vault apparatus (7.1), she qualified fifth in vault scoring 14.933 with the Produnova and 14.466 with the double twisting yurchenko for a final average score of 14.699. She also scored 12.300, ranking 72nd in floor exercise. In the vault finals, Peña suddenly stopped running {{in the middle of her}} first vault attempt. She then restarted the vault and sat down her handspring-double front, earning a 0.1 penalty and scoring 14.566. She then landed her second vault with a little step, earning a 14.466, averaging 14.516 and finishing in sixth place. She later said nervousness was not the reason for her failure and that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> dreamed-of medal chances were lost before the second attempt. She also said that she wanted to be remembered with the quotation: [...] "The possibility to realize a dream is what makes life interesting".|$|E
2500|$|Berenson {{obtained}} press credentials {{for herself}} and her photographer to the Congress of Peru, papers which were later reported by the media to be [...] "false journalist credentials". Her support website states that [...] "After half a decade of hands-on experience ... Lori was able to obtain assignments from two U.S. publications, Modern Times and Third World Viewpoint, to work as a free-lance journalist. At the time of her arrest she was researching articles about the effects of poverty on women in Perú. Her parents are in possession of some of the transcripts of her work, but the Peruvian anti-terrorist police took most of it when her apartment was searched." [...] Her photographer, Nancy Gilvonio, was actually the wife of Néstor Cerpa, the MRTA second-in-command — although Berenson claims she was unaware of this connection and claimed that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> only as a Bolivian photographer. Berenson had entered the main Congress building with Gilvonio several times during 1995 to interview members of Congress. Gilvonio was alleged to have provided the information she collected to the MRTA including detailed information on the floor plans of Congress, its security and members. The plan was for the MRTA to invade the Congress building, kidnap the legislators, and exchange the hostages for MRTA prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|From {{tapes of}} Genie's {{first two months}} in the hospital, {{linguists}} discerned that by January 1971 <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> own name, the words mother and father, the four color words red, blue, green, and brown, the words no and sorry, and a few miscellaneous nouns such as jewelry box, door, and bunny. She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them {{in the context of}} sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her active vocabulary at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Neptune {{entered the}} battle about 25 {{minutes after the}} start of the action, having by then drifted to leeward and fallen astern of Redoutable. Neptune should have had the {{position}} immediately astern of Bucentaure, but the [...] Spanish 74-gun San Justo, which should have been four places astern of Neptune had drifted up to leeward. Maistral hailed San Justo The San Justo not being in her station and edging down to place herself on my windward beam hampered me; I at once hailed her to enquire if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> station; I told her that mine was to be next astern to the Bucentaure; she replied that she was about to place herself astern of me, which she did not do, and continued to the wind and to fore-reach on me, which made me fall off a little to leeward and to draw away from the flagship, of whom I had been within hail in the first place. San Justos captain, Francisco Javier Garstón, blamed the crew's inexperience for failing to keep her station. This would be significant in the coming battle as the position astern of the flagship would be the focus of British attention, and should have been occupied by a powerful ship like the Neptune. Meanwhile, the ship that should have been astern of Neptune, the Spanish 64-gun San Leandro, was following San Justo to leeward, leaving a considerable gap behind the flagship that the British could exploit. Redoutables captain, Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, saw the threat, and brought his ship forward in an attempt to close the gap. Despite his efforts, the British were able to break the line between Bucentaure and Redoubtable.|$|E
2500|$|Kathleen Mary [...] "Kathy" [...] Griffin {{was born}} on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, to Mary Margaret [...] "Maggie" [...] Griffin (née Corbally; born June 10, 1920) and John Patrick Griffin (October 29, 1915 – February 17, 2007), both first-generation Irish Americans. Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who needed to talk, all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and {{the place where she}} learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>her</b> eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or {{be in the same room}} as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
