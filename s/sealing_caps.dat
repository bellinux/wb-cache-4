40|$|Background: In {{minimally}} invasive surgery, force feed-back information on tissue manipulation is altered by {{friction between the}} instrument and the sealing mecha-nism of the trocar. It is unknown how the different sealing mechanisms of currently available trocars influ-ence the friction forces. The current study investigated the dynamic changes in friction for various trocars at different instrument velocities. Methods: The friction characteristics for six common types of trocars were determined. A force sensor {{was attached to the}} shaft of a standard 5 -mm disposable grasper to measure the forces required to move it through the trocars. Movement velocity and direction of the shaft were controlled by a servomotor. In addition, whether moistening the shaft reduced friction was tes-ted. Results: The friction depended on the type of trocar, the movement velocity, and the movement direction, and varied between 0. 25 and 3. 0 N. Specifically, trocars with narrow <b>sealing</b> <b>caps</b> (i. e., high normal force onto the shaft) and trocars with thick <b>sealing</b> <b>caps</b> (i. e., large contact area) generate a high amount of friction. Moistening the shaft reduced friction 15 % to 45 %. For most trocars, large fluctuations in forces occur when the movement starts or when the direction reverses. The magnitude of these fluctuations varied between 0. 2 and 2. 5 N. Conclusions: For some trocars, friction can be as great as the forces associated with instrument–tissue interac-tion. At movement reversals, friction fluctuates due to deformations of the rubber and silicon parts of the sealing mechanism. Such high variance can deteriorate surgical performance during high precision tasks (e. g., tissue manipulation) that typically involve many chan-ges in movement direction. Comparisons of the inves-tigated trocars indicate that the friction magnitude and variance can be reduced easily by changing the proper-ties of the sealing cap or by lubricating the instruments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep-sea {{electric}} and optical connections {{can often be}} problematic. Several manufacturers propose wet-mateable connectors based on integrated valve systems but the complexity and precision needed to reach the required reliability result in high cost. We are therefore developing {{a new type of}} tooling for connecting cheap standard wet-mateable connectors under oil in deep sea water pressure conditions. Complexity is delocalised from the connector to the easily recoverable and reparable tooling. The cost of wet connections is consequently expected to be drastically reduced, with reliability enhanced. The tooling contains 2 carriers sliding on a linear stage together with a second perpendicular stage intersecting the line between the carriers. The carriers and linear stages are enclosed in a clam-shelled oil-fillable volume. Each half of the connector to be mated is fixed to its respective carrier in a ROV operation. The waterproof caps of the two connectors automatically attach to the third carrier on the perpendicular stage. Seawater around the connectors is replaced with non-conductive oil, and both halves of the connector are detached from their <b>sealing</b> <b>caps,</b> which are then moved sideways to allow the connector to be mated under oil. The clamshells are then opened, allowing the mated connector to be removed by the ROV. A reverse capping procedure is applied for disconnection...|$|E

The cell pellet was washed with buffer (45.9  mM K 2 HPO 4 and 8.8  mM KH 2 PO 4, pH  7.5) and recentrifuged twice under the same conditions. The cells were then resuspended in phosphate buffer to an OD 660 of 0.3.

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{shells of}} vibratory cylinder gyroscopes are commonly packaged in metallic caps. In order {{to lower the}} production cost, a portion of vibratory cylinder gyroscopes do not employ vacuum packaging. However, under non-vacuum packaging conditions there can be internal acoustic noise leading to considerable acoustic pressure which is exerted on the resonant shell. Based on {{the theory of the}} structural-acoustic coupling, the dynamical behavior of the resonant shell under acoustic pressure is presented in this paper. A finite element (FE) model is introduced to quantitatively analyze the effect of the structural-acoustic coupling. Several main factors, such as <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> sizes and degree of vacuum which directly affect the vibration of the resonant shell, are studied. The results indicate that the vibration amplitude and the operating frequency of the resonant shell will be changed when the effect of structural-acoustic coupling is taken into account.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{study on the}} geological characteristics of a multi-coalbed reservoir using coal cores collected from well drilling tests in Bide-Santang Basin, China. The study focuses on {{the investigation of the}} coalbed methane (CBM) -bearing property, porosity and permeability, sealability of capping rocks, and groundwater characteristics in coal seams, providing the experimental information on the control function of sequence strata for the coalbed methane. This reservoir is comprised {{of a large number of}} coalbeds and exhibits many distinctive geological characteristics of a CBM reservoir, such as high CBM content, complex vertical volatility of CBM content, vertical discontinuous distribution of porosity and permeability, strong <b>sealing</b> <b>capping</b> property and many vertical water-bearing systems, etc. The investigation shows that the unattached multiple superposed CBM-bearing system (UMSCS), which formed the unique multi-coalbed CBM reservoir, can be identified in the study area. Depending on the development scale of vertically unattached CBM-bearing coal seams, the CBM reservoir in the study area can be classified as simple UMSCS and complex UMSCS. The former, typically appearing in Zhuzang syncline and Agong syncline, exhibits the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics in terms of less coal seams, much weaker sealability of capping rocks, higher CBM content, and many vertical water-bearing systems. The latter, typically represented by Shuigonghe syncline and Santang syncline, shows the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics with a large number of coal seams, strong <b>sealing</b> <b>capping</b> property, and reasonably high CBM content. For simple UMSCS reservoirs, a sublevel exploitation method should be adopted for CBM exploitation in order to minimize the effect caused by larger variation of the reservoir energy in different systems. For complex UMSCS reservoirs, one effective way for CBM exploitation is to fracture virtual reservoir (mainly key sandstone member) to depressurize it uniformly and thus achieve large-scale discharging and mining in several adjacent CBM-bearing subsystems...|$|R

30|$|The Mesozoic {{carbonate}} {{systems of}} the Persian Gulf contain most of the extensive reservoir rocks {{in this area and}} form one of the richest hydrocarbon provinces in the world.
