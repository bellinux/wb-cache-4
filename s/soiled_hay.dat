Previous studies successfully used stable isotopes to separate organic and conventional products, but up to now, this approach was not tested for organic grassland <b>hay</b> and <b>soil.</b> Moreover, isotopic abundances could be a powerful tool to elucidate differences in ecosystem functioning and driving mechanisms of element cycling in organic and conventional management systems. Here, we studied the d 15 N and d 13 C isotopic composition of <b>soil</b> and <b>hay</b> samples of 21 organic and 34 conventional grasslands in two German regions. We also used Dd 15 N (d 15 N plant - d 15 N soil) to characterize nitrogen dynamics. In order to detect temporal trends, isotopic abundances in organic grasslands {{were related to the}} time since certification. Furthermore, discriminant analysis was used to test whether the respective management type can be deduced from observed isotopic abundances. Isotopic analyses revealed no significant differences in d 13 C in hay and d 15 N in both <b>soil</b> and <b>hay</b> between management types, but showed that d 13 C abundances were significantly lower in soil of organic compared to conventional grasslands. Dd 15 N values implied that management types did not substantially differ in nitrogen cycling. Only d 13 C in <b>soil</b> and <b>hay</b> showed significant negative relationships with the time since certification. Thus, our result suggest that organic grasslands suffered less from drought stress compared to conventional grasslands most likely due to a benefit of higher plant species richness, as previously shown by manipulative biodiversity experiments. Finally, it was possible to correctly classify about two third of the samples according to their management using isotopic abundances in <b>soil</b> and <b>hay.</b> However, as {{more than half of the}} organic samples were incorrectly classified, we infer that more research is needed to improve this approach before it can be efficiently used in practice...|$|R

In addition to apathogenic types, i. e. unharmful to human and animal health, there are also types of mycobacteria that can cause disease in humans and animals. These zoonotic agents are roughly subdivided into “tuberculous” and “nontuberculous” mycobacteria. The first include the closely related pathogens of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which cause common tuberculosis. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (mycobacteriosis) are caused by pathogens of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAIC). Both pathogenic species can also infect pigs. Available statistics show that the number of infections are low (0. 15 to 0. 5 % of slaughtered animals have potentially pathogenic mycobacteria). According to currently available findings it appears highly improbable that humans are infected with tuberculous mycobacteria through foodstuffs produced from pork. In addition, there are no known cases in which the transmission of mycobacterioses, which can be caused by the nontuberculous mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium avium-intra¬cellulare complex, occurred through foodstuffs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 An {{ecological}} {{study of a}} microorganism similar to that isolated in 1956 and designated as Micrococcus radiodurans indicated that the organism could be isolated from several different environments. By taking advantage of its radio-resistivity, high levels of gamma radiation {{were used in the}} isolation procedures to inactivate most of the non-resistant microflora. By this means, microorganisms resembling M. radiodurans were isolated from ground beef and pork sausage as well as from beef hides and water from Cox Creek (Albany Oregon).

Pre-incubation and pre-inoculation experiments indicated that M. radiodurans did not compete well with the natural micro-flora present in meat and soil samples. The use of enrichment culture techniques and incubation of the samples before irradiation did not facilitate the isolation of M. radiodurans. The presence of NZ-Case (a tryptic digest of casein) in the isolation medium produced more luxuriant growth than TGYM medium but the radiation sensitivity of M. radiodurans increased ten-fold in the former medium and the degree of pigmentation was less. Subsequent studies using thin layer chromatography indicated that the less resistant strain was lacking two of the eight pigments present in the more resistant culture. The degree of resistance was inversely related to the concentration of NZ-Case in the growth medium at all of the levels tested. At the highest level of NZ-Case used (0. 5 percent), the LD₅₀ dose was 350 k rads as compared to 700 k rads when TGYM was the growth medium. The resistance to ultraviolet radiation was also reduced. Removal of NZ-Case from the growth medium resulted in a return of the high level of resistance and the reappearance of the missing pigments. A possible role of the pigments in the radiation resistance of this organism was thus suggested and described. In this role the pigments would serve as scavengers of toxic ions and radicals produced by radiation and thus protect the functionally important lipids and lipoproteins of the cell membranes from being altered with resultant release of cellular enzymes. Spectral analysis of the eight pigments indicated that they were all closely related and were tentatively identified as lycopene, hydroxy lycopene or di-hydroxy lycopene. None of the pigments absorbed in the ultraviolet range. Pigments obtained from cells grown in NZ broth had the same spectral characteristics but were present in reduced concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative {{coccobacillus}} {{capable of}} surviving {{for weeks at}} low temperatures in water, moist <b>soil,</b> <b>hay,</b> straw, or decaying animal carcasses. F. tularensis is the causative of the zoonotic disease tularemia. F. tularensis {{is one of the}} most infectious bacterial pathogens known, as few as 10 - 50 organisms can cause disease. Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected arthropods; handling infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil and inhalation of infective aerosols. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. F. tularensis have few subspecies: 1) F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A), highly virulent, found only in North America. The bacterium is transmitted among animals and from animals to humans by ticks, occasionally deerfly, or by aerosols; 2) F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (type B), moderately virulent, occurs in Eurasia and North America, mainly associated with streams, lakes, ponds, rivers and semi-aquatic animals such as muskrats and beavers (water-borne disease). Type B tularemia has been observed during war times (during Second World War 100 000 cases occurred each year, in Kosovo in 2000 and 2003 over 300 cases each year); 3) F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica, rarely reported, isolated only in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan; 4) F. tularensis subsp. novicida is of low virulence, isolated in USA, Canada, Spain and Australia; 5) F. tularensis subsp. philomiragia, is of low virulence, associated with salt water (Atlantic, Mediterranean). Tularemia is very rear in Macedonia, but in 1996 an epidemic of glandular/oral-pharyngeal tularemia occurs in East part of the country (26 cases confirmed by serology only, subspecies not confirmed). F. tularensis could be used as a biological weapon in a number of ways. Release in a dense populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning after 3 – 5 days (incubation 1 – 14 days). An aerosol release would likely have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Airborne F. tularensis would be expected to principally cause pleuropneumonitis, might contaminate the eye (ocular tularaemia); penetrate broken skin (ulceroglandular or glandular disease); or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. Stockpiling effective antibiotics to treat infected people, coordinating a nation-wide program, sharing of information, education for health professionals (prevention, diagnosis, treatment), public and the media are essential needs for prevention and control of tularemia, occurred naturally or by possible bio attack by F. tularensis.

Moreover, scarcity of irrigation water has prompted the use of greywater, which contain variable concentrations of organic compounds such as anionic surfactants. <b>Soils</b> added with <b>hay,</b> maize straw or peat at 1 % w/w were irrigated, at field capacity (FC) or saturated (S), with an aqueous solution of the anionic surfactant Aerosol 22 (A 22), corresponding to an addition of 200 mg C/kg soil/day. Soil solution was extracted after one month and analyzed for total soluble metals, dissolved soil organic matter and UV absorbance at 254 nm. Speciation analyses were performed with WHAM VI for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. For selected scenarios, metal uptake by barley was determined. Metal mobility increased for all treatments and soils (Pb>Cu>Cd≥Zn) compared to control assays. The increase was significantly correlated (p< 0. 05) with soil organic matter solubilisation for Cd (R= 0. 68), Cu (R= 0. 73) and Zn (R= 0. 86). Otherwise, Pb release was related to aluminum solubilisation (R= 0. 75), which suggests that Pb was originally co-precipitated with Al-DOC complexes in the solid phase.

Grazing greatly reduced the survival and biomass of both target species and its effects were reinforced by summer drought: plants that did not establish well enough during the autumn and spring did not survive summer. The restored rock cover had a mild positive effect, particularly on B. retusum. There were no negative or positive plant neighbor interactions in the steppe, while there was competition in both abandoned fields. Competition was particularly intense in the abandoned melon field, composed of a dense sward of annual grasses (Bromus sp.).

While pathogen reduction from manures and CAFO discharges currently is not being regulated, the issue of pathogens may be addressed in the future. Therefore, data regarding the risks and solutions are needed for informed future decisions. We currently are examining the occurrence and persistence of bacterial pathogens in an alternative beef feedlot runoff control-vegetative treatment system (Woodbury et al., 2003). Runoff from feedlot pen surfaces is collected in a flat-bottom basin which provides temporary liquid storage and accumulates solids. When adequate volume is attained, the liquid fraction is discharged from the basin into a 6 ha vegetative treatment area (VTA) of bromegrass which is harvested as hay. Samples analyzed include manure from the pens, liquid and solids from the basin, and <b>soil</b> and <b>hay</b> from the VTA. Basin discharge can introduce both pathogens and generic E. coli into the VTA. Without additional inputs from the basin, isolation frequencies of E. coli O 157 and Campylobacter spp. from VTA soils decrease over time. Similarly, levels of generic E. coli in soil initially decrease rapidly, but lower residual populations may persist for long periods.

In experiment II, with a higher soil-to-hay ratio and mites, springtails and potworms as faunal treatments, N 2 O emissions increased with potworms from 51. 9 (control) to 123. 5 mg N 2 O-N m- 2. Experiment III studied the effect of potworm density; we found that higher densities of potworms accelerated the peak of the N 2 O emissions by 5 days (P < 0. 001), but the cumulative N 2 O emissions remained unaffected. We propose that increased soil aeration by the soil fauna reduced N 2 O emissions in experiment I, whereas in experiment II N 2 O emissions were driven by increased nitrogen and carbon availability.
