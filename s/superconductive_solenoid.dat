50|$|PLUTO was {{the first}} {{electromagnetic}} <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoid</b> in the world, with a very uniform axial magnetic field of 12000 Gauss, to operate in a straight section of e+e&minus; accelerators at DESY, first with DORIS I (a storage ring at center of mass energies of ~3-5 GeV) in 1974-1976, then with DORIS II (the upgraded storage ring of DORIS I at center of mass energies of ~7-10 Gev) in 1978 and later with PETRA (also a storage ring, at larger center of mass energies of ~10-45 GeV) in 1978-1982 (see review).|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} are to experimentally confirm several advanced design concepts on the Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS). The advanced design concepts {{were identified as}} potential improvements by Madison Magnetics, Inc. (MMI) during 1984 and 1985 studies of an MSBS utilizing 14 external superconductive coils and a <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoid</b> in an airplane test model suspended in a wind tunnel. This study confirmed several advanced design concepts on magnetic suspension and balance systems. The 1989 MSBS redesign {{is based on the}} results of these experiments. Savings of up to 30 percent in supporting magnet ampere meters and 50 percent in energy stored over the 1985 design were achieved...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} suspension and balance {{system is designed}} to support models of aircraft or other objects in wind tunnels by means of magnetic forces. Major design improvements have been achieved, resulting in reductions of the system size, weight, and cost. These improvements are due to: (1) the use of holmium in the model core to increase its magnetic moment, (2) {{the use of a}} powerful new permanent magnet material in the model wings, (3) a new arrangement for the roll coils, and (4) the use of a nonmetallic structure to eliminate eddy current losses. The conceptual design of the holmium core <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoid</b> and of the new permanent magnet wing assembly is described in detail. The discussion includes comparisons of the pole strengths for different model core magnets, the design of a superconducting solenoid and cryostat, and the analysis of model wing magnetic requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{magnetic}} levitation and control is introduced for levitation above a plane. A set of five vertical solenoid magnets mounted flush below the plane supports and controls {{the model in}} five degrees of freedom. The compact system of levitation coils is contained in a space 2. 4 m (96 in) diameter by 1 m (40 in) deep with {{the top of the}} levitation system 0. 9 m (36 in) below the center line of the suspended model. The levitated model has a permanent magnet core held in position by the five parallel <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoids</b> symmetrically located in a circle. The control and positioning system continuously corrects for model position in five dimensions using computer current pulses superimposed on the levitation coil base currents. The conceptual designs include: superconductive and Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet model cores and levitation <b>solenoids</b> of either <b>superconductive,</b> cryoresistive, or room temperature windings...|$|R
40|$|The design {{improvements}} for {{the system}} encompass 14 or 18 external superconductive coils mounted on a 8 x 8 foot wind tunnel, a superconductive model core magnet on a holmium mandrel to fit an F- 16 model, model wings of permanent magnet material Nd 2 Fe 14 B, and fiber glass epoxy structure. The Magnetic Suspension and Balance System (MSBS) advanced design is confirmed by the successful construction and test of a full size <b>superconductive</b> model core <b>solenoid</b> with holmium mandrel. The solenoid is 75 cm long and 12. 6 cm in diameter and produces 6. 1 tesla for a hold time of 47 minutes. An integrated coil system design of a new compact configuration without specific coils for roll or pitch shows promise of simplicity; magnet reductions of 30 percent compared {{to the most recent}} 1985 design are possible...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of magnetic levitation of hydrogen gas bubble surrounded by liquid hydrogen confined in a semi-transparent spherical shell of 3 mm internal diameter. Such shells {{are used as}} targets for the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), for which a homogeneous (within a few percent) layer of a hydrogen isotope should be deposited on the internal walls of the shells. The gravity does not allow the hydrogen layer thickness to be homogeneous. To compensate this gravity effect, {{we have used a}} non-homogeneous magnetic field created by a 10 T <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoid.</b> Our experiments show that the magnetic levitation homogenizes the thickness of liquid hydrogen layer. However, the variation of the layer thickness is very difficult to measure experimentally. Our theoretical model allows the exact shape of the layer to be predicted. The model takes into account the surface tension, gravity, van der Waals, and magnetic forces. The numerical calculation shows that the homogeneity of the layer thickness is satisfactory for the ICF purposes...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{compact design}} for a superconducting magnetic suspension and balance system for an 8 ft. x 8 ft. transonic wind tunnel is developed. The original design of an MSBS in NASA Cr- 3802 utilized 14 external superconductive coils and a <b>superconductive</b> <b>solenoid</b> in the airplane test model suspended in a wind tunnel. The improvements are in the following areas: test model solenoid options, dynamic force limits on the model, magnet cooling options, structure and cryogenic designs, power supply specifications, and cost and performance evaluations. The improvements are: MSBS cost reduction of 28 %, weight; reduction of 43 %, magnet system ampere-meter reduction of 38 %, helium liquifier capacity reduction by 33 %, magnet system stored energy reduction by 55 %, AC loss to liquid helium reduced by 76 %, system power supply reduced by 68 %, test coil pole strength increased by 19 %, wing magnetization increased by 40 %, and control frequency limit increased by 200 % from 10 Hz to 30 Hz. The improvements are due to: magnetic holmium coil forms in the test model, better rare earth permanent magnets in the wings, fiberglass-epoxy structure replacing stainless steel, better coil configuration, and new saddle roll coil design...|$|E
