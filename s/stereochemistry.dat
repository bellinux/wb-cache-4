The co-occurrence in the oil of the three cedrane-type arrangements (cedrane, 1, 7 -diepi-cedrane and 2 -epi-cedrane) has permitted, after a thorough 2 D NMR analysis the unequivocal spectroscopical assignment {{of each of the}} three cedrane skeletons, and subsequently the development of an unambiguous method for establishing their <b>stereochemistries.</b> A useful pattern for distinguishing between the two duprezianane <b>stereochemistries</b> is also given. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial <b>stereochemistry.</b> The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
5|$|The <b>stereochemistry</b> of the archaeal {{glycerol}} moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of the bromo-beta-lactones obtained by addition of bromine to aqueous solutions of disodium 2, 3 -dimethylmaleate and 2, 3 -dimethylfumarate reveals <b>stereochemistries</b> opposite to those originally assigned in 1937 : cis alkene yields erythro lactone, and trans alkene yields threo lactone. B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d) calculations using a PCM description of aqueous solvation confirm the validity of our proposed mechanism, in which the first-formed intermediate in each case is an a-lactone. The cyclic bromonium species is not an intermediate. An alternative pathway leading directly from cis alkene to cis lactone, via an unusual frontside displacement mechanism, is over 20 kJ mol(- 1) higher in free energy.

25|$|In {{the highly}} {{versatile}} and widely used Evans’ Aldol Reaction, allylic strain {{played a major}} role in the development of the reaction. The Z enolate was created to avoid the allylic strain with oxazolidinone. The formation of a specific enolate enforces the development of relative <b>stereochemistry</b> throughout the reaction, making the aldol reaction a very predictive and useful methodology out there to synthesize chiral molecules.

25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to <b>stereochemistry</b> or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific <b>stereochemistry.</b> This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined <b>stereochemistry.</b> While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E
