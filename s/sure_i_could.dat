500|$|Gillard's {{mother told}} ABC TV's Australian Story program that Gillard had spoken {{from a young}} age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have. There's {{something}} in me that's focused and single-minded and if I {{was going to do}} that, I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done this." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where I was <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2014, Haye became vegan. He also {{launched}} his own range of vegan protein. Haye gave up eating animal products {{at the beginning}} of 2014 and was immediately open about his reasons for doing so. [...] "I watched a TV documentary about how animals are farmed, killed and prepared for us to eat," [...] he explained. [...] "I saw all those cows and pigs and realised I couldn't {{be a part of it}} any more. It was horrible. I did some research to make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still obtain enough protein to fight and, once satisfied that I could, I stopped. I'll never go back." [...] He was named one of PETA's Sexiest Vegan Celebrities of 2014 in UK.|$|E

6000|$|... "Let me help you," [...] she begged. [...] "Do! This is not {{a matter}} of {{politics}} or anything compromising. <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be useful to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|For many, {{the only}} {{justification}} for the 'flank march' was an immediate assault upon Sevastopol. George Cathcart, commander of the British 4th Division, pleaded with Raglan for instant action. [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk into it, with scarcely {{the loss of a}} man," [...] wrote Cathcart to Raglan on 28 September from the heights above the eastern approach to the city. [...] "We could leave our packs, and run into it even in open day … We see people walking about the streets in great consternation ..." [...] But caution prevailed, and plans by Burgoyne for a formal siege, backed by Canrobert, were prepared. When Raglan told Cathcart that nothing would happen until the Allied siege trains had been landed, Cathcart could not hide his irritation, [...] "Land the siege trains! But my dear Lord Raglan, what the devil is there to knock down?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Franklin loved {{travelling}} abroad, particularly trekking. She first [...] "qualified" [...] at Christmas 1929 for {{a vacation}} at Menton, France, where her grandfather went to escape English winter. Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle as [...] "vastly superior to that of English". In contrast, she described English people as having [...] "vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency". Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home. In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued. But she wrote to her mother, [...] "I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wander happily in France forever. I love the people, {{the country and the}} food." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brady played college {{football}} for the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999. He was a backup quarterback {{for his first}} two years, while teammate and future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, which was capped by {{a victory in the}} Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship. When he enrolled at Michigan, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and he had an intense struggle to get some playing time. At one point, Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and even considered transferring to California. He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and to maximize his performance on the field. Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: [...] "He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Violet, [...] "I am not {{altogether}} <b>sure.</b> Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost fancy {{that you have}} been thinking of nothing beyond what you are doing in that horrible cañon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`You let me an' little Spinks alone,' I replied angrily, {{yet with}} some hesitation, for I {{did not feel}} quite <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> thrash Turner. <b>I</b> {{expected}} a sharp rejoinder, but he merely smiled and turned away.|$|R
60|$|CLARE. I believe--I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> earn my living. Quite serious.|$|E
60|$|So {{that was}} the {{beginning}} of our married life. More than ever, I felt <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust in Harold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that, mamma; {{and indeed}} I am very happy. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not ever have liked any one else since I first knew him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. I {{left before}} five, being <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get here {{in an hour and}} a half. I have been riding up and down these dreary hills for nearly five hours. You have dined?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir; {{it is not}} any planned {{manner of}} mine at all,' she said earnestly. 'But you will see, <b>I</b> am <b>sure,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{go down to the}} hall with you without putting myself in a wrong light.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} I ought {{to offer you}} my excuses for being here, though <b>I</b> am not <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help it," [...] he said. [...] "Grant Devine is of a {{somewhat}} determined disposition, and he insisted on bringing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Tom. I felt {{it myself}} {{so much that}} I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not wish my worst enemy to go through such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not do that," [...] said Rollo. [...] "And I {{should not}} think that any body but a monkey could do it, or a spider." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were ance at Lunnon," [...] said Jeanie, in exculpation, [...] "I am amaist <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get {{means to}} speak to the queen about my sister's life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are right}} then," [...] he murmured. [...] "I felt <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be mistaken. This {{is the place}} they have made their headquarters. That fellow has gone out to fetch somebody. Soon we shall have some amusement." ...|$|R
60|$|This was true, {{but it was}} maddening to {{be obliged}} to sit there with an empty gun, when if I had but one charge, or even my pistol, <b>I</b> was <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have blinded or {{crippled}} this satanic pachyderm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} it over since," [...] he went on rapidly; [...] "you were right. I cannot work--it is not in me. But I have always felt that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make a name for}} myself--for you--in the army. <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> command a regiment. And now the time is coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} plenty of pluck, Alexis, or you never could have gone on walking with such feet as those. I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have done so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope it won't be a {{long way}} to let oneself down," [...] Surajah said, [...] "for I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not hold on, by that thin rope, for any distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{would rather}} fast {{for a week}} than {{run the risk of}} the ship being broken up on the rocks," [...] Wulf replied. [...] "I can swim but little even in calm water, and <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing among those waves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What nonsense! Charlie {{is one of}} my {{favorite}} young men. I am not at all <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spare him, even to Lois. But the poor boy must marry someone! I don't see how else he is to live. By the bye, who is your protégé?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is capital, Father. I {{had a lot}} of {{practice}} in rope climbing, before I came out, and <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage with the help that would give. I don't think Surajah could, but we could let him down first, easily. Now, as to your prison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's rather late {{to try for}} Rough Firth, but I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{find the}} Barbara Deep if we let her run. If we missed it and went ashore, she'd soon break up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Luigi, if {{you would}} only smoke a little milder tobacco, I am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn not to mind it in time, but this is so strong, and the pipe is so rank that--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} delighted to come, Mr. Haw," [...] cried Laura, with her sweetest smile. [...] "A good deal of my time just now is taken up in looking after the poor people, who find the cold weather very trying." [...] Robert raised his eyebrows, for {{it was the first}} he had heard of his sister's {{missions}} of mercy, but Mr. Raffles Haw nodded approvingly. [...] "Robert was telling us of your wonderful hot-houses. <b>I</b> am <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> transport the whole parish into one of them, and give them a good warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have known}} me for so short a time," [...] she argued. [...] "How can you {{possibly}} be <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give you what you want? And in any case, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> give anything except my eager wishes, my friendship--perhaps, if you will, my affection? But would that bring you content?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{part of a}} psychopathic {{killer was}} {{completely}} different to anything Fabian had done.
