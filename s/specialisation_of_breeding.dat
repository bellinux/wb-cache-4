40|$|In this {{tutorial}} the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> declarative logic {{programs is}} presented. The main correctness results are given, and {{the outline of}} a basic algorithm for partial evaluation of a logic program with respect to a goal. The practical considerations of gaining efficiency (and not losing any) are discussed. A renaming scheme for performing structure specialisation is then described, and illustrated on a well-known string matching example. The basic algorithm is enhanced by incorporating abstract interpretation. A two-phase specialisation is then described and illustrated, in which partial evaluation is followed by the detection and removal of useless clauses. This is shown for the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> a proof procedure for first order logic. The <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> meta programs is very important in logic programming, and the ground representation for object programs has to be handled. Some techniques for doing this are described. Comparisons are made in the tutorial to similar work in other programming languages, and the similarities and differences between them and logic program specialisation is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} specialisation {{trends in}} 32 manufacturing industries across 13 European countries over the 1972 - 1996 period. We find that sectoral employment specialisation measured by locational Gini indices has been generally increasing, {{and that the}} dissimilarity of industrial structures among the sample countries has grown. Specialisation is most pronounced in “traditional ” resource- and labour-intensive sectors, but {{there are signs of}} increasing clustering in technology-intensive industries since the mid- 1980 s. <b>Specialisation</b> <b>of</b> exports, whilst decreasing on average, is stronger than <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> employment.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{relation}} between industrial specialisation and geographic concentration of industries, these are two different concepts. After clarifying both, the aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the structural change on Portuguese manufacturing industry from two perspectives: the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> regions in particular sectors and the regional concentration of those sectors (industries). Our empirical study uses yearly data for the period 1996 - 2004 and made use of absolute indicators to measure whether individual industries became more or less concentrated in Portuguese regions, and whether the industry structure of the Portuguese regions became more similar. In the first case we talk about geographical concentration of industries, in the second about a decrease <b>of</b> sectoral <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> regions. The results suggest a high level of concentration and a variable level <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> between regions.

40|$|This paper {{employs the}} concept of {{technology}} efficiency to analyse the optimal degree <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> organic arable farms. Based on bookkeeping data from 461 organic farms, three technology specific frontiers (each representing a different degree <b>of</b> <b>specialisation)</b> and an all-encompassing metafrontier are estimated {{using a combination of}} Data Envelopment Analysis and Window Analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of sample farms have not chosen their optimal degree <b>of</b> <b>specialisation.</b> We quantify the potential productivity gain from switching to the optimal specialisation class. This is highest for moderately specialised farms switching to higher degrees <b>of</b> <b>specialisation.</b> We demonstrate that there are significant differences in the structure of inputs and outputs between farms that have chosen the optimal degree <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> and those that have not. We further identify the factors determining whether a farm should switch to a more specialised or a more diversified organisation of enterprises. organic arable farming, business strategies, optimal degree <b>of</b> <b>specialisation,</b> technology efficiency, Data Envelopment Analysis, Window Analysis, Farm Management, Production Economics, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} and formalises {{an approach to}} the evolution of the organisation of industry which starts from multi-activity firms, and which relates to economists like Young, Stigler, and Richardson. To capture the open-ended process of disintegration of industry, the paper operates with decomposable tasks and gives an account of the vertical and horizontal structure of production by means of weighted trees — in the graphtheoretical sense. Based on this addition to the analytical toolbox, the paper gives an account of the decomposition of industry as driven by the structural innovations and process innovations of firms that specialise and exchange in an open-ended evolutionary process.

40|$|Sharks are {{traditionally}} classified as generalists that use a {{diverse range of}} habitats and prey. While this is an accurate description of some species, sharks exhibit a range of resource use strategies that affect their influence on communities. These strategies also influence resilience {{in the face of}} environmental and anthropogenic effects. Identifying resource use patterns is critical to understanding sharks in aquatic environments. However, despite the rapid increase in studies focused on measuring the dietary and habitat selection patterns of sharks, discussion on how to define the ecological <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> sharks has been limited. This is an impediment to communication and research as definitions <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> and how to measure it vary based on context. This review presents a conceptual framework within which to define the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> sharks that can be applied to different environmental scales and goals. We present examples of species with varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> at large and small scales within the proposed context. The effects <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> on population stability are also briefly discussed. Specialists are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations and thus more susceptible to population depletion following environmental changes. Therefore identifying specialised species is key to understanding species vulnerabilities and advancing ecological discussions...|$|R

40|$|Marsupial moles (genus Notoryctes) are {{the most}} highly {{specialised}} burrowing marsupials. The <b>specialisations</b> <b>of</b> the appendicular musculo-skeletal system of the marsupial moles are extensive and widespread; the major alterations are concentrated in, but not restricted to, the forelimb. Many of the derived features of the muscular system appear to be adaptations for improving the mechanical advantage of the limbs for burrowing. A number <b>of</b> the <b>specialisations</b> <b>of</b> the muscular system of the marsupial moles are convergent with those previously documented in other fossorial mammals, including golden moles, rodents and armadillos. There are, however, a number <b>of</b> unique <b>specialisations</b> <b>of</b> the musculo-skeletal system of Notoryctes. The functional morphology of the locomotor apparatus of marsupial moles is interpreted {{on the basis of}} the descriptions of the anatomy of the skeletal and muscular systems. The burrowing technique of the marsupial moles is a modified form of the parasagittal digging method that is used by other fossorial mammals, such as golden moles, armadillos and some rodents including pocket gophers. Differences in the functional morphology of the hindlimb between marsupial moles and other fossorial mammals are a reflection of the fact that marsupial moles do not construct permanent open burrow systems, but instead constantly dig through loose soil, backfilling as they progress. The functional morphology of the tail is uniquely specialised in the marsupial moles to function as the fifth limb during the pentapedal burrowing locomotion of marsupial moles. Phylogenetic affinities of marsupial moles within the Marsupialia have long been enigmatic. While <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> the musculo-skeletal system have been so widespread as to obscure almost any phylogenetically relevant patterns, there is some evidence to support an association between notoryctids and peramelid bandicoots. Interspecific differences between the two species of marsupial moles, Notoryctes typhlops and N. caurinus, are minor...|$|R
