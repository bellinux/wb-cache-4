Following field surveys, a high-resolution morphometric map was established. Ten 14 C ages of sub-fossil trees and charcoal beds were compiled. All datasets were integrated into a Geographic Information System. We computed three palaeosurfaces by masking the Digital Elevation Model of the current topography, and calculated the sediment budget of the catchment. Estimations of specific hillslope erosion, sedimentation and export rates highlight {{the evolution of the}} catchment and its sensitivity to variations in the ratio of sediment load to stream discharge. Between 20, 000 and 14, 500 cal. BP, sediment that was eroded (37 million m 3) within the Charanc catchment was entirely exported. A change to a sedimentation regime commenced at around 14, 500 cal. BP. Between 9000 cal. BP and 7000 cal. BP, footslopes were buried by fan-shaped deposits at a rate of 6700 m 3 /yr. Since 7000 cal. BP, the overall morphogenetic regime has been one of vertical incision. 73 % of the material eroded over the last 14, 500 years (14 million m 3) was stored in fan-shaped deposits. At the present time, 46 % of this volume (6 million m 3) is still stored in the catchment. 8 million m 3 of sediments have thus been exported out of the Charanc catchment since 14, 500 cal. BP. Annual specific erosion rates on marly slopes are estimated at: (1) 98 to 111 t/ha/yr for the period 20, 000 - 14, 500 cal. BP, which is comparable to present rates measured on denudated marls in the Southern French Alps, under a probably climate-driven erosion regime, and (2) 17 to 20 t/ha/yr since 14, 500 cal. BP, a reduction in erosion rate that may have been favoured by a more extensively wooded landscape...|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in the cool, clear, strong-flowing, cobble bottomed, <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>rivers</b> and streams (ranging from small to large) in the {{southeast}} corner of the Murray-Darling river system. Their range encompasses northeast Victoria, southeast New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Originally two-spined blackfish co-inhabited many of these waters with Macquarie perch and trout cod.|$|R
50|$|River {{blackfish}} {{continue the}} trend present in Murray-Darling native fish of speciating into primarily lowland species and upland species, with the upland species {{being in this}} case the two-spined blackfish, Gadopsis bispinosus. The two-spined blackfish is a more specialised upland inhabitant, and is found in the strongly flowing, cobble-bottomed <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>rivers</b> and streams of northeast Victoria, southeast New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. Though with the blackfish species perhaps you would say the split is lowland/midland and upland as there are overlaps in their range, and river blackfish are found in many upland habitats.|$|R
50|$|Two {{sites are}} of pre-historic origin. The Rock Drawings in Valcamonica {{date back to}} a period between 8000BC and 1000BC, {{covering}} prehistoric periods from the Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic to the Iron Age. The engravings show depictions {{of a wide range}} of topics including agricultural and war scenes alongside more abstract symbols. The multi-centred heritage site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps includes 111 individual objects in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Slovenia, of which ten are located in Lombardy. Each of these objects consists of remnants of buildings erected on wooden piles in <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>rivers,</b> lakes and wetlands, built between 5000BC and 500BC. In general, only the submerged wooden parts have been preserved in the alluvial sediment, although in some places pile buildings have been reconstructed.|$|R
