In the latter case this underground vault may be preferable to a <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> pond if other uses are intended for the land (e.g. a pedestrian plaza or park).

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>detention</b> and {{depression}} storage constitute the two conceptual storages {{of water at}} the soil surface and depend on the spatial configuration of the micro-topography. To be able to measure directly those storages and investigate how they evolve with time and precipitation, {{it is necessary to}} isolate the impact of the micro-topography from the infiltration. Therefore we developed a fast and cheap in-situ molding method (+/− 85 €/m 2) that combines alginate, plaster and lacquer. It allows creating stable and impermeable artificial micro-topographies that reproduce real field situations and that can be submitted to various laboratory runoff simulations. Both the surface of a specific soil and its artificial reproduction were measured with a laser scanner in order to assess the quality of the molding method. This method is shown to be precise {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 55 mm, which is also the spatial resolution of the laser scanner method. This novel molding method was applied to get ten footprints of the micro-topography of a loamy bare soil, at different levels of cumulative rainfall erosivity value (R), starting with a tilled soil, and letting it evolve with natural rain events. We studied the evolution of the bulk values of depression storage and <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> at the interrill scale, considering that these bulk values may provide useful input to hillslope models for which the size of the single grid cell corresponds to the size of our entire molds. We related the hydraulic properties to R, assuming that R would help explain the change in hydraulic parameters of micro-topographies over time. We found a general decrease of maximum depression storage and steady state <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> with R. We finally parametrized <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> by an effective friction factor, using a classical equation for an equivalent laminar sheet flow. A simple model to compute the <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> as a function of the discharge per unit width and the cumulative rainfall erosivity was proposed...|$|E
40|$|To {{predict the}} {{hydrological}} response of a hillslope to a rainfall event, the spatial configuration of soil roughness {{needs to be}} taken into account. Quantitative expressions of hydrological connectivity based on topography may improve the prediction of overland flow propagation, especially if the connectivity concept is applied at the subgrid scale of current hillslope models, which corresponds to the interrill scale. Our first objective was to measure the effect of micro-topography on overland flow. Some of the water is stored in depressions (depression storage) and some is temporarily stored in the flowing water layer (<b>surface</b> <b>detention).</b> To measure those storages, we used a new molding technique that reproduced realistic but waterproof soil surfaces, which were subjected to artificial runoff. The evolution of both storages following rainfall was related to the cumulative rainfall erosivity value. Our second objective was to find runoff-relevant connectivity properties of micro-topography. Based on numerical runoff experiments, we found that, among a number of existing structural connectivity indices and a proposed new functional connectivity index (namely the Relative Surface Connection function), the RSC function was the most robust and directly linkable to the runoff dynamics. Our last objective was to introduce the connectivity properties captured by the RSC function at the subgrid (interrill) scale in distributed hydrological models. A corrective procedure was proposed to combine both <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> and depression storage dynamics. It allows mimicking the hydraulic behavior of small plots where the effect of the micro-topography is characterized by few (1 or 2) effective parameters implementable in hillslope models.

40|$|International audienceDetention basins are {{valuable}} facilities for urban storm water management, {{from both the}} standpoint of flood control and the trapping of pollutants. Studies performed on storm water have shown that suspended solids often constitute the main vector of pollutants (heavy metals, polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbon (PAH), etc.). In order to characterise the ecotoxicity of urban sediments from storm water detention basins, the sediments accumulated over a 6 -year period were sampled at five different points through {{the surface of a}} large detention basin localised in the east of Lyon, France. A spe- cific ecotoxicological test battery was implemented on the solid phase (raw sediment) and the liquid phase (interstitial water of sediments). The results of the study validated the method formulated for the ecotoxicological characterization of urban sediments. They show that the ecotoxicological effect of the sediments over the basin is heterogeneous and greater in areas often flooded. They also show the relationship between, on one hand, the physical and chemical characteris- tics of the sediments and, on the other hand, their ecotoxicity. Lastly, they contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynam- ics of the pollution close to the bottom of detention basins, which can be useful for improving their design. The results of this research raise particularly the issue of using oil separators on the <b>surface</b> of <b>detention</b> basins...|$|R
40|$|Natural and human-induced {{environmental}} {{changes have been}} altering the earth's surface and hydrological processes, and thus directly contribute to the severity of flood hazards. To understand these changes and their impacts, this research developed a GISbased hydrological and hydraulic modeling system, which incorporates state-of-the-art remote sensing data to simulate flood under various scenarios. The conceptual framework and technical issues of incorporating multi-scale remote sensing data have been addressed. This research develops an object-oriented hydrological modeling framework. Compared with traditional lumped or cell-based distributed hydrological modeling frameworks, the object-oriented framework allows basic spatial hydrologic units to have various size and irregular shape. This framework is capable of assimilating various GIS and remotely-sensed data with different spatial resolutions. It ensures the computational efficiency, while preserving sufficient spatial details of input data and model outputs. Sensitivity analysis and comparison of high resolution LIDAR DEM with traditional USGS 30 m resolution DEM suggests {{that the use of}} LIDAR DEMs can greatly reduce uncertainty in calibration of flow parameters in the hydrologic model and hence increase the reliability of modeling results. In addition, subtle topographic features and hydrologic objects like <b>surface</b> depressions and <b>detention</b> basins can be extracted from the high resolution LiDAR DEMs. An innovative algorithm has been developed to efficiently delineate <b>surface</b> depressions and <b>detention</b> basins from LiDAR DEMs. Using a time series of Landsat images, a retrospective analysis of surface imperviousness has been conducted to assess the hydrologic impact of urbanization. The analysis reveals that with rapid urbanization the impervious surface has been increased from 10. 1 % to 38. 4 % for the case study area during 1974 - 2002. As a result, the peak flow for a 100 -year flood event has increased by 20 % and the floodplain extent has expanded by about 21. 6 %. The quantitative analysis suggests that the large regional detentions basins have effectively offset the adverse effect of increased impervious surface during the urbanization process. Based on the simulation and scenario analyses of land subsidence and potential climate changes, some planning measures and policy implications have been derived for guiding smart urban growth and sustainable resource development and management to minimize flood hazards...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{configuration}} of micro-topography affects the runoff connectivity at the interrill scale and, therefore, {{the shape of}} the hydrograph. In a previous study, we demonstrated the ability of the so-called Relative Surface Connection (RSC) function to capture, at the grid scale, the evolution of the contributing area {{as a function of the}} depression storage filling. However, this function neglects the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>detention,</b> which is proportional to the runoff rate and which must be taken into account if one wants to predict correctly the discharge dynamics. Therefore we tested two corrective procedures in association with the RSC function to integrate, at the grid scale, the effects of both depression storage and <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> dynamics. The weighted-source corrective procedure consists in weighing the effective supply of water between depression storage and runoff using the RSC function. The weighted-surface corrective procedure consists in splitting a single grid into parallel independent strips whose sizes depend on the RSC function and which activate at various times and then participate to the global runoff production. Those methods allowed to mimic in a simple way and at the grid scale synthetical and experimental hydrographs for complex subgrid micro-topographies. The weighted-source and especially the weighted-surface corrective procedures improved the hydrograph prediction compared to the classical approach where runoff only starts when depression storage capacity is full. In a purely numerical framework with four runoff scenarios on highly contrasted micro-topographies, this improvement was reflected in a significant increase of the median Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients E 50 (E 50 = 0. 29 for the classical approach, E 50 = 0. 67 for the weighted-source procedure and E 50 = 0. 94 for the weighted-surface procedure). For the depression storage filling, an alternative to the Linsley equation was found and allowed a better description of surface runoff before maximal depression storage was reached. This was reflected in an increase of the E 50 computed for 27 overland flow experiments under laboratory conditions and their equivalent model results (E 50 = 0. 89 for the Linsley approach, E 50 = 0. 94 with the proposed ‘uniform’ multiple- compartment conceptual approach, and E 50 = 0. 85 for the classical approach where runoff only starts when depression storage capacity is full) ...|$|E
40|$|Watershed {{management}} is an emerging concept for the {{efficient use of}} rain run-off {{in the rural areas}} of India. The approach to watershed {{management is}} participatory in nature, people friendly, location specific, processed based and geared to cater to the problems and needs of the rural communities. Operation of watershed management is ideal where the rainfall pattern is very short, uneven and there is no support of major and minor irrigation systems to enhance agricultural production. The principle of watershed management is the proper management of all the precipitation by way of collection, storage and efficient utilisation of run-off water and use of groundwater. The re-harvesting of run-off in the study area of watershed management is achieved by managing 25 % of the total rainfall and 25 % of the run-off to generate crop-growing area, through four re-harvesting mechanisms such as tanks, farm ponds, contour bunds and structures such as gully plugs and <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> in depression.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the water runoff on the sloping {{cultivated}} fields of Central Greece, an experiment was carried out from 1997 to 2000. The following treatments were used: three tillage methods, viz. conventional tillage, reduced tillage with heavy cultivator and disk-harrow: two with or without winter cover crop, two parallel and perpendicular to the contour tillage and planting directions. An existing methodology for predicting runoff was evaluated and improved, {{which is based on}} the estimation of pending time for the different tillage systems in the study area under rainfall. An equation predicting the time to ponding was used obtaining data from infiltration experiments using double-cylinder infiltrometers in the field. The surface runoff of each rain storm was estimated by combining the appropriate infiltration equation with the rain intensity data, taking into consideration not only the excess rainfall rate over the infiltration rate, but also the <b>surface</b> <b>detention.</b> Measured runoff was used to test the validity of the USDA-Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method in the region. The results from this test indicated that this prediction runoff method may not be used in the region without the proper modifications to suit the rainfall in the region. The developed model could be used to successfully estimate runoff and erosion in the area. It was found that the combination of equations of time to incipient ponding and the maximum surface storage capacity of topsoil, could explain about 85 % of the existing runoff variation.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} runoff from ungaged semi-arid unit watersheds is presented. The method consists {{of using the}} realistic rotating disk rainfall simulator (Rotadisk Rainulator) to measure the infiltration rate combined with data from recording raingages.

A runoff hydrograph for the unit watershed is then calculated using a computer program which essentially subtracts the infiltration from the rainfall volume as measured by existing recording rainfall records. This hydrograph determination is repeated for increasing increments of <b>surface</b> storage and <b>detention.</b> The final selection of storage and detention is based in part on direct measurement using the Rotadisk Rainulator, and using the resulting hydrographs combined with past experience of the hydrologist with gaged watersheds. The method was tested using four one-acre gaged watersheds on the Atterbury Experimental Watershed on the valley floor east of Tucson, Arizona.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} {{management}} plan to address the City of Alta’s stormwater runoff.

Algal biomass produced and harvested from the lagoons has been proven to affect the way nitrogen and phosphorous are removed, while having {{the potential to be}} converted to biofuels. Therefore, implementing a secondary type clarifier in the Logan Lagoons would produce treated water with a reduced phosphorous concentration, and algae feedstock for biofuel production. While several factors influence clarifier design, the settling characteristics of flocculent algae in wastewater were the main focus of this project. Sedimentation columns were used to calculate <b>surface</b> overflow rate, <b>detention</b> time and algae percent settling. The addition of chemicals and variation of zeta potential, to promote flocculation and higher algae percent settling, were also studied. Preliminary results revealed a large fraction of the algae can be settled by means of sedimentation prior to chemical dosing. A suspended settling efficiency of 40 %- 60 % with a detention time of 2 - 2. 8 hours was attained and a surface overflow rate between 51 - 69 ft/day was calculated. Furthermore, a pH of 8 - 11 influenced a neutral zeta potential, increasing algae percent settling and phosphorous removal even further.

40|$|Taiwan has a Subtropic to Tropical climate, but its {{precipitation}} {{varies widely}} {{in response to}} seasonal effects and weather events such as Typhoon and Meiyu systems. Precipitation must be held back in reservoirs to provide and regulate sufficient water supply. Balancing the irregular precipitation and increasing water demands generates tremendous pressure on water resources management for the water stored in the Shihmen Reservoir, which is the major unitary water supply system in the Greater Taoyuan Area. Such pressure will be significantly enlarged due to the huge 17 billion USD Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project. In earlier days many small artificial ponds (a common terminology in this article), including irrigation ponds, fishery ponds and others, were built to cope with water shortages in Taoyuan County. These small storage ponds provided a solution that resolved seasonal precipitation shortages. Unfortunately, these ponds have been vanishing one after another one due to regional industrialization and urbanization in recent decades and less than 40 % of them still remain today. There is great urgency and importance to investigating the link between vanishing ponds and water resources management. Remote sensing technology {{was used in this}} study to monitor the environmental consequences in the Taoyuan area by conducting multi-temporal analysis on the changes in water bodies, i. e., ponds. SPOT satellite images taken in 1993, 2003, and 2010 were utilized to analyze and assess the importance of small-scale ponds as water conservation facilities. It was found that, during the seventeen years from 1993 - 2010, the number of irrigation ponds decreased by 35. 94 %. These ponds can reduce the burden on the major reservoir and increase the water recycling rate if they are properly conserved.

40|$|Hydrological {{models are}} {{important}} tools for effective management, conservation and restoration of forested wetlands. The {{objective of this}} study was to test a distributed hydrological model, MIKE SHE by using bi-criteria (two measurable variables, streamflow and water table depth) to describe the hydrological processes in a forested watershed that is characteristic of the lower Atlantic Coastal Plain. Simulations were compared against observations of both streamflow and water table depth measured on a first-order watershed (WS 80) on the Santee Experimental Forest in South Carolina, USA. Model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and Nash-Sutcliffe's model efficiency (E). The E and root mean squared error (RMSE) were chosen as objective functions for sensitivity analysis of parameters. The model calibration and validation results demonstrated that the streamflow and water table depth were sensitive to most of the model input parameters, especially to <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> storage, drainage depth, soil hydraulic properties, plant rooting depth, and surface roughness. Furthermore, the bi-criteria used for distributed model calibration and validation was shown to be better than the single-criterion in obtaining optimum model input parameters, especially for those parameters that were only sensitive to some specific conditions. Model calibration using the bi-criteria approach should be advantageous for constructing the uncertainty bounds of model inputs to simulate the hydrology for this type of forested watersheds. R 2 varied from 0. 60 – 0. 99 for daily and monthly streamflow, and from 0. 52 – 0. 91 for daily water table depth. E changed from 0. 53 – 0. 96 for calibration and 0. 51 – 0. 98 for validation of daily and monthly streamflow, while E varied from 0. 50 – 0. 90 for calibration and 0. 66 – 0. 80 for validation of daily water table depth.

40|$|Soil surface {{characteristics}} (SSCs) {{are highly}} variable {{even at a}} small scale (< 1 m 2) and the infiltration-runoff partitioning under rainfall {{is dependent on the}} spatial variability and spatial structure of SSCs. For {{a better understanding of the}} influence of the variability of SSCs on infiltration-runoff partitioning, a modelling approach may be needed due to the complexity of the problem, but at the same time experiments are needed with measurements of all components of the soil water balance, namely soil water storage, drainage, soil <b>surface</b> <b>detention</b> and runoff. The aim of this paper is to describe the experimental setup and the first results of an infiltration-runoff experiment conducted in the lab under simulated rainfall on a 2 D model of heterogeneous remoulded soil. A 50 cm long x 10 cm wide x 20 cm high model of soil with a wavy surface was first built. The wavy surface created 3 depressions of increasing depth (0. 2 to 2. 5 cm) from upstream to downstream. 3 pats of compacted soil were then inserted at the bottom of the depression: this model was representative for a system of sedimentary crusts and undisturbed soil. 24 micro-tensiometers were inserted to measure soil water matrix potentials every 10 s, and runoff flow was recorded at the same time step. Distributed drainage flow was manually measured. The soil model was then placed under a rainfall simulator using the facilities of the INRA Soil Science Lab in Orléans, France. Hydrodynamic properties of the un-compacted soil and compacted soil were measured with the Wind’s evaporation method. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the soil model was obtained at the beginning and at the end with a laser profile-meter and with a photogrammetric method. Photogrammetry was also used to estimate the amount of water stored in depressions at the soil surface. First results show the relations between the evolution in time of the depressional water storage, the runoff flow and the soil matrix potentials. This kind of experiment provides data helpful for the validation of numerical model coupling distributed soil infiltration and distributed runoff and accounting for the variability of soil hydrodynamic properties...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{by which}} {{urbanization}} in Minnesota leads to temperature increases in coldwater streams and subsequent loss of trout habitat were investigated and quantified. Hydrologic and thermal computer models for surface and groundwater systems were developed, calibrated, {{and applied to}} the Vermillion River in Dakota County and to Miller Creek in Duluth. Surface runoff from impervious surfaces can have significant impact on stream temperatures in small tributary coldwater streams. Runoff from pavements and commercial rooftops creates more thermal pollution than runoff from residential rooftops. Runoff from afternoon or evening rainfall events with rapid onset tends to produce the most thermal pollution. Storms with high dewpoint temperatures can also produce high levels of thermal pollution from both pervious and impervious <b>surfaces.</b> Wet stormwater <b>detention</b> ponds tend to increase total heat input to receiving streams compared to untreated runoff, but do reduce {{the rate of heat}} release, and thus create smaller but longer-lasting temperature changes in streams. Pond designs with subsurface outlets reduce heat loadings for smaller rainfall events. Infiltration practices are generally a highly effective stormwater management practice for mitigation of thermal pollution. Loss of riparian shading causes more frequent high stream temperatures than does surface runoff. Efforts to mitigate temperature impacts of land development need to consider both mitigation of surface runoff and maintaining or restoration of riparian shading. Since tree growth is a slow process long-term watershed planning is important. Coldwater streams in Minnesota rely on inputs of cold water from groundwater or wetlands to maintain moderate summer temperatures. Urbanization has the potential to impact stream temperature by reducing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Shallow groundwater aquifers, e. g. in the Vermillion River, can be heated by paved surfaces leading to local stream temperature increases. Establishing buffer distances between pavements and stream channels is advisable. Although not a focus of this study, changing climate will be a significant cause of temperature changes in coldwater streams. Long term planning to maintain coldwater streams in Minnesota needs to consider both land development and climate change. Additional study is needed to assess agricultural impacts, particularly on coldwater streams in southeastern Minnesota.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. The Energy Independence and Security Act, {{passed by}} Congress in 2007, {{included}} a section {{commonly referred to}} as EISA 438. This section of the Act requires any new development or redevelopment of federal facilities, involving more than 5, 000 square feet, to retain on-site a sufficient volume of rainfall to mimic the pre-development hydrology. The retained rainfall must be dissipated by means of infiltration into the ground, evapo-transpiration, or reuse. It cannot be directly discharged into a storm drain or <b>surface</b> water. Therefore, <b>detention</b> basins are not an appropriated best management practice (BMP) for complying with this regulation, since they have direct discharges. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a guidance document for complying with the regulation entitled, “Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for Federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act”. This guidance document presents two options for estimating the retention capacity for designing best management practices to comply with this regulation. Option one is based on a statistical analysis that requires 95 % of the average annual rainfall be retained and dissipated. The problem with this option is that it fails to consider soil infiltration or changes in ground cover, which are the primary factor influencing the runoff volume. This option is appropriate for site planning estimates, but not BMP design. Option two puts forward the concept of modeling the pre-development and post-development hydrology to estimate the appropriate storage capacity. Although Option two suggests a continuous simulation model, the method presented in Appendix A of this guidance document is an analysis for a single 24 -hour rainfall event. The single event analysis has the problem that it fails to consider the dissipation rate, and subsequently it fails to consider the actual storage volume available for the next rainfall. Described in the following paragraphs is the “Retention Volume Simulation Model” (RVSM). The RVSM is a continuous simulation, volume based hydrology RVSM, appropriate for estimating the retention capacity for BMPs to comply with new EISA 438 regulation.
