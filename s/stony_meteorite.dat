5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a <b>stony</b> <b>meteorite,</b> though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been {{described}} variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a <b>stony</b> <b>meteorite.</b> , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.|$|E

25|$|The Rosetta flyby {{demonstrated}} that the mass of Lutetia is (1.700 ± 0.017) kg, smaller than the pre-flyby estimate of 2.57 kg.

25|$|Christopher Chyba {{and others}} have {{proposed}} a process whereby a <b>stony</b> <b>meteorite</b> could have exhibited the behaviour of the Tunguska impactor. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body's descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all its energy at once. The result is no crater, with damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, {{and all of the}} damage resulting from the thermal energy released in the blast.|$|E

30|$|This {{study focused}} on four {{particle}} types: olivine mi-croparticles, ordinary chondrite microparticles, olivine-ice mixtures, and chondrite-ice mixtures. Olivine was used in experiments {{because it is a}} mineral frequently found in many <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> and is thus a relevant analogue for such meteorites. However, most meteorites are multi-phase: they are rocks, and not minerals. Therefore, we also obtained a sample of a type L 3.5 ordinary chondrite to use in experiments, as this is a better analogue for multi-phase <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> than olivine alone.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{the shock}} {{metamorphism}} on <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> are {{compared with those}} on lunar materials with respect to (a) the viscous magnetization which represents a relative abundance of superparamagnetically fine metallic grains produced by the explosive shock metamorphism and (b) the magnetic phase composition of metallic nickel-irons which represents effects of their remelting (or reheating up to about 1000 ℃) followed by rapid cooling caused by the shock metamorphism. Experimental {{results show that the}} Type (II) viscous magnetization, which gives the presence of superparamagnetic metallic grains more than 1 / 4 of total metal, is observed in almost all lunar fines and breccias but none of <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> possesses the Type (II) viscous magnetization, and that almost all <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> are still maintaining a magnetic phase composition resulted from a slow cooling of a metallic melt, approximately keeping the phase equilibrium condition, whereas the majority of lunar materials, particularly lunar breccias, contain the secondary products of a remelting (or a reheating) followed by a rapid cooling such as α_ 2 -phase of metallic nickel-iron, schereibersite, and pure metallic iron exsolved from Fe-bearing silicate minerals by the subsolidus reduction process. These experimental results may lead to a conclusion that the lunar surface materials were seriously shock metamorphased probably owing to repeated meteorite impacts, whereas most <b>stony</b> <b>meteorites</b> have been subjected to much less shock effects than in the case of lunar materials...|$|R
2500|$|Large meteoroids may {{strike the}} earth with a {{significant}} fraction of their escape velocity (second cosmic velocity), leaving behind a hypervelocity impact crater. The kind of crater {{will depend on the}} size, composition, degree of fragmentation, and incoming angle of the impactor. The force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction. The most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the Earth are caused by iron meteoroids, which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact. Examples of craters caused by iron meteoroids include Barringer Meteor Crater, Odessa Meteor Crater, Wabar craters, and Wolfe Creek crater; iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters. In contrast, even relatively large stony or icy bodies like small comets or asteroids, up to millions of tons, are disrupted in the atmosphere, and do not make impact craters. Although such disruption events are uncommon, they can cause a considerable concussion to occur; the famed Tunguska event probably resulted from such an incident. Very large stony objects, hundreds of meters in diameter or more, weighing tens of millions of tons or more, can reach the surface and cause large craters, but are very rare. Such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed, leaving no meteorites. (The very first example of a <b>stony</b> <b>meteorite</b> found in association with a large impact crater, the Morokweng crater in South Africa, was reported in May 2006.) ...|$|E
