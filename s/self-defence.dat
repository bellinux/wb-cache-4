5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of <b>self-defence,</b> inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of <b>self-defence.</b> Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in <b>self-defence,</b> one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of <b>self-defence,</b> suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate <b>self-defence</b> focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Ahimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' {{includes}} one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical {{literature of}} Hinduism such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, {{as well as}} modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring <b>self-defence.</b> The historic literature from India and modern discussions have contributed to theories of Just War, and theories of appropriate <b>self-defence.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{matters of}} <b>self-defence,</b> {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests <b>self-defence</b> is appropriate, criminals are not {{protected by the}} rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures {{support the use of}} violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do {{teaches the}} {{military}} style of taekwondo, closer to traditional martial art than modern martial sport in nature. Training consists of exercises {{that may be}} classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to kihon in karate), destruction (breaking), hyung (patterns or forms), <b>self-defence,</b> and sparring. Basics, destruction, hyung, and <b>self-defence</b> are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do teaches the Chang Hon hyung.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of <b>self-defence,</b> camouflage and thermoregulation. In some Lepidoptera families {{such as the}} Psychidae and Lymantriidae, the wings are reduced or even absent (often in the female but not the male).|$|E
5|$|Jains {{agree with}} Hindus that {{violence}} in <b>self-defence</b> can be justified, and {{they agree that}} a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted {{the use of military}} power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 {{often has}} radios {{installed}} for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, including an SO-69 identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) transponder. The aircraft's <b>self-defence</b> suite includes various measures, such as flare and chaff dispensers capable of launching up to 250 flares and dipole chaff. Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{deployed}} in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with the four ship group, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan. The Japanese Maritime <b>Self-Defence</b> Force (JMSDF) was represented by two destroyers, one maritime patrol aircraft and a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Fleming portrayed Bond as a tall, athletic, {{handsome}} {{secret agent}} {{in his thirties}} or forties; he has several vices including drinking, smoking, gambling, automobiles and womanizing. He is an exceptional marksman, and skilled in unarmed combat, skiing, swimming and golf. While Bond kills without hesitation or regret, he usually kills only when carrying out orders, while acting in <b>self-defence</b> and occasionally as revenge.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Gomez {{was charged}} with murder after a gang fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez had hit one of his attackers, Sam Parle, who died after his head hit the {{pavement}} {{as a result of}} the blow. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in <b>self-defence.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1986 she {{permitted}} US F-111s to use Royal Air Force {{bases for}} the bombing of Libya {{in retaliation for the}} alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of <b>self-defence</b> under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of her decision.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Arsenal {{fans were}} {{originally}} {{blamed for the}} violence as the police had fixed blame on them. In Turkey, the media portrayed Galatasaray fans as acting in <b>self-defence,</b> with criticism directed at the British fans for allegedly attacking members of the press. However, there were conflicting reports, with claims that some Galatasaray fans were instigating some of the violence. Later on, British media blame also transferred towards Galatasaray fans.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in <b>self-defence.</b> The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in <b>self-defence.</b> In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's <b>Self-Defence</b> force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the AW101 {{are equipped with}} <b>self-defence</b> systems, such as chaff and flare dispensers, directed infrared countermeasures (infrared jammers), ESM (electronic support measures {{in the form of}} RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A chin-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.|$|E
5|$|Non-comedic roles after Airplane! {{included}} Prom Night (1980) and Creepshow (1982), both horror films, and as {{a dramatic}} and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy Soul Man. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client of a prostitute killed in <b>self-defence</b> by Barbra Streisand's character, Claudia Draper, in Martin Ritt's courtroom drama Nuts (1987).|$|E
5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in <b>self-defence</b> the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable <b>self-defence</b> and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them <b>self-defence.</b> Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship has}} <b>self-defence</b> {{capability}} and {{is equipped with}} an indigenous anti-missile defence chaff system. On-board systems include fully automatic engine controls, power management and battle damage control systems. According to the navy, the ship was designed to operate as a command platform. The ship is fitted with four AK-630 Close-in weapon systems, which can fire {{at a rate of}} 4,000 to 10,000 rounds a minute.|$|E
5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} <b>self-defence,</b> and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted {{at the rear of the}} hangar to hoist the seaplanes in and out of the water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for <b>self-defence.</b> She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
5|$|For <b>self-defence</b> against enemy warships, Eagle {{had nine}} BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along {{both sides of}} the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were {{positioned}} on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for <b>self-defence.</b> Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from deployable mines to energy shields. Every ship is also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or weapons fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's <b>self-defence</b> systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{attempted}} {{to reclaim the}} citadel by sending reinforcements. Vĩnh Long and Mỹ Tho sent 1,800 and 800 troops respectively, but French shelling prevented them from reaching the scene. This left the 5,800-strong local <b>self-defence</b> militia to combat the French. These militia engaged in ambushing French patrols near the citadel, as well as evacuating local inhabitants, {{in order to create}} an open space close to their target. The local militia were supported by wealthy southern landowners, who supplied them with food and resources.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in <b>self-defence,</b> Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for <b>self-defence</b> and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in <b>self-defence,</b> they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for <b>self-defence,</b> as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or <b>self-defence.</b> Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Culann {{the smith}} invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar {{goes to the}} playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so {{impressed}} by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in <b>self-defence,</b> in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated {{by the loss of}} his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's Hound".|$|E
5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in <b>self-defence,</b> is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E
5|$|In March, {{the carrier}} loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and {{delivered}} them to Gibraltar on 29 March, {{where they were}} loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for <b>self-defence.</b> After a brief refit, Argus sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship {{was back in the}} United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August, Furious left Belfast with {{a load of}} 49 Hurricanes, {{carrying}} three Fulmars of 800 Squadron {{and four}} Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for <b>self-defence,</b> and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for Ark Royal. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes {{because some of the}} Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When Ark Royal returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was Furiouss last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of <b>self-defence</b> in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
