60|$|Mr. Sharp complied, {{and in a}} {{few minutes}} the launch was {{floating}} slowly away from the hospitable bank of sand. Paul hauled out the jigger, a small sprit-sail, that kept itself close-hauled from being fastened to a <b>stationary</b> <b>boom,</b> and a little mast stepped quite aft, the effect of which was to press the boat against the wind. This brought the launch's head up, and it was just possible to see, by close attention, that they had a slight motion through the water.|$|E
5000|$|A key aspect in the {{successful}} {{construction of the}} Yeywa RCC dam was comprehensive training of the local staff during preparative for and initial stages of the construction.High-Tech Concrete Technologies(HTCT)which {{is a member of}} Shwe Taung Group, was the one who has been succeeding the knowledge from local perspective. [...] Up to 5,000 workers were employed on this large construction project. Equipment selected for the concreting operations include Putzmeisterâ€™s MX 32 <b>stationary</b> <b>boom,</b> an M 38 truck-mounted concrete pump and two BSA 2,109 HP stationary pumps.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{leading cause}} of death on sailboats is {{directly}} attributed to the use of booms. [...] Booms can cause injuries directly, sweep people overboard, and their associated hardware and lines represent tripping hazards. On larger boats, sailors tend to stand on the boom to perform sail maintenance and install or take off sail covers. Falls from the boom onto the deck below occur. Even when <b>stationary,</b> <b>booms</b> represent a hazard since on most boats there is insufficient headroom to walk below them without ducking. According to a German study, [...] "boom strikes were {{the most common cause of}} sailing injury overall".|$|R
5000|$|For rigs with no mainsail, {{there is}} also no boom. This saves the cost of the boom, and {{hardware}} and lines associated with the boom. More importantly, eliminating the boom is a matter of safety. The second leading cause of death on sailboats is the boom. [...] Booms cause injuries and deaths directly and indirectly by knocking people overboard. Even when <b>stationary,</b> <b>booms</b> represent a hazard. According to a German study, [...] "boom strikes were {{the most common cause of}} sailing injury overall". [...] Another aspect of safety is in regards to the elimination of the lines and hardware to control the boom. With fewer lines and less hardware on the deck there are fewer items to trip over or trap fingers and hands.|$|R
40|$|The NASA MMS Spin Plane Double Probe (SDP) Deployer {{utilizes}} a helical path, rotating Metering Wheel and {{a spring}} loaded Wire "Holding" Track {{to pay out}} a "fixed end" 57 meter x 1. 5 mm diameter Wire Boom stored between concentric storage cylinders. Unlike rotating spool type storage devices, the storage cylinders remain <b>stationary,</b> and the <b>boom</b> wire is uncoiled {{along the length of}} the cylinder via the rotation of the Metering Wheel. This uncoiling action avoids the need for slip-ring contacts since the ends of the wire can remain stationary. Conventional fixed electrical connectors (Micro-D type) are used to terminate to operational electronics...|$|R
