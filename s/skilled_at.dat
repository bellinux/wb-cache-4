40|$|Oportunidades (formerly PROGRESA) is a {{conditional}} {{cash transfer}} program ran by the Mexican federal government designed to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Among other activities, it provides free delivery attendance for women enrolled in the program. <b>Skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> delivery {{has been identified as}} an effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality, an important health problem in Mexico. In this paper we assess the impact of Oportunidades on <b>skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> delivery taking advantage of the experimental design implemented for the evaluation of this program in rural areas and using a variety of analytical techniques. The main results of the study indicate that Oportunidades had, at best, only a small effect on <b>skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> delivery in treatment communities. The program had larger effects on those women who had one birth just prior to the experimental treatment and another birth subsequent to the experimental treatment. These results should lead to a review about the strategies used by Oportunidades to increase <b>skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> delivery. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago.

5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was <b>skilled</b> <b>at</b> his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{determinants of}} utilisation for antenatal care (ANC) and <b>skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> birth after a substantial reduction in user fees. Methods The {{study was conducted}} in the Nouna Health District in north-western Burkina Faso in early 2009. Data was collected by means of a representative survey on a sample of 435 women who reported a pregnancy in the prior 12 months. Two independent logit models were used to assess the determinants of (a) ANC utilisation (defined as having attended at least 3 visits) and (b) <b>skilled</b> assistance <b>at</b> birth (defined as having delivered in a health facility). Results 76 % of women had attended at least 3 ANC visits and 72 % had delivered in a facility. Living within 5 Â km from a facility was positively associated, while animist religion, some ethnicities, and household wealth were negatively associated with ANC utilisation. Some ethnicities, living within 5 Â km from a health facility, and having attended at least 3 ANC visits were positively associated with delivering in a facility. Conclusions User fee alleviation secured equitable access to care across socio-economic groups, but alone did not ensure that all women benefited from ANC and from <b>skilled</b> attendance <b>at</b> birth. Investments in policies to address barriers beyond financial ones are urgently needed.

Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm.

5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became <b>skilled</b> <b>at</b> both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} <b>skilled</b> <b>at</b> catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E

At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well.
