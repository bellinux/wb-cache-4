25|$|The {{future of}} life on earth depends on our ability to take action. Many {{individuals}} {{are doing what they}} can, but real success can only come if there's a change in our societies and our economics and in our politics. I've been lucky in my lifetime {{to see some of the}} greatest spectacles that the natural world has to offer. <b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> have a responsibility to leave for future generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, we didn't {{understand}} {{the effect of}} our actions. Unknowingly, we sowed the wind and now, literally, we are reaping the whirlwind. But {{we no longer have}} that excuse: now we do recognise the consequences of our behaviour. Now <b>surely,</b> <b>we</b> must act to reform it — [...] individually and collectively, nationally and internationally — or we doom future generations to catastrophe.|$|E
30|$|Theorem  4.1 {{implies the}} {{solutions}} to the CSFDEs (1.1) will asymptotically approach the set S almost <b>surely.</b> Then <b>we</b> deduce some useful corollaries.|$|R

60|$|Thus, <b>surely,</b> if <b>we</b> {{call the}} Oolitic beds one new world above the New Red sandstone, we must call the chalk a second new world in like wise.|$|R
2500|$|... “It’s {{always a}} case of getting {{together}} and feeling out the moods of each of us when we meet with instruments {{for the first time}} in six months. [...] We began as always, playing around and fooling about for two days, playing anything we want, like standards, our own material or anything that comes to us, and slowly but <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> develop a feel that takes us on to the new material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abu Musa al-Ashari {{reported}} that Muhammad said, [...] "When {{a son of}} a servant of Allah dies, Allah Says to the angels, 'Have you taken the son of My servant?' They say, 'Yes.' Then Allah Says, 'Have you taken the fruit of his heart?' They say, 'Yes.' Allah Says, [...] "What has My servant said?' They say, 'He has praised You and said, Allah is the only one and his Prophet is Muhammad [...] (<b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> belong to Allah and to Him shall we return). Then Allah Says, 'Build a house for My servant in Paradise and call it the house of praise.'" [...] From Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad and ibn Habban ...|$|E
60|$|Dibble readily complied; {{and slowly}} but <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> drew {{in on the}} rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>surely,</b> major, <b>we</b> might {{prevent their}} scaling the walls. It {{is not likely}} that they would attack on all sides at once, and without {{artillery}} they could do little." ...|$|R
60|$|Florentia. We go to find amusement: that, <b>surely,</b> is what <b>we</b> all go for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{condition}} doesn't matter? <b>Surely</b> not; <b>we</b> {{leave her}} condition out; we take it, that is, for granted. I see it, her condition, as behind and beneath you; {{yet at the}} same time I see it as bearing you up." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. <b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> {{must tell}} the truth, however painful {{it may be}} to our feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{leave me}} no option in that case. As you have remarked before, citizen Heron, {{why should we}} wait any longer? <b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> can now go." ...|$|E
6000|$|VIOLET. But, then, {{are we not}} to mortify our earthly affections? and <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> are to {{sacrifice}} ourselves, at least in God's service, if not in man's? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} to do with me, or I with you?" [...] he repeated, in a voice which was rapidly gaining {{strength}} and passion. [...] "God knows! Yet as <b>surely</b> as <b>we</b> both live, our lots are intertwined {{the one with the}} other." ...|$|R
60|$|But steadily, <b>surely,</b> and {{notwithstanding}} <b>We</b> {{have come}} our ways and met at last Here in this upper room.|$|R
60|$|The Lettish and Australian myths are folk-poetry; {{they have}} nothing to do with a disease of {{language}} or forgotten meanings of words which become proper names. All this is <b>surely</b> distinct. <b>We</b> proclaim the abundance of poetical Nature-myths; we 'disable' the hypothesis that they arise from a disease of language.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a worship {{that rarely}} brings lasting {{happiness}} with it. In our greed {{to collect the}} means of enjoyment, <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> lose the power to enjoy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> haven't bested them so soon as this," [...] I replied like a stupid, and {{he laughed}} {{as if there was}} {{somewhat}} of humor in my remark.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{all means}} bring her with you, Dias. If you and she are both {{willing to share}} the dangers we should meet with, <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> cannot object in any way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These are our ancestors, {{and their}} history is our history. Remember that as <b>surely</b> as <b>we</b> one day swung {{down out of}} the trees and walked upright, just as surely, on a far earlier day, did we crawl up out of the sea and achieve our first {{adventure}} on land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} that it is pretended such a message has come," [...] Colonel Cox replied, in a most {{offensive}} tone, and I could see Sergeant Corney clenching his fists tightly, as if thereby the better to hold himself in check, for <b>surely</b> were <b>we</b> two entitled to make reply to such an implied accusation.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{many will}} <b>surely</b> escape, as <b>we</b> have done. It cannot be {{that all our}} friends--all those who rode in with the princes--can have been murdered." ...|$|R
60|$|Are {{you sure}} you're not making an ass of yourself? If you've {{got into a}} mess, <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> can get you out. Marriage, like hanging, is rather a desperate remedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is terrible," [...] Marie said. [...] "I think {{night and}} day of our father and mother. Can nothing be done? <b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> might devise some means for their escape." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} finding the largest tree in a random graph. First of all, we {{estimate}} {{the size of the}} largest tree almost <b>surely.</b> Then <b>we</b> propose two approximate greedy algorithms. Both algorithms achieve a solution whose value is one half {{of the value of the}} optimal solution, with high probability...|$|R
50|$|Since {{it is not}} for us {{to create}} a plan for the future that will hold for all time, all the more <b>surely</b> what <b>we</b> contemporaries have to do is the uncompromising {{critical}} evaluation of all that exists, uncompromising in the sense that our criticism fears neither its own results nor the conflict with the powers that be.|$|R
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING. <b>Surely</b> <b>we</b> have met, Mr Archbishop. I {{remember}} your face. We--[she checks herself suddenly] Ah, no: I remember now: {{it was someone}} else. [She sits down]. They all sit down.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to do it if I can," [...] said Ralph, [...] "for <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> can be doing no harm in trying to prove whether the {{property}} is valuable or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine {{we shall}} find this place 'the limit'," [...] remarked Uncle John ruefully. [...] "But <b>surely</b> <b>we</b> shall {{be able to}} stand it for one night," [...] he added, with a philosophic sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly you are right, Miss Porter," [...] he said, [...] "but I do {{not think}} that any of us need worry about our carrion-eating acquaintance. The chances are that he is some half-demented {{castaway}} who will forget us more quickly, but no more <b>surely,</b> than <b>we</b> shall forget him. He is only a beast of the jungle, Miss Porter." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsider a {{stochastic}} {{differential equation}} {{with respect to}} semimartingales dX(t) =AX(t) dμ(t) +G(X(t),t) dM(t) which might {{be regarded as a}} stochastic perturbed system of dX(t) =AX(t) dμ(t). Suppose the second equation is exponentially stable almost <b>surely.</b> What <b>we</b> are interested in in this paper is to discuss the sufficient conditions under which the first equation is still exponentially stable almost surely...|$|R
