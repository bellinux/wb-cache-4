40|$|Pavement {{failure is}} a common problem in India and {{especially}} areas having a high water table are mainly suffered from this problem. To overcome this problem, some methods are studied in this paper to improve the bearing capacity of soil {{such as the use}} of Geogrid, soil stabilization using different materials, and proper sub-surface drainage. Soil can be improved by the addition of a stabilizer or excess aggregate. In any case, the traditional undercut & stabilization solution is often costly & always time-consuming. The paper suggests the use of different stabilization methods, plastic coated aggregates and geogrid which helps in increasing the bearing capacity of subgrade soil while greatly reducing the loss of aggregate and cover material into weak, wet or <b>saturated</b> <b>subgrade</b> soil...|$|E
40|$|Instability of low-lying <b>saturated</b> <b>subgrade</b> soil {{contributes}} to 2 ̆ 7 clay-pumping 2 ̆ 7 {{that is responsible}} for contaminating the overlying track materials. The clay pumping occurs under the action of cyclic loading (train loading) due to the build-up of excess pore water pressure. The work contained in the paper is focused on monotonic loading response of fouled ballast and is a crucial first step towards a more complete analysis of the clay pumping effect. In this paper, a bounding surface plasticity model is presented for clay-fouled ballast within the framework of critical state soil mechanics, adopting isotropic hardening and a non-associated flow rule. The role of the constitutive parameters and their dependence on various levels of fouling is discussed. The size and shape of the bounding surface is influenced by the extent of fouling. The model is calibrated against the results of consolidated drained triaxial tests conducted using a large scale cylindrical apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong. The model was successfully validated against triaxial testing on fouled ballast for an array of confining pressures, and the model predictions were found to be in good agreement with the laboratory data...|$|E
40|$|Current railroads require {{significant}} upgrading to {{meet the}} challenges of heavier loads at higher speeds. Due to excessive track degradation, the Australian rail industry spends large amounts on frequent track repair and maintenance, as well as ground improvement prior to track construction where soft and <b>saturated</b> <b>subgrade</b> soils pose considerable difficulties in design and construction. Moreover, the degradation of ballast particles under impact loading seriously hampers the safety and efficiency of rail tracks, which leads to speed restrictions and more frequent track upgrading. Hence, there is a need for innovative design solutions that can extend the service life of tracks to cater for faster and heavier train traffic. The use of planar geosynthetics and recycled rubber mats placed at the interface of ballast and subballast layer has proven an effective approach to mitigate ballast degradation and improve track longevity. This paper presents the current state-of-the-art knowledge of rail track geomechanics conducted at the University of Wollongong (UOW) including topics relating to laboratory testing and computational modeling approaches. The load-deformation responses of rubber mat/geogrid-stabilised ballast are studied in the laboratory using a large-scale drop weight impact testing facility, and Track Process Simulation Apparatus (TPSA). Numerical modelling using discrete element methods (DEM) are used to model geogrid-reinforced ballasted tracks, capturing both the discrete nature of ballast subject to various types of loading and boundary conditions. These results provide promising approaches to incorporate into the existing track design routines catering for future high speed and heavy haul trains...|$|E
40|$|Pavement layers are {{systematically}} {{constructed as}} engineered fills with specified properties and criteria; however these well built layers may be underlain by loose <b>saturated</b> <b>subgrades</b> that, if not treated, {{may be subject}} to undesirable and damaging deformations. This may be especially true for roads that are constructed on reclaimed land. Dynamic Compaction is a ground improvement technique that can and has been effectively utilised for treating thick loose layers of saturated in situ or reclaimed granular soils. In this paper, the application of Dynamic Compaction for improving loose sub-grades will be discussed using three case studies. The case studies have been specifically selected in a manner to demonstrate the applicability of this technique to hydraulic fills and truck dumped fills, to very large projects such as the 900, 000 m 2 Abu Dhabi Corniche, to moderately large projects such as Marjan Island Main Road corridor and to relatively small sized projects such as the 10, 000 m 2 approach roads of Reem Island Causeway. The projects can be in undeveloped locations or in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|Expansion of {{the rail}} network in {{congested}} coastal Australia compels track construction on soft clayey subgrade, including fine-grained estuarine soils. In such low-lying areas, where the water table {{is close to the}} ground surface, the <b>saturated</b> soft <b>subgrade</b> is often subjected to pumping (mud slurry) under the application of cyclic wheel loads, thereby causing fouling of the overlying ballast. This technical note presents the results of a series of large-scale, drained, cyclic, triaxial tests conducted on clay-fouled ballast. The impact of fouling on the stress-strain behaviour, resilient modulus and degradation of ballast is discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSoft, <b>saturated,</b> {{fine grained}} <b>subgrade</b> soils are {{distinguished}} by their low undrianed shear strength and high compressibility. Such soils cover {{most of the}} middle and southern parts of Iraq. The effect of using stone column, encased in geogrid and steel mesh to improve pavement's performance is experimentally investigated and evaluated. To compare the experimental and analytical outputs, three dimensions finite element throughout elastic and elasto-plastic models using ABAQUS ver. 6. 12. 3 software are developed to simulate and analyze {{the relations between the}} cycling load and deformation of the suggested pavement modes. Based on the results and the limitation of this study it is concluded that, using encased stone columns, is more practical and suitable alternative to improve weak subgrade against permanent deformation as compared with the other simulated pavement modes.

40|$|Maintenance of {{ballasted}} railway tracks {{is a major}} {{cost for}} railway infrastructure owners. In many developed countries, much of the railway infrastructure is mature and was built for service requirements long since superseded. The increased demands on historic infrastructure {{can lead to the}} development or exacerbation of localised trackbed problems that require disproportionate levels of maintenance. Identifying these and applying cost effective remediation has the potential to reduce maintenance spend in the long term. However, it is not always clear what the most cost effective remediation will be. One type of localised maintenance issue is the development of wet beds or wet spots, which can occur where <b>saturated</b> clayey <b>subgrade</b> soils are overloaded and result in the development of mud pumping as trains pass. This leads to the migration of fines into the ballast bed and a deterioration in local track performance. Over time the track overlying the wet bed settles disproportionately more, sleepers become progressively more voided, and train ride quality deteriorates. Maintenance of the wet bed may involve locally digging out and replacing the ballast; however, unless the underlying cause is addressed the problem is likely to recur, requiring repeated localised maintenance interventions. This is costly, reactive and ultimately an ineffective approach to managing the problem. This paper presents a study of a wet bed in the UK, both prior to and after a full track renewal. Transient track deflections during train passage were monitored using sleeper mounted geophones and high speed filming techniques. Loaded track geometry data were obtained from a track recording vehicle. It is shown that local maintenance interventions were generally ineffective, but that a renewal of the top 200 mm of the trackbed including placement of a geotextile filter and geogrid appears to have been successful in remediating the problem, {{at least in the short}} term...|$|R
40|$|Settlement {{prediction}} {{methods of}} soft subgrade {{based on the}} soil mechanical theories and mathematical statistics emerges in endlessly, but together with its limitations; the single theoretical calculation method maybe sometimes good, sometimes bad without the capacity to consider the change of the load; however {{the study of the}} theory of the combined forecast method is far from perfect. Under this situation, in view of the engineering practice in soft soil subgrade deformation law research in order to put forward a reasonable settlement prediction method, which is a problem urgently to be solved at present. Relying on gravel pile in soft soil subgrade construction in the highway K 9 + 420 -K 9 + 550 section, and analyzing the data measured according to the soft soil foundation in the loading and constant loading period, taking classification of embankment load into account, and based on the related parameters of soil at the same time using the numerical analysis of <b>saturated</b> soft soil <b>subgrade</b> deformation-seepage coupling calculation, comparing the measured data with the finite element results and checking the fit, based on detailed sedimentation data by using curve-fitting method for calculating ultimate settlement value and compared with the finite element method settlement value for several years under broaden embankment. The two values differ by 1. 5 cm, which is in a controllable range for soft soil. Then thus the results are true and reliable in order to have implications for similar projects...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary This project {{includes}} {{the use of}} expanding rigid polyurethane foam to remediate substructure deficiencies in railroad track at a field site in Illinois. Soft substructure soils exhibit creep or consolidation that lead to excess track settlement. Cyclic loading from passing trains can fail the subgrade, with progressive cyclic shear failure. Track settlement and progressive shear failure were found at a field sites in Dayton, Illinois. Following a geotechnical and geophysical investigation of the sites, URETEK USA planned a polyurethane injection strategy to compress the subgrade soils and permeate the subballast layer. Polyurethane injection was compared to traditional railroad maintenance with a Life-Cycle Cost Analysis and Life-Cycle Analysis. Due to weather and scheduling difficulties, the injection results will be appended and included in a final, updated report. A full-scale prototype model is often the ideal simulation of the final product for field application. Therefore, in geotechnical engineering, different models are developed to test proposed construction methods, interaction between elements, and field performance. Areas where experimental products are used in full-scale applications, and that are constructed with traditional equipment and techniques, are invaluable to researchers and industry alike. The prototyped product can be evaluated in real-world conditions, where not all variables can be closely controlled. Laboratory tests, while important, cannot replicate porewater distributions and soil heterogeneity in the environment where the product is proposed for use. The expanding rigid polyurethane enhanced ballast research began in 2011 with Keene (2012) investigating the performance of clean ballast injected with polyurethane (PUR) in a collaboration of with UW-Madison and URETEK USA. PUR strengthened the ballast layer in both compression and flexural tests. Dolcek (2013) investigated the same PUR, but with injection into ballast with varying amounts of fouling (fine) materials and water content. Similar to Keene (2012), the mechanical behavior was enhanced in both compression and flexural, but flexural performance of fouled ballast was below that of the clean ballast. Enhancement of the ballast layer was proven over repeated experiments with different ballast types and gradations and resulted in the motivation to test this technology in the field. A railroad track site was chosen in Dayton, Illinois, for which fraccing sand is transported to test {{the performance of a}} substructure deficient section of railroad injected with PUR. This spur line receives fully loaded unit trains on a near daily basis. Car switching and train assembly (putting cars in proper positions for transportation) occurs here as well. The track borders the Fox River, and there are substructure problems with: soft soil, settlement, and embankment failures along this stretch of track. To clarify what the contributing underlying problems are at the track field site, the ?Dayton Dip,? geotechnical and geophysical investigations were conducted. URETEK USA/ICR provided Dynamic Cone Penetrometer logs, which give an indication of soil strength. The UW-Madison team conducted Ground Penetrating Radar, Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Time Domain Reflectometry, and excavated test pits to take samples to run engineering property tests in a laboratory setting. The data from these different tests collectively verified the hypothesis of a highly fouled ballast layer, with a soft <b>saturated</b> clay <b>subgrade</b> beneath. There were classic subgrade shear failures along the track and at bridge approaches; i. e., the ?bump {{at the end of the}} bridge? in which an abrupt change in track stiffness causes differential settlement. The investigation assisted in the design of two types of polyurethane injection: one to strengthen the subballast and one to strengthen and stiffen soft subsurface material. With URETEK USA?s background in polyurethane injection for infrastructure projects, including rail crossings, their expertise was necessary in designing a functional and economical injection package. The injection was proposed as a combination of subballast layer strengthening and URETEK Deep Injection (UDI) to strengthen and stiffen the subgrade. Due to imposed restrictions of the railroad, PUR could not be placed within 30 cm of the bottom of the tie. The evaluation of polyurethane injection included mobilization and construction costs, track stiffening, maintenance, and environmental impact. Fast construction time decreases user costs and inconveniences. Furthermore, environmental impact has become an important consideration in construction projects. Polyurethane injection can fulfill these metrics. A life-cycle cost analysis was conducted with inputs from URETEK and Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, over a ten-year period. Over a 10 -year period, PUR injection appears to be a superior improvement methodology to traditional maintenance resulting in a cost savings from $ 1000 - $ 20, 000 depending on discount rate. In the life-cycle analysis, PUR injection results in use of water, and CO 2 emissions, 82 %, and 5 % respectively, compared to traditional maintenance methods. After the ongoing portion of this project are completed, various instruments and techniques will be used to monitor the rail section. To measure the dynamic properties and track modulus, strain gauges will be used to measure the cumulative strain in the super-structure and sub-structure of the track. Survey reflectors will be installed every 2 m on both sides of the rail to measure settlement and differential settlement between rails. Finally, settlement rods will be installed to isolate the response of different layers and their corresponding contribution to the permanent deformation in the railroad track. An un-injected control section will be also instrumented to compare results and assess PUR effectiveness. Due to schedule constraints (e. g., early onset of cold weather in 2014), the injections were not completed before the completion of this thesis. Therefore, when the pilot study is completed and analyzed, results will be appended, and a final, updated report issued to the project sponsors. Included in the Appendix are laboratory tests of environmental impacts on polyurethane stabilized fouled ballast and rigid polyurethane foam. Freeze-thaw cycling was conducted; degradation was tracked and tested with non-destructive methods and cyclic triaxial testing. No effect was determined after 20 -freeze-thaw cycles. Long term water absorbance of polyurethane foam was investigated. Samples were submerged for 120 -days then tested in unconfined compression. Minimal, approximately 3 %, changes were seen from ideal polyurethane samples. The results from freeze-thaw cycling and water absorbance indicate that PUR will remain stable in field conditions...|$|R
