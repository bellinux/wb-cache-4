A number of typical variants has been studied, such as <b>the</b> Team <b>OP,</b> <b>the</b> (Team) <b>OP</b> with Time Windows and <b>the</b> Time Dependent <b>OP.</b> Recently, a number of new variants of <b>the</b> <b>OP</b> was introduced, such as <b>the</b> Stochastic <b>OP,</b> <b>the</b> Generalized <b>OP,</b> <b>the</b> Arc <b>OP,</b> <b>the</b> Multi-agent <b>OP,</b> <b>the</b> Clustered <b>OP</b> and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of <b>the</b> <b>OP,</b> including <b>the</b> proposed solution approaches.
