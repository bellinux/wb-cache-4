25|$|Pound locks {{were first}} used in medieval China during the Song Dynasty (9601279 AD).The Songshi or History of the Song Dynasty, volume 307, {{biography}} 66, records how Qiao Weiyue, a high-ranking tax administrator, was frustrated at the frequent losses incurred when his grain barges were wrecked on the West River near Huaiâ€™an in Jiangsu. The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges {{so that they}} could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of <b>sluice-gates</b> two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.|$|E

The measurements have been performed by varying the slope and roughness of the channel bed {{and the amount of}} cohesionless solid material (gravel) mixed with water stored in a tank above the <b>sluice-gate</b> {{at the beginning of the}} test. It has been observed that the bed roughness does not immediately affect the evolution of the debris flow and its effects are seen only after a certain time from the opening of the <b>sluice-gate.</b> This observation provides a way to evaluate the time scale of the resistance force in the debris flow. Moreover, sometimes the dam-break wave evolves into a fully developed flow, allowing a quantitative description of the steady motion of a debris flow...|$|R

HE does not trouble his head as I do, about the river at night. HE does not care for its creeping, black and silent, on our right there, rushing through <b>sluice-gates,</b> lapping at piles and posts and iron rings, hiding strange things in its mud, running away with suicides and accidentally drowned bodies faster than midnight funeral should, and acquiring such various experience between its cradle and its grave.

60|$|When we {{came near}} the churchyard, {{we had to}} cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a <b>sluice-gate.</b> There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his {{stagnant}} way), Old Orlick.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Gordon was riding, circumspectly, {{down the}} rutted trail, {{and it was}} an hour later when he dismounted at the shanty of Nasmyth's workmen, and shared a meal with the gang employed on the dam. After that he sat with Nasmyth, who still limped a little, in the hut, from which, as the door stood open, they could see the men stream up into the Bush and out along the dam. The dam now stood high above the water-level, for the frost had bound fast the feeding snow upon the peaks above, though the stream roared and frothed through the two big <b>sluice-gates.</b> By-and-by, the ringing of axes and the clink of drills broke through the sound of the rushing waters. Gordon, who stretched himself out on a deer-hide lounge, smiled at Nasmyth as he lighted his pipe.|$|E
60|$|Then the <b>sluice-gates</b> {{were opened}} and the whole story was told. Sitting there {{late into the night}} Mary told it all as well as she knew how,--all of it except in regard to any spark of love which might have fallen upon her in respect of Reginald Morton. Of Reginald Morton in her story of course she did not speak; but all the rest she declared. She did not love the man. She was quite sure of that. Though she thought so well of him there was, she was quite sure, no feeling in her heart akin to love. She had promised to take time because she had thought that she might perhaps be able to bring herself to marry him without loving him,--to marry him because her father wished it, and because her going from home would be a relief to her {{stepmother}} and sisters, because it would be well for them all that she should be settled out of the way. But since that she had made up her mind,--she thought that she had quite made up her mind,--that it would be impossible.|$|E
60|$|Now, Joe kept a {{journeyman}} at weekly wages {{whose name}} was Orlick. He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,--a clear Impossibility,--but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him {{to have been the}} prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and {{when he went to the}} Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the <b>sluice-gates,</b> or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched, locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful, half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.|$|E
50|$|The fort is {{situated}} {{on a hill}} surrounded by a moat and accessible during opening hours. It was built in 1889-1890 with sand taken from the excavations for a new <b>sluice-gate</b> complex in IJmuiden. On 3 May 1943 an American Ventura bomber crashed into the moat.|$|R
60|$|He {{called at}} the water-keeper's cottage {{and took the}} key of the sluice. They went through a little gate from the high-road, {{to the head of}} the water, where was a great stone basin which {{received}} the overflow, and a flight of stone steps descended into the depths of the water itself. At the head of the steps was the lock of the <b>sluice-gate.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then came two fine days when, {{although}} the sun shone, heavy clouds rolled about the hills. Jim, knowing the fine weather would not last, drove his men hard, {{since there was}} work he must push forward before the next flood.

6000|$|When Mr. Fenwick {{reached the}} mill, he found old Brattle sitting {{alone on a}} fixed bench {{in front of the}} house door with a pipe in his mouth. Mary Lowther was quite right in saying that the mill, in spite of its dilapidations,--perhaps by reason of them,--was as pretty as {{anything}} in Bullhampton. In the first place it was permeated and surrounded by cool, bright, limpid little streams. One of them ran right through it, as it were, passing between the dwelling-house and the mill, and turning the wheel, which was there placed. This course was, no doubt, artificial, and the water ran more rapidly in it than it did in the neighbouring streamlets. There were <b>sluice-gates,</b> too, by which it could be altogether expelled, or kept up to this or that height; and it was a river absolutely under man's control, in which no water-god could take delight. But there were other natural streams on each side of the building, the one being the main course of the Avon, and the other some offspring of a brooklet, which joined its parent two hundred yards below, and fifty yards from the spot at which the ill-used working water was received back into its mother's idle bosom. Mill and house were thatched, and were very low. There were garrets in the roof, but they were so shaped that they could hardly be said to have walls to them at all, so nearly were they contained by the sloping roof. In front of the building there ran a road,--which after all was no more than a private lane. It crossed the smaller stream and the mill-run by two wooden bridges; but the river itself had been too large for the bridge-maker's efforts, and here there was a ford, with stepping-stones for foot passengers. The banks on every side were lined with leaning willows, which had been pollarded over and over again, and which with their light-green wavy heads gave the place, from a distance, the appearance of a grove. There was a little porch {{in front of the house}}, and outside of that a fixed seat, with a high back, on which old Brattle was sitting when the parson accosted him. He did not rise when Mr. Fenwick addressed him; but he intended no want of courtesy by not doing so. He was on his legs at business during nearly the whole of the day, and why should he not rest his old limbs during the few mid-day minutes which he allowed himself for recreation? ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{disposed}} {{to believe that}} no novel reader in England has seen {{the little town of}} Bullhampton, in Wiltshire, except such novel readers as live there, and those others, very few in number, who visit it perhaps four times a year for the purposes of trade, and who are known as commercial gentlemen. Bullhampton is seventeen miles from Salisbury, eleven from Marlborough, nine from Westbury, seven from Haylesbury, and five from the nearest railroad station, which is called Bullhampton Road, and lies on the line from Salisbury to Ycovil. It is not quite on Salisbury Plain, but probably was so once, when Salisbury Plain was wider than it is now. Whether it should be called a small town or a large village I cannot say. It has no mayor, and no market, but it has a fair. There rages a feud in Bullhampton touching this want of a market, as there are certain Bullhamptonites who aver that the charter giving all rights of a market to Bullhampton does exist; and that at one period in its history the market existed also,--for a year or two; but the three bakers and two butchers are opposed to change; and the patriots of the place, though they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes and gin-and-water, have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out their purpose. Bullhampton is situated on a little river, which meanders through the chalky ground, and has a quiet, slow, dreamy prettiness of its own. A mile above the town,--for we will call it a town,--the stream divides itself into many streamlets, and there is a district called the Water Meads, in which bridges are more frequent than trustworthy, in which there are hundreds of little <b>sluice-gates</b> for regulating the irrigation, and a growth of grass which is a source of much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers. There is a water-mill here, too, very low, with ever a floury, mealy look, with a pasty look often, as the flour becomes damp with the spray of the water as it is thrown by the mill-wheel. It seems to be a tattered, shattered, ramshackle concern, but {{it has been in the}} same family for many years; and as the family has not hitherto been in distress, it may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means of livelihood. The Brattles,--for Jacob Brattle is the miller's name,--have ever been known as men who paid their way, and were able to hold up their heads. But nevertheless Jacob Brattle is ever at war with his landlord in regard to repairs wanted for his mill, and Mr. Gilmore, the landlord in question, declares that he wishes that the Avon would some night run so high as to carry off the mill altogether. Bullhampton is very quiet. There is no special trade in the place. Its interests are altogether agricultural. It has no newspaper. Its tendencies are altogether conservative. It is a good deal given to religion; and the Primitive Methodists have a very strong holding there, although in all Wiltshire there is not a clergyman more popular in his own parish than the Rev. Frank Fenwick. He himself, in his inner heart, rather likes his rival, Mr. Puddleham, the dissenting minister; because Mr. Puddleham is an earnest man, who, in spite of the intensity of his ignorance, is efficacious among the poor. But Mr. Fenwick is bound to keep up the fight; and Mr. Puddleham considers it to be his duty to put down Mr. Fenwick and the Church Establishment altogether.|$|E
50|$|The closure by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization, of the <b>sluice-gates</b> of Mavil Aru on July 26, 2006, was {{a crucial}} {{turning point in the}} Sri Lankan Civil War.

50|$|The {{method is}} well {{described}} by Pliny the Elder in Book XXXIII of his Naturalis Historia from the 1st century AD. He distinguishes {{the use of}} the method for prospecting for ore and use during mining itself. It was used during the Roman period for hydraulic mining of alluvial gold deposits, and in opencast vein mining, for removal of rock debris, created by mechanical attack and fire-setting. He describes how tanks and reservoirs are built near the suspected veins, filled with water from an aqueduct, and the water suddenly released from a <b>sluice-gate</b> onto the hillside below, scouring the soil away to reveal the bedrock and any veins occurring there.|$|R

Jim talked about his troubles at some length while Evelyn tried to look sympathetic, and afterwards stated, with numerous particulars, his projects for improving the estate, although he carefully explained that his losing his money might prevent their being carried out. While he sketched his plans he unconsciously delineated his character, and when he went away Evelyn felt daunted.|$|R

40|$|The general {{solution}} of the dam-break problem with partial uplift of the <b>sluice-gate</b> {{is presented in the}} framework of the one-dimensional Shallow-Water Equations, under the hypothesis that the classic Energy-Momentum (E-M) formulation is used to evaluate the flow characteristics at the gate. Due to the nonlinearity of the problem, there are ranges of the initial conditions for which the problem admits multiple solutions, or no solution. In the ranges in which there are multiple solutions, the maximization of the discharge under the gate is used as a disambiguation criterion. The exact solutions are used as a benchmark in order to evaluate the results of a simple Finite-Volume scheme, where the discharge under the gate and the forces exerted on the flow by the gate itself are calculated using the E-M formulation...|$|R

50|$|The dam {{consists}} of a masonry dam about 2769 ft long extended on both sides by earthen banks, making a total length of about 3937 ft. There are 111 arched openings of 5 m span in the masonry dam. They can be closed by steel <b>sluice-gates</b> 16 ft high. The piers and arches are founded upon a masonry platform 87 ft wide by 10 ft thick. This platform is protected on its up-stream and down-stream sides by a continuous and impermeable line of cast iron tongued and grooved sheet-piling with cemented joints. This piling extends into the sand bed of the river {{to a depth of}} 23 ft below the upper surface of the platform and prevents it from being undermined. The river bed is protected against erosion for a width of 67 ft upstream by a stone paving laid on a puddle clay blanket to check infiltration, and on the downstream side for the same width by a stone paving having an inverted filter bed underneath, so that any springs that may be caused by the water above the sluices shall not carry sand with them from beneath the paving.|$|E
50|$|In 1777, after {{a branch}} of the Somme was blocked at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, the {{authorities}} decided to build a canal from Abbeville to the estuary at Saint Valery. Work began in 1786 but hit problems in 1793 with the installation of the <b>sluice-gates</b> in the muddy sub-strata and above all, the reaction of the local farmers, raising sheep and cattle on the salt-marshes. Work resumed under the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, who wanted Saint-ValÃ©ry-sur-Somme as a war-port. In 1810, Spanish prisoners worked on the terracing and the maritime canal was inaugurated in 1827.In 1840, Laviers took the name of Grand-Laviers and from 1845 to 1850, the railway line from Abbeville to Ã‰taples was built, a section of the Paris - Boulogne line. The river bed of the Somme was filled and moved to accommodate the construction.The town was comparatively safe during the First World War, accommodating Indian colonial assistants. In May 1940, during the Second World War, the town was separated from Abbeville.It was liberated by English troops in August 1944. In 1953, a primary school was constructed at Grand-Laviers, and the following year, the pupils of the school inherited a castle from the Jusancourt family that now houses an educational medical institute.On May 2, 1976, the commune of Petit-Laviers was amalgamated with Grand-Laviers.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the pool began in the 8th century BC, when a dam was built across the short Beth Zeta valley, {{turning it into a}} {{reservoir}} for rain water; a <b>sluice-gate</b> in the dam allowed the height to be controlled, and a rock-cut channel brought a steady stream of water from the reservoir into the city. The reservoir became known as the Upper Pool (×‘×¨×™×›×” ×”×¢×œ×™×•× ×”). Around 200 BC, during the period in which Simon II was the Jewish High Priest, the channel was enclosed, and a second pool was added {{on the south side of}} the dam; although popular legend argues that this pool was used for washing sheep, this is very unlikely due to the pool's use as a water supply, and its extreme depth (13m).|$|R
