In irrigated agriculture, it may be recommended to: apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) to displace sodium cations with calcium and so reduce ESP or <b>sodicity,</b> avoid rapid wetting, and avoid disturbing soils when too wet or dry.|$|E

50|$|Soil <b>sodicity</b> refers the soil's {{content of}} sodium {{compared}} to its content of other cations, such as calcium. In high levels, sodium ions break apart clay platelets and cause swelling and dispersion in soil. This results in reduced soil sustainability. If the concentration occurs repeatedly, the soil becomes cement-like, {{with little or}} no structure. Extended exposure to high sodium levels results in a decrease in the amount of water retained and able to flow through soil, as well as a decrease in decomposition rates (this leaves the soil infertile and prohibit any future growth). This issue is prominent in Australia, where 1/3 of the land is affected by high levels of salt. It is a natural occurrence, but farming practices such as overgrazing and cultivation have contributed to the rise of it. The options for managing sodic soils are very limited; one must either change the plants or change the soil. The latter is the more difficult process. If changing the soil, one must add calcium to absorb the excess sodium that blocks water flow.|$|E

40|$|Concern that <b>sodicity</b> {{developing}} at a {{soil surface}} might increase soil strength, {{and thus have}} an indirect adverse effect on germination, stimulated this investigation. The aim {{was to investigate the}} link between the strength developing at a soil surface and rising salinity and <b>sodicity.</b> A soil containing small amounts of a swelling clay, of a type known to suffer from capping, was deliberately salinised in order to impose a range of salinities and sodicities at the soil surface. It was found that the strength at the surface increased during the actual salinisation process, but this was almost exclusively related to the rise in <b>sodicity,</b> and was not influenced to any great extent by the rising salinity. Further strengthening occurred on leaching, and this was also strongly linked to the <b>sodicity</b> at the soil surface immediately before leaching. The strength of the surface increased with rising <b>sodicity</b> up to a maximum consistent with values indicated in the literature as being likely to cause problems due to swelling and dispersion. Above these critical <b>sodicity</b> levels, the strength of the surface remained constant but at a high value.

40|$|Soil <b>sodicity</b> {{development}} {{is a process that}} depends nonlinearly on both salt concentration and composition of soil water. In particular in hot climates, soil water composition is subject to temporal variation due to dry–wet cycles. To investigate the effect of such cycles on soil salinity and <b>sodicity,</b> a simple root zone model is developed that accounts for annual salt accumulation and leaching periods. Cation exchange is simplified to considering only Ca/Na exchange, using the Gapon exchange equation. The resulting salt and Ca/Na-balances are solved for a series of dry/wet cycles with a standard numerical approach. Due to the nonlinearities in the Gapon equation, the fluctuations of soil salinity that may be induced, e. g. by fluctuating soil water content, affect <b>sodicity</b> development. Even for the case that salinity is in a periodic steady state, where salt concentrations do not increase on the long term, <b>sodicity</b> may still grow as a function of time from year to year. For the longer term, <b>sodicity,</b> as quantified by Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP), approaches a maximum value that depends on drought and inflowing water quality, but not on soil cation exchange capacity. Analytical approaches for the salinity and <b>sodicity</b> developing under such fluctuating regimes appear to be in good agreement with numerical approximations and are very useful for checking numerical results and anticipating changes in practical situation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Salinity and <b>sodicity</b> {{are major}} {{constraint}} in increasing crop production at global level. Millions of the hectares {{of the land}} are too saline to produce economic yield.   In Ethiopia, 11 million ha of land is salt affected, about half of these soils are saline and remaining half are saline - sodic and sodic soil. As most of the arable land and quality water resources have already been exploited, the use of saline or urban/industrial waste water may be a viable alternative for further agro production. In view of such perspectives, an investigation was conducted to {{examine the effect of}} salinity (NaCl) and <b>sodicity</b> (Na 2 CO 3) on  biomass, total nitrogen, nitrate reductase activity, leaf area, and chlorophyll contents in Maize (Zea mays L.) plants. The appropriate amount of NaCl and Na 2 CO 3   was  dissolved in distilled water for appraisal of artificial  salinity and <b>sodicity</b> levels (0, 4, 8,  and 12   and  mScm- 1) in soil medium. Plants were also supplied with potassium (0 and 5 mM KNO 3) as remedial treatment. Maize plants were analyzed for germination, early growth, biomass, total nitrogen, Nitrate reductase activity, Leaf area, and chlorophyll contents as grown under different ECe levels of salinity and <b>sodicity.</b> The extent of salinity and <b>sodicity</b> effects was compared on the basis of different parameters. It was observed that plants showed substantial reduction in all parameters due to imposition of salinity and <b>sodicity</b> in root medium and it was more so due to <b>sodicity.</b> However, the use of additional potassium brought about an enhancement in these parameters.   It is suggested that plants may be raised in saline soil and saline water however; the extent of success depends upon salinity and <b>sodicity</b> levels, remedial treatments and plant species.

The influence of both <b>sodicity</b> and salinity were less with unground than ground plant material because of reduced interaction of substrates with the soil matrix. The effects of the treatments on mineralisation of plant C were established within the first 20 days of incubation. Mineralisation of native soil C was increased by <b>sodicity</b> throughout the incubation at low salinity, but was unaffected by <b>sodicity</b> at high salinity.

This is particularly relevant to less-developed, arid and semi-arid countries, in which problems of soil and water quality degradation are common (Qadir and Oster, 2004). The aim, therefore, should be to increase yield per unit of land rather than the area cultivated. More efforts are needed to improve productivity as more lands are becoming degraded. It is estimated that about 15 % of the total land area of the world has been degraded by soil erosion and physical and chemical degradation, including soil salinization (Wild, 2003). The main sources of soil salinity and <b>sodicity</b> development are groundwater and irrigation water. In discharge areas of the landscape, water exits from groundwater to the soil surface bringing the salts dissolved in it. The driving force for upward movement of water and salts is evaporation from the soil plus plant transpiration. Salt accumulation is high when the water table depth is less than a threshold. However, this threshold depth may vary depending on soil hydraulic properties and climatic conditions. Groundwater associated salinity and <b>sodicity</b> affects around 350 X 10 4 km 2 in the world (Szabolcs, 1989). In this thesis, the focus is to quantify and understand the salinity and <b>sodicity</b> dynamics, and the feedback on dynamics in groundwater dependent agro-ecosystems. First we have considered the impact of salt coming from groundwater on capillary fluxes and on the root zone water and salt dynamics. Groundwater can be a source of both water and salts in semi-arid areas, and therefore capillary pressure induced upward water flow may cause root zone salinization. To identify which conditions result in hazardous salt concentrations in the root zone, we combined the mass balance equations for salt and water, further assuming a Poisson-distributed daily rainfall and brackish groundwater quality. For the water fluxes (leaching, capillary upflow, and evapotranspiration), we account for osmotic effects of the dissolved salt mass using Van‘t Hoff’s law. Root zone salinity depends on salt transport via capillary flux and on evapotranspiration, which concentrates salt in the root zone. Both a wet climate and shallow groundwater lead to wetter root zone conditions, which in combination with periodic rainfall enhances salt removal by leaching. For wet climates, root zone salinity (concentrations) increases as groundwater is more shallow (larger groundwater influence). For dry climates, salinity increases as groundwater is deeper due to a drier root zone and less leaching. For intermediate climates, opposing effects can push the salt balance in either way. Root zone salinity increases almost linearly with groundwater salinity. With a simple analytical approximation, maximum concentrations can be related with the mean capillary flow rate, leaching rate, water saturation and groundwater salinity, for different soils, climates and groundwater depths.      A Soil <b>sodicity</b> (quantified by ESP) model based on the soil salinity model (as discussed above) has been developed. For <b>sodicity</b> calculations, we have used the Gapon equation favored in salinity research. The simulation results show that soil salinity and <b>sodicity</b> development in groundwater driven agro-ecosystems {{play a major role in}} soil structure degradation. To identify which conditions can make soil sodic, we have modeled the coupled water, salt, and cation balances. The root zone salinity Cand <b>sodicity</b> ESPgradually change to their long term average values. These long term average values are independent of the cation exchange capacity CEC. The rate of change depends inversely on the size of the root zone reservoir, i. e., on root zone thickness for C, and additionally on CEC, for ESP. Soil type can have a large effect on both the rate of approach of the long term steady state salinity and <b>sodicity,</b> and on the long term levels, as it affects the incoming and out-going water and chemical fluxes. Considering two possible sources of salts, i. e., groundwater and irrigation water (here represented by rainfall), the long term salt concentration Cof the root zone corresponds well with a flux weighted average of infiltrating and upflowing salt mass divided by the average water drainage. In full analogy, the long term ESPcan be approximated very well for different groundwater depths and climates. A more refined analytical approximation, based on the analytical solution of the water balance of Vervoort and Van der Zee(2008), leads to a quite good approximation of long term salinity and <b>sodicity,</b> for different soils, groundwater depths, and climates. Modeling is an efficient tool to investigate water and solute movement in groundwater driven agro-ecosystems. However, in most available models (SWAP,MODFLOW/MT 3 D) continuing degradation of soil hydraulic properties as a result of rising Na + concentrations is ignored. Disregarding the soil hydraulic degradation due to <b>sodicity</b> level in some cases makes modeling water and solute movement within the soil profile questionable. We have translated the effects of soil salinity and <b>sodicity</b> into reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity to quantify the feedback effects of reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity on root zone fluxes, salinity, and <b>sodicity</b> under different groundwater depths and climates of Oenpelli and Tennant Creek Airport located in the North Territory of Australia. The reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity due to salinity and <b>sodicity</b> (Ks(C,ESP)) has been calculated by using the procedure developed by McNeal(1968). The significant feedback effects of Ks(C,ESP) on salt concentration and soil ESPdepend on many important parameters like groundwater depth, leaf area index, weather seasonality and non-seasonality, and soil type. Out of these important parameters, weather seasonality is the main driver that can develop significant feedback effects of Ks(C,ESP) onsalt concentration and soil ESP. Furthermore, Ks(C,ESP) although decreasing the capillary flux, leaching flux, and evapotranspiration, it increases the magnitude of runoff. Also when Ks(C,ESP) affects both capillary and leaching flux under seasonal rainfall, the feedback effects are significant compared to the partial feedback (Ks(C,ESP) affects only leaching flux, but not capillary flux). In the second theme of this thesis, we have focused on optimizing irrigation water between two farms under water scarcity and salinity regimes. In arid and semi-arid regions, irrigation water is scarce and often saline. To reduce negative effects on crop yields, the irrigated amounts must include water for leaching and therefore exceed evapotranspiration. The leachate (drainage) water returns to water sources such as rivers or groundwater aquifers and increases their level of salinity and the leaching requirement for irrigation water of any sequential user. We develop a sequential (upstream-downstream) model of irrigation that predicts crop yields and water consumption and tracks the water flow and level of salinity along a river dependent on irrigation management decisions. The model incorporates an agro-physical model of plant response to environmental conditions including feedbacks. For a system with limited water resources, the model examines the impacts of water scarcity, salinity and inefficient application on yields for specific crop, soil, and climate conditions. As a general pattern we find that, as salinity level and technical inefficiency increase, the system benefits when upstream farms use less water than is available to them, to provide downstream farms with more and better quality water. We compute the marginal value of water, i. e. the price water that would command on a market, for different levels of water scarcity, salinity and levels of water loss.     In summary this thesis aims to understand theoretically how soil salinity and <b>sodicity</b> develop under different climates, groundwater depths, soil types, root zone thicknesses, and different groundwater salinities. The developed salinity <b>sodicity</b> model can be applied in potential salt affected areas to predict the long term salinity, <b>sodicity</b> trends. Furthermore, quantification of feedback effects of reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks(C,ESP)) on root zone fluxes, salinity, and <b>sodicity</b> guide us towards better management of soil, vegetation, and irrigation/groundwater.     ...|$|E
