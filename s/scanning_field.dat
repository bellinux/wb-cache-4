The key feature distinguishing it from other scanning scenarios is that the <b>scanning</b> <b>field</b> has a non-canonical kinetic term, whose role is to terminate the scan around the desired Higgs mass value. We propose a concrete realisation of this idea with two new singlet fields, one that scans the Higgs mass, and another that limits the time window in which the scan is possible.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, a novel optical {{design for}} an afocal scan engine {{based on two}} 90 ° {{off-axis}} parabolic optical elements acting as reflective relay optics between two deflecting mirrors is proposed. The characteristics of this scan engine such as linearity of scan lines, spot sizes, spot intensity profiles, field curvature, and temporal distortion across the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> have been investigated. The new scan engine was also evaluated as an afocal relay, with scan optics and for optical zoom performance. The engine was modelled and investigated using OSLO, commercial optical software. Its performance was evaluated and compared to known scan engines with results showing superior linearity of scan lines and intensity distribution across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> The advantage of using it with a fast resonant scan mirror is highlighted. The new scan engine prototype and known scan engines were assembled in the laboratory and their performance was evaluated and compared in order to verify the OSLO prediction. The experimentally measured results {{were found to be}} in agreement with the OSLO predicted results. A physical explanation for the difference in results has been provided. Using OSLO optical software, a study of temporal distortion across the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> was then conducted. The calculated results predict that the use of the new scan engine in two-photon microscopy may result in improved contrast in two-photon images across the <b>scan</b> <b>field.</b> The new two-photon excitation correction factor for reflective scan engines was introduced and its evaluation confirmed that the new engine is the best choice for fast scanning two-photon microscopy (TPM) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{selective}} laser melting process features a nearly incomparable freedom of design. But its potential is still limited due to remaining porosity, cracking, distortion, low build-up rates and a limited range of materials. While there is some progress in process control and multiple parallel <b>scan</b> <b>fields</b> to tackle these issues, the potential of synchronized multibeam strategies {{has not yet been}} investigated. The presented synchronized multibeam approach is characterized by two widely overlapping <b>scan</b> <b>fields</b> fed by two independent laser sources that can be controlled to work in a synchronized manner with or without a defined offset. This allows a selective manipulation of the local temperature field and thus of melt pool dynamics, the temperature gradients and cooling rates, which are all influencing the processes’ porosity, cracking and distortion behavior. Therefore the influences of these strategies on the melt pool dimensions and dynamics as well as the temperature gradients are investigated in this work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new reconstruction algorithm for both single- and dual-energy computed tomography (CT) imaging. By incorporating the polychromatic {{characteristics of the}} X-ray beam into the reconstruction process, the algorithm is capable of eliminating beam hardening artifacts. The single energy version of the algorithm assumes that each voxel in the <b>scan</b> <b>field</b> can be expressed as a mixture of two known substances, for example, a mixture of trabecular bone and marrow, or a mixture of fat and flesh. These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) setting. We have compared our algorithm to three commonly used single-energy correction techniques. Experimental results show that our algorithm is much more robust and accurate. We have also shown that QCT measurements obtained using our algorithm are five times more accurate than that from current QCT systems (using calibration). The dual-energy mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the <b>scan</b> <b>field,</b> {{and can be used}} to estimate the attenuation coefficient function of unknown materials.

Flat missile road program scans and does not shrink. Its flight speed falls and declines rapidly, has different gliding distance and terminal velocity.

But shortcomings are that target tracking scanning domain contracts. Using the seeker optical axis in the pitch direction can achieve accurate positioning with the height precession.

In this contribution, a more detailed study on the influences of the surface oxide layers on the field emission on Nb surfaces will be reported. By anodization technique, the thickness of the surface pentoxide layer was artificially fabricated from 3 nm up to 460 nm. A home-made <b>scanning</b> <b>field</b> emission microscope (SFEM) was employed to perform the scans on the surfaces.

40|$|We {{describe}} fiber-optic stand magnifiers {{specifically designed}} for use as low-vision reading aids. Application of this technology results in better optical and ergonomic properties. The fiber-optic magnifiers (tapers) provide bright, uniformly illuminated, distortion-free images. The reading material can be scanned without the user’s having to bend directly over the magnifier. One can further increase the <b>scanning</b> <b>field</b> by slanting the taper to tilt the image toward the observer. Tilting the upper face of the taper by cutting the smaller lower face on a bias is shown to increase the scanning range substantially and to provide better control of illumination. The scanning range of such tilted tapers is approximately double that of the equivalent lens magnifiers. To increase the contrast transfer through the magnifiers, we have developed lower-resolution tapers with an increased core-to-cladding ratio. The increase in contrast transfer is reported for representative tapers. The lower-resolution design is also helpful in reducing the manufacturing cost of taper magnifiers. 1...|$|E

Two observers assessed the quality of the models independently on a five-point scale using specified criteria. The results indicate that large-field selection reduced the visibility of the teeth and the interproximal space. Also, large voxel size reduced the visibility of the occlusal surfaces and bone in the anterior region in both maxilla and mandible. Segmentation threshold was more variable in the maxilla than in the mandible. Closed-mouth scan complicated separating the jaws and reduced teeth surfaces visibility. The preliminary results from this image-intensifier system indicate that the use of medium or small <b>scan</b> <b>fields</b> in an open-mouth position with a small voxel is recommended to optimize quality of the 3 D surface model reconstructions of the dental arches from CBCT.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-reference, scan-based Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH) is {{a useful}} {{measurement}} tool {{that can be applied}} when an insufficient number of microphones are available to make measurements on a complete hologram surface simultaneously. The scan-based procedure can be used to construct a complete hologram by joining together sub-holograms captured using a relatively small, roving scan array and a fixed reference array. For the procedure to be successful, the source levels must remain stationary for the time taken to record the complete hologram: that is unlikely to be the case in practice, however. Usually, the reference signal levels measured during each scan differ from each other with the result that spatial noise is added to the hologram. A non-stationarity compensation procedure that is based on the acoustical transfer functions between the sources and both the reference and <b>scanning,</b> <b>field</b> microphones are invariable is introduced. Numerical and experimental results show well the availability of the introduced procedures to suppress the spatially distributed noise and to get better sound fields partially separated...|$|E
