50|$|OE dampers are {{predominantly}} made using rubber as the bonding agent between the inner hub {{and the outer}} mass. Rubber is susceptible to operational and environmental factors. Rubber only has a finite ability to withstand operating temperatures plus any fluids that may find their way onto the damper. They are also susceptible to low temperatures which can make them brittle. Any cracking of the elastomer would be an immediate indicator {{of the need to}} replace the unit. OE dampers must be balanced, unless acting as an external balancer (Harmonic Balancer), as the quality of materials (usually cast or <b>sintered</b> <b>iron)</b> do not lend themselves to acceptable/perfect balance straight from manufacturing. Most aftermarket dampers are rebuildable, excluding the fluid type. When used in racing (drag, circle track, road race, etc.) they require regular inspection to assure their proper function.

5000|$|... 1969 - 1982In {{the late}} 1960s, Colt {{began to be}} {{concerned}} with a decline in its market share because of price increases brought about by the high labor costs inherent in its manufacturing processes. In response, an entirely new product line of revolvers dubbed the MK III series debuted in 1969. Intended to be the first major advancement of Colt’s designs {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century, the MK IIIs used a new ‘J’ frame and had no parts interchangeability with older models. The new revolvers were considered groundbreaking as they were the first modern revolver designs to employ a state of the art transfer-bar lockwork system. This lockwork was not only more sophisticated, but inherently safer due to its superiority to the older hammer-blocking designs; the revolver could fire only if the trigger was deliberately pulled completely to the rear. It also vastly improved on the earlier design in durability, and offered the advantage of employing <b>sintered</b> <b>iron</b> internal parts rather than expensive forged ones. The sintered parts also allowed for improved fabrication tolerances, and could be given a special heat treatment resulting in a harder more wear-resistant composition. Using these parts virtually eliminated hand fitting, significantly lowering labor costs associated with the assembly and manufacture of the MK III line. The springs used in the Mark III internals were also an improvement. Unlike the older flat style, they were coiled and made entirely of corrosion-resistant stainless steel.|$|E
