5|$|The Allenville Mill <b>Storehouse</b> {{was long}} {{considered}} to be the Allenville Mill, including in the 1937 Federal Writer's Project book, but records indicate this was the <b>storehouse</b> of the mill constructed in 1813. Despite not being the mill complex, the <b>storehouse</b> is the earliest surviving example of the 19th-century company storehouses in Rhode Island, and one of only a few surviving examples of company storehouses remaining from the 19th century. Furthermore, the property was erected and owned by the Governor of Rhode Island and later United States Senator Phillip Allen. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Dominique Vivant Denon was Napoleon's art advisor, and {{accompanied}} {{him on the}} expedition to Egypt. Through his initiative, the Valley of the Kings in Egypt was discovered and studied extensively.

5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor <b>storehouse,</b> so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the <b>storehouse</b> with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

5|$|On the {{confines}} of the island feuds were vicious, and one surgeon went insane. Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension, keeping the garrison on edge. Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island, building roads, water tanks, a <b>storehouse,</b> and developing the gardens on Green Mountain. For these efforts, Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension, and additionally asked for convicts.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After {{a long period of}} use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built <b>storehouse</b> mounted on staddle stones to prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich <b>storehouse</b> of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E

5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a <b>storehouse</b> near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a <b>storehouse</b> at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E
5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde up the river. Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut the log boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a <b>storehouse,</b> seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E
50|$|The {{storage area}} at Wanuku Pampa {{includes}} 497 qullqas (<b>storehouses)</b> and 30 processing and administration buildings. The city {{may have been}} an extremely important redistributive center supplying the provincial villages of the area it administered with the products of other regions. Qollqas are constructed in rows and made of pirqa masonry, just as the residential districts. The groups of <b>storehouses</b> included: 1) a small zone of <b>storehouses</b> which may have held the stores, of the Sun, the state religion; 2) minor groups of single <b>storehouses</b> apparently devoted to special shrines or ceremonial activities; 3) an ill-defined section of buildings which may have held a wide variety of goods in temporary storage for more immediate uses; and 4), the largest group, which was devoted to long-term storage of various food stuffs and other goods in technologically specialized facilities. Storage was very diverse among crops, for example, root crops were placed in the middle of layers of straw, bound into bales with rope and stored in rectangular structures, while maize was stored shelled, in large jars which were put in circular <b>storehouses</b> with stone floors. Highland root crops made up for 50-80% of the space, while maize made up for 5-7%.|$|R

5|$|Momohime's {{story begins}} after {{she wakes up}} Kyo with {{memories}} of being killed by the dying Jinkuro when he was aiming for her betrothed, the samurai lord Yukinojo. Upon encountering the spirit of Jinkuro, he forcefully possesses her, but before the process of soul transference is finished, they are attacked. In the confusion, Momohime's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk Rankai and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime's body will die if her soul is harmed. With her soul safe, Jinkuro sets out to regain the Dark Resurrection Demon Blade so he can properly utilize his Soul Transference Technique and gain influence through a new host. Encountering Yukinojo, who is searching for Momohime, the two battle. Momohime forces Jinkuro to spare Yukinojo, even when she learns that Yukinojo's intentions in marrying her {{were part of a}} scheme to ruin her family as punishment for defying the shogun. Jinkuro goes to Yukinojo's compound to retrieve the Dark Resurrection, but the <b>storehouse</b> where it is said to be is absorbed into Yomi by demons. Descending into Yomi, Jinkuro's soul is briefly captured by a demon, and it is only with Momohime's help that he escapes and learns that the Dark Resurrection was never in the <b>storehouse.</b> With Momohime's body beginning to fail due to the strain Soul Transference put on it, Jinkuro attempts to ascent to Heaven so he can become an immortal demon, but is stopped by Raijin and Fujin.|$|E
5|$|The Apple House, a small red-brick {{building}} {{to the west of}} the stables quadrangle, also dates from around 1636, and can be seen in a painting of Crewe Hall from around 1710. Originally a dovecote, it is used as a <b>storehouse.</b> Built on an octagonal plan with two storeys, it has two oval windows with stone surrounds. The lower entrance has a stone semicircular arch; a second doorway is located at first-floor height. The pyramidal tiled roof is topped by a glazed lantern with a lead cap. The building is listed at grade II.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Machias (August 13–14, 1777) was an {{amphibious assault}} on the Massachusetts town of Machias (in present-day eastern Maine) by British forces during the American Revolutionary War. Local militia aided by Indian allies {{successfully}} prevented British troops from landing. The raid, led by Commodore Sir George Collier, was executed {{in an attempt to}} head off a planned second assault on Fort Cumberland, which had been besieged in November 1776. The British forces landed below Machias, seized a ship, and raided a <b>storehouse.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{demolished}} by 30 September 1937 {{for the construction}} of Via della Conciliazione. Its art was given to the Capitolo di San Pietro and then to the Museo Petriano; some chapel frescoes are on display at the Museo di Roma. Elements of the facade, including the 17th-century travertino portal decorated with cherubs, are in the comune <b>storehouse</b> at the Bastione Ardeatino. The two relics (of Isaac's sacrifice and the presentation of Jesus in the temple) were placed in the church of the Santi Michele e Magno, the national church of the Dutch in Borgo, during the early 1990s; the latter is now the church's main altar.|$|E
5|$|The name Crewkerne {{is thought}} to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, {{especially}} a <b>storehouse.</b> The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new <b>storehouse</b> (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand <b>Storehouse</b> north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E
