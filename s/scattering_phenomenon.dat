25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} is {{a collective}} <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon</b> with electrons being scattered by atoms {{in a regular}} crystal array. This can be understood in analogy to the Huygens principle for the diffraction of light. The incoming plane electron wave interacts with the atoms, and secondary waves are generated which interfere with each other. In 1927, two Americans named Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer had proven de Broglie's theory by discovering electron diffraction. This confirmation of the wavelike nature of an electron was discovered independently of Englishman George Paget Thomson.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{observations}} of color {{can be related}} to spectroscopy. Neon lighting is a direct application of atomic spectroscopy. Neon and other noble gases have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered molecular spectrum is that of nitrogen dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. Rayleigh scattering is a spectroscopic <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that accounts for the color of the sky.|$|E

Lateral distribution represents the beam profile in the matter. both lateral and angular Multiple scattering distributions are interdependent.|$|E
5000|$|The skin's {{pigmentation}} (in this condition) {{has been}} described as uniformly gray, grayish purple, slate gray, or grayish blue, and is usually limited to exposed portions of the body. It may involve the conjunctivae over the scleras but usually not the oral mucosa. Location of pigment predominantly in the upper dermis leads to the blue component of skin color through the <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> It is much less likely to be deposited in the nails and hair.|$|E
50|$|In physics, a Fano {{resonance}} {{is a type}} of resonant <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{that gives}} rise to an asymmetric line-shape. Interference between a background and a resonant scattering process produces the asymmetric line-shape. It is named after Italian-American physicist Ugo Fano, who gave a theoretical explanation for the scattering line-shape of inelastic scattering of electrons from helium; however, Ettore Majorana was the first to discover this phenomenon. Because it is a general wave phenomenon, examples can be found across many areas of physics and engineering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The time variant {{nature of}} an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar signal {{scattered}} from a radar target is well described throughout the literature. To study the behaviour of these transient signals, Joint Time-Frequency (TF) analysis is considered.

30|$|Previous {{methods for}} aerial {{perspective}} modeling and rendering rely on understanding the <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomena</b> in the atmosphere. McCartney [16] presented an excellent review of former works on atmospheric optics. His work contains relevant {{data about the}} <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomena</b> under different weather conditions categorized by the heuristic parameter turbidity (T). T is used to model the scattering by molecules of air and larger particles, such as haze, and is employed for classifying various atmospheric conditions ranging from pure air to fog. Since the atmospheric phenomenon in [16] is modeled using real data, {{it has been used}} in both CV and CG fields. However, such models have been used differently, varying depending on whether the aim is oriented to CV or CG.|$|R
50|$|Much {{more rarely}} than with silver, bismuth may produce a {{generalized}} persistent skin discoloration resembling argyria. This {{is known as}} bismuthia. The conjunctivae and oral mucosa, as well as skin, are commonly afflicted by the condition. Pigment granules are evenly scattered through the dermis, producing a blue, or bluish gray skin color by the <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> It is extremenly rare, {{and as a consequence}} is poorly understood by modern medicine. Special stains and spectroscopic methods must be utilized for identification of skin pigments affected by bismuth.|$|E

30|$|To {{conclude}} this narrowband analysis we {{can make}} the following statements. The details in the range of one wavelength and smaller, highly contribute to the <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and are particularly visible where no specular reflection occurs. Neglecting them would unbalance the specular and scattering phenomena favouring the strong reflections. Adding details large compared to the wavelength, representative of the low-resolution case, would correctly attenuate the specular reflection without fully reproducing the <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Results using low resolutions could be improved by adding the scattered power not accounted for, which is here in the order of 2 dB, thus achieving comparable results to those obtained with medium resolutions.|$|E

40|$|Very sharp Bragg {{reflections}} {{accompanied by}} diffuse <b>scattering</b> <b>phenomena</b> are typical for most stable quasicrystals. The correlation {{length of the}} quasiperiodic average structure can reach several micrometers as proved by high-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments. This corresponds to a structural perfection of some quasicrystals {{similar to that of}} silicon. Nevertheless, the omnipresent diffuse scattering indicates significant deviations from a strictly ordered quasiperiodic structure {{especially in the case of}} decagonal phases. These structural deviations may be caused by phason fluctuations, by disorder in the packing of the basic atomic clusters, by the formation of nanodomains, by chemical disorder, or by superstructure formation on a short-range scale. Characteristic examples of different types of structural disorder present in icosahedral and decagonal quasicrystals are reported.
