5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E

Yet, <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community {{knew that they were}} strategically important to each other, thus they had to continue cooperation and coordination to defend and advance their economic and strategic interests. With a documentary research approach, this paper aims to examine how <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community their partnership evolved between 1969 and 1974. It explores the ties that the Nixon Administration designed to bind <b>the</b> European Community <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community’s responses.
