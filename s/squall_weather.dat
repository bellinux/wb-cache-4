5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, <b>squall</b> <b>weather,</b> and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E
50|$|A hard <b>squall</b> with hazy <b>weather,</b> {{coming on}} {{about the same time}} Foudroyant lost sight of the fleet, and about half an hour after midnight brought the chase to close action.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But now {{the vessel}} was full, {{more than sixty}} on board, and I had {{reckoned}} upon an empty vessel in the hot Santa Cruz and Solomon Island latitudes. Moreover, the weather was extraordinarily unfavourable--damp, foul winds, <b>squalls,</b> calms, unhealthy <b>weather.</b> Mr. Tilly was being greatly pulled down, and everything seemed {{to point out that}} the voyage ought not to be long. I made my mind up, took back the Solomon Island scholars; and, with heavy sea and baffling winds and one short gale, sailed back to New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|The wreck {{lies with}} 17 degree list to starboard, and objects {{belonging}} to the ship {{that have been found}} on the sea floor have all been found on the starboard side. The current theory as to how the ship sank is that she was hit by a sudden <b>squall</b> in rough <b>weather,</b> heeled to starboard, took on water and then sank. The base of the windlass attached to the foredeck, a very sturdy construction, seems to have been torn off, which suggest the sinking happened suddenly. [...] The presence of weapons and equipment on the weather deck supports the theory that the sinking occurred suddenly. No remains of the crew have been found.|$|R
50|$|Twining {{departed}} Eniwetok on 15 September to {{rendezvous with}} Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogans Fast Carrier Task Group (TG 38.2) and thereafter devoted {{most of her}} effort {{for the rest of}} the war to protecting aircraft carriers. Arriving off Luzon on the 21st, Twining guarded the carriers as they launched strikes despite cloudy <b>weather,</b> <b>squalls,</b> and low visibility. Following the launching of further strikes from an attack position off San Bernardino Strait on the 24th, the task group headed eastward and arrived off Saipan on the 28th. From there, the destroyer conducted antisubmarine patrols until the 30th when the task group got underway for the western Carolines and entered Ulithi lagoon on 6 October.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{one more}} air strike on 28 July, heavy rain <b>squalls</b> and poor <b>weather</b> {{canceled}} further strikes {{and the task}} group turned for the Mariana Islands. After a quick replenishment stop at Saipan on 2 August, the task group steamed west for a strike against the Bonin and Volcano Islands. During a fighter sweep on 4 August, friendly aircraft reported a small enemy task group in the area. Late that afternoon, Biloxi, three other cruisers and seven destroyers closed the Bonins for an anti-shipping sweep. After the destroyers [...] and [...] destroyed a small sampan, the cruisers picked up a Japanese convoy on radar north of Muko Jima. Owing to the danger of enemy torpedo attack, the cruisers kept their distance and fired at long range. Their accurate gunfire quickly damaged and eventually sank escort destroyer [...] and collier Ryuko Maru.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw more}} of Wolf Larsen than ever {{when we had}} gained the grounds. For when the weather was fair {{and we were in}} the midst of the herd, all hands were away in the boats, and left on board were only he and I, and Thomas Mugridge, who did not count. But there was no play about it. The six boats, {{spreading}} out fan-wise from the schooner until the first weather boat and the last lee boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart, cruised along a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad weather drove them in. It was our duty to sail the Ghost well to leeward of the last lee boat, so that all the boats should have fair wind to run for us in case of <b>squalls</b> or threatening <b>weather.</b>|$|R
