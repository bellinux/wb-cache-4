5|$|Adrienne's head is <b>split</b> <b>open</b> by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot's {{first annual}} music festival, called Knotfest, {{was held on}} August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian also {{performed}} at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On 14, June 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time. The band performed to roughly 90,000 people and was twice forced to stop the set—once {{in the middle of}} a song—to allow the front barricade, which had <b>split</b> <b>open</b> under crowd pressure, to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and <b>split</b> <b>open,</b> revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E

5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia <b>split</b> <b>open</b> into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E
5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they <b>split</b> <b>open</b> their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was <b>split</b> <b>open</b> in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E

5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger <b>split</b> <b>open</b> after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was <b>split</b> <b>open.</b> The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E

Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they <b>split</b> <b>open,</b> and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E

5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the February 25, 2013 {{episode of}} Raw, brawling with Brock Lesnar after {{he attempted to}} attack Mr. McMahon. The brawl resulted in Lesnar having his head <b>split</b> <b>open</b> and requiring 18 stitches. The following week, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted {{on the condition that}} he could choose the stipulation. The following week, after Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H's career on the line. At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Lesnar after a Pedigree onto the steel steps. On the April 15 episode of Raw, Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules, which Triple H accepted the following week. Triple H ended up losing the match at the pay-per-view on May 19 thanks to interference from Heyman, and he also injured his jaw.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso <b>split</b> <b>open</b> revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{in their}} usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts {{kicked off the}} match and {{immediately}} won a corner, which was dealt with by Westerveld. A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi's challenge, but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn. Arsenal began to dominate play, with Vieira {{at the heart of}} their best moves. The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to <b>split</b> <b>open</b> the Liverpool defence. A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached the half-hour mark, and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner. Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position, having collected a long pass.|$|E
50|$|The fruits are three- or rarely two-compartment capsules, {{sometimes}} fleshy, {{but almost}} always ripening to a woody container that then <b>splits</b> <b>open,</b> sometimes explosively. The seeds are four-angled, oval, or spherical, and some species have a caruncle.|$|R

50|$|The {{fruit is}} usually a schizocarp, but {{sometimes}} a drupe. A typical schizocarp is the regma, a capsular fruit with three or more cells, each of which <b>splits</b> <b>open</b> at maturity into separate parts and then breaks away explosively, scattering the small seeds.|$|R
5|$|Lesnar {{returned}} on the January 28, 2013 {{episode of}} Raw, confronting Mr. McMahon {{who was about}} to fire Heyman, and despite Heyman's pleas, Lesnar attacked McMahon with an F-5, breaking McMahon's pelvis in storyline. The following week during The Miz's Miz TV talk show, Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero revealed herself as the one who signed Lesnar to a new contract to impress McMahon. On the February 25 episode of Raw, Lesnar once again attempted to attack McMahon, only to get into a brawl with the returning Triple H, which resulted in Lesnar legitimately having his head <b>split</b> <b>open</b> and requiring eighteen stitches. The following week on Raw, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted but only after Triple signed a contract and Lesnar named the stipulation. After Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H's career on the line. At WrestleMania 29 on April 7, Lesnar lost to Triple H after a Pedigree onto the steel steps. On the April 15 episode of Raw, Lesnar attacked 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, and Jinder Mahal) before Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules, which Triple H accepted the following week. At the event on May 19, after interference from Heyman, Lesnar defeated Triple H to end their feud. Lesnar returned on the June 17 episode of Raw, attacking Heyman's fellow client CM Punk with an F-5. Despite the accusations from Punk, Heyman claimed that he was not behind Lesnar's attack on him. However, Heyman turned on Punk in July, and claimed that Punk could not beat Lesnar, which led to Lesnar making his return and attacking Punk on the July 15 episode of Raw. The following week on Raw, Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at SummerSlam on August 18, where Lesnar defeated Punk in a no disqualification match.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to take a shot, forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to <b>split</b> <b>open</b> the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E
