5|$|Aside {{from the}} 22 proteinogenic amino acids, many non-proteinogenic amino acids are known.

5|$|In living systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids <b>selenomethionine,</b> selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and <b>selenomethionine.</b> In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with <b>selenomethionine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selenium, {{especially}} in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively <b>selenomethionine,</b> diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, {{as illustrated by the}} selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, <b>selenomethionine,</b> selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Selenomethionine</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring amino acid. The L-selenomethionine enantiomer {{is the main}} form of selenium found in Brazil nuts, cereal grains, soybeans, and grassland legumes, while Se-methylselenocysteine, or its γ-glutamyl derivative, is the major form of selenium found in Astragalus, Allium, and Brassica species. In vivo, <b>selenomethionine</b> is randomly incorporated instead of methionine. <b>Selenomethionine</b> is readily oxidized.|$|E
50|$|Selenium and sulfur are chalcogens {{that share}} many {{chemical}} properties so {{the substitution of}} methionine with <b>selenomethionine</b> may have only a limited effect on protein structure and function. However, the incorporation of <b>selenomethionine</b> into tissue proteins and keratin in horses causes alkali disease.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by nutritionists that <b>selenomethionine,</b> which is an organic form of selenium, is easier for the human body to absorb than selenite, which is an inorganic form. It was determined in a clinical trial that <b>selenomethionine</b> is absorbed 19% better than selenite.|$|E
5000|$|In the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial, selenized yeast {{resulted}} in [...] "a {{reduction in the}} incidence of prostate cancer and in total cancer incidence"; subsequent anti-cancer studies using <b>selenomethionine</b> did not show any benefit against cancer; but, selenized yeast contains both <b>selenomethionine</b> and methylselenocysteine.|$|E

50|$|Selenium yeast, {{produced}} by fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a selenium-rich media, is a recognized source of organic food-form selenium. In this process, {{virtually all of}} the selenium structurally substitutes for sulfur in the amino acid methionine thus forming <b>selenomethionine</b> via the same pathways and enzymes that are used to form sulfur-containing methionine. Owing to its similarity to S-containing methionine, <b>selenomethionine</b> is taken up nonspecifically and becomes part of yeast protein. It is this metabolic route that makes selenium yeast valuable in animal and human nutrition, since it offers the same organic form of selenium {{produced by}} food-chain autotrophs (i.e., most plants and certain blue-green algae).|$|E

50|$|Incorporation of <b>selenomethionine</b> into {{proteins}} {{in place of}} methionine aids the structure elucidation of proteins by X-ray crystallography using single- or multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD or MAD).

5000|$|<b>Selenomethionine</b> is {{the primary}} dietary form of selenium. PLP is needed as a {{cofactor}} for the enzymes that allow selenium to be used from the dietary form. PLP also plays a cofactor role in releasing selenium from selenohomocysteine to produce hydrogen selenide, which can then be used to incorporate selenium into selenoproteins.|$|E
50|$|Total {{selenium}} in selenium yeast can be reliably determined using open {{acid digestion}} to extract selenium from the yeast matrix followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Determination of the selenium species <b>selenomethionine</b> {{can be achieved}} via proteolytic digestion of selenium yeast followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).|$|E
50|$|The {{apoenzyme}} form, {{lacking the}} zinc cofactor, has a molecular weight of 382815.4 g/mol. The chloride ion and the 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39-tridecaoxahentetracontane-1,41-diol (C28H58O15) {{are the two}} main ligands seen on the enzyme in this form. There are 16 polymer chains seen in this form contributing to the heaviness of the enzyme. This form is also sometimes termed the <b>selenomethionine</b> form.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{selenium}} {{occurs in}} proteins as unspecifically incorporated <b>selenomethionine,</b> which replaces methionine residues. Proteins containing such unspecifically incorporated <b>selenomethionine</b> residues are not regarded as selenoproteins. However, replacement of all methionines by selenomethionines {{is a widely}} used, recent technique in solving the phase problem during X-ray crystallographic structure determination of many proteins (MAD-phasing). While the exchange of methionines by selenomethionines appears to be tolerated (at least in bacterial cells), unspecific incorporation of selenocysteine in lieu of cysteine seems to be highly toxic. This {{may be one reason}} for the existence of a rather complicated pathway of selenocysteine biosynthesis and specific incorporation into selenoproteins, which avoids the occurrence of the free amino acid as intermediate. Thus, even if a selenocysteine-containing selenoprotein is taken up in the diet and used as selenium source, the amino acid must be degraded prior to synthesising a new selenocysteine for incorporation into a selenoprotein.|$|E

50|$|All {{animals and}} some plants need trace amounts of selenium, {{but only for}} some {{specialized}} enzymes. Humans consume on average between 6 and 200 micrograms of selenium per day. Mushrooms and brazil nuts are especially noted for their high selenium content.

50|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in amounts toxic as forage, e.g. locoweed. Selenium is {{a component of the}} amino acids selenocysteine and <b>selenomethionine.</b> In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase. Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of selenophosphate (PSeO33−).|$|E
50|$|Serine, homoserine, O-methyl-homoserine and O-ethyl-homoserine {{possess an}} hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, O-methyl-hydroxymethyl and O-methyl-hydroxyethyl side chain. Whereas cysteine, homocysteine, {{methionine}} and ethionine possess the thiol equivalents. The selenol equivalents are selenocysteine, selenohomocysteine, <b>selenomethionine</b> and selenoethionine.Amino acids {{with the next}} chalcogen down are also found in nature: several species such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, and Penicillium chrysogenum {{in the absence of}} sulfur are able to produce and incorporate into protein tellurocysteine and telluromethionine.|$|E
50|$|The first tungsten-requiring enzyme to be {{discovered}} also requires selenium (though the precise form is unknown). In this case, the tungsten-selenium pair has been speculated to function analogously to the molybdenum-sulfur pairing of some molybdenum cofactor-requiring enzymes. Although a tungsten-containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria {{has been found to}} contain tungsten-molydopterin and also non-protein-bound selenium (thus removing the possibility of selenium in selenocysteine or <b>selenomethionine</b> form), a tungsten-selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described.|$|E
50|$|Biotechnological {{applications}} of selenocysteine include use of 73Se-labeled Sec (half-life of 73Se = 7.2 hours) in {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) studies and 75Se-labeled Sec (half-life of 75Se = 118.5 days) in specific radiolabeling, facilitation of phase determination by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction in X-ray crystallography of proteins by introducing Sec alone, or Sec together with <b>selenomethionine</b> (SeMet), and incorporation of the stable 77Se isotope, which has a nuclear spin of 1/2 {{and can be used}} for high-resolution NMR, among others.|$|E
50|$|These studies rely on {{the natural}} {{promiscuous}} activity of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase to add to its target tRNA an unnatural amino acid (i.e. analog) similar to the natural substrate, for example methionyl-tRNA synthase's mistaking isoleucine for methionine. In protein crystallography, for example, the addition of <b>selenomethionine</b> to the media of a culture of a methionine-auxotrophic strain results in proteins containing <b>selenomethionine</b> as opposed to methionine (viz. Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion for reason). Another example is that photoleucine and photomethionine are added instead of leucine and methionine to cross-label protein.Similarly, some tellurium-tolerant fungi can incorporate tellurocysteine and telluromethionine into their protein instead of cysteine and methionine.The objective of expanding the genetic code is more radical as it does not replace an amino acid, but it adds one or more to the code. On the other hand, proteome-wide replacements are most efficiently performed by global amino acid substitutions. For example, global proteome-wide substitutions of natural amino acids with fluorinated analogs have been attempted in E. coli and B. subtilis. A complete tryptophan substitution with thienopyrrole-alanine in response to 20899 UGG codons in E. coli was reported in 2015 by Budisa and Söll. Moreover, many biological phenomena, such as protein folding and stability, are based on synergistic effects at many positions in the protein sequence.|$|E
