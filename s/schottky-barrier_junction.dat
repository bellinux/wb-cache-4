40|$|Abundant, scalable, environmentally-friendly organic {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) {{technology is}} increasingly promising in recent years. The {{power conversion efficiency}} (PCE) of OPVs has been raised to around 10 %. However, this record efficiency is still far below the Shockley-Quasar limit of 22 ~ 27 %. This dissertation introduces great research effort to improve the OPV device efficiency by understanding the device physics, and engineering the donor/acceptor interfaces as well as designing new device architectures. The research activities mainly focused on: 1) Understanding the physical mechanism of open circuit voltage in OPVs; 2) Optimizing the band offset between the donor and the acceptor by using ultrathin ferroelectric dipole layer between donor/acceptor interfaces; 3) Designing fullerene based <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>junction</b> structure to obtain large open circuit voltage of round 0. 9 V; 4) Applying thermally-annealed bilayer heterojunction structure to improve OPV device performance and demonstrating {{the origin of the}} improvement is due to reduced bimolecular charge recombination loss; 5) Studying the ferromagnetism of model photovoltaic materials poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which might open up another approach to improve P 3 HT:PCBM based organic solar cells by using external magnetic fields, and also might initiate the applications of multifunctional organic optoelectronics with integration of electronics, photonics, and magnetics. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — DC {{photocurrent}} gain {{properties of}} planar metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) optical sensor structures on {{have been investigated}} experimentally. The test structure has two co-planar Mo/n-Si <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>junctions</b> on silicon of resistivity 9 - 12 Ω-cm and the electrode separation is 20 μm. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics measurements under illumination in visible range showed a rapid increase in photocurrent at higher biases examined. From the temperature, the dependence of I-V characteristics and noise measurements, such photocurrent increase was ascribes to avalanche multiplication of carriers photogenerated in the Schottky junction reversed-biased. From low-frequency (10 - 50 kHz) signal measurements, {{it was found that}} multiplication factor larger than 100 at 10 kHz and 30 at 50 kHz was achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{scaling of}} Field Effect Transistor (FET) at {{nanoscale}} assures better {{performance of the}} device. The phenomenon of downsizing the device dimensions has led to challenges such as short channel effects, leakage current, interconnect difficulties, high power consumption and quantum effects. Therefore, new materials and device structures are needed as alternatives to overcome these challenges. In this research, an analytical model for Trilayer (ABA-stacked) Graphene Nanoribbon carrier statistics based on quantum confinement effect is presented. To this end, density of states, carrier concentration and ballistic conductance of Trilayer Graphene Nanoribbon (TGN) as an FET channel are modeled. Besides that, scaling behaviors of p-n <b>junction,</b> Homo <b>junction,</b> <b>Schottky-barrier</b> diode and Schottkybarrier FET based on the Graphene Nanoribbon application are analytically studied. This is demonstrated in the proposed structure of TGN Schottky-barrier FET that exhibits negligible short channel effects, improved on current, pragmatic threshold voltage, very good subthreshold slope, and fast transient between on-off states to meet the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) near-term guidelines. Therefore, the proposed model is suitable for a high speed switching application because the value of subthreshold slope for the proposed transistor {{is less than the}} ideal value of 60 mV/decade. A small value of subthreshold slope denotes a small change in the input bias which can modulate the output current and would lead to less power consumption. Finally, an analytical modeling of Graphene-based NO 2 gas sensor is proposed. MATLAB software was used to implement the numerical methods for modeling and data analysis. Observations of the presented models showed acceptable agreement with the published data...|$|R
