City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>sites.</b> Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Prostate {{cancer is}} the most {{frequently}} diagnosed cancer in men in industrialized countries. Despite the substantial clinical importance of the disease, the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of prostate cancer are poorly understood. In the present study, fragment analysis of chromosome arm 16 q was carried out {{with the aim of}} <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>sites</b> of consistent chromosomal deletion, possibly uncovering the location of target genes that become inactivated in prostate carcinogenesis. The highest percentage of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found at chromosomal region 16 q 24. 1 -q 24. 2, including the gene for 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/ 17 -ketosteroid reductase (17 HSD/KSR) type 2, HSD 17 B 2. The data further indicated an association between loss of the most commonly deleted region and clinically aggressive features of the disease. A fragment analysis performed using sequential primary and locally recurrent prostate cancer specimens suggested the location of the genes related to prostate cancer progression to be at 16 q 24. 3 and, further, gave rise to a hypothesis of the potential role of locus HSD 17 B 2 as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer progression. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed a decreased HSD 17 B 2 gene copy number in prostate cancer specimens compared to their normal counterparts. A diminished HSD 17 B 2 gene copy number was significantly associated with poor differentiation of the tumor. The progression of prostate cancer during androgen deprivation is a serious clinical problem, the molecular mechanisms of which largely remain to be clarified. The present data of enzyme activity measurements performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) provided evidence of a substantial decrease in oxidative and an increase in reductive 17 HSD/KSR activity during the transition of prostate cancer LNCaP cells into an androgen-independent state. Further, the changes detected in the activities largely coincided with the changes in the relative expression levels of genes for the potential 17 HSD/KSR isoenzymes; 17 HSD/KSR types 2, 5, and 7, as evidenced by relative quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The data on the expression analysis of mRNA for 17 HSD/KSR types 5 and 7 in prostate tissue specimens performed using in situ hybridization showed a moderately low but constitutive level for 17 HSD/KSR 7 mRNA in tissues of cancerous as well as hyperplastic origin. The expression of mRNA for 17 HSD/KSR type 5, instead, varied considerably between different specimens, the highest expressions being strongly associated with aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer. Interestingly, furthermore, the intense expression of 17 HSD/KSR 5 was significantly associated with the androgen deprivation achieved either surgically or medically. Since 17 HSD/KSRs critically contribute to the control of the bioavailability of active sex steroid hormones locally in the prostate, the variation in intraprostatic 17 HSD/KSR activity might be crucially involved in the regulation of the growth and function of the organ...|$|E
