5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Welsh land owners {{divided up}} the land to allow for tenant-based farming. Each <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> would include {{vegetable}} crops, as well as a cow, pigs and a few chickens. The 18th and 19th centuries were a time of unrest for the Welsh people. The Welsh food riots began in 1740, when colliers blamed the lack of food on problems in the supply, and continued throughout Wales as a whole. The worst riots happened in the 1790s after a grain shortage, which coincided with political upheaval in the form of forced military service and high taxes on the roads, leaving farmers unable to make a profit. As a result of riots by colliers in the mid 1790s, magistrates in Glamorgan sold the rioters corn at a reduced price. At the same time they also requested military assistance from the government to stop further rioting. Due to the close-knit nature of the poor communities, and the slightly higher status of the farmers above the labourers, the rioters generally blamed the farmers and corn merchants, rather than the gentry.|$|E

Unable to command Smith to honor their plan, Bragg focused on a movement to Lexington instead of Nashville. He cautioned Smith that Buell could pursue and defeat his smaller army before Bragg's army could join up with them.|$|E

25|$|The press devoted much {{attention}} to Church's relationship with boyfriend Gavin Henson, a Welsh rugby player. At the end of 2005, she bought a property in her native Cardiff—for a reported £500,000—which she later sold for £900,000. The couple then bought a manor with a 20-acre (8 hectare) <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> in the Vale of Glamorgan {{in the village of}} St. Bride's Major. The couple mentioned marriage on talk shows and in the press. In 2007, Church made another appearance on a British young people's rich list with Henson. They were ranked 49th-richest young people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of £12 million.|$|E
25|$|A {{call for}} {{additional}} ammunition for {{police officers in}} case of a shootout came at 12:20p.m. The killers had ceased shooting just minutes earlier. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00p.m., and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09p.m., moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. By 3:00p.m., Dave Sanders had died of his injuries before SWAT officers could take him to get medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|The priory {{was never}} wealthy {{and most of}} its income came from small, {{scattered}} estates, close by in Staffordshire or in neighbouring counties. A deed of 1170 has the nuns of Brewood and Blithbury, at Mavesyn Ridware, giving land they held at Ridware to the lord of the manor, in return for an annual rent of two shillings and confirmation of meadowland they already had there. This shows the nuns busily trying {{to make the most of}} a <b>small</b> <b>holding.</b> It also shows that there was already some sort of special relationship between Black Ladies and Blithbury. The Blithbury nuns obtained land at Gailey in Penkridge parish around 1160, but this had passed to Black Ladies by 1189, when Henry II took it under royal control, leaving his son King John to compensate Black Ladies with the manor of Broome in 1200. Three years later, the prioress vindicated her claim to the advowson of the church at Broome. Alexander de Bransford, the parson of Broome who died around 1205, had been presented by the previous manorial lord, Richard of Ombersley, whose father Maurice was reckoned the founder of the church. Broom had been created by partitioning Clent and granted to Maurice in 1154. The church was thus sometimes considered a chapelry of the church at Clent and Herbert, the vicar of Clent, claimed the right to present a successor. The prioress successfully maintained that the king had acquired the advowson when he confiscated the manor and had handed over this potentially valuable asset to Black Ladies, although it was not mentioned in the charter of 1200. The priory seems to have retained the advowson thereafter.|$|E

500|$|The {{initial action}} in Jackson's Valley Campaign took place to their east, but in June Frémont's force of 15,000 joined the 10,000-man {{division}} of Brig. Gen. James Shields to converge on Jackson south of Massanutten Mountain. [...] Jackson {{was determined to}} attack the two Union columns separately and arranged half of his troops to block Shields {{on the right side}} of the mountain, while the other half, commanded by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, blocked the left side. [...] Jackson's wish was realized when, on June 8, Frémont's army attacked. [...] Frémont, believing he was striking Jackson's rear, instead attacked Ewell head-on, and Jackson soon brought his whole force to bear on the Union troops in the Battle of Cross Keys. [...] The men of the 68th came under concentrated fire for the first time but were not heavily involved in the battle, although two men were killed. [...] The battle was a defeat for the Union, and Frémont's force did not attack again, being blocked instead by a <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> force from Ewell's wing. [...] The rest of Jackson's force then turned to attack Shields's army the next day at Port Republic, but Frémont's infantry did not figure in the battle, another Confederate victory, though his artillery shelled the enemy from long range.|$|E
500|$|The {{change to}} a new genre {{presented}} multiple challenges to the team: while standard RPGs were designed around a scripted experience, MMORPGs were more reliant on a true sense of unscripted adventure. A major disadvantage was that Fujisawa was inexperienced with working on MMORPGs. The first major developmental issue was the need in an MMORPG {{to have a full}} customizable character. Another related problem was the initial premise of an unseen force as the threat, which was unusual within the form. Fujisawa rationalized it into a kind of [...] "common sense" [...] related to the interaction between player community and necessary events within the game world that worked against accepted principles of MMORPG gameplay, which resulted in multiple staff members raising doubts as to whether the game could work. The second major issue was what types of environments to include or discard, and for this Fujisawa was prepared due to his long experience with the franchise. On top of this, the staff needed to evaluate what would work for an MMORPG in the unpredictable Japanese gaming market, which unlike {{other parts of the world}} was not a major consumer of MMORPGs. Their main object for comparison was World of Warcraft, which by that time had 12 million players worldwide but only had a <b>small</b> <b>holding</b> in Japan. While this appeared discouraging, there had not been many titles of similar scale and success within the country, so there was both space for and detractions against an equivalent MMORPG experience.|$|E
