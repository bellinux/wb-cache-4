5|$|Denning met {{his future}} wife Mary Harvey on 25 October 1914 aged fifteen at his confirmation; she was the {{daughter}} of the Vicar of Whitchurch. Denning attempted to court her for many years, but for a long time his love was unrequited, with Mary wanting them to be only friends. After a dance at Beaulieu on 18 January 1930 she finally admitted her love for him, and he returned to Hampshire with her to pick out an engagement ring. Barely six months away from the <b>set</b> <b>date</b> for their wedding Mary was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but she recovered and the couple were married on 28 December 1932, with the wedding officiated by Cecil Henry Boutflower, Bishop of Southampton.|$|E
5|$|The first Alabama Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1819, {{provided that}} a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve {{no more than}} four out of every six years. This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years. The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years, but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serves two consecutive terms can run again after waiting out the next term. The constitution had no <b>set</b> <b>date</b> for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.|$|E

5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers. The three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the <b>set</b> <b>date</b> of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E

This left Zuma open to being recharged with corruption as soon as the NPA completed preparing its case.|$|E
25|$|However, an officer, who {{had been}} brought in on the plot {{the morning of the}} <b>set</b> <b>date,</b> warned the {{government}} and several of the plotters were arrested. De Saram drove to Temple Trees alone, but there he was arrested. Since no actual coup had taken place, the government had no real evidence to use to punish the accused and thus confined them to solitary confinement in hope of getting a confession. De Saram confessed taking sole responsibility of the coup. This would go one to become the prosecution's main article of evidence. On 3 June 1963, De Saram was convicted along with 11 of the other 24 accused to 10 years in jail as well confiscation of property after laws had been specially modified by the government in order to convict the plotters. The conviction was eventually overruled on appeal to the Privy Council, which ruled that the new Act had denied fair trial.|$|E

25|$|On four {{occasions}} since 1990, the Middletown Times-Herald Record has run lengthy investigative {{articles on}} claims of electoral {{fraud in the}} village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn; a year later the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001 absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a <b>set</b> <b>date</b> of expected return and thus {{would not be allowed}} under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county grand jury investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed and many mistakes were made, {{there was no evidence of}} deliberate intent to violate the law.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and <b>set</b> <b>date</b> for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E
25|$|In Malta, the <b>set</b> <b>date</b> for {{the celebration}} of Saint Joseph is March 19, but can be moved if {{necessary}} {{to fit into the}} Lent and Easter season. This has been a day of remembrance in Malta since the 10th century A.D.. Most businesses shut down for this day for all the celebrations that occur. The main celebrations are held in Mdina, which is the “old capital” of Malta in the suburbs of the city of Rabat. There are three main events that occur for this day. One of them being special masses in honor of Saint Joseph. Then it follows with colorful processions with music bands in the streets and fireworks at night. The main procession takes place in the evening with the statue of St. Joseph being carried to the church of Saint Mary of Jesus. The statue represents a high level of workmanship for the figure Joseph had in Jesus' life. Also, {{this is one of the}} public holidays in Malta, known as Jum San Ġużepp. People celebrate mass in the morning, and in the afternoon go for a picnic. It is a liturgical feast that occurs on a Sunday in summer. However, the city of Rabat celebrates the traditional Maltese feast where in the evening a procession is also held with the statue of Saint Joseph. On this day also the city of Żejtun celebrates the day, known as Jum il-Kunsill (Zejtun Council's Day), till 2013 was known as Jum iż-Żejtun (Zejtun's Day). During this day a prominent person from Żejtun is given the Żejtun Honour (Ġieħ iż-Żejtun). In the past years the Żejtun Parish Church has celebrated these feast days with a procession with the statue of Saint Joseph.|$|E

25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a <b>set</b> <b>date,</b> the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in {{numerous}} policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights.
