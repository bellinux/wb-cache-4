5|$|Computer and Video Games {{stated that}} Pilotwings sold over two million copies {{worldwide}} by August 1996. A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as a launch title for its respective system. A second sequel for the Nintendo 64, which <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> the console's capabilities, was cancelled.

However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not confident in publishing it. Nintendo finally announced a new title in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title Pilotwings Resort, at E3 2010. The new title was released as a launch title for the 3DS in North America on March 27, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{presented}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1998, where developers <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> a demonstration of the game. In the months leading to the game's release, the game's publisher, Interplay Productions, ran a program that allowed Descent fans to submit a digital photo of themselves along with a pilot name to the company. These photos would later be included in the game so that players could use them as their multiplayer profiles. Outrage also released two game demos that allowed customers to try the game before purchasing it. The second demo included a single-player level and several multiplayer matches which could be played through a matchmaking service provided by Outrage. From March to August 1999, Interplay also held a Descent 3 tournament in the United States consisting of three phases where numerous players could compete against each other in multiplayer matches. The winner was awarded a prize of US$50,000.|$|E

5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E

50|$|Countersignaling by contrast, is <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> by not <b>showing</b> <b>off,</b> or {{by playing}} humble. For instance, the nouveau riche {{are eager to}} flaunt their wealth, and often {{surround}} themselves with expensive luxury items. Those with old money are more understated, preferring not to waste money on such frivolities.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is similar}} to {{conspicuous}} consumption except {{that it does not}} involve buying anything. Additionally, rather than <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> wealth, conspicuous expression is used to <b>show</b> <b>off</b> social status. In other words, it is doing something for others to witness so that they think you are [...] "cool".|$|R
25|$|Originally, {{pale skin}} was {{considered}} most attractive.

25|$|On September 18, 2010 Victor faced former WBA Light Welterweight Champion Vivian Harris on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard at Staples Center. He was on ESPN's SportsNation {{to promote}} the fight with Harris. Victor landed 25-of-54 power punches. He dropped Harris {{with both hands and}} landed some nasty power punches.

25|$|Kelly {{produced}} Geyer's ninth studio album Difficult Woman {{which was}} released on Larrikin Records in 1994. It was her first solo studio album in 9 years. The exposure encouraged Geyer {{to move back to}} Australia and following the release of Difficult Woman, Geyer spent time reestablishing herself on the live circuit across Australia. These performances showed her more relaxed on stage than at her peak when her innate shyness was often cleverly disguised. Now a confident, mature woman she <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> a hitherto hidden wicked sense of humour.|$|E
25|$|The {{graphics}} received {{mixed reviews}} with reviewers praising the lighting effects {{as well as}} interior and exterior details of premium cars, stating that Photo Mode <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> their detailed graphical design very well, but commented negatively on the detail of standard cars which lacked cockpit views, looked like up-scaled versions taken from Gran Turismo 4 and did not keep up {{to the level of}} detail found in the premium models. GT5 has been criticized for frame-rate drops and screen tearing. The problems are most noticeable when many cars are on screen with rain or smoke visible.|$|E

25|$|The house slaves, {{in their}} moments of leisure, took the {{dance to the}} field slaves and mimicked the dance of their masters. The slaves who worked in or around these houses quickly copied the style and dress. They <b>showed</b> <b>off</b> by doing ceremonious bows, making grand entrances, {{sweeping}} movements, graceful and gentle gliding steps which imitated the elegance of the French. The rhythmic quality of the bélé drums added spicy and yet subtle sensuality to the movements. There are more than 14 types of bélé dances including the Grand bélé and Congo bélé, with each performed to its own rhythms and chants.|$|E
