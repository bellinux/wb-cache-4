5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the western Allies. Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo.

5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion,</b> the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{a statue}} of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was {{demolished}} in 1939 by Soviet troops {{in the aftermath of}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland. In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E

5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special propellers with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Tank Corps was a tank {{corps of}} the Soviet Union's Red Army. It was first formed in 1938 from a {{mechanized}} corps and {{fought in the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland before being disbanded in January 1940. During its first formation, it participated in the capture {{of the city of}} Grodno and Augustów Forest from Poland, and the corps finished its service at Wilno and Soleczniki.|$|E
50|$|Before the Nazi German and <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasions</b> of Poland, it {{was located}} in Second Polish Republic. The village was a site of one of {{hundreds}} of massacres of Poles in Volhynia by the Ukrainian OUN-UPA between 1942 and 1945. In October 1944 and in December 1944 Christmas Eve raids, Zygmunt Konopka and Józef Gabinski were executed there.|$|R
50|$|Bortnytsia (Бортниця, Bortnica) is {{a village}} in Volyn oblast, {{near the town of}} Dubno, in Dubno Raion, Ukraine. The village {{currently}} has a population of 365.

50|$|On 13 August 1939 Junak {{played the}} first game of the play-offs. In Poznań, against Legia, the score was good (1-1). Then, on 20 August, at home, in a disappointing game versus Śląsk Świętochłowice, neither side scored. The next home game, planned on September 10, against Śmigły Wilno, never took place, because of German and <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasions</b> on Poland.|$|R
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion,</b> including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
