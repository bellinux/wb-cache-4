40|$|Thesis (MCom (International Trade)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 A {{service can}} be traded either {{directly}} between a consumer and provider {{of the service}} or a service can serve as an input into the manufacturing of various products and other services that are traded. Trade in services has therefore become {{an essential part of}} global trade and contributes significantly to global, as well as South African economic growth, development and productivity. Service trade has furthermore been growing at a greater rate than trade in manufactured goods. The growth of services trade can be attributed to growth in goods trade, technological advances, rising per capita incomes, micro-economic reforms, as well as increased consumer and business demand, and technological change. According to the GATS’ (General Agreement on Trade in Services) services sectorial classification list, the service sector can be classified into twelve major categories and these sectors can further be divided into 160 sub-sectors. One of the sub-sectors that have been identified that has significant growth potential globally and for South Africa is the sub-sector, ‘other business’ services. This sub-sector falls under the sector, business services. Trade data revealed that this sub-sector {{is one of the top}} three traded service categories internationally, as well as for South Africa. For the purpose of this study the focus was specifically on ‘other business’ services provided by members of the BEPEC (Built Environmental Professional Export Council). The services performed by the members of the BEPEC are: consulting engineering, architectural, quantity surveying, and construction project managing services. These services are inputs into the manufacturing or construction of human creations such as buildings, <b>structures,</b> <b>dams,</b> <b>roads</b> <b>etc.</b> Trade barriers, however, hinder the free flow of services from the service provider to customers in other countries. This is no different for the providers of ‘other business’ services. Therefore in order to increase the competitiveness of South Africa’s ‘other business’ services sector internationally; the primary objective of this study was to identify the internal, as well as external barriers experienced by the exporters of ‘other business’ services. These internal and external barriers were identified by means of a questionnaire that the members of the BEPEC, who are exporters of ‘other business’ services, completed. Once these barriers were identified recommendations were made to the South African government. The most significant internal barriers were found to be: • lack of information about foreign markets; • lack of information on how to enter these foreign markets; • lack of personnel who are experienced in export activities; • scarcity of internal financial resources for export purposes and export promotion. • The most significant external barriers were found to be: • exchange rate risk and the risk of non-payment; • corruption and bribery; •	risks involved with political instability in a country; • restrictions on immigration provisions such as delay in obtaining entry visas, residency or work permits; •	poor infrastructure; • foreign government procurement policies; • distance to the target market. All of the identified barriers can mostly be addressed by the South African government by providing training, the provision of market related information, and trade negotiations. Master...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the generalization of DTM extracted from LiDAR data. The essence of generalization is reducing details while enhancing important features {{at the same}} time; so {{for the purpose of}} terrain surface visualization special attention has to be given to the enhancement and generalization of topographic objects like <b>dams,</b> <b>roads</b> <b>etc.</b> The focus of this work is laid on the extraction of road objects and their contribution into the enhancement of the generalized terrain model. An algorithm for the extraction of roads is developed and is followed by a generalization algorithm that weights together road networks and filtered LiDAR point clouds. Following the presentation of the algorithm results for this approach are shown and evaluated. 1...|$|R

The Portuguese government built <b>dams,</b> <b>roads,</b> schools, <b>etc.</b> There was also an economic boom that led to a huge increase of the European population. The white population increased from 44,083 in 1940 to 172,529 in 1960. With around 1,000 immigrants arriving each month. On the eve {{of the end of the}} colonial period, the ethnic European residents numbered 400,000 (1974) (excluding enlisted and commissioned soldiers from the mainland) and the mixed race population was at around 100,000 (many were Cape Verdian migrants working in the territory). The total population was around 5.9 million at that time.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} list of tree species {{enumerated}} from a total of 60 ha area sampled in the tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 272 tree species (Ā 30 cm girth at breast height) representing 181 genera and 62 families were recorded. Euphorbiaceae with 25 species was the most speciose family, followed by Moraceae (17 species), Rubiaceae (17), Rutaceae (14) and Lauraceae (12). At the generic level, Ficus dominated with 12 species, followed by Diospyros (9), Acacia (6), Terminalia (6) and Grewia (5). Anthropogenic activities such as hill cultivation, construction of <b>dams,</b> <b>roads,</b> buildings, <b>etc.</b> affect the already fragmented southern Eastern Ghats, and underline the need for effective conservation measures...|$|R
40|$|Decline in wet grasslands, {{which in}} the past {{resulted}} particularly from the intensification of agriculture, was accompanied {{by the loss of}} a lot of populations of organisms, including protected and endangered species of plants and animals associated with these habitats e. g. terrestrial orchids. The survival of populations of many species of European orchids is strongly dependent on appropriate site management, especially regular mowing or grazing. In addition, humans can negatively affect the persistence of orchid populations in various ways, such as conversion of orchid meadows into building areas, <b>dams,</b> <b>roads</b> <b>etc.</b> or the intensive use of fertilizers and contamination of areas by fertilisers from nearby fields. Comparison of historical data with the present distribution of orchids can reveal a lot about the main reasons for the decline in this endangered group of plants. Here we present an extensive study of the persistence of 192 historical orchid sites in South Bohemia, with particular reference to the 5 commonest species of orchids, Anacamptis morio, Dactylorhiza majalis, Epipactis helleborine, Epipactis palustris and Platanthera bifolia. We show that the most abundant species at the sites studied was Dactylorhiza majalis. E. palustris, A. morio and P. bifolia are currently not present at any of the historical localities for these species. Considering more recent history, the situation regarding orchid localities in South Bohemia is not critical, but the fate of these species should be closely monitored. The majority of this loss is due to the cessation of mowing of the sites. Thus more attention should be paid to the management of the existing sites. During this study, some new sites were discovered...|$|R

40|$|Within Australia, {{riverine}} connectivity {{has been}} disrupted through {{the installation of}} numerous instream fish passage barriers {{in the form of}} weirs, <b>dams,</b> <b>road</b> crossings, and floodgates. These barriers impact native fish populations by interrupting spawning and seasonal migrations, restricting access to essential habitat and food resources, and altering habitat condition and water quality. As a result, the NSW Department of Primary Industries initiated an extensive audit of instream <b>structures</b> (weirs, <b>dams,</b> <b>road</b> crossings, and floodgates) for the purpose of detailing the location and extent of fish passage obstructions across the NSW coastal catchments. In total, over 3300 barriers were identified and subsequently prioritised regarding their impact on migrating fish. Road crossings accounted for over half of all barriers identified, with pipe culverts and causeways accounting for the majority of impediments for this structure type. Floodgates accounted for an additional third of all barriers, with hinge-flapped gates being the predominate design. Although weirs accounted for < 15 % of identified barriers, the majority of such structures were located on priority waterways resulting in high remediation rankings. Remediation considerations including design options (e. g. fishway installation, auto-tidal floodgates) and overall project costs are described for each barrier type...|$|R

40|$|Springs are {{the main}} source of water for {{millions}} of people in the mid-hills of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH). Both rural and urban communities depend on springs to meet their drinking, domestic and agricultural water needs. There is increasing evidence that springs are drying up, or their discharge is reducing throughout the HKH. As a result, communities are facing unprecedented water stress. The exact extent of this problem is not well known, given the dearth of scientific studies. Springs {{are an integral part of}} the groundwater system. However, the science of hydrogeology that governs the occurrence and movement of water in underground aquifers is not well understood in regions that depend upon springs. This often results in misconceptions regarding springs. This, in turn, creates misaligned policies that exacerbate the problem. Springs are also part of complex sociotechnical and informal governance systems with pronounced gender and equity dimensions, and these systems are not well understood. Again, such lack to understanding leads to inappropriate policies and interventions. Climate change and change in biophysical landscape (e. g. land-use and vegetation) are widely implicated in the drying of springs. But there is very little systematic knowledge to effectively link climate change, vegetation change and spring discharge, especially because of large data uncertainties. This is an urgent area for research and knowledge generation. Rapid socio-economic and demographic changes and infrastructure (<b>dams,</b> <b>roads</b> <b>etc.)</b> have also impacted springs. But again, the exact nature of change is difficult to understand due to a dearth of studies. This is another important knowledge gap that needs to be filled. The drying of springs, which comes with its own set of consequences, is a regional phenomenon that cuts across the HKH – from Afghanistan all the way to Myanmar. A few local and national organizations have started scientific studies and policy advocacy on springs, but more needs to done, especially given the extent of the problem and its regional and local dimensions. In this context, ICIMOD with support from CGIAR’s WLE Program, has initiated work on understanding the physical and governance issues related to springshed management and use this knowledge to influence policymaking in the region...|$|R
40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the various {{disturbance}} agents such as fire, grazing and browsing, over-exploitation of resources, <b>dam</b> constructions, <b>road</b> constructions <b>etc.,</b> affecting the growth of Anogeissus latifolia in the Srinagar valley of Uttarakhand. A. latifolia is the prominent tree species of this valley and is {{an important source of}} fuel, fodder, timber and other basic uses for the local villagers. The inevitable pressure on the A. latifolia is leading to severe destruction of the species and may create the scarcity of that species in the near future. Therefore, joint efforts need to be implemented by the local villagers with government agencies for conservation and sustainable use of A. latifolia. The government may also take a initiative by allotting demarcated forests areas to the villagers as village forest, thus motivating the villagers to take special care for its protection and rehabilitation and for a sustainable output...|$|R
5000|$|The {{modern history}} of the town is {{interwoven}} {{with the history of}} Travancore state. The modern town of Nagercoil grew around Kottar, now a locality within the municipal limits. The town came to prominence during and after the reign of Maharaja Marthanda Varma, the king of Travancore, the capital of which was Padmanabhapuram, about 20 km to the north of Nagercoil. The capital was later shifted to Trivandrum, now Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala state. In the erstwhile Travancore state, Nagercoil was the second most important town in the state, after the capital Trivandrum.His successors continued the reforms he instituted. Although Travancore was {{considered by many to be}} a [...] "Hindu" [...] administration, the rulers generally showed religious tolerance, and were not hostile to European educators, missionaries and traders. Until the 19th century, the coffers of Travancore were greatly helped by revenues from the trade of pepper and other spices, with the European powers. Irrigation systems (an excellent system is still found around Nagercoil), <b>dams,</b> <b>roads,</b> schools <b>etc.</b> developed under the able administration of the Travancore regents and their Dewan. The British in India considered Travancore a [...] "model native state". At the time, Travancore was the most socially developed, and one of the most economically developed states under the British Raj. During the British Raj, Travancore was essentially a vassal-state to the British, but the British never interfered in the general administration of the state.|$|R
40|$|Climate warming {{has been}} more acute in the Arctic than at lower latitudes and this {{tendency}} is expected to continue. This generates major challenges for economic activity in the region. Among other issues is the long-term planning and development of socio-economic infrastructure (<b>dams,</b> bridges, <b>roads,</b> <b>etc.),</b> which require climate-based forecasts of the frequency and magnitude of detrimental flood events. To estimate {{the cost of the}} infrastructure and operational risk, a probabilistic form of long-term forecasting is preferable. In this study, a probabilistic model to simulate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) for multi-year runoff based on a projected climatology is applied to evaluate changes in extreme floods for the territory of the Russian Arctic. The model is validated by cross-comparison of the modelled and empirical PDFs using observations from 23  sites located in northern Russia. The mean values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of the spring flood depth of runoff are evaluated under four climate scenarios, using simulations of six climate models for the period  2010 – 2039. Regions with substantial expected changes in the means and CVs of spring flood depth of runoff are outlined. For the sites located within such regions, it is suggested to account for the future climate change in calculating the maximal discharges of rare occurrence. An example of engineering calculations for maximal discharges with 1  % exceedance probability is provided for the Nadym River at Nadym...|$|R

40|$|The {{capital market}} connects the {{financial}} sector with other non-financial {{sectors of the economy}} and, in the process, facilitates growth and economic development. Literature abound on the impact of stock market on economic growth however, little literature are available from the demand-following hypothesis which claims that it is the growth of the economy that causes increased demand for financial services which, in turn, leads to the development of financial markets. It is against this background that we examined the impact of stock market development on economic growth from the demand-following arguments from the period 1996 - 2010. Employing the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression, we found that economic growth has positive and non-significant impact on market capitalization ratio and turnover ratio of the Nigerian stock exchange but had a negative on the Nigerian stock market value traded ratio. Our study thus recommends an increased effort by the Nigerian government to grow the economy through rapid industrialization, provision of basic amenities such as electricity, <b>roads,</b> <b>dams</b> <b>etc</b> as this will in turn lead to the development of {{the financial sector}}...|$|R
