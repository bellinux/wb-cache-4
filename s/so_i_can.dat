If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.|$|E

When he first read them, Smith found Croft and Sim's lyrics to be [...] "purposely ambiguous so people can relate to them", saying in an interview for Uncut, [...] "I mean… if I listen carefully, I do know about their lives intimately <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> guess what they’re about.

500|$|Reviewing the {{highlights}} from the concert shown on television, Paul Byrne of Dublin's Evening Herald called the concert [...] "a delightfully silly idea" [...] with an [...] "irresistible charm". Anna Lowman of TV Scoop {{noted that some}} {{of the power of the}} featured Doctor Who music came from the audience associating the themes with powerful scenes from the television series. [...] She added, [...] "It was a joy to watch it on the TV, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only imagine that it was magical to be there on the night itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I get done playing a song <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|On 23 May 2016, Giovinco, {{along with}} fellow MLS compatriot Pirlo, was left off of Conte's 30-player {{shortlist}} for Italy's Euro 2016 squad.

In response to his omission, Giovinco stated, [...] "I was upset. I need to keep improving <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find my place back on the national team; I've said before, the league is continuing to grow and it's a beautiful league." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in the investigation, an {{additional}} $4,000 fine was imposed on Monteiro. The coach had {{a salary of}} only about $1,500 per month during the eight months he spent with the Rainmen. He was unable to contact team owner Andre Levingston, who did not assist or help him. Monteiro responded to the charges by claiming that they were unfair. In a statement on May 11, he said, [...] "I am looking for help to fight these unjust sanctions and fines <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> continue to work {{and be able to}} support my family.

500|$|About casting, Singer said, [...] "You pick {{people not}} {{for what they}} are, but what you imagine they can turn into." [...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{although}} [...] "Keep It Together" [...] sonically {{pays tribute to}} Sly and the Family Stone, the lyrics talk about the realization of how important Madonna's family has been {{as a form of}} stability in her life, especially in the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They've always been there for me, We have a connection, Home is where the heart should be". The lyrics follow the course of Madonna's rise from figuratively being a [...] "hungry sibling" [...] ("I'm gonna leave this place, <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> forget every single hungry face") to being a superstar ("I hit the big time but I still get the blues, Everyone's a stranger, City life can get to you").|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> reach more people playing football. [...] I guess you can say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition {{received}} positive reviews. Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{considered the}} updated graphics at native 1080p resolution {{as a good}} addition to the core Tomb Raider experience. He cited mostly negligible {{differences between the two}} versions, but noted a smoother frame-rate on the PS4 version. The Escapist's Jim Sterling was less receptive to the Definitive Edition; he praised the visual improvements, but felt that nominal content additions to the single-player experience and the game's price point made it difficult to recommend to players outside of those who had not played the original version. GameZone's Matt Liebl gave Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition a 9/10, stating [...] "Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition was my first time playing Crystal Dynamics' reboot, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> definitely recommend it for newcomers. As for whether or not it's worth paying full price for the same game with upgraded graphics, well that's something you need to decide." ...|$|E

500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E

[...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight is finally stern with him, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing to the children.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie.
