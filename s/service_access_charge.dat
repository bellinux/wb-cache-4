40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} considers the problem of excessive originating and terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> imposed by some competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) in the United States. The problem arises because the current institutional structure provides an incentive for CLECs to <b>charge</b> for <b>access</b> <b>service</b> in excess of what a competitive market would indicate. An examination of the data shows {{that the problem of}} excessive <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> imposed by CLECs is very real. An analysis of terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> for September 2000 reveals that average terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> billed to three interexchange carriers (IXCs) are excessive, exceeding average price cap regulated incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> by 370 - 470 percent. Some solutions to the problem are offered including a first-best solution whereby the calling party would be required to pay for originating <b>access</b> <b>service</b> and have the receiving party pay for terminating <b>access</b> <b>service.</b> A second-best solution would be to limit CLEC's <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> to an IXC to be {{less than or equal to}} the <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> of the ILEC with which it directly competes for customers. <b>Access</b> <b>charges</b> CLECS Federal Communication Commission Telecommunications Policy...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> of copper and fiber {{unbundling}} on an incumbent's incentives to invest in fiber access networks. Once the fiber deployment is in place, the incumbent and the entrant compete for consumers in both copper and fiber markets. We show that when the regulator can freely set either the copper or the fiber <b>access</b> <b>charge,</b> there is a positive correlation between the fixed fiber (respectively, copper) <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> and the copper (respectively, fiber) <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> that maximizes the incumbent's profit after the investment. On the contrary, when the regulator is free to set both <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> the incumbent's profit is an increasing function of both <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> However, the decision of the incumbent to undertake the investment in fiber deployment is not only affected by its profit after the investment, but also by the opportunity cost of the investment. This cost is reflected by the profits that the incumbent earns when it does not invest in fiber access networks, and hence, the two firms compete for the provision of only copper-based services. We find that the optimal regulatory policy in terms of investment incentives is to set the copper <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> at the cost of providing the access to the copper access network and the fiber <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> at the level that maximizes the incumbent's profit after the investment.

Long-distance rates, meanwhile, fell both due {{to the end of}} this subsidy and increased competition. The FCC established a system of <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> where long distance networks paid the more expensive local networks both to originate and terminate a call. In this way, the implicit subsidies of the Bell System became explicit post-divestiture.

In addition, the effect of such service bundling by an entrant on the market incumbent with ownership over existing bottleneck facilities is analyzed. Furthermore, an <b>access</b> <b>charge</b> that maximizes social welfare is explored and determined.
