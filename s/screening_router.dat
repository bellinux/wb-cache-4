50|$|A {{packet filter}} {{is a first}} {{generation}} firewall that processes network traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router {{is known as a}} <b>screening</b> <b>router,</b> which screens packets leaving and entering the network.|$|E
40|$|Efforts of {{this paper}} focus on the issues about {{management}} and throughput of firewalls (or <b>screening</b> <b>routers)</b> applied in transit networks. On the one hand, manual configuration of large amount of firewalls distributed in many access points can not meet the global security requirements in the open and dynamic environment. On the other hand, the ordinal lookup of filtering rules in each individual firewall results in great decrease of throughput. Aimed at a typical transit network and its security policy requirements, a policy-based access control framework (PACF) is proposed in this paper. This framework is based on three levels of abstract access control policy: organizational access control policy (OACP), global access control policy (GACP) and local access control policy (LACP). The GACP, which comes {{from the results of}} IDSes and search engines according to OACP, is automatically and dynamically distributed to firewalls as LACPs. Each LACP is then enforced by an individual firewall. Some key algorithms for distribution of GACP and enforcement of LACP are described. A hash-based algorithm is proposed, for lookup of filtering rules in LACP. Under the environment with policy requirements described in this paper, the new algorithm reduces the time complexity of lookup from O (N) of traditional sequential algorithm to O (1), which therefore increases largely the throughput of firewalls. 1...|$|R
40|$|Several leading {{lighting}} {{companies for}} example NXP and Philips {{work in a}} project to explore the next generation intelligent lighting system. One innovation of the project is using a distributed architecture to replace current centralized system to increase robustness and extensibility. As a core component of wireless lighting control system, there are many wireless communication protocols can be applied in distributed system. We choose BLE protocol which is a new wireless communication protocol as the communication protocol of distributed system to do research because BLE has a huge potential in low power consumption. However, there exist some problems in BLE based distributed lighting control system. One of these problems is a commissioning problem. The commissioning problem {{we come up with}} is that a constrained device (no <b>screen)</b> <b>router,</b> cannot display a scanning list of BLE based lamps. This prevents specific BLE based lamps which user want to remotely control, from securely joining in the existing access point (router). The main purpose of this thesis is to solve the commissioning problem in a BLE based intelligent lighting control system to make BLE become an appropriate candidate in this field. An innovative solution, developed on standardized BLE protocol, which is used for overcoming the commissioning problem through utilizing modified BLE protocol in a smartphone. The modified BLE protocol is a application protocol. With the modified BLE protocol stack, a third device which is a Commissioning Tool(smartphone) can securely instruct specific BLE based lamps to router. As part of this thesis, a demo was set up and the solution to the commissioning problem has been tested on this system. Results proved that the solution was valid to solve the commissioning problem of BLE based intelligent lighting control system.

40|$|With {{the status}} of {{intrusion}} detection systemâ€™s (IDS) future doubted by some and supported by others, the steps involved in building a distributed IDS are questioned. Issues with deployment and implementation are outlined in summary. Review of currently available documentation and setup of systems, while updating applications required for the builds, are conducted to determine what problems may be encountered and if solutions or workarounds exist. A question of what additional security measures may be performed is addressed, along with a means to duplicate systems inexpensively. Overview An emergency response plan for incident handling exists. <b>Screening</b> <b>router</b> and firewall are filtering packets permitted into the network. There is an anti-viral gateway scanning messages destined for the users ' mailboxes. But what about the traffic 'permitted ' into the network, past the router, through the firewall, which contains malicious code, the latest exploit against the company's web server, or the newest buffer overflow for the organization's nameserver?
