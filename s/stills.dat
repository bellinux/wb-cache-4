5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist.

A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts.

Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being <b>stills</b> from the film itself.
