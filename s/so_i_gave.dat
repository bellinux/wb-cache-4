During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets.

500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{noted that}} his usual method of {{generating}} parody ideas is to scan Billboard charts, radio play and online buzz {{in order to}} create a master list of candidates. From that point, he works out possible puns on the song titles, the potential for humor and general direction for his versions. Fans speculated ahead of the album's release that Yankovic would parody [...] "Let It Go" [...] from the Disney film Frozen, due to the song's popularity. He later explained that he considered making a Frozen parody titled [...] "Make It So" [...] about , but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed. Yankovic observed that the existing spoof [...] "had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to take it down! I couldn't think of an idea that I liked as much as 'Make It So', <b>so...</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> up!". There were several other songs he intended to parody, but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for, and instead used them in the medley [...] "Now That's What I Call Polka". More specifically, Yankovic expressed that while Daft Punk's [...] "Get Lucky" [...] is an [...] "iconic song", it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively.|$|E

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool", also by Lee, Moody, and Hodges, {{is about}} celebrities with false images. In a VH1 interview, Lee said: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't {{want to offend}} anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started {{dressing}} like them and she was like 8 years old. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] "My Immortal", a piano rock ballad written by Moody with a bridge by Lee, {{is based on a}} short story Moody wrote; in the album booklet he dedicates the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. [...] "Haunted" [...] is also based on a Moody short story which was posted on the Evanescence fan forum, EvBoard.com. [...] "Tourniquet" [...] was originally written for Christian death metal band Soul Embraced, which included future Evanescence member Rocky Gray. [...] "Imaginary", a song from Evanescence's 1998 self-titled EP, was originally intended as Fallen fourth single. The midtempo [...] "Taking Over Mes lyrics are about Lee being consumed by another person's obsession with her. [...] "Hello" [...] remembers one of Lee's sisters, who died of an illness in 1987 at age three. The lyrics of [...] "My Last Breath" [...] explore emotional survival, with the lack of air a metaphor. [...] "Whisper" [...] features the Millennium Choir singing in Latin against muted guitars, but the choir is credited in the booklet by each individual vocalist rather than by the choir's official name.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E
2500|$|While at Idaho, Lightfoot also {{excelled in}} the classroom, {{which was the}} {{opposite}} of what had been occurring at the high school and junior college levels. He did not miss a single class in his three years and graduated on time. Years later, he had this retrospective on the change: [...] "I was not dumb, just lazy and spoiled. [...] I was put on probation at Idaho and they would have kicked me out of there if I screwed up even once.

His funeral service was attended by Michael Jackson, Harry Wayne Casey, Jennifer Valoppi and Nat Kipner. Valoppi, a family friend said, [...] "It was emotional, there was humor. Everybody talked about how this was a man who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life." [...] Gibb's ex-wife Lulu was reported to have attended his funeral. Kipner, who managed the early Bee Gees career in Australia in 1966 spoke fondly of his memories: [...] "But I had a business in Australia and I didn't want to go. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> them their contract back. One of the dumb things I've done", he joked.|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a wonderfully}} {{cooperative}} young lady that needed direction. Had no technique and no real acting experience. She {{was engaged to}} marry Dick Zanuck. So in Planet of the Apes they put her in with Frank Schaffner, then in mine, they underwrote her. They had nothing {{for her to do}} in this one, except just be part of the sequel. In other words, she was so badly conceived in the writing that I had to conceive actions for her to make her belong to the piece. And the big action which I gave her – and I think she came off beautifully with it – was to try to understand what these people were trying to communicate to her. And struggling to understand and feeling sympathetic vibrations coming from these people. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> her something which was not in the script to play and she played that, I think, very simpatico, very beautifully." ...|$|E
2500|$|Les Femmes (1969) was a flop, {{although}} the screwball comedy The Bear and the Doll (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: Les Novices (1970), Boulevard du Rhum (1971) (with Lino Ventura). The Legend of Frenchie King (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked [...] "Underneath what people call [...] "the Bardot myth" [...] was something interesting, {{even though she}} was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to {{get to the end of}} something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her.

2500|$|Bellairs {{undertook}} The Face in the Frost {{while living}} in Britain and after reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, {{but it is not}} much like that book, apart from sharing the idea of a wizard who is palpably human and not a literary stereotype. Bellairs said of his third book: [...] "The Face in the Frost was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. I was much taken by The Lord of the Rings and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book I was {{struck by the fact that}} Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in." [...] Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described The Face in the Frost as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since The Lord of the Rings. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to The Face in the Frost at the time. An unfinished sequel titled The Dolphin Cross was included in the 2009 anthology Magic Mirrors, which was published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
