40|$|The role of {{diabetes}} specialist nurses in delivering diabetes consultations has been recognised {{for more than}} a decade, particularly since the publication of the Standards for Specialist Education and Practice by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) in 2001. However, evidence on how the consultation is delivered, together with patients’ experiences, is somewhat limited. This study examined diabetes specialist nurses’ and patients’ consultation experiences in primary care. It also investigated the process and outcome <b>of</b> these diabetes <b>consultations.</b> This research utilised a sequential mixed methods single approach design in which qualitative was followed by quantitative investigation. In the qualitative stage, 7 diabetes specialist nurses and 7 patients were interviewed separately, followed by observations <b>of</b> 7 nurse-patient <b>consultations.</b> The data from the interviews were analysed thematically, whereas the data from nurse patient consultations were examined though conversation analysis (CA). The investigation continued quantitatively, where the questionnaires were developed based on the qualitative findings and adaptation <b>of</b> the <b>Consultation</b> Quality Index (CQI- 2). Following on from a pilot study, the questionnaires were sent to adult patients with diabetes (n= 150) and 40 completed questionnaires were returned for statistical analysis. The qualitative and quantitative findings were then merged in a matrix diagram to reveal holistic findings on consultation experiences. The thematic analysis of patients’ interviews produced five themes which were: ‘I don’t like living with diabetes’, ‘Daily problems’, ‘Coping with my diabetes’, ‘How the nurses approach me’ and ‘My expectations toward the diabetes specialist nurses’. In contrast, the themes from the nurses focused not only on the diabetes consultation but also care management issues: ‘Current problems’, ‘My expectations towards the patients’, ‘Consultation approaches’, ‘Personal development’ and ‘Team working’. Details on the sequence and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> were obtained from conversation analysis which highlighted the approaches commonly used by the diabetes specialist nurses. The statistical analysis showed associations between partnership and empathy (P= 0. 01), empathy and outcome (P= 0. 005), information giving and consultation time (P= 0. 05). The integration of qualitative and quantitative findings suggested ‘Consultation stages’ as a theme, and also four themes related to consultation experiences: ‘Day to day hurdle’, ‘Knowing each other’, ‘Shared expectations’and ‘Working together’. This study has identified the value and processes <b>of</b> the nurse-patient <b>consultation</b> in diabetes care from a nursing context. In general, the patients experienced their consultations with the DSNs positively. They highlighted key personal characteristics of the nurses. Similarly, the nurses considered their role in delivering consultation as crucial. Some challenges were evident including patients’ behaviours, the diabetes knowledge of other health care professionals and the lack of administrative support.

40|$|Background: Earlier {{studies have}} {{associated}} improvements in chronic pain outcomes with various consultation attributes, including: the legitimization of people's chronic pain experience, affective {{components of the}} therapeutic relationship, and reaching decisions about people's care through collaboration. Although studies have used patient self-report measures to examine how certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> contribute to managing chronic pain. The psychometric quality of these measures seems to have not been independently appraised to date. Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties and administrative feasibility of published patient self-report consultation measures that were validated for people with chronic pain. Methods: Databases were searched to identify patient self-report consultation measures validated in chronic pain populations. Explicit review criteria for 8 measure attributes were developed for this review by synthesizing information from available guidelines. In total, 58 potentially relevant consultation measures were identified. Of these, 4 measures satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were critically appraised by 2 independent reviewers. Overall, the psychometric quality of the included measures was modest, particularly in terms of evidence for content validity, test-retest reliability, responsiveness, and interpretability. Discussion: Each of the included measures assessed differing aspects <b>of</b> <b>consultations,</b> and their potential clinical and research uses are discussed. Recommendations are made to improve the psychometric quality of the included measures. In summary, more psychometric {{research needs to be}} undertaken to improve the existing measures' quality and broaden the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> chronic pain <b>consultation</b> measures before studies may be conducted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the manner in which consultation attributes influence chronic pain outcomes...|$|R

The accusations brought forth in the so-called expert opinion of scientific deception by the assessment authorities are completely unfounded and their content provides no new contri-bution to the scientific discourse. They were not made available in the public consultation or in a peer-reviewed publication.

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore GPs experience of informing women of prenatal genetic screening tests for foetal abnormality. Methods: A qualitative study consisting of four focus groups was conducted in metropolitan and rural Victoria, Australia. A discussion guide was used and the audio-taped transcripts were independently coded by two researchers using thematic analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> that do {{not conform}} to the traditionally understood communication 'dyad', in order to highlight implications for medical education and develop a reflective 'toolkit' for use by medical practitioners and educators in the analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultations.</b> DESIGN: A series of interdisciplinary research workshops spanning 12  months explored the social impact of globalisation and computerisation on the clinical consultation, focusing specifically on contemporary challenges to the clinician-patient dyad. Researchers presented detailed case studies <b>of</b> <b>consultations,</b> taken from their recent research projects. Drawing on concepts from applied sociolinguistics, further analysis of selected case studies prompted the identification of key emergent themes. SETTING: University departments in the UK and Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Six researchers with backgrounds in medicine, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics and medical education. One workshop was also attended by PhD students conducting research on healthcare interactions. RESULTS: The contemporary consultation is characterised by a multiplicity of voices. Incorporation of additional voices in the consultation creates new forms of order (and disorder) in the interaction. The roles 'clinician' and 'patient' are blurred as they become increasingly distributed between different participants. These new consultation arrangements make new demands on clinicians, which lie beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> most educational programmes for clinical communication. CONCLUSIONS: The consultation is changing. Traditional consultation models that assume a 'dyadic' consultation do not adequately incorporate the realities <b>of</b> many contemporary <b>consultations.</b> A paradox emerges between the need to manage consultations in a 'super-diverse' multilingual society, while also attending to increasing requirements for standardised protocol-driven approaches to care prompted by computer use. The tension between standardisation and flexibility requires addressing in educational contexts. Drawing on concepts from applied sociolinguistics and the findings of these research observations, the authors offer a reflective 'toolkit' of questions to ask <b>of</b> the <b>consultation</b> in the context of enquiry-based learning...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To gain {{insights}} into the ability of general practitioners (GPs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) to meet patient demands in out-of-hours primary care by comparing the outcomes of teams with different ratios of practitioners. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study. SETTING: A GP cooperative (GPC) in the Netherlands. INTERVENTION: Team 2 (1 NP, 3 GPs) and team 3 (2 NPs, 2 GPs) were compared with team 1 (4 GPs). Each team covered 35 weekend days. PARTICIPANTS: All 9503 patients who were scheduled for a consultation at the GPC through a nurse triage system. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the total number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> per provider for weekend cover between 10 : 00 and 18 : 00 hours. Secondary outcomes concerned the numbers of patients outside the NPs' <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice, patient safety, resource use, direct healthcare costs and GPs' performance. RESULTS: The mean number <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> per shift was lower in teams with NPs (team 1 : 93. 9, team 3 : 87. 1; p< 0. 001). The mean proportion of patients outside NPs' <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice per hour was 9. 0 % (SD 6. 7), and the highest value in any hour was 40 %. The proportion of patients who did not receive treatment within the targeted time period was higher in teams with NPs (team 2, 5. 2 %; team 3, 8. 3 %) compared with GPs only (team 1 3. 5 %) (p< 0. 01). Team 3 referred more patients to the emergency department (14. 7 %) compared with team 1 (12. 0 %; p= 0. 028). In teams with NPs, GPs more often treated urgent patients (team 1 : 13. 2 %, team 2 : 16. 3 %, team 3 : 21. 4 %; p< 0. 01) and patients with digestive complaints (team 1 : 11. 1 %, team 2 : 11. 8 %, team 3 : 16. 7 %; p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Primary healthcare teams with a ratio of up to two GPs and two NPs provided sufficient capacity to provide care to all patients during weekend cover.

40|$|Background Triage at out-of-hours GP cooperatives (GPCs) {{is aimed}} at {{determining}} medical urgency and guiding decisions. Both medical knowledge and communication skills are required for this complex task. Objective To explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and estimated urgency on the appropriateness of decisions. Methods We performed a secondary analysis <b>of</b> telephone triage <b>consultations</b> by nurses at 29 Dutch GPCs. Consultations were taped and assessed by trained observers, using a validated instrument. Measures concerned quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation,</b> nurse-estimated urgency (four levels) and appropriateness of decisions (urgency, follow-up advice and timing). Bivariate analyses and logistic multilevel regression analyses were used to explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> (controlling for urgency) on appropriateness of decisions. Results The sample included 6739 telephone contacts, most of which (90 %) were non-urgent. The majority of decisions were appropriate (91 % for urgency, 96 % for follow-up advice and 95 % for timing). In bivariate analyses, appropriateness of decisions {{was positively related to}} higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Estimated urgency was negatively associated with quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Logistic multilevel analysis showed that higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> was related to a more appropriate estimation of urgency [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 69 - 1. 95], follow-up advice (OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI: 2. 41 - 3. 01) and timing of decisions (OR = 2. 41; 95 % CI: 2. 20 - 2. 63).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{preliminary}} evaluation of a mental health consultation process provided to staff working in residential care settings for young people. Using a semi-structured interview approach, qualitative information was gathered from six participants about their experiences <b>of</b> the <b>consultation.</b> A thematic analysis of the interviews generated four key themes, which appear to reflect the different stages <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> These included: initiating consultation; building the consultative relationship; overcoming obstacles; and seeing the value <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> These themes, along with prevalent sub-themes, are discussed with reference to the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>consultation</b> process and the implications for use <b>of</b> psychological <b>consultation</b> in clinical practic...|$|R
40|$|Aims The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the current role of general {{practice}} nurses and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> nursing practice to inform the development of national professional practice standards for Australian general practice nurses. Background Increasing numbers of nurses have been employed in Australian general practice to meet the growing demand for primary care services. This has brought significant changes to the nursing role. Competency standards for nurses working in general practice were first developed in Australia in 2005, but limited attention has been placed on articulating the contemporary <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice for nurses in this setting. Design Concurrent mixed methods design. Methods Data collection was conducted during 2013 - 2014 and involved two online surveys of Registered and Enrolled Nurses currently working in general practice, a series of 14 focus groups across Australia and a series <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> with key experts. Findings Data collection enabled the development of 22 Practice Standards separated into four domains: (i) Professional Practice; (ii) Nursing Care; (iii) General Practice Environment and (iv) Collaborative Practice. To differentiate the variations in enacting these Standards, performance indicators for the Enrolled Nurse, Registered Nurse and Registered Nurse Advanced Practice are provided under each Standard. Conclusion The development of national professional practice standards for nurses working in Australian general practice will support ongoing workforce development. These Standards are also an important means of articulating the role and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the nurses 2 ̆ 7 practice for both consumers and other health professionals, as well as being a guide for curriculum development and measurement of performance...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{multiple}} roles {{of a school}} psychologist is consultation. The Mental Health, Organizational, and Behavioral models <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> are reported in publications by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) to be the prominent models {{in the field of}} school psychology. However, no supporting data are cited; thus it is unclear whether these three consultation models are the most prominent in school psychology today. The current study evaluated the consultation literature over the past twenty-two years in the professional journal School Psychology Review. Consultation articles were analyzed to obtain information regarding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published, the most frequent types <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> mentioned, topics addressed, and the type of research conducted. Data collected found a minimal decrease in the amount <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published over the past twenty-two years. A wide array of terminology was found in referring to types <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Behavioral consultation was found to be the most frequently researched and mentioned model. The Mental Health consultation model was fairly prominent but the Organization model was rarely presented. Numerous other consultation models were reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Scope</b> <b>of</b> {{practice}} {{is seen as}} the base from which governing bodies prepare standards of practice, educational institutions organize curricula and employers prepare job descriptions. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice varies among and within healthcare professions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the concept <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice for dietetics in Saskatchewan and Canada. Little is known about dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice in Canada and literature has not shown a consistent use of the term. Saskatchewan is one of two provincial dietetic regulatory bodies without a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice in legislation. Implications for having an undefined <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice include role confusion, competition among providers, diminishing professional identity and under- or over-utilization of health professionals. 	Using interpretative description methodology, data was collected through four phases. In Phase I, eight provincial dietetic regulatory bodies participated in semi structured telephone interviews on <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice. Phase II used an online survey on 92 Saskatchewan dietitians to examine dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice. A follow up online focus group was conducted with ten Saskatchewan dietitians in Phase III to further explore dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice. Phase IV related dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice statements found across Canada to literature and data collected in Phases I-III. Themes were defined as a topic identified by participants in more than one phase. Data from all phases were coded using NVivo 9. 0. 	Results indicate that dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice statements are a product of a complex multi-player, political process. Without a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice, Saskatchewan dietitian participants were interpreting their role from a combination of documents (e. g. ethics, research) and stakeholders (e. g. employers and colleagues). Participants believed a dietetic <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice should provide guidance to dietitians, employers, health professionals, the public, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Challenges defining, understanding and working with a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice include encompassing the diversity of dietetics in a concise statement, and working with stakeholders who have a poor understanding of the dietetic profession. 	Our research also revealed variation in dietetic <b>scopes</b> <b>of</b> practice across Canada. A <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice cycle was proposed which included four phases: no <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice, creating a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice, using a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice and evaluating and updating a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice. Factors influencing a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice, such as the political environment, education of professionals and employer policies all impact this <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice cycle. Perceived outcomes <b>of</b> a <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> practice include guidance, credibility, advanced practice and practice protection...|$|R
