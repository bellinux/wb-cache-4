He did, however, return to the studio long enough to produce two final albums, <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>There</b> and Adi√≥s, in late 2012 and early 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly {{survived to}} stand trial on 19 October 1880 in Melbourne before the Irish-born judge Justice Sir Redmond Barry. Mr Smyth and Mr Chomley {{appeared}} for the crown and Mr Bindon for the prisoner. The trial was adjourned to 28 October, when Kelly was presented on the charge {{of the murder of}} Sergeant Kennedy, Constable Scanlan and Lonigan, the various bank robberies, the murder of Sherritt, resisting arrest at Glenrowan and with a long list of minor charges. He was convicted of the willful murder of Constable Lonigan and was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Barry. Several unusual exchanges between Kelly and the judge included the judge's customary words [...] "May God have mercy on your soul", to which Kelly replied [...] "I will go a little further than that, and say I will <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>there</b> where I go." [...] At Kelly's request, his picture was taken and he was granted farewell interviews with family members. His mother's last words to him were reported to be [...] "Mind you die like a Kelly." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sigurd continued: [...] "I {{was in many}} {{a battle}} in the Saracens' land, and always came off conqueror; I won many {{precious}} goods, the like of which were never seen here before; and I was always the most highly esteemed where brave men met: while yours is but a home-bred renown. I went to Palestine, I came to Apulia; but I did not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>there,</b> brother. I gave Roger the Great the title of King. I won seven battles; but you were in none of them. I was at our Lord's grave; but I did not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>there,</b> brother. I went to Jordan, where our Lord was baptized. I swam across the river; but I did not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>there.</b> A willow grew on the bank, and I twisted the boughs into a knot, which is waiting there for you; for I said that you should untie it, and fulfil the vow that is bound up in it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, and his {{low voice}} had the {{intensity}} of a trumpet. [...] "If this magnificent moment passes by, this chance for a pure impulsive choice, it is lost forever.
