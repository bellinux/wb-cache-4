50|$|Starting his {{international}} sporting career only in {{his late}} thirties at the 1968 Winter Olympics of Grenoble, Krienbühl mostly skated {{at the back of}} the field. However, in 1974, he introduced the one-piece <b>skin</b> <b>suit</b> into speed skating. In spite of the fact that he improved his times dramatically, he was initially laughed at. However, when other skaters also showed improvement, the top skaters quickly switched to the suits as well. Krienbühl also introduced minor improvements for skates.|$|E
40|$|Ski Cross rules require loose {{garments}} and <b>skin</b> <b>suits</b> are not allowed. This {{study investigated}} the aerodynamic behaviour of flapping garments of different looseness ratios (garment length to cylinder circumference) mounted on a horizontal cylinder. Three fabrics of different roughness were tested in a wind tunnel from 20 to 140 kph. Tight fitting textiles showed the standard flow transition and critical flow regime known from smooth and rough cylinders. Flapping textiles exhibited a higher drag coefficient (on average 1. 5 {{times higher than the}} tight fitting fabrics in the subcritical regime), which decreased slightly with speed. The high drag coefficient {{can be attributed to the}} flutter amplitude which increases the wake diameter and prevents backward movement of the separation points. The looseness ratio (fineness ratio) affects the drag coefficient only marginally (drag decreases with the ratios) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSport {{events are}} often staged by {{destination}} marketers for branding purposes, {{to attract new}} tourists, and/or to address tourism seasonality issues, among other reasons. But before athletes vie for championships in far-away places often an equally vigorous competition has taken place months or in some cases, years earlier to determine the host cities. Such {{is the case for}} mega- events i. e., Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup as well as for second tier events including the International Ski Federation (FIS) Nordic World Ski Championships. One might perceive that cross country skiing involves quietly schussing through pine forests but at the elite level, nordic ski races are highly commercialized, featuring athletes in colorfully-clad <b>skin</b> <b>suits</b> adorned with corporate emblems, and the courses, lined with sponsor signs, finish in a stadium. The event atmosphere is like a rock concert: Large screens broadcast the races while pulsating music blares and fans dance (to keep warm). Food, beverage, and merchandise vendors display their wares for sale or sample. For those seeking sport in pristine wilderness environments, too much commercialism may be disconcerting, leading to shortened stays and negative referrals; conversely too few commercial opportunities linked to nature-based sport tourism may inhibit existing businesses and/or future investments, or lead to an event atmosphere that is blasé...|$|R

50|$|The 1970s saw {{a second}} {{technological}} {{breakthrough in the}} form of the <b>skin</b> <b>suit,</b> though that came only into general use by 1976. The 1970s saw a faster improvement than the decades before, beginning with Soviet skater Lyudmila Titova, who was the first woman below 1:30.0 with her 1:29.5 on 9 January 1970 on the Medeo rink, a record that stood only a day because Lyudmila Fechina skated 1:29.0 the next day of the same event. This result was equalled next year by Stien Kaiser on 16 January 1971 in Davos and by Lyudmila Titova during day one of the World Sprint Speed Skating Championships for Women 1971 in Inzell. A day later however Lyudmila Titova made the record her own again when she skated a 1:27.7. The last skater who set the world record on natural ice was U.S. skater Anne Henning, who managed a 1:27.3 on 8 January 1972 in Davos. Medeo by now had an artificial rink, and the next records of the 1970s would be skated here by Soviet skater Tatyana Averina: 1:26.40 in 1974, and 1:26.12, 1:25.28 and 1:23.46 in 1975.|$|E
40|$|Skin {{exposures}} to chemicals may lead, through percutaneous permeation, {{to a significant}} increase in systemic circulation. Skin is the primary route of entry during some occupational activities, especially in agriculture. To reduce skin exposures, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended. PPE efficiency is characterized as the time until products permeate through material (lag time, Tlag). Both skin and PPE permeations are assessed using similar in vitro methods; the diffusion cell system. Flow-through diffusion cells were used in this study to assess the permeation of two herbicides, bentazon and isoproturon, as well as four related commercial formulations (Basagran(®), Basamais(®), Arelon(®) and Matara(®)). Permeation was measured through fresh excised human <b>skin,</b> protective clothing <b>suits</b> (suits) (Microchem(®) 3000, AgriSafe Pro(®), Proshield(®) and Microgard(®) 2000 Plus Green), and a combination of <b>skin</b> and <b>suits.</b> Both herbicides, tested by itself or as an active ingredient in formulations, permeated readily through human <b>skin</b> and tested <b>suits</b> (Tlag <  2  h). High permeation coefficients were obtained regardless of formulations or tested membranes, except for Microchem(®) 3000. Short Tlag, were observed even when skin was covered with suits, except for Microchem(®) 3000. Kp values tended to decrease when <b>suits</b> covered the <b>skin</b> (except when Arelon(®) was applied to skin covered with AgriSafe Pro and Microgard(®) 2000), suggesting that Tlag alone is insufficient in characterizing suits. To better estimate human skin permeations, in vitro experiments should not only use human skin but also consider the intended use of the suit, i. e., the active ingredient concentrations and type of formulations, which significantly affect skin permeation...|$|R

40|$|Aim The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} registered and enrolled nurses’ perceptions of how they assess patients’ pain, nutrition and skin. Introduction Planning for pain, nutrition and skin care management is an essential part of nursing. In Sweden, it is common that registered and enrolled nurses work together in the care of patients. Method Interviews with nine registered and nine enrolled nurses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results One theme; blurring boundaries between registered and enrolled nurses regarding pain, nutrition and <b>skin</b> <b>suit</b> assessments was identified. The manifest content of interviews is described in four categories: nurse–patient interaction, using oneself as a tool, collaborating with colleagues and listening to patients’ next of kin. Conclusion The analysis showed a blurring of boundaries between RNs and ENs regarding pain, nutrition and <b>skin</b> <b>suit</b> assessments. How they perform their assessments conforms to a large extent. However, even if the activities are the same, the education levels of RNs and ENs are different and therefore the assessment of the patients might be different in clinical practice. Taking the results into account it is important that RNs and ENs collaborate regarding assessment of the patients’ pain, nutrition and <b>skin</b> <b>suit...</b>|$|E
40|$|Bioceramic fabrics {{have been}} claimed to improve blood circulation, {{thermoregulation}} and muscle relaxation, thereby also improving muscular activity. Here we tested whether bioceramic fabrics {{have an effect}} on postural control and contribute to improve postural stability. In Experiment 1, we tested whether bioceramic fabrics contribute to reduce body-sway when maintaining standard standing posture. In Experiment 2, we measured the effect of bioceramic fabrics on body-sway when maintaining a more instable posture, namely a handstand hold. For both experiments, postural oscillations were measured using a force platform with four strain gauges that recorded the displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) in the horizontal plane. In half of the trials, the participants wore a full-body second <b>skin</b> <b>suit</b> containing a bioceramic layer. In {{the other half of the}} trials, they wore a ‘placebo’ second <b>skin</b> <b>suit</b> that had the same cut, appearance and elasticity as the bioceramic suit but did not contain the bioceramic layer. In both experiments, the surface of displacement of the CoP was significantly smaller when participants were wearing the bioceramic suit than when they were wearing the placebo suit. The results suggest that bioceramic fabrics do {{have an effect on}} postural control and improve postural stability...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of speedskating suits to increase average skating speed at the 2002 Olympic winter games of Salt Lake City. We model the average skating speed {{of male and female}} speed skaters at distances from 500 to 10000 meters. Speed not only depends on physical characteristics of the skaters, but also on previous performance and speedskating suits that reduce drag. We find that one specific suit, the so-called Swift <b>Skin</b> <b>suit,</b> significantly increases average skating speed, especially in long-distance events. This suits increase speed by up to 0. 2 - 0. 3 seconds per lap on a 400 -meter oval. The effects are more pronounced for men than for women and show up {{in the first part of}} the race. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} fastskin swimsuits {{reflects}} {{some of the}} challenges facing the impact of technology in postmodern culture. Introduced in 1999 and ratified for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, fastskin swimsuits were touted as revolutionising competitive swimming. Ten years later, they were banned by the world&# 039;s swimming regulatory body FINA (the Fédération Internationale de Natation), with the ban taking effect from January 2010 (Shipley 2009). The reason was the controversy caused by {{the large number of}} world records that were broken by competitors wearing polyurethane swimsuits, the next generation of the original fast <b>skin</b> <b>suits.</b> These suits were deemed to be providing an artificial advantage by increasing buoyancy and reducing drag. This had been an issue ever since they were introduced, yet FINA had approved the suits and, thereby, unleashed an unstoppable technological revolution of the sport of competitive swimming. Underlying this was the issue about its implications of the transformation of a sport based on the movement of the human body through water without the aid of artificial devices or apparatus. This article argues that the advent of the fastskin has not only transformed the art of swimming but has created a new image of the swimmer as a virtual android rather than a human fish. In turn, the image of the sport of swimming has been re-mapped as a technical artefact and sci-fi spectacle based on a radically transformed concept of the swimming body as a material object that has implications for the ideal of the fashionable body...|$|R
