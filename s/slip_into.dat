5|$|Windsor Castle {{continued}} to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted {{a visit from the}} Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits.|$|E

Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E

5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to have}} treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available. In 480 BC, during the Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian king Xerxes had sent his army via a mountain track (the Anopea) to outflank the pass. From this track, on the western side of Mount Kallidromon, another road led off and descended in Phocis. In 480 BC, a thousand Phocian troops were stationed above Thermopylae to guard the road and prevent a Persian assault on Phocis (though they notably failed to prevent the Persians using Anopea). However, in 339 BC, the Greeks had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> central Greece unhindered.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru FC {{began the}} season in good form and {{finished}} the first month {{on top of the}} table. Defeat to the previous season league champions Mohun Bagan in February saw the club <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> second place until the final month of the season. However, the club then went seven games unbeaten to return {{to the top of the}} table by April. The title was secured on 17 April when Bengaluru FC defeated Salgaocar at home. After the I-League season, the club were knocked out of the Federation Cup in the first round of the competition by Aizawl. The club started their AFC Cup campaign slowly, losing their first two group stage matches. Three victories in a row however saw Bengaluru FC qualify for the knockout stages. In the Round of 16 the club defeated Kitchee to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. 26 different players represented the club in three competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. Bengaluru FC's top goalscorer was Sunil Chhetri, who scored 9 goals in 20 games. This season was also the last that Bengaluru FC would be under their first coach Ashley Westwood. Westwood left the club after the season concluded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to}} have treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> central Greece unhindered. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
