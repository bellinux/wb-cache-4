Tijekom 2014. godine 12 mokro-suhih parova crnih Theysohn® naletno barijernih feromonskih klopki postavljeno je u dvije g. j. UŠP Gospić na različitim nadmorskim visinama. Šest parova klopki postavljeno je u g. j. Žitnik na 500 metara nadmorske visine, a preostalih šest na nadmorskoj visini od 1100 metara u g. j. Štirovača u blizini nacionalnog parka Sjeverni Velebit. Između testiranih klopki nije utvrđena statistički značajna razlika broja ulovljenih potkornjaka, iako je suha feromonska klopka ulovila veći broj jedinki smrekovog pisara i šesterozubog smrekovog potkornjaka. Mokra i suha feromonska klopka pokazale su jednaku selektivnost prema predatorskoj entomofauni – Thanasimus formicarius i Nemozoma elongatum. U suhim feromonskim klopkama utvrđena je redukcija broja ulovljenih potkornjaka djelovanjem predatora. Kod vrste T. formicarius uočena je mogućnost bijega iz suhih feromonskih klopki. Rezultati provedenog istraživanja omogućuju racionalniji pristup monitoringu populacija smrekovih potkornjaka sustavom suhih i mokrih naletno barijernih Theysohn feromonskih klopki. Efficiency of dry and wet flight barrier Theysohn® pheromone traps in {{catching the}} {{spruce bark beetle}}s Ips typographus L. and Pityogenes chalcographus L. Eight toothed spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) and six toothed spruce bark beetle (Pityogenes chalcographus L.) are most imported pests of mature spruce forests in whole Europe. When the populations are low they usually attack the trees which are weakened by snow, wind, highlight or some other biotic or abiotic factors. When the populations increase higher they can attack and kill living standing trees and-thus become primary pests. Monitoring of populations with pheromone traps is an important tool in integrated forests protection. During {{the last two decades}} the foresters in Croatia mainly use the classic black Theysohn® flight barrier pheromone traps for monitoring of spruce bark beetle populations in spruce forests. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate is there any significant difference in catches between dry and wet flight barrier pheromone traps, is there any possibility that bark beetles can escape from pheromone traps after they fall down in plastic box at the bottom of pheromone traps, and is there any difference in selectivity of compared traps to predator species (Thanasimus formicarius L., Nemozoma elongatum L.). In 2014. a field experiment was set up in spruce stands in two sites, one in higher elevation and one in lower elevation. In each site three black Theysohn® flight barrier pheromone traps using water in collecting box were compared with three traps with dry boxes, for each bark beetle species. The holes on the bottom of collecting boxes on wet traps were sealed with silicone. Also new made holes at the side of collecting boxes were covered with plastic net to stop the loss of captured bark beetles with water overflow. The traps were loaded with pheromone lures – Pheroprax® lure for I. typographus and Chalcoprax® for P. chalcographus. Totally for each species were set up six pairs of dry-wet pheromone traps, three pairs on lower and three pairs on higher elevation. The experiment started 17 th of May and was finalized in the last week of September. The traps were emptied every eight days. The caught beetles were kept in 60 % ethanol until the moment when they were determined and counted. Except the two main bark beetle species, also the predator species T. formicarius and N. elongatum were counted. In total 73. 994 specimens of I. typographus were caught in dry, and 71. 212 specimens in wet traps. In dry traps 214. 950 specimens of P. chalcographus were caught, and 179. 146 specimens in wet traps. There was no significant difference between dry and wet pheromone traps for both bark beetle species. It can be concluded easily that I. typographus and P. chalcographus could not escape from traps after they fall down in collecting box at the bottom of traps, what isn’t case with Tomicus species (Hrašovec & Pernek, unpublished results). In both case bigger number of bark beetles (no statistically significant) were caught in dry traps. The reason may be the production of 1 -hexanol and verbenon in wet traps. More dead bark beetles was found in wet pheromone traps what is logical because after they fall down in plastic hunting box which is full of water they get drown after some time, what is no case with bark beetles in dry pheromone traps. Increasing the number of dead beetles can reduce the efficiency of pheromone traps (Kretschmer, 1990; Bakke et al, 1983). The smell of dead bark beetles significantly reduce the efficiency of pheromone traps, but in the moment it wasn’t known which component were responsible for it. Lower efficiency of pheromone traps is consequence of production 1 -hexanol and verbenon from dead bark beetles (Zhang et al., 2003). Pernek (2006), Pernek & Lacković (2011) had a better monitoring results of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> species (genus Pityokteines) with wet traps compared to dry traps. The classic black Theysohn® traps were used like in this experiment. The reason why the wet pheromone traps had shown a better results in previous research (Pernek, 2006; Pernek & Lacković, 2011) probably is consequence of different factors: biology and pheromone communication, swarming time, weather conditions and different type of stands. All this factor could have a important impact on pheromone trap catches. There is no significant difference in selectivity of compared traps to predators. The dry pheromone traps catch less individuals of T. formicarius L. and more individuals of N. elongatum compared to wet traps. It had been observed the escape possibility of T. formicarius from dry traps. During the analysis of some samples just the eaten bark beetles had been found in dry traps, and there wasn’t any Thanasimus specimens. N. elongatum couldn’t escape from dry traps, and there was some reduction of caught six tooth bark beetles in dry pheromone traps by this predator. The results support the use of both type of traps in monitoring of spruce bark beetle species. Although, dry trap setting in the field, collecting and analyzing of dry catches is much easier...|$|E

U koncept integrirane zaštite šuma sve više se nastoji uvesti ekološki prihvatljive metode zaštite, kakve su primjerice feromonske klopke. U obavljenom istraživanju feromonski pripravak Curviwit®, deklariran kao feromon jelovog krivouzubog potkornjaka Pityokteines curvidens, testiran je u kombinaciji s klopkama Theysohn® i IPM®. Cilj ovog rada bio je dobiti spoznaje o mogućnostima primjene feromonske klopke za ulov jelovih potkornjaka. Rezultati ulova u klopkama ukazuju kako let proljetne generacije P. curvidens ovisi o kretanju srednje dnevne {{temperature}} koja mora postići 10 °C. Rojenje počinje početkom travnja, a glavni let i najveši ulov u klopkama dostignu se krajem travnja i početkom svibnja. Nakon najvećih ulova kukaca sljedi nagli pad, a ulovi nakon tog vrlo su niski i nakon ljetne zamjene feromona. Broj ulovljenih mužjaka u klopkama u početku rojenja višestruko je veći od ženki, ali se pri najvećim ulovima izjednačava na 1 : 1. Because {{of frequent}} {{problems with the}} <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{over the last few}} years in Croatia, the question of their effective control has been raised. Within the concept of integrated protection of the forests attempts to introduce ecologically acceptable methods of protection have increased, such as for example pheromone traps. In the published investigation the pheromone preparation Curviwit, declared as pheromone of the <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Pityokteines curvidens, was tested in combination with Theysohn® and IPM® traps. The aim of this study was to obtain knowledge on the possibilities of applying pheromone traps to catch the <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b> The experiment was set up in several compartments at Litorić (Forestry Office "Vrbovsko", Forest Administration Branch Office "Delnice") for a period of two years (2004 - 2005). In both experimental years two types of traps were used: Theysohn® and IPM®, and in 2005 a modified version of Theysohn was added. In the experiment a pheromone dispenser was used in all traps under the name Curviwit® (Witasek, Feldkirchen, Austria) declared as pheromone of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> P. curvidens, with active components methylbutenol and ipsenol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylen- 2, 7 -oktadien- 4 -ol) and with evaporation ("ratio rate") 1 mg/day at 24 °. In 2004 the pheromone dispenser was placed on 31 st March and replaced with a new one on 31 st June, and in 2005 placed on the 30 th March and replaced on 7 th June. The traps were controlled and emptied every 7 - 8 days. The <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> trapped were conserved in ethanol (50 %) and later analysed in the laboratory. Laboratory analysis included determination of the <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> according to species and sex. The results of the catch in the traps indicate that the flight of the spring generation of P. curvidens depends on the daily temperature, which must reach 10 °C. Swarming begins atthe beginning of April and the main flight and greatest catch in the traps is achieved at the end of April and beginning of May. After the greatest catch of insects there follows a sudden decrease and the catch is later very low after the change of pheromones in the summer. The number of male beetles caught in the traps at the beginning of swarming is several times greater than of the females, although during the greatest catches it becomes equal at 1 : 1. From the two-year investigation of pheromone traps for the <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> the following conclusions can be made: 1. The traps for the <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Pityokteines curvidens germar should be placed at the latest at the beginning of April, because the greatest catch can be expected at the end of April and beginning of May. 2. Of the tested traps in the experiment the best catches were achieved with the modified Theysohn trap. 3. After the sudden decrease in the catches at the end of April or beginning of May pheromone should be removed from the traps in order not to catch undesired insects, particularly useful or rare species. 4. The ratio of the sexes in the traps was initially 3 : 1, and later in the period of the greatest catch it amounted to 1 : 1, which corresponds with the natural ratio of sexes. 5. The investigation should be continued in accordance with the obtained results and comparison of the traps and relevant catch trees...|$|R

40|$|The montane forests (i. e. below about 2900 m altitude) of the Colorado Front Range have {{experienced}} repeated outbreaks of {{western spruce budworm}} (Choristoneura occidentalis) and Douglas <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), both of which locally attack Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The effects were studied of (historically documented) outbreaks of these insects on succession, stand structure, and radial growth of host and non-host species in Rocky Mountain National Park; the most recent budworm (1974 - 85) and <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (1984 -present) outbreaks resulted in the most severe and widespread disturbance of these forests since the late 19 th century. Studies were carried out during 1987 and 1988 in 11 stands representing {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions, and dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir, in order to investigate the responses of stands to repeated outbreaks of these pests. The stands were either old (3 ̆e 250 yr) with relatively open understories or young (yr), dense, even-aged post-fire stands. Cores were taken from some Douglas fir, ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) for dendrochronological analyses. Young, vigorous post-fire stands showed minimal budworm defoliation, and in these stands only remnant trees from the pre-fire generation appeared to be susceptible to beetle-caused mortality. Dense stands exhibited higher budworm-induced mortality, which hastened the natural thinning process and shifted dominance towards the non-host species. The stands most severely disturbed by these insects were multi-storied stands with high host densities and a wide range of stem sizes. The stand response to these disturbances included the growth release of shade-intolerant, seral species, and in some cases, a higher survivorship among mid-sized individuals of Douglas fir. The net result of the combined insect outbreaks is the temporary slowing of the successional trend towards a steady-state Douglas fir forest. Fire suppression, by increasing the density of suppressed Douglas fir, has previously been shown to favour increased outbreak severity of western spruce budworm in the N. Rocky Mountains. However, in the Front Range, recent increases in outbreak severity and their synchroneity may also be the result of large areas of forest, (burned during the late 19 th century during European settlement) simultaneously entering structural stages susceptible to insect outbreak...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This {{study has}} been {{concerned}} with the patterns of vegetative changes which occur during {{the first five years}} following logging and burning on Douglas-fir clear cuts. Knowledge of the successional sequence in the coastal forests of western Oregon is of primary importance to those concerned with the management of this resource. From the more theoretical point of view, there are many unique features associated with this type of vegetation of special interest to the ecologist. Published accounts of studies in Oregon and Washington have been of a generalized nature. None have approached a localized area with the degree of intensity attempted in this study. Due to its close proximity to Oregon State University and the cutting and burning history of the area, the Mary's Peak Watershed has been especially suitable for this study. Mary's Peak is the highest point of the Oregon Coast range having an elevation of 4, 097 feet. The Corvallis watershed is located on the eastern slope of the peak and includes both the Rock Creek and Griffith Creek drainages. The area is about five miles long east and west by four miles north and south. The area is managed as a unit by the United States Forest Service. Due to the marine influence, the area has a humid climate averaging approximately 65 inches of precipitation annually with an annual mean temperature of approximately 52 °F. Soils are basaltic in origin and are primarily clay loam in texture. In 1950, an epidemic of Douglas <b>fir</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> made necessary a program of development which included cutting of dead and infected trees and establishing a road system. Cutting was restricted to small clear cuts. The vegetation in the study area is a Douglas fir-vine maple association. Gaultheria shallon and Berberis nervosa dominate the forest floor with traces of Castanopsis, Corylus, and Cornus. Study plots were located on nine clear cut and burned areas ranging in elevation from 1, 300 to 2, 800 feet and including north, south, and east exposures. Nineteen study plots, which were 100 x 100 feet, were established in uniform vegetative areas. Plots were also established in the undisturbed areas adjacent to the clear cuts for comparative purposes. Vegetative sampling was done using a device called an ocular point frame which provided a reliable indication of vegetative cover. Sampling was done in both the spring and fall on the second, third, fourth, and fifth years following burning. The stable undisturbed vegetation was sampled only once. Results of the five-year study showed a general increase in total number of plant species. The average total vegetative cover rose abruptly the third, fourth, and fifth years. An analysis indicated that south exposed plots had the greatest vegetative cover the first five years after burning. East plots ranked second and north plots third. By the fourth year, average cover values on clear cut areas exceeded the cover values of understory vegetation on the adjacent uncut forest. Analysis of data regarding seasonal variation indicated sharp decreases in total cover from spring to fall during the first three years. Increasing amounts of perennial vegetation during the fourth and fifth years reduced this seasonal variation markedly. In terms of mean cover trends, the annual herb, Senecio sylvaticus, dominated the second year; Lotus stipularis and Circium vulgare, the third; Lotus and Holcus lanatus, the fourth and fifth. All plant species indicated a wide range of cover values on the plots sampled. Some consistent trends in the sequence of cover dominance are noted...|$|R

They also feed on <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba), European larch (Larix decidua), aspen (Populus tremula), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), apple (Malus domestica), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and bogberry (Vaccinium uliginosum). In spring the larvae consume the first buds, then later the needles. A single caterpillar eats about 200 pine, or 1000 spruce needles {{and twice as}} many are damaged by biting off. Spruces die at 70 percent needle loss and pine at 90 percent. There is also a danger also increased of secondary infections by longhorn <b>beetles,</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> fungi or other pathogens.

50|$|Scolytus is a genus of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (subfamily Scolytinae). It {{includes}} several species notorious for destroying {{trees in the}} forests. The Dutch elm disease is spread in North America by two species : the native elm <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Hylurgopinus rufipes, and the European elm <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Scolytus multistriatus. In Europe, while the aforementioned Scolytus multistriatus again acts as vector for infection, it is much less effective than the large elm <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Scolytus scolytus.|$|R
50|$|The adults overwinter at {{the base}} of conifers, rarely of {{deciduous}} trees. They emerge in the spring and fly to lower parts of trees to hunt <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Their common prey are pine <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> Tomicus piniperda and T. minor, and the European spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus. Often they are seen waiting their prey on the bark of fallen pine or spruce trees. Both ant <b>beetles</b> and <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> are attracted to monoterpenes from the damaged areas of the fallen trees. Stacked wood is especially attractive due to the monoterpene volatiles. The ant beetles are also attracted to specific pheromone components of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> therefore they often fall into <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> pheromone traps. The larvae enter the scolytid galleries and feed on the immature stages of the <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> The larvae grow very slowly, spending two years in the larval stage, and pupate in the fall in niches in the outer bark. Adults of T. formicarius live 4 to 10 months.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBark beetles, {{especially}} Dendroctonus species, {{are considered}} to be serious pests of the coniferous forests in North America. <b>Bark</b> <b>beetle</b> forest pests undergo population eruptions, causing region wide economic losses. In order to save forests, finding new and innovative environmentally friendly approaches in wood-boring insect pest management is more important than ever. Several biological control methods have been attempted over time to limit the damage and spreading of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> epidemics. The use of entomopathogenic microorganisms against <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> populations is an attractive alternative tool for many biological control programmes in forestry. However, the effectiveness of these biological control agents is strongly affected by environmental factors, {{as well as by the}} susceptibility of the insect host. <b>Bark</b> <b>beetle</b> susceptibility to entomopathogens varies greatly between species. According to recent literature, <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> are engaged in symbiotic relationships with fungi and bacteria. These types of relationship are very complex and apparently involved in <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> defensive mechanisms against pathogens. The latest scientific discoveries in multipartite symbiosis have unravelled unexpected opportunities in <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> pest management, which are discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} climate change on the spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Model {{simulations}} show that an increased frequency in storms and drought periods may result in more frequent and shorter outbreaks of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Warmer summers can result in two <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> generations per summer instead of one, giving <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> the opportunity to attack forests twice in a single year. By Bjørn Økland, Paal Krokene and Holger Lange In a NORKLIMA project financed by the Research Council of Norway, we have focused on how climate change can affect an important species for Norwegian forestry, namely the spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus). The spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is one of the}} few insects in Norway capable of killing trees in large numbers, and this makes it an important species in both economic and ecological terms. Recurring outbreaks over the last few centuries have had catastrophic effects on forests in Central and Northern Europe. The most recent outbreak in southern Norway in the 1970 s killed forests equivalent to five million cubic meters of lumber, which at the time was worth about 500 million kroner (about 84 million dollars).
