25|$|The Republican base in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and <b>suburbanites</b> in the east. McCain closely matched George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group. However, in 2008, <b>suburbanites</b> in Northern Virginia and in the Richmond/Hampton Roads areas abandoned the Republican Party in droves, and it was simply impossible for McCain to win the state without their support.|$|E
25|$|The uneasy {{existence}} of upper-middle-class <b>suburbanites</b> Agnes and Tobias and their permanent houseguest, Agnes' witty alcoholic sister Claire, is disrupted {{by the sudden}} appearance of lifelong family friends Harry and Edna, fellow empty nesters with free-floating anxiety, who ask to stay with them to escape an unnamed terror. They soon are followed by Agnes and Tobias's bitter 36-year-old daughter Julia, who returns home following the collapse of her fourth marriage.|$|E

25|$|Along {{the edge}} of the city and beyond city limits, several new subdivisions have come to {{fruition}} in only the last few years. South of Antilley Road, these subdivisions mainly use two routes to enter the city, Buffalo Gap Road and US Highway 83/84, where many of these places are located. This surge of residential growth is evidence of both recent outward growth in the city and the desire for open spaces often exhibited by urbanites as well as <b>suburbanites.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, <b>suburbanites</b> saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions. In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} New York, Kemble stood {{out as a}} neatly dressed, muscular Protestant youth, in an urban {{political}} setting that was predominantly Catholic and Jewish. He worked at The New York Times but was fired for refusing to cross a picket line during a typesetters' strike. A leader in the East River chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Kemble helped to organize a non-violent blockade of the Triborough Bridge during rush hour, to raise consciousness among <b>suburbanites</b> {{of the lives of}} Harlem residents. Kemble was a founder of Negotiation Now!, a group which {{called for an end to}} the bombing of North Vietnam and a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam War. He was opposed to a unilateral withdrawal of U.S forces from Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, {{aided by}} the {{construction}} of the Interstate Highway System, many White Americans began leaving industrial cities for new housing in suburbs. The roads served to transport <b>suburbanites</b> to their city jobs, facilitating the development of suburbs, and shifting the tax base away from the city. This may have exacerbated urban decay. In some cases, such as in the Southern United States, local governments used highway road constructions to deliberately divide and isolate black neighborhoods from goods and services, often within industrial corridors. In Birmingham, Alabama, the local government used the highway system to perpetuate the racial residence-boundaries the city established with a 1926 racial zoning law. Constructing interstate highways through majority-black neighborhoods eventually reduced the populations to the poorest proportion of people financially unable to leave their destroyed community.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the major}} {{projects}} the Federal City Council pushed for in the 1960s were Inner Loop highway system and its associated Three Sisters Bridge, and the Washington Metro subway system. The Inner Loop was strongly opposed by local citizens, who felt it was unnecessary, destroyed many neighborhoods, and despoiled the environment. However, Representative William Natcher, chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Appropriations, {{was not only a}} strong advocate of bridge and highway construction but also convinced that construction of the Inner Loop was essential to the growth of the District of Columbia. The Federal City Council, too, advocated the Inner Loop {{as a response to the}} flight of retail and light industry for the suburbs (a trend which began in the 1950s). The organization believed that quick and easy automobile access to the city (with lots of inexpensive parking) would draw shoppers and retailers back. A large subway system was equally important, as the Federal City Council concluded that surface transit alone could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing D.C. metropolitan area. The organization pushed hard for construction of Metro even though Representative Natcher threatened to cancel the subway project if the Inner Loop was not constructed. The organization also wished to ensure that wealthier <b>suburbanites</b> would be able to reach the downtown D.C. shopping district, in the hopes this would reverse or at least stop the flight of retail out of the city.|$|E

Bruce was held for four hours before being released on $5,000 bail. The January 1998 issue of Spin magazine ran a four-page cartoon lampooning Insane Clown Posse and Juggalos, claiming that the group was offensive [...] "not for their obscenity, but for their stupidity". Spin likened Insane Clown Posse's stage act to [...] "a sort of circus karaoke" [...] and portrayed the group's fans as overweight <b>suburbanites.</b> On the group's website, Bruce responded to the article by stating, [...] "I could give a fuck less".|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, Rush Street was {{the center}} of the Chicago nightlife as home to many great cabarets, bars, clubs and restaurants. [...] However, many of the bars {{migrated}} north to Division Street as the street gentrified. [...] Currently, the late night establishments mostly lure <b>suburbanites</b> and tourists. The Chicago Sun-Times describes it as the [...] "hippest strip" [...] in Chicago, with specific kudos to the part between Oak Street and Chicago Avenue. It continues to be the destination where visiting conventioners in pursuit of Chicago nightlife are brought by taxi as well as a preferred place for thirtysomething singles to congregate at night, especially in the summer. Although Rush Street ends two blocks south of Division Street, the nightlife ambiance now continues to Division and spreads west from there.|$|E
500|$|In {{the promotional}} video for the American debut, Bourne {{highlights}} {{the juxtaposition of}} the gothic horror setting and the suburban settings of the adaptation. [...] He also notes that San Francisco {{was a good place}} for the United States debut of the work in part because as a city it exhibits a tolerance {{similar to that of the}} <b>suburbanites</b> in the work. [...] The piece has no spoken words. Like in the film, Edward is equipped with only scissors for hands because his inventor died in the middle of outfitting him. [...] He is discovered in his castle by an Avon lady who brings him into her home. He then wanders into a town where a family takes him in. The theatrical adaptation has a more robust prologue than the film, but the additional backstory does not add content to the character.|$|E
500|$|Ernie C and Ice-T {{conceived}} the album with the dark, ominous tone and Satanic lyrical themes of Black Sabbath in mind. However, Ice-T felt that basing his lyrics in reality would be scarier than the fantasy basis in Black Sabbath's lyrics; the inner artwork depicts {{a man with}} a gun pointed at the viewer's face. Ice-T states, [...] "To us that was the devil [...] what's more scary than [...] some gangster with a gun pointed at you?" [...] Ice-T defined the resulting mix of heavy metal and reality-based lyrics as [...] "a rock album with a rap mentality." [...] The album's musical style is primarily described as speed metal, thrash metal and heavy metal. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that with Body Count, Ice-T [...] "has recognized a kinship between his gangster raps and post-punk, hard-core rock, both of which break taboos to titillate fans. But where rap's core audience is presumably in the inner city, hard-core appeals mostly to <b>suburbanites</b> seeking more gritty thrills than they can get from Nintendo or the local mall." ...|$|E

500|$|District {{residents}} {{protested the}} route cuts with a picket line {{in front of}} WMATA's downtown headquarters in August 1991. Prince George's County residents were also angered by the bus route changes, arguing that Metro had promised more (not less) bus service and complaining {{that they would be}} forced to use a rail station located in the District of Columbia's most violent and crime-prone neighborhood. More than 1,000 people packed [...] "raucous" [...] public hearings for three nights in the District and Prince George's County in early September, denouncing Metro and claiming they were [...] "becoming a victim of transportational apartheid." [...] Worried {{about the impact of the}} cuts as well as a possible bus boycott, D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon announced on September 11, 1991, that she would seek an alternative to the changes proposed by WMATA. Suburban commuters were angry that Metro would keep the bus routes open in Anacostia (at an estimated cost of $4 million) when their bus service had been cut at the time Metrorail stations opened in their areas; D.C. residents countered that poor African American District citizens could ill afford the same transit changes and fare increases that wealthy, white <b>suburbanites</b> were asked to absorb.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968 there was widespread rioting and disorder across the US. The trouble reached Baltimore on April 6, {{and for the next}} three days and nights the city burned. Agnew {{declared a state of emergency}} and called out the National Guard. When order was restored there were six dead, more than 4,000 were under arrest, the fire department had responded to 1,200 fires, and there had been widespread looting. On April 11, Agnew summoned more than 100 moderate black leaders to the state capitol, where instead of the expected constructive dialogue he delivered a speech roundly castigating them for their failure to control more radical elements, and accused them of a cowardly retreat or even complicity. One of the delegates, the Rev. Sidney Daniels, rebuked the governor: [...] "Talk to us like we are ladies and gentlemen", he said, before walking out. Others followed him; the remnant was treated to further accusations as Agnew rejected all socio-economic explanations for the disturbances. Many white <b>suburbanites</b> applauded Agnew's speech: over 90 percent of the 9,000 responses by phone, letter or telegram supported him, and he won tributes from leading Republican conservatives such as Jack Williams, governor of Arizona, and former senator William Knowland of California. To members of the black community the April 11 meeting was a turning point. Having previously welcomed Agnew's stance on civil rights, they now felt betrayed, one state senator observing: [...] "He has sold us out ... he thinks like George Wallace, he talks like George Wallace".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, {{developed}} the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's [...] "Death of a Clown". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, [...] "Autumn Almanac", in early October. Backed with [...] "Mister Pleasant", the single became another Top 5 success for the group. Andy Miller points out that, despite its success, the single marks {{a turning point in}} the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK Top Ten for three years: [...] "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous Davies efforts." [...] Nick Jones of Melody Maker asked, [...] "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey <b>suburbanites</b> going about their fairly unemotional daily business? ... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring." [...] Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song [...] "a load of old rubbish". Dave's second solo single, [...] "Susannah's Still Alive", was released in the UK on 24 November. It sold a modest 59,000 copies, but failed to reach the Top 10. Miller states that [...] "by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion".|$|E

2500|$|Over time, {{the show}} became noticeably darker, with Jonathan {{investigating}} psychopaths, pimps, gangsters and corrupt policemen, {{who stood in}} stark contrast to the duplicitous <b>suburbanites</b> of earlier series; one story even saw Maddy being held at gunpoint by a gang member who was only just disarmed thanks to a card trick Jonathan had picked up recently. The 2009 special contained a hybrid of elements from earlier and later seasons, with the lethal engineering element, somewhat reminiscent of [...] "Mother Redcap", and the torture and murder of a young woman as she is held dangling by a rope in the middle of a room. This theme continued on in [...] "The Judas Tree" [...] with a murderer being killed and her accomplice then being framed for the crime.|$|E

He also sent out last-minute letters from Senator Thurmond telling voters that Turnipseed would disarm the United States, and turn it over to liberals and Communists. At a press briefing, Atwater planted a fake reporter who rose and said, [...] "We understand that Turnipseed has had psychiatric treatment". Atwater later told reporters off of the record that Turnipseed [...] "got hooked up to jumper cables", referring to electroconvulsive therapy that Turnipseed underwent as a teenager.|$|E
