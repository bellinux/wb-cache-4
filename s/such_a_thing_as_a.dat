25|$|In {{cooperation}} with the literary scholar , DAS GEDICHT initiated a widely followed debate on, “Is there <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> European poem?” Alongside translations from English, Spanish, or Classical Greek authors, the magazine regularly features German-language poetry from outside Germany, such as Austrian, Swiss, and Luxembourgian poetry. DAS GEDICHT has also often been the root of productive altercations among aesthetic positions and has facilitated debate among poets. Looking at the question – short poem or long poem – many prominent German poets engaged in critical exchange {{within the realm of}} the magazine: Durs Grünbein, , and Jürgen Becker. The critic and member of the Group 47, , dedicated a larger portion of his radio broadcast, in order to give this debate a national audience.|$|E
500|$|Conduct {{books have}} {{traditionally}} been viewed by scholars as an integral factor {{in the creation of}} a bourgeois sense of self. The conduct book [...] "helped to generate the belief that there was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'". By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners. However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called [...] "the angel in the house" [...] image (alluding to Coventry Patmore's poem of that name). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Sheryl Crow {{received}} general acclaim {{from most}} music critics. Eric Weisbard of Spin praised the album's production, {{stating that the}} record [...] "goes much further" [...] than its predecessor and that its [...] "bigger beats and dirtier guitar/keyboard effects [...] well with Crow's literate hippie-chick persona". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros, commenting: [...] "If there's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> professional lo-fi album, Sheryl Crow is it." [...] He also noted Crow's louder and more assured singing, concluding that she [...] "doesn't expose that much of herself [...] she's an emotional centrist. But at the very least, she's building a bridge to a lasting career". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J.D. Considine praised Crow's vocals, especially on [...] "If It Makes You Happy", which he felt was probably the album's best song.|$|E

500|$|Lurie {{argued that}} Taft {{did not receive}} the public credit for his {{policies}} that he should have. Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt (although the lawsuits received much publicity). Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good" [...] trust. This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft [...] "was boring—honest, likable, but boring". Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being [...] "one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents... a {{chief justice of the}} United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub," [...] a story that, despite Taft's fondness for bathtubs, is not true. Taft similarly remains known for another physical characteristic—as the last president with facial hair to date.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask {{what we can do to}} help." ...|$|E

2500|$|The main crisis {{came when}} a German u-boat sank the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915. International law {{required}} a warning so that {{passengers and crew}} could board life boats. [...] No warning was issued and the ship sank in 18 minutes, with a thousand deaths including over 100 Americans. Wilson said, [...] "There is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man being too proud to fight. There is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation being so right {{that it does not}} need to convince others by force that it is right". Many reacted to these remarks with contempt. Wilson protested to Berlin but its reply was evasive. Secretary of State Bryan, strongly opposed to war, resigned, and was replaced by Robert Lansing. The White Star liner the SS Arabic was then torpedoed, with two American casualties. Wilson threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action; Germany then gave a written promise: [...] "liners will not be sunk by our submarines". Wilson had won a promise that merchant ships would not be sunk without warning; and most importantly he had kept the U.S. out of the war. Meanwhile, Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500,000 troops. It also included a five-year Navy plan for major construction of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines—showing Wilson's dedication to a big Navy.|$|E
