60|$|Instantly Jenny Wren popped {{her head}} out of her doorway. <b>She</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side to listen, then looked down at Peter, and her sharp little eyes snapped.|$|E
60|$|So another donkey was procured, {{this time}} with a man's saddle, and putting her foot in the stirrup, <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> leg over and took her seat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be {{reckoned}} among Liza's faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.|$|E
60|$|The queer things my aunt {{said were}} {{nothing to the}} queer things she didn't say. I {{remember}} her in our drawing-room one day, and how <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye--it's the only expression--at the India-rubber plant in a Doulton-ware pot which Marion had placed {{on the corner of}} the piano.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems," [...] {{said the}} Earl of Derby, [...] "that old England {{who takes a}} frolicsome brain-fever once {{every two or three}} years, for the benefit of her doctors, and the {{purification}} of the torpid lethargy brought on by peace and prosperity, is now gone stark staring mad on the subject of a real or supposed Popish plot. I read one programme on the subject, by a fellow called Oates, and thought it the most absurd foolery I ever perused. But that cunning fellow Shaftesbury, and some others amongst the great ones, having taken it up, and are driving on at such a rate as makes harness crack, and horses smoke for it. The King, who has sworn never to kiss the pillow his father went to sleep on, temporises, and gives way to the current; the Duke of York, suspected and hated on account of his religion, is about to be driven to the continent; several principal Catholic nobles are in the Tower already; and the nation, like a bull at Tutbury-running, is persecuted with so many inflammatory rumours and pestilent pamphlets, that <b>she</b> has <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail, flung up her heels, taken the bit betwixt her teeth and is as furiously unmanageable as in the year 1642." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old lady}} rose, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> black eyebrows and her silver crest at us for an instant.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} eyes very wide and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, looking at him with indescribable archness.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the black}} furrow {{of a field}} [...] I saw an old witch-hare this night; [...] And <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> lissome ear, [...] And she eyed the moon so bright, [...] And she nibbled o' the green; [...] And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,' [...] Away like a ghostie o'er the field [...] She fled, and left the {{moonlight}} there.|$|E
6000|$|As a {{confession}} of Zo's first love, this was irresistible. Carmina burst out laughing. Zo indignantly claimed a hearing. [...] "I haven't done yet!" [...] she burst out. [...] "The boy dances. Like this." [...] <b>She</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head, and slapped her thigh, and imitated the boy. [...] "And sometimes he sings!" [...] she cried with another outburst of admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes--but I don't keer for that." [...] <b>She</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> hat {{a little}} audaciously, but Brice noticed that her arms {{afterwards}} dropped {{at her side}} with the same weary gesture he had observed before. [...] "Whenever I go into shops it's always 'Yes, miss,' and 'No, miss,' and 'Certainly, Miss Dimwood.' Oh, they're mighty respectful. I reckon they allow that Snapshot Harry's rifle carries far." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail {{up in that}} saucy way of {{hers and}} winked at Johnny Chuck. [...] "The way he can fly," [...] said she softly.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's this?" [...] cried Mrs. Tuke, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> head on one side. [...] "Music! A mandoline! How extraordinary! Do {{you think}} it's a serenade?--" [...] And {{she lifted her}} brows archly.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Minnow <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head: [...] "Mister Picklepip," [...] she said, [...] "Do {{you ever}} think to wed?" [...] Town of Dae by the sea, [...] No fair lady ever made a [...] Wicked speech like that to me! ...|$|R
60|$|Down in {{his little}} tunnels {{underneath}} the snow Danny Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen Danny. But old Granny Fox knew all about those little tunnels, and she didn't waste any time digging at the doorways. Instead <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> sharp little ears and listened with all her might. Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny Meadow Mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow.|$|E
60|$|Observing {{me sitting}} there, they lowered their voices. Evidently {{she wanted him}} to put the brick down and leave her to think. She was not quite sure where she would have it. He, on the other hand, was sure he had found the right place for it. He pointed it out to her and {{explained}} his views. Other birds quarrel a good deal during nest building, but swallows are the gentlest of little people. She let him put it where he wanted to, and he kissed her and ran out. <b>She</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye after him, watched till he was out of sight, then deftly and quickly slipped it out and fixed it {{the other side of the}} door.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan read aright {{the anguish}} and the {{suffering}} of the huge mother cat. He had been minded to bait her. It was to do this that he had sneaked silently through the trees until he had come almost above her, but something held the ape-man as he saw the lioness grieving over her dead cub. With the acquisition of Go-bu-balu, Tarzan had come to realize the responsibilities and sorrows of parentage, without its joys. His heart went out to Sabor as it might not have done a few weeks before. As he watched her, there rose quite unbidden before him a vision of Momaya, the skewer through the septum of her nose, her pendulous under lip sagging beneath the weight which dragged it down. Tarzan saw not her unloveliness; he saw only the same anguish that was Sabor's, and he winced. That strange functioning of the mind which sometimes is called association of ideas snapped Teeka and Gazan before the ape-man's mental vision. What if one should come and take Gazan from Teeka. Tarzan uttered a low and ominous growl as though Gazan were his own. Go-bu-balu glanced here and there apprehensively, thinking that Tarzan had espied an enemy. Sabor sprang suddenly to her feet, her yellow-green eyes blazing, her tail lashing as <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> ears, and raising her muzzle, sniffed the air for possible danger. The two little cubs, which had been playing, scampered quickly to her, and standing beneath her, peered out from between her forelegs, their big ears upstanding, their little heads cocked first upon one side and then upon the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's a great secret, but Maura {{told me in}} the cloakroom. It {{is because}} Mr. Frank wants to be her---to be her---her admirer,' said Valetta, <b>cocking</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, and adding to the already crimson colour of her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|The mare {{had raised}} <b>her</b> head and <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> ears at the {{rustling}} of a quail in the thicket. Chris {{leaned over and}} rubbed around her ears. Dolly's enjoyment was evident, and she drooped her head over against the shoulder of his own horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I'm {{an old man}} now I'd {{change his}} tune for him. I'd take the stick to his back and beat him while I could stand over him--as I done many a time before. The mother, you know, <b>she</b> <b>cocks</b> him up with this and that...." ...|$|R
5000|$|Camille O'Sullivan {{arrived on}} the Pet Sounds Stage in a kimono and a trilby and {{stripped}} down to a saucy dress and Wizard of Oz style sequined stilettos for [...] "In These Shoes", which she performed {{in an array of}} pin-up poses. She miowed and purred her way through the set, crawling onto the speaker to fondle security. A burlesque show of epic proportions, Camille ended up stripping down to just a sexy corset and fishnets teamed with a pair of wellies in true festival fashion. Her band, complete with a mini brass section, were the perfect accompaniment to the sultry singer, following her lead throughout. In a final number <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> tail and flaunted her sexy curves, winking at lucky audience members and ignoring the [...] "get them off you"s from one eager gentleman in the crowd. She gave a final thank you to her obliging band, before leaving a stunned and delighted crowd clutching a bottle of wine in one hand and her dress in the other.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the black}} furrow {{of a field}} [...] I saw an old witch-hare this night; And <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> a lissome ear, [...] And she eyed the moon so bright, And she nibbled of the green; [...] And I whispered [...] "Wh-s-st! witch-hare," [...] Away like a ghostie o'er the field [...] She fled, and left the {{moonlight}} there.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>cocked</b> {{only one}} hammer, {{and she did}} it so gently {{that it did not}} frighten the rabbit, {{although}} he flirted his ears a little when he heard the [...] "click, click!" [...] Everything was so quiet that he probably thought he heard some insect, probably a young or ignorant cricket that {{did not know how to}} chirp properly.|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> pert little head on one side, and her sharp little eyes snapped. [...] "Why don't {{you learn}} to swim, Peter, like your cousin down in the Sunny South?" [...] she demanded. [...] "If {{he had been in}} your place, he would simply have plunged into the Smiling Pool and laughed at Reddy Fox." ...|$|R

40|$|Before long Sally Senior will <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> {{mortar board}} over her newly waved tresses, trip nonchalantly across the platform, receive a diploma with almost eager hands, and {{walk back to}} her seat as Sarah Alum. Graduation gifts she really likes will do much toward making the jump from Sally to Sarah seem the momentous and joyous {{occasion}} it really should be...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, [...] "even I have a derringer--a very little one, you know, which I carry in my {{reticule}}. Captain Richards {{gave it to}} me." [...] She opened her reticule and showed a pretty ivory-handled pistol. The look of joyful surprise which came into his face changed quickly as <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> it and lifted it into the air. He seized her arm quickly.|$|R
6000|$|It was not {{the wind}} at her back, it was the thrust of Bjornstam's scorn which carried her through town. She faced Juanita Haydock, <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> head at Maud Dyer's brief nod, and came home to Bea radiant. She telephoned Vida Sherwin to [...] "run over this evening." [...] She lustily played Tschaikowsky--the virile chords an echo of the red {{laughing}} philosopher of the tar-paper shack.|$|R
60|$|He heard lively {{voices from}} the library above. He entered a room to be lived in and be happy in, with a jolly fire on the hearth and {{friendly}} people on a big, brown davenport. Ruth Winslow smiled at him from behind the Colonial silver and thin cups on the tea-table, and as he saw her light-filled eyes, saw <b>her</b> <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> head gaily in welcome, he was again convinced {{that he had found}} a playmate.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} they came to Skalaholt, {{and there was the}} body buried, and the next after they set out for home. Finnward's heart was heavy, and his mind divided. He feared the dead wife and the living; he feared dishonour and he feared dispeace; and his will was like a sea-gull in the wind. Now he cleared his throat and made as if to speak; and at that Aud <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> eye and looked at the goodman mocking, and his voice died unborn. At the last, shame gave him courage.|$|R
40|$|Dores McCree {{made your}} day {{a little better}} {{whenever}} she walked into a room. When you talked with her, you knew her goal was simply to enjoy your company, not to {{get something out of}} you, and not to show herself off. She was good at talking and good at listening. She 2 ̆ 7 d <b>cock</b> <b>her</b> head slightly and ask questions to which she really cared about the answers. On more than one occasion, I had to jockey with others to be able to sit with her at a dinner...|$|R
6000|$|Rosamond <b>cocked</b> up <b>her</b> left eyebrow with an ineffably droll look, which {{encouraged}} Charlie to say, [...] "Such fierceness {{can only}} be prompted by personal experience. Look out, Rosamond!" ...|$|R
50|$|Anna LaCazio (born January 26, 1962) is an American vocalist, {{best known}} {{as a member of the}} American pop rock band <b>Cock</b> Robin. <b>Her</b> father was Italian and her mother Chinese.|$|R
60|$|That Softswan was {{not free}} from alarm was pretty {{evident from the}} {{peculiar}} curl of her pretty eyebrows, but that the sounds did not unnerve her was also obvious from the quiet though prompt way in which she gathered up all the loaded firearms, and bore them swiftly to the breastwork {{in front of the}} cabin. Arranging the guns in a row at her side, so as to be handy, the girl selected one, laid it on the parapet, and carefully examined the priming. Having satisfied herself that it was all right, <b>she</b> <b>cocked</b> the piece, and quietly awaited the issue of events.|$|R
60|$|These {{directions}} {{made the}} innkeeper's wife very uneasy. However, she said nothing, {{and began to}} roast the <b>cock,</b> while <b>her</b> husband {{did his best to}} make the man sleepy with wine, but all in vain.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{retained}} <b>her</b> hold, <b>cocked</b> <b>her</b> weapon, {{and stepped}} back a pace from the door. The blue sleeve {{was followed by the}} rest of the overcoat, and a blue cap with the infantry blazoning, and the letter H on its peak. They were for the moment more distinguishable than the man beneath them--grimed and blackened with the slime of the Marsh. But what could be seen of his mud-stained face was more grotesque than terrifying. A combination of weakness and audacity, insinuation and timidity struggled through the dirt for expression. His small blue eyes were not ill-natured, and even the intruding arm trembled more from exhaustion than passion.|$|R
60|$|And {{each has}} a little baby bird {{swimming}} behind it. Oh! there: the mother has <b>cocked</b> up <b>her</b> tail and dived, and the little one is swimming about looking for her! How it cries! It is afraid of the yacht.|$|R
