5|$|Bournemouth is {{a tourist}} and {{regional}} centre for leisure, entertainment, culture and recreation. Local author and former mayor, Keith Rawlings, suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture {{due to its}} large university population and many language school students. In recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. In a 2007 survey by First Direct, Bournemouth {{was found to be}} the happiest place in the UK, with 82% of people questioned <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> happy with their lives.|$|E
5|$|He and {{the chief}} {{railroad}} inspector scoured the city, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, {{and in fact the}} employee they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army, and determined the sizes of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending US invasion.|$|E

5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Being {{popular in}} Australia with players {{as well as}} the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936. He was on the point of {{accepting}} a permanent appointment with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–48) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one famous occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen's Hall. Following an afternoon performance of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, the hall was destroyed during a night-time incendiary raid.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association {{reported}} that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, {{had formed a}} coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E

Some say the lilacs were planted there because Wilson’s wife was congratulating him on the job of station agent, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there to cover {{the smell of the}} outhouses outside of the train station, some <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given as a gift, others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> planted to remind her of her native Britain.

5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court hearing {{took place}} on 11 February 2008 – only {{two days before the}} series was due to premiere. The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP {{subpoena}} to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes, as well as outlines and story lines, to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10am on that date. The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes, <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> incomplete and that the network's lawyers were closely supervising production. However, it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously. The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer. At the hearing, which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court, Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial. Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed. The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria, but the offer was rejected by Justice King. It was initially planned that an alternative program, Underbelly: A Special Announcement, discussing {{the subject matter of the}} series, would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere. This idea was scrapped, and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead. The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision, and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options.|$|E
