5000|$|During 2000-2006, {{commercial}} fishing {{was one of}} the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with an average annual fatality rate of 115 deaths per 100,000 fishermen. Falling overboard specifically killed 182 fishermen in the period between 2000 and 2010. This fatality rate is 3 times that of the next most dangerous job in the U.S. and more than 25 times that of the national average across all workers. Also, between the years of 1919 and 2005, 4111 fishermen died in fishing related accidents in the United Kingdom industry alone. [...] These deaths are generally a result of a combination of severe weather conditions, extreme fatigue because any one fisherman usually puts in a 21-hour shift, and dangerous equipment. The U.S. Coast Guard has primary jurisdiction over the safety of the U.S. {{commercial fishing}} fleet, enforcing regulations of the U.S. Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (CFIVSA). CFIVSA regulations focus primarily on saving lives after the loss of a vessel and not on preventing vessels from capsizing or sinking, falls overboard, or injuries on deck. CFIVSA regulations require that commercial fishing vessels carry various equipment (e.g., life rafts, radio beacons, and immersion suits) depending on the size of the vessel and the area in which it operates. Not all commercial fishermen follow safety regulations and advice. One study of Maine fishermen found that less than 25% of the fishermen interviewed had recent training in first aid or CPR, only 75% of the boats had survival suits and only 36% had a survival craft. Even the ships that did have the necessary equipment did not consistently have a captain that fully understood how to use the safety equipment.Common causes of fishing-related deaths include vessel disasters, falls overboard, and onboard injuries. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Commercial Fishing Incident Database found that between 2000 and 2010, most vessel disasters often were initiated by flooding, vessel instability, and large waves, and that severe weather conditions contributed to a majority of fatal vessel disasters. Most falls overboard went unwitnessed, and in none of the cases documented was the victim wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). [...] Onboard injuries often result when a crew member is caught in a line and pulled into a winch on deck. The installation of a readily accessible emergency <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> on the winch can potentially prevent these kinds of injuries.|$|E

Specialized geriatric units {{are supposed to}} {{pay particular attention to}} prescribing appropriateness and to promoting a higher prescribing quality. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the reality of such assessment and optimization in real life (usual care) in a population of elderly individuals admitted to a geriatric unit. Method: This is an observational study including all older patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit over a 6 -month period. As part of usual care, the geriatrician is supposed to detect potentially inappropriate medication and potential prescribing omission using validated tools. The primary outcome was the prevalence rate of therapeutic modifications motivated by treatment optimization (<b>stop,</b> <b>switch,</b> or introduction). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with therapeutic discontinuation. Results: A total of 216 patients were included. The mean age was 85. 7 years. Included patients had an average of 7. 2 ± 3. 3 drugs at admission and 5. 8 ± 2. 7 at discharge. IP was highly prevalent in our study where about 63 % of the patients had experienced at least one modification because of overuse. The most commonly discontinued medications were drugs used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease and serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. The most commonly introduced medications were analgesics and warfarin. By using multivariate analysis, we found that patient age and number of drugs on admission were significantly associated with medication discontinuation during hospital stay. Conclusion: In this real-life study of all patients admitted to a Geriatric Post Emergency Unit, 83 % of the patients had a treatment modification during hospital stay. The most original result of our study is the clear reduction in polypharmacy during hospitalization. Keywords: elderly, inappropriate prescriptions, geriatric unit, overuse, misuse, underus...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea about}} the CyberBike came to Jens G. Balchen - {{the founder of the}} Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU - in the 1980 's. He wanted to make an {{unmanned}} autonomus bicycle, i. e. a bike that could run by itself. The idea was picked up by Amund Skavhaug, who started the CyberBike project in the late 80 's. After being deffered for some years, the CyberBike has again gained some attention. This master's thesis is based on Hans Olav Loftum's and Lasse Bjermeland's theses at the spring 2006 and the autumn project of John A. Fossum the same year. The goal of the CyberBike project is to make the bike work as intended, i. e. as an autonomous unmanned bicycle. This thesis naturally share this goal, although the bike did not become able to take its first autonomous trip within the thesis' time frame. At the start of the work, the bike were already equipped with a suitcase of computational hardware on its baggage rack, a small QNX Neutrino OS image was installed on the industrial PC mounted in the suitcase, and drivers for the installed motors, tachometers and potmeters were written. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was intended to supply the control system with the necessary information about rotation, acceleration and position, and the unit was purchased for the purpose. Also a driver was written, but not properly tested. The IMU had to be installed and connected to the control system. The bike's control theory was developed, but had never been put into action outside computer simulations (due to the lack of acceleration measurements). The various tasks that had to be addressed emerged as the development process advanced. First, the IMU had to be connected to the system, by making a signal tranceiver circuit. A small printed circuit board was designed and laid out, mainly to include a MAX 233 CPP iC. Then the DB- 9 serial connector on the bikes single board computer (Wafer- 9371 A) could be used to read the UART signal from the IMU as RS- 232. Then some testing had to be done, and drivers updated. A better and more advanced IMU (referred to as the "MTi") was added to the project. This unit needed no signal converting circuitry, but driver development and testing still had to be done. To enhance the CyberBike's navigation opportunities, a GPS module was purchased. A signal transceiving circuit, similar to the one for the IMU, was made for this unit, as well as software to read out the measurements from the device. By the end of this thesis, no navigational algorithms are made, hence the GPS is currently not used, but available for future efforts made on this area. Some hardware related tasks was carried out, as connecting and implementing functionality to the pendulum limit switches, installation of a emergency <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> and a power switch, purchasing and installation of two 12 V batteries and a cooling fan. An operating system upgrade resulted in replacing the CyberBikePC's storage device, a compact flash card, with a mobile hard disk drive. Installation of a motor, for supplying torque to the rear wheel, included setup and tuning of a hardware based velocity controller in a Baldor TFM 060 - 06 - 01 - 3 servo module. However; this task is not to be considered as accomplished, due to some unsolved problems on the system I/O-card's output channels giving the motor controller card its reference voltage. A bike model and controller realized in Simulink was made by Bjermeland. Hence communicaton between Simulink and the device drivers had to be established, and this was realized by using S-functions and Real-Time Workshop. Finally the controller could be connected to the actual bike, but there was too little time left to explore this thoroughly, and make the system work properly. However, a foundation is laid for further development of the control strategy, hopefully storing a bright future for the CyberBike. </p...|$|E

25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur {{takes a lot of}} programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined the safety of a driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor.

40|$|Being {{able to stop}} (or inhibit) {{an action}} rapidly as in a stop-signal task is an {{essential}} human ability. Previous studies showed that when a pre-stimulus cue warned of the possible need to stop a response in an upcoming trial, participants’ response time (RT) increased if the subsequent trial required a go response (i. e., go RT cost) relative to a trial where this uncertainty was not present. This increase of the go RT correlated with more efficient response stopping. However, it remains a question whether foreknowledge of upcoming inhibition trials given prior to the task is sufficient to modulate neural activity associated with the primary go responses irrespective of whether stopping an overt response is required. We presented three task conditions with identical primary (i. e., go) response trials but without pre-stimulus cues. Participants were informed that Condition 1 had only go trials (All-go condition), Condition 2 required a stop response for some trials (Stop condition), and Condition 3 required a response incongruent with the primary response (i. e., Switch response) for some trials (Switch condition). Participants performed the tasks during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) scans. Results showed {{a significant increase in the}} go RT (cost) in the <b>Stop</b> and <b>Switch</b> conditions relative to the All-go condition. The go RT cost was correlated with decreased inhibition time. fMRI activation in the frontal-basal-ganglia regions during the go responses in the <b>Stop</b> and <b>Switch</b> conditions was also correlated with the efficiency of <b>Stop</b> and <b>Switch</b> responses.
