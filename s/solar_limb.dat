40|$|We {{present a}} study of solar flares that do not produce {{disturbances}} in the low terrestrial ionosphere, detectable in very low frequency (VLF) low ionosphere propagation as sudden phase advances (SPA). We selected only flares with larger optical H-alpha importance (equal or larger than 1), occurred near the cycle 22 solar maximum (19871989), at times when VLF data were available for long-distance propagation paths entirely illuminated by the Sun. For the 463 optical solar flares selected, we found that 18. 8 % had no measurable effects on the lower ionosphere. Inversely, all measured SPAs did have a solar counterpart, optical (such a subflare) and/or X-ray fluxes. Among the H-alpha flares that do not produce measurable disturbances in the low terrestrial ionosphere, there is a surprising selection for events occurred at the <b>solar</b> <b>limbs.</b> On the other hand, the X-ray flux for the H-alpha flares selected, obtained from GOES for the bands 0. 5 - 4 Angstrom and 1 - 8 Angstrom exhibited a rather scattered correlation with the SPAs amplitudes. GOES X-rays fluxes for H-alpha flares not producing SPAs extend over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. These results may suggest real physical distinctions between events. Possible explanations suggest {{the existence of a}} directional trend for the soft X-ray produced in flares possibly combined with the blockage of ionizing X rays behind the <b>solar</b> <b>limbs...</b>|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for measuring solar photospheric and subphotospheric rotation rates is described. The technique utilizes the standing-wave {{nature of the}} nonradial p-mode oscillations of the whole sun. Specifically, the technique {{is based upon the}} observed concentration of p-mode oscillatory power into well defined ridges in two-dimensional wavenumber-frequency power spectra. The frequencies of the ridges in the eastward- and westward-traveling portions of an individual spectrum are systematically shifted in opposite directions by a drift of the standing-wave pattern across the observing field of view. The magnitudes of these frequency shifts are related to the drift velocity and to the horizontal wavenumber {{in such a way that}} measurement of the observed frequency shifts in a spectrum yields the drift velocity for that observing run. By guiding on the <b>solar</b> <b>limbs</b> and observing the velocity field at disk center, the observed drift velocity obtained in this way is exactly the rotational velocity of the solar p-mode pattern, and of the solar gas itself...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{modeling}} the solar chromosphere is developed, based on submillimeter continuum {{observations of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>limb.</b> Submillimeter radiation from the <b>solar</b> <b>limb</b> emanates from the chromosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, making it an important chromospheric diagnostic.

40|$|Mapping {{observations}} of the Sun at millimeter wavelengths were made on 16 to 22 July 1984 with the 45 -m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. Seven 36 -GHz (8. 3 -mm) maps and five 98 -GHz (3. 1 -mm) maps were taken with half-power beam widths of 46 arc sec and 17 arc sec, respectively. Instead of the conventional rastering technique, a radial-scan method was adopted in which every scan passes through the disk center. Accordingly, the variation of the atmosphere attenuation due {{to changes in the}} weather conditions can be easily estimated and removed by using the brightness values at the disk center as calibration data. Also, the pointing errors of the telescope due to the high-speed scans can be corrected by using the <b>solar</b> <b>limbs</b> as position references.

The spectrograph slit was oriented parallel to the <b>solar</b> <b>limb</b> to minimize scattered photospheric light into the spectrograph for spectra taken above the limb. The image stabilizer was used to accurately step the <b>solar</b> <b>limb</b> in 0. 149 arcsecond increments across the 0. 5 arcsecond slit. Although the image stabilizer canceled image motion in the axis parallel to the <b>solar</b> <b>limb,</b> seeing still distorted and degraded the limb image. Scan sequences were taken at the solar south polar limb to avoid possible active regions in the mid-latitudes. Frame selection techniques were used to construct spectroheliogram images from the best seeing spectral frames resulting in 2 -D images approaching 1 arcsecond resolution. Continuum images were subtracted from CO line center grams resulting in images that clearly show both bright and dark structures in the CO that extend into the above-limb emission.

Combined ultraviolet and white-light images of the lower corona reveal that in an initial CME lateral "expansion phase," the EUV disturbance tracks the laterally expanding flanks of the CME, both moving parallel to the solar surface with speeds of ~ 450 km s^(– 1). When the lateral expansion of the ejecta ceases, the EUV disturbance carries on propagating parallel to the solar surface but devolves rapidly into a less coherent structure. Multi-point tracking of the CME leading edge and the effects of the launched compression waves (e. g., pushed streamers) give anti-sunward speeds that initially exceed 900 km s^(– 1) at all measured position angles. We combine our analysis of ultraviolet and white-light images with a comprehensive study of the velocity dispersion of energetic particles measured in situ by particle detectors located at STEREO-A (STA) and first Lagrange point (L 1), to demonstrate that the delayed solar particle release times at STA and L 1 are consistent with the time required (30 - 40 minutes) for the CME to perturb the corona over a wide range of longitudes.

The main properties of each model are shown. The predicted limb shape as a function of wavelength for different features on the solar disk, such as quiet Sun, sunspots, and faculae, is investigated. These models provide overall consistent limb shapes with some discrepancies that are discussed here in terms of differences in solar atmosphere models, opacities, and the algorithms used to derive the <b>solar</b> <b>limb</b> profile. Our analysis confirms that the most common property of all models is limb shapes that are much steeper than what is observed, or predicted by the available empirical models. Furthermore, we have investigated the role of the Fraunhofer lines within the spectral domain used for the <b>solar</b> <b>limb</b> measurements. Our results show that the presence of the Fraunhofer lines significantly displaces the limb inflection point from its position estimated assuming only the photospheric continuum.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that boundary conditions for <b>solar</b> wind/lunar <b>limb</b> interactions are active. The 'whole-moon' limb does not evoke a shock cone because warm solar wind electrons are replaced by cool photoelectrons that are ejected from the generally smooth areas of the lunar terminator illuminated at glancing angles by the sun. A localized volume of low thermal pressure is created in the solar wind by these cool photoelectrons. The solar wind expands into this volume without shock production. Directly illuminated highland areas exchange hot photoelectrons for warm solar wind electrons. The hot electrons generate a localized pressure increase in the adjacent solar wind flow which evokes a shock streamer in the solar wind. Shock streamers are identifiable by a coincident increase in {{the magnitude of the}} solar wind magnetic field. Shock occurrence is controlled by lunar topography, solar activity in the hard ultraviolet, solar wind electron density and thermal velocity, and the density of the solar wind magnetic field...|$|R
