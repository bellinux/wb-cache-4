5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom <b>Sensor</b> <b>System</b> (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the <b>sensor</b> <b>system.</b> That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E

40|$|To improve cow {{management}} in large dairy herds, sensors {{have been developed}} that can measure physiological, behavioral, and production indicators on individual cows. Recently, the number of dairy farms using <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> has increased. It is not known, however, to what extent <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are used on dairy farms, and the reasons why farmers invest or not in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are unclear. The first objective {{of this study was}} to give an overview of the <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> currently used in the Netherlands. The second objective was to investigate the reasons for investing or not investing in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> The third objective was to characterize farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> A survey was developed to investigate first, the reasons for investing or not in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> and, then, how the <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are used in daily cow management. The survey was sent to 1, 672 Dutch dairy farmers. The final data set consisted of 512 dairy farms (response rate of 30. 6 %); 202 farms indicated that they had <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> and 310 farms indicated that they did not have <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> A wide variety of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was used on Dutch dairy farms; those for mastitis detection and estrus detection were the most-used <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> The use of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was different for farms using an automatic milking system (AMS) and a conventional milking system (CMS). Reasons for investing were different for different <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> For <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> attached to the AMS, the farmers made no conscious decision to invest: they answered that the sensors were standard in the AMS or were bought for reduced cost with the AMS. The main reasons for investing in estrus detection <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> were improving detection rates, gaining insights into the fertility level of the herd, improving profitability of the farm, and reducing labor. Main reasons for not investing in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> were economically related. It was very difficult to characterize farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Farms with CMS and <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> had more cows than CMS farms without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, farms with <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> had fewer labor hours per cow compared with farms without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Other farm characteristics (age of the farmer, availability of a successor, growth in herd size, milk production per cow, number of cows per hectare, and milk production per hectare) did not differ for farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of investment in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> on productivity change, using farm accounting data. Farm accounting data for the years 2008 – 2013 was available for 217 Dutch dairy farms. In addition, information was available on the adoption of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> on these farms. For each farm, 5 input variables (number of dairy cows, number of hectares, total capital costs, total variable costs, and total labor costs) and 1 output variable (total revenues) were defined for each year. The Malmquist Total Factor Productivity index was used to examine productivity change for three categories of farms: farms without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems,</b> farms with <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> at an automatic milking system, and farms with <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> at a conventional milking system. The Malmquist index measures how the productivity of an individual farm changes over time and enables the contributions of technical change and technical efficiency change to be identified. Productivity did not change after investment in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> on dairy farms. Furthermore, no technical change was found after investment in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems,</b> suggesting that the potential technological improvement claimed by producers of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> does not materialize on dairy farms. Providing more information and guidance on how to use the output of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> might improve the technical performance of the farms...|$|R

This paper discusses the motivation towards the development of high temperature, smart wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> that include <b>sensors,</b> electronics, wireless communication, and power.
