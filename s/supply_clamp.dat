40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD power supply clamps are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD power supply clamps that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the clamping element since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD power <b>supply</b> <b>clamp</b> should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the collector to base junction diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as clamping elements will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four power supply ESD clamps are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main clamping element. Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD power <b>supply</b> <b>clamp</b> architectures are proposed: standalone ESD power supply clamps and hybrid ESD power supply clamps. Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD protection. The hybrid clamp architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply rails, a static clamp, and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD power <b>supply</b> <b>clamp</b> with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD power <b>supply</b> <b>clamp</b> with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} clamp circuits. A 1959 manual {{describes}} {{a technique called}} [...] "saturation clamping". [...] In that scheme, there is a saturation <b>clamp</b> <b>supply</b> at about 2 volts connected to the collector with a saturation clamp diode. When the transistor nears saturation, the clamp diode turns on and supplies the extra collector current to keep the transistor from saturating. The saturation <b>clamp</b> <b>supply</b> needs to supply substantial current. In contrast, the Baker clamp reduces the transistor base current rather than supplying more collector current.|$|R
40|$|The innervations of haptors in four monogenean fish parasites {{were studied}} using the enzymatic technique, the acetylthiocholin iodide for choline esterases. The innervations of the clamps in Gastrocotyle trachuri is curious since the 15 or so anteriormost <b>clamps</b> are <b>supplied</b> from the clamp-side lateral nerve trunk or cord and the 10 or so posteriormost clamps are innervated {{from the main}} haptoral nerve. After the fusion of the two main haptoral nerves, two {{distinct}} nerve arise to supply marginal II in addition to marginal I and pair of small hamuli. The innervation of haptor of Microcotyle donovani consists of the usual two pre-haptoral ganglia which give rise to 2 main haptoral nerves; from each one a separate nerve arises to <b>supply</b> a <b>clamp.</b> From {{each side of the}} pre-haptoral ganglia, two thin nerves arise one at side of each main haptoral nerve. After supplying the two rows of the clamps the 2 haptoral nerves fuse together and after their fusion, fine nerves arise possibly to supply the hamuli and 2 pairs of marginal hooks. The innervations of the haptor of Axine belones appears to be unusual; the pre-haptoral ganglia are formed after the fusion of the ventral and lateral nerve cords only, because the dorsal nerve cord does not extend beyond the anterior third of the body. The non-clamp side pre-haptoral ganglion is located near the position of the larval haptor while the clamp-side pre-haptoral ganglion is remote from the position of the hamuli. It {{is interesting to note that}} even with replication of clamps there are separate nerves <b>supplying</b> each <b>clamp.</b> From the clamp-side pre-haptora...|$|R

5000|$|At {{medical centers}} {{with a high}} volume of open aortic surgery, the fastest option for open aortic surgery was {{sequential}} aortic clamping or [...] "clamp-and-sew", whereby the aorta was clamped proximally and distally to the diseased segment, and a graft sewn into the intervening segment. This technique leaves {{the branches of the}} aorta un-perfused during {{the time it takes to}} sew in the graft, potentially increasing the risk of ischemia to the organs which derive their arterial <b>supply</b> from the <b>clamped</b> segment. Critics of this technique advocate intra-operative aortic perfusion. In infrarenal aneurysms, the relative tolerance of the lower extremities to ischemia allows surgeons to clamp distally with low risk of ill effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{electric}} bicycles {{has spread to}} the US, and more bicycle shops are carrying electric assist bicycles. Most bicycle shops are currently ill equipped to accommodate heavier electric bicycles with traditional repair stands, that require at least one had to operate, and the other hand {{to hold up the}} bicycle. The problem being solved is the awkward and poor ergonomics of holding up a heavy electric bicycle with one hand, and operating a repair stand with the other. The solution is to use a repair stand that does not require hands to operate. Having a hands-free clamping device capable of supporting two hundred pounds, and <b>supplying</b> a <b>clamping</b> force of around fifty-two pounds to securely hold an electric bicycle in place to conduct maintenance. Manufacturing a device that could be integrated into existing bicycle shops would greatly benefit smaller businesses financially, and bicycle mechanics ergonomically. Current products require replacing existing repair stands with ones that cost thousands of dollars. The proposed solution would cost only a few hundred and integrate directly into existing shops with little downtime or invasive set up. Strain on one’s back while lifting heavy objects is a major concern with organizations, such as OSHA, and a more ergonomically friendly product would prevent future issues...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} tumour hypoxia is induced by {{physically}} occluding the tumour vascular <b>supply</b> by <b>clamping,</b> or by giving mice 5 mg kg- 1 hydralazine. These methods have previously {{been shown to}} increase the radiobiological hypoxic fraction in tumours close to 100 %. Their effectiveness in potentiating the bioreductive toxicity of: misonidazole (800 mg kg- 1), RSU 1069 (80 mg kg- 1), mitomycin C (5 mg kg- 1) and SR 4233 (50 mg kg- 1) is assessed in the RIF- 1 and KHT tumours using regrowth delay as an assay. Clamping alone for 120 min gives little or no response, but when RSU 1069 is administered 15 min before clamping, large growth delays result. RIF- 1 tumours clamped for 90 or 120 min with RSU 1069 give cure rates of 12. 5 % and 37. 5 % respectively. Less effect with clamping is seen for the other bioreductive agents. The effect of hydralazine with RSU 1069 although significant in the RIF- 1 tumour, is modest compared to that for clamping. Small enhancements of toxicity are seen with hydralazine in combination with misonidazole in the RIF- 1 tumour and mitomycin C in both tumours. The varying effectiveness of these treatments is attributed to several factors which include the level and duration of hypoxia, concentration and contact time of the bioreductive drugs, the microenvironment of the tumour {{and the nature of}} the reductive metabolic pathways available in the different tumour cell types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{technique}} of inductive contactless energy transfer (CET) has found its application in specific industrial applications where an (air) gap between energy source and load is preferable or even required. A relative new application area of CET is where CET {{is part of}} a general energy distribution network. As an example, electrical sockets might give problems in bathrooms for safety reasons: CET provides a solution because of inherent electrical isolation between source (grid) and loads (e. g. hair dryer or electrical shaver). For such application this paper reports on the design of a contactless power system that is able to supply to multiple users simultaneously, analogously to the regular plug-and-socket network. The proposed contactless system consists of a special energy <b>supply</b> cable where <b>clamps</b> (each maximum 240 W) can be mounted on at arbitrary locations along the cable while electrical isolation is maintained between cable and clamps. Result is a supply cable design and a prototype with 2 clamps, which are compared by means of analytical calculations, simulations and experimental results.

40|$|The {{advances}} in high-voltage switching developed {{in this project}} allow a camera user to rapidly vary the number of output frames from 1 to 25. A high-voltage, variable-amplitude pulse train shifts the deflection location to the new frame location during the interlude between frames, making multiple frame counts and locations possible. The final deflection circuit deflects to five different frame positions per axis, including the center position, making {{for a total of}} 25 frames. To create the preset voltages, electronically adjustable {+-} 500 V power supplies were chosen. Digital-to-analog converters provide digital control of the supplies. The power <b>supplies</b> are <b>clamped</b> to {+-} 400 V so as not to exceed the voltage ratings of the transistors. A field-programmable gated array (FPGA) receives the trigger signal and calculates the combination of plate voltages for each frame. The interframe time and number of frames are specified by the user, but are limited by the camera electronics. The variable-frame circuit shifts the plate voltages of the first frame to those of the second frame during the user-specified interframe time. Designed around an electrostatic image tube, a framing camera images the light present during each frame (at the photocathode) onto the tube’s phosphor. The phosphor persistence allows the camera to display multiple frames on the phosphor at one time. During this persistence, a CCD camera is triggered and the analog image is collected digitally. The tube functions by converting photons to electrons at the negatively charged photocathode. The electrons move quickly toward the more positive charge of the phosphor. Two sets of deflection plates skew the electron’s path in horizontal and vertical (x axis and y axis, respectively) directions. Hence, each frame’s electrons bombard the phosphor surface at a controlled location defined by the voltages on the deflection plates. To prevent the phosphor from being exposed between frames, the image tube is gated off between exposures...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{responses}} to hypoxia restore oxygen homeostasis and promote cell survival, and are mainly regulated through the {{activation of the}} hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) - 1 and its target genes. In this study we questioned whether surgically depleting the liver s arterial blood <b>supply,</b> by <b>clamping</b> the hepatic artery (HA), would be sufficient to mount a hypoxia-driven molecular response, the up-regulation of hepatoprotective genes and thereby protect the liver from subsequent damaging insults.;;The HA of normal male Balb/c mice was clamped with a micro vascular clip for 2 hours. The liver s saturated oxygen concentration (SO 2) was measured using an O 2 C surface probe (LEA-Medizintechnik) and interstitial fluid was collected with microdialysis membranes to monitor tissue damage. Mice without clamping served as sham operated controls. Interstitial fluid was assessed for lactate pyruvate (L/P) and glycerol content and the mRNA of hepatoprotective genes was analyzed by real time PCR. Subsequently, mice received either a tail vein injection of anti-Fas antibody (Jo 2, 0. 2 mg/kg) or the liver was made ischemic (60 min) followed by 6 hours reperfusion. Caspase 3 -activity and cleaved lamin A {{were used to assess}} apoptosis. In separate groups, animal were monitored for survival.;;After 30 min of clamping the HA the SO 2 of the liver decreased and remained at a reduced level for up to 2 hours, without an increase in L/P ratio or glycerol release. We demonstrate the activation of a hypoxia-inducible signaling pathway by the stabilization of HIF- 1 protein (Western blot) and by an increase of its target gene, Epo, mRNA. There was an up-regulation of the hepatoprotective genes IL- 6, IGFBP- 1, HO- 1 and A 20 mRNA. When subsequently injected with Jo 2, animals preconditioned with HA clamping, had a significantly decreased caspase- 3 activity (avg 21044 vs. avg 3637; p= 0. 001, T-test) and there were fewer positive cells for cleaved Lamin A. The survival probability (10. 5 hours, n= 12) of mice with HA clamping was significantly higher (3. 2 hours, n= 13; p= 0. 014, Logrank test). Likewise, survival after 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and 6 hours of reperfusion was reduced from 86 % in mice with pretreatment by HA clamping to 56 % in sham treated controls.;;This study demonstrates that a localized hypoxic stress can be achieved by surgically removing the livers arterial blood supply. Furthermore it can stimulate a hepatoprotective response that protects the liver against Fas-mediated apoptosis and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our findings offer an innovative approach to induce hepatoprotective genes to defend the liver against subsequent insults...|$|R
