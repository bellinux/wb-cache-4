5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to {{a hole in the}} closet, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> suffocated.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of}} the night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{immediately}} <b>have</b> uttered another sentence; {{her heart}} was too full, her breath too much oppressed.|$|R
60|$|But {{she kissed}} the girl--if not with tenderness, {{at any rate}} with a curious feeling of pity which <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> defined.|$|R

5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|As Lydia recovers in hospital, Zoe {{is charged}} with Sarah's murder. Realising she has escaped arrest for accidentally killing Sarah, Lydia lies to Charlotte, telling her how she and Sarah planned to travel and even adopt. Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) confronts Lydia over the day of Sarah's death and is shocked when Lydia claims she was not {{supposed}} to die. Archie goes to the police, however they do not do anything. During Sarah's funeral, Archie arrives at her wake and announces Lydia caused her death. When no one believes him, he is removed. Before Zoe's court case, Mike goes to visit her. Lydia tries to tell Mike that she will try to appear innocent. When he returns, and claims he knows <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> killed Sarah, Lydia manipulates him into believing that she was just trying to get him on side. At this time, Charlotte and Lydia get back together. At the court case, Lydia lies whilst giving a statement. Charlotte accompanies Lydia to the case, agreeing to keep their new relationship quiet. However, when she sees the knife used to cut the parachute, Charlotte realises Lydia was responsible for Sarah's death. After she confesses, Lydia tells Charlotte if she goes to prison, she will kill herself.|$|E

Daisy admits that he was right to leave; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> coped otherwise. She later visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they again share their passion for each other, then part once more.|$|E

6000|$|... "Quantities of things," [...] began Fan, {{and then}} stopped, for somehow she felt ashamed to own {{that she was}} afflicted because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> {{a new set of}} furs, go to Paris in the spring, and make Mr. Sydney love her.

25|$|Altering the backstory of the victim. In the novel, Mrs Boynton is a tyrannical sadist {{and former}} prison warden, which {{is central to}} her murder. She remains a sadist in the adaptation, this time in control of a large {{financial}} empire. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any children of her own, so she selected her children from orphanages, {{all of whom were}} badly abused and tormented.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's tenuous {{relationship}} with her mother Jackie (Ann Gillespie) continued in the series' first season, with tension arising due to Jackie's drunken negligence of Erin, a recurring character in the original series and a regular in the spin-off. She also resumed her friendship with Brenda Walsh. However, their relationship was briefly strained by Kelly's and possibly Brenda's lingering feelings for former boyfriend Dylan McKay, as well as Brenda sleeping with Kelly's ex-boyfriend, Ryan Matthews, a teacher at West Beverly. Following Brenda's discovery that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> children, she and Kelly made amends once again.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Obama {{purchased}} {{a new home}} in the Kenwood District of Chicago for $1.65million (which was $300,000 below the asking price but represented the highest offer on the property) {{on the same day that}} Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, purchased the adjoining empty lot from the same sellers for the full asking price. Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention, but denied any coordination of offers. According to Obama, while the properties had originally been a single property, the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots, but made it a condition of the sales that they be closed on the same date. Obama also stated that the properties had been on the market for months, that his offer was the better of two bids, and that Ms. Rezko's bid was matched by another offer, also of $625,000, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> purchased the property for less.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2015, former {{employee}} Farryn Johnson was awarded $250,000 after an arbitrator found that racial discrimination contributed to her termination. Johnson was terminated in August 2013 after her store manager (from the Hooters in Baltimore, Maryland) {{told her that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> blonde highlights in her hair. Johnson filed a civil rights complaint with the State of Maryland Civil Rights Division where her attorneys stated {{the applicability of the}} dress code for African Americans and everyone else (e.g. non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander American) where one set of policies pertains to a certain group of people was considered as racial discrimination. A statement from Hooters of America by Ericka Whitaker (Hooters of America senior brand manager) stated that she had no issue of having blonde highlights as a Hooters Girl prior to becoming a brand manager and the company will continue to diversify its employees, from the restaurant to the annual Hooters International Swimsuit Pageant.|$|E
25|$|Shurley {{found no}} signs of brain damage but {{observed}} a few persistent abnormalities in Genie's sleep, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of REM sleep and an unusually high number of sleep spindles. He eventually concluded Genie had been mentally disabled from birth, specifically citing her significantly elevated number of sleep spindles. The other scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been disabled. She pointed out that Genie made a year's developmental progress for every calendar year after her rescue, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital, and that some aspects of language Genie acquired were uncharacteristic of mentally disabled people. She instead believed that Genie was born with at least average intelligence, and that the abuse and isolation of her childhood had left her functionally disabled.|$|E
25|$|Esma Sultan, the {{daughter}} of Sultan Abdul Hamid I and aunt of Sultan Abdülmecid I, lived in luxury in her magnificent villa in Istanbul, but still her life passed in sadness because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the one thing she wished for most; a child. At length she decided to adopt a child, {{the daughter}} of Gök Bey Gogen who belonged {{to one of the}} noble families of the Ubykh tribe of Circassia in the Ottoman Empire, after reaching satisfactory terms with the mother and father, when Rahime was a toddler one year of age. the child was particularly diminutive, delicate and graceful, so she renamed her Perestu, the Persian word for swallow. All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as though she were a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were so lovely that they became devoted to her. In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu. She had three brothers, Mustafa, Hüseyn and Hasan Bey, and two sisters, Fatma Gülcemal Hanım and Mihrifidan Hanım.|$|E

25|$|Back in Peking, Phillips {{translated}} nursing {{training material}} into Chinese. Then, in September 1915, Phillips taught medicine in Chinese at the Union Medical College for Women. The classes she taught varied from hygiene to public health. Phillips also attended classes with her {{students at the}} Peking Union Medical College to translate the curriculum for them. Phillips also agreed to be the visiting physician for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, but when asked to officially join the mission again, Phillips declined, no longer wishing to affiliate with a specific mission. Phillips also rented a house for herself {{so that she could}} open her own private practice. To make some extra money, Phillips rented out rooms to paying guests. Along with teaching and her medical practice, Phillips was also made the unofficial physician for the YWCA, in which Phillips worked to help Chinese women medically and socially. At age 45 while in Peking, Phillips adopted a boy baby since <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> children due to her previous hysterectomy. The baby was from England and she named him Clifford. After spending time in China, Clifford returned to England as a young man to continue his education.|$|E

Her therapist asks if she has ever clicked with anyone and Ellen replies, [...] "Susan." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of six days, the court heard a {{succession}} of witnesses piecing together the complicated story of how Thomas had met her death. Webster had attempted before the trial to implicate the publican John Church and her former neighbour Porter, but both men had solid alibis and were cleared of any involvement in the murder. She pleaded not guilty and her defence sought to emphasise the circumstantial {{nature of the evidence}} and highlighted her devotion to her son as a reason why <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been capable of the murder. However, Webster's public unpopularity, impassive demeanour and scanty defence counted strongly against her.|$|E
6000|$|But somehow his insistence, {{his very}} {{gentleness}} struck a jarring note, for which <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accounted.

60|$|She had {{suffered}} much, {{and was still}} overwrought and nerve-strung: for some reason <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afterwards <b>have</b> explained, <b>she</b> felt spiteful and uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury {{by the look of}} insolence and of triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>have</b> {{explained to}} herself why a sudden disclosure of her identity {{at this moment}} would have been peculiarly unpleasant to her. It was a weak, childish feeling no doubt. But such as it was, it was real, and strong, and genuine.|$|R
500|$|Anderson died in 1984 and {{her body}} was cremated. DNA tests were {{conducted}} in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a great-nephew of Empress Alexandra. According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, [...] "If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra." [...] Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some supporters of Anderson's claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been the Grand Duchess had [...] "won the day".|$|E
500|$|Hemings never married. As a slave, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a {{marriage}} recognized under Virginia law, but many slaves at Monticello {{are known to}} have taken partners in common-law marriages and had stable lives. (No such marriage for Hemings is noted in the records.) While Sally Hemings worked at Monticello, she had her children nearby. According to her son Madison, while young, the children [...] "were permitted to stay about the 'great house', and only required to do such light work as going on errands". At the age of 14, each of the children began their training: the brothers with the plantation's skilled master of carpentry, and Harriet as a spinner and weaver. The three boys all learned to play the violin (Jefferson played the violin).|$|E

[...] Jenkins felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
60|$|Juliette was one {{of those}} who escaped condemnation.
