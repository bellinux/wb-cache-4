25|$|A {{replacement}} for lost or stolen cards costs £15 and involves {{applying for a}} replacement card online or by calling the Oyster helpline. A new photograph is not required. The funds or remaining travel is non-transferable to a new student Oyster photocard and is refundable instead. The refund of a lost or stolen Oyster card {{is based on the}} original pro-rata daily rate. Thus, if you lose an annual student Oyster, the refund will not cover the remainder of the year, owing to the higher monthly/weekly pro-rata charges {{for the remainder of the}} year.
