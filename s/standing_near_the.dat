25|$|In 1871, a {{year after}} the {{official}} withdrawal of Imperial British forces, the headland around The Gap became a military garrison when work began to build coastal artillery emplacements to defend the Port of Sydney. Construction was undertaken by the colonial government's militia under the command of British military engineers. The first barracks, which were occupied by members of the New South Wales Artillery, were completed by 1877. Extensions were added in 1880 to accommodate additional personnel.

25|$|The Showcase Lagoon grandstands were {{constructed}} and stunt ski performances began in 1979. These shows included formation skiing {{as well as}} high speed jumps off a large ramp.

At this point in time, the Showcase Lagoon and the east lagoon (also referred to as Oriental Lagoon) were still one large body of water. The ski boat would often use the east lagoon for turning around after a run. A clown skiing on a round piece of plywood (called a saucer) while entertaining the crowd was also part of the show.|$|E

25|$|The same day, all {{opposition}} forces staged a March of Mourning to the Assembly Palace, but again {{the road was}} barricaded by armed forces.

The deputies panicked before troops stormed in, and Carp was found <b>standing</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> dead body, engaged in a row with the National Liberals' Dimitrie Sturdza. A version of the events, promoted by journalist and memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa, points to a government conspiracy. According to Bacalbașa, I.

25|$|Due to {{numerous}} delays, 1,250 temporary seats weren't ready {{in time for}} the game. According to a police officer <b>standing</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> affected area, the seats hadn't been installed {{in time for the}} fire marshal to inspect them. The NFL scrambled almost until kickoff to find replacement seats. Eventually, 850 fans in four sections were relocated, while 400 fans in two sections were given a refund equivalent to three times the face value of their ticket. The latter set of fans were later offered the chance to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench, but would still get the triple refund. Some of these fans were still upset, since they had spent thousands on airfare and hotels. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that when the league decided to relocate the 850 fans, it lost any shot of setting the attendance record.|$|E
25|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> castle, the Church of the Holy Rude {{is one of}} the town's most {{historically}} important buildings. Founded in 1129 it is {{the second}} oldest building in the city after Stirling castle. It was rebuilt in the 15th century after Stirling suffered a catastrophic fire in 1405, and is reputed to be the only surviving church in the United Kingdom apart from Westminster Abbey to have held a coronation. On 29 July 1567 the infant son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was anointed James VI of Scotland in the church. James' bride, Anne of Denmark was crowned in the church at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The Holy Rude congregation still meet and some 19th century parish records survive. Musket shot marks that may come from Cromwell's troops during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms are clearly visible on the tower and apse of the church.|$|E

25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa.

In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, <b>standing</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E
