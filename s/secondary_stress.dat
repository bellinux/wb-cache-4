5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have <b>secondary</b> <b>stress,</b> and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E

40|$|Trusses {{have been}} a common {{structural}} system for hundreds of years. The design and analysis of trusses evolved over time to its current state. Most manual truss analyses use the methods of joints and sections under idealized conditions. These ideal conditions, including pinned connections, cause discrepancies between the ideal truss being analyzed and the actual truss being constructed. The discrepancies include joint rigidity, connection eccentricity, and transverse loading. These cause <b>secondary</b> <b>stresses,</b> which induce bending moment into the truss members due to the chord’s continuity. <b>Secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> are most severe in continuous compression chord members. In these members, <b>secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> {{should be addressed to}} determine if they are severe and {{should be included in the}} truss design, or if idealized analysis will suffice. This report aims to determine the variables that affect the magnitude of <b>secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> in continuous compression chords due to chord continuity.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} with 129 counsellors {{who were members of}} various counselling organisations or associations in New Zealand. A quantitative methodology was utilised with questionnaires completed online. Participants were surveyed in relation to the constructs of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> burnout, compassion satisfaction, resilience, social support, degree of exposure to trauma and personal history of trauma. The majority of the participants reported age greater than 50 years (n= 84), female gender (n= 109) and identified as being of New Zealand European/ Pakeha descent (n= 105). Statistical analyses were completed to establish the prevalence of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> burnout and compassion satisfaction, the relationship between exposure and risk of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> the relationship between personal trauma history and risk of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress</b> and the relationships between burnout, compassion satisfaction, resilience and social support levels with <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress.</b> In addition, the moderating effect of compassion satisfaction was analysed. Results established a prevalence of 21. 7 % for high risk of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> 24. 8 % for high risk of burnout and 21. 7 % for high potential for compassion satisfaction in this sample. Results established statistically significant relationships between exposure and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> between burnout and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress</b> and between resilience and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress.</b> These results are discussed in relation to the secondary exposure to trauma of counsellors working with trauma clients.

Method: The study included 56 wives of war veterans diagnosed with PTSD and treated at the Center for Psychotrauma in Rijeka, Croatia. A short structured interview was conducted with each woman to collect demographic and socioeconomic data. The women independently completed an adapted 16 -item version of Indirect Traumatization Questionnaire to {{determine the}} presence of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress</b> symptoms, which corresponded with PTSD symptoms {{as defined by the}} fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders. Results: Out of 56 veterans’ wives included in the study, 32 had six or more symptoms of <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress,</b> whereas only 3 had none of the symptoms.

Thermal loading is considerable in a pressure vessel which handles hot fluid. Typically liquid metal reactors (LMR) have thermo-mechanical loadings. Analytically, induced stresses are calculated using pressure vessel theory or ASME codes. In this project induced stresses are calculated using ANSYS coupled field analysis for thermo-mechanical loading. The results are then compared with analytical results. This work demonstrates usage of commercial FEA tool over analytical approach. Analytical solutions such as ASME and Japanese Code give empirical relationships to calculate thermal stress. Use of FEA tools is not very popular in pressure vessel industries. FEA of this kind of loading requires coupled field analysis. In the work ANSYS is used to perform coupled field analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the self-perception of {{compassion}} satisfaction, compassion fatigue, and burnout by student conduct administrators working in the United States of America. Additionally, this study looked at the years of experience, job responsibilities, on-call responsibilities and direct student contact hours which may impact an individual’s overall professional quality of life. To accomplish the objectives outlined in the purpose statement, the following research questions were explored: 1. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ compassion satisfaction, burnout, and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress?</b> 2. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ years of experience and compassion satisfaction, burnout, and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress?</b> 3. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ responsibility areas and compassion satisfaction, burnout, and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress?</b> 4. What is the relationship between student affairs professionals serving in an on-call capacity and compassion satisfaction, burnout, and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress?</b> 5. What is the relationship between student conduct professionals’ amount of direct student contact and the compassion satisfaction, burnout, and <b>secondary</b> traumatic <b>stress?</b> This study utilized a quantitative methodology to collect data. For the purposes of this study, members of the Association for Student Conduct Administration were selected as the intended sample population. The study sample was comprised of 381 individuals (n= 381). The web-based survey included Stamm’s (2010) Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL), closed-ended questions as well as a demographic survey.
