5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head <b>lice</b> and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> live on clothing and feed on the <b>body.</b> Because <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{status of}} the head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> of humans has been debated for more than 200 yr. To clarify the specific status of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> we sequenced 524 base pairs (bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of 28 head and 28 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from nine countries. Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are not from reciprocally monophyletic lineages. Indeed, head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> share three of the 10 haplotypes we found. F-ST values and exact tests of haplotype frequencies showed significant differences between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> However, the same tests also showed significant differences among lice from different countries. Indeed, more of the variation in haplotype frequencies was explained by differences among lice from different countries than by differences between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Our results indicate the following: (1) bead and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> do not represent reciprocally monophyletic lineages and are conspecific; (2) gene flow among populations of lice from different countries is limited; and (3) frequencies of COI haplotypes can be used to study maternal gene flow among populations of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> and thus transmission of lice among their human hosts...|$|R
40|$|Homeless {{persons in}} San Francisco, California, USA,have {{been shown to}} have head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> infestations and Bartonella quintana infections. We {{surveyed}} a self selected population of homeless persons in San Francisco to assess infestations of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> risks of having <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and presence of B. quintana in lice. A total of 203 persons who reported itching were surveyed during 2008 - 2010 and 2012 : 60 (30 %) had <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> 10 (4. 9 %) had head lice, and 6 (3. 0 %) had both. B. quintana was detected in 10 (15. 9 %) of 63 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> pools and in 6 (37. 5 %) of 16 head lice pools. Variables significantly associated(p< 0. 05) with having <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> in this homeless population included male sex, African-American ethnicity, and sleeping outdoors. Our study findings suggest that specific segments of the homeless population would benefit from information on preventing <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> infestations and louse borne diseases...|$|R
40|$|Human {{head and}} <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are {{obligatory}} hematophagous ectoparasites {{that belong to}} a single species Pediculus humanus. Only <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> however, are vectors of the infections gram-negative bacteria Bartonella quintana. Due to their near identical genomes, yet differential vector competency, head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> provide an ideal model system to study an insects ability to gain or lose vector competency. Using our in vitro louse rearing system, we have infected both head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> with a blood containing B. quintana in order to detect differences in B. quintana proliferation between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> as well as transcriptional regulation of immune-related genes. B. quintana proliferates rapidly in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> after 6 days post-infection, but declines in head lice after 4 days post-infection, possibly explaining, in part, the differential vector competence between the two insects. A transcriptome analysis using whole lice followed by qPCR verification of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> immune-related genes was then conducted using uninfected, versus B. quintana infected lice to identify potential genes involved in vector competence. The immune-related genes Defensin 1, Fibrinogen-related protein and Spaetzle, were differentially regulated between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> and were identified as potential targets for future research. Previously studied immune-related genes, PGRP, Defensin 1 and Defensin 2 transcription levels were also assessed in <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> midgut using qPCR following B. quintana infection. In this case, B. quintana infection {{did not result in}} significant effects on the transcript levels of these genes in midgut tissue. Overall transcriptional profiles of head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> genomes were notably different, including difference in the expression of 18. 3 % of immune related genes, a finding that strongly supports the contention that immune system differences between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are the primary reason for difference in vector capacity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> is {{currently}} {{recognized as a}} vector of Rickettsia prowazekii, Borrelia recurrentis, and Bartonella quintana. Previous studies have reported the isolation of Acinetobacter baumannii from the <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> of homeless patients. To study how the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> acquires A. baumannii, we infected a rabbit by infusing 2 × 106 colony-forming units of the louse strain of A. baumannii. Two hundred <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were infected by feeding on the bacteremic rabbit and compared with 200 uninfected lice and two groups of 200 lice feeding on rabbits infected either with another strain of A. baumannii or A. lwoffii. Each louse group received maintenance feedings once a day on another seronegative rabbit. <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> that fed on rabbits infused with each Acinetobacter species demonstrated a generalized infection. The <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> did not transmit their infection to the nurse rabbit by bite while feeding or to their progeny (eggs and larvae). The lice excreted living Acinetobacter species within their feces. Only the louse strain of A. baumannii was pathogenic for the <b>body</b> <b>louse.</b> An increased mortality rate was observed between {{the second and third}} days post-infection; however, they remained infected for their lifespan...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetic {{analyses}} of human lice {{have shown that}} the current taxonomic classification of head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus) does not reflect their phylogenetic organization. Three phylotypes of head lice A, B and C exist but <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> have been observed only in phylotype A. Head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> have different behaviours and only the latter have been involved in outbreaks of infectious diseases including epidemic typhus, trench fever and louse borne recurrent fever. Recent studies suggest that <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> arose several times from head louse populations. Methods and Findings: By introducing a new genotyping technique, sequencing variable intergenic spacers which were selected from louse genomic sequence, we were able to evaluate the genotypic distribution of 207 human lice. Sequence variation of two intergenic spacers, S 2 and S 5, discriminated the 207 lice into 148 genotypes and sequence variation of another two intergenic spacers, PM 1 and PM 2, discriminated 174 lice into 77 genotypes. Concatenation of the four intergenic spacers discriminated a panel of 97 lice into 96 genotypes. These intergenic spacer sequence types were relatively specific geographically, and enabled us to identify two clusters in France, one cluster in Central Africa (where a large <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> outbreak has been observed) and one cluster in Russia. Interestingly, head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were not genetically differentiated. Conclusions: We propose a hypothesis for the emergence of <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and suggest that humans with both low hygiene and head louse infestations provide an opportunity for head louse variants, able to ingest a larger blood meal (a required characteristic of <b>body</b> <b>lice),</b> to colonize clothing. If this hypothesis is ultimately supported, it would help to explain why poor human hygiene often coincides with outbreaks of <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Additionally, if head lice act as a reservoir for <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and that any social degradation in human populations may allow the formation of new populations of <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> then head louse populations are potentially a greater threat to humans than previously assumed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus) and {{the head}} louse (P. h. capitis) are closely related obligate parasites that feed {{exclusively}} on human blood. Acinetobacter baumannii readily infect, multiply and proliferate in <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> producing a generalized infection 1. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the rate of infection to Acinetobacter sp. of <b>body</b> and head <b>lice</b> collected in Ethiopia. Methods: We collected head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from seven locations with different altitudes (from 1450 to 2400 meters) in Ethiopia. Total genomic DNA of each louse was extracted and used as a template in a real-time PCR assay targeting the rpoB gene of Acinetobacter sp. 2. In order to identify the genotype of <b>body</b> and head <b>lice,</b> the mitochondrial gene, cytB (cytochrome b) was amplified and sequenced 3. For data comparison, EpiInfo version 6. 0 software was used (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA). A p value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 115 head and 113 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were collected from 134 patients (109 females and 25 males) and tested. All <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were grouped in phylotype A and all the head lice, which were all black, belonged to phylotype C. Acinetobacter sp. was found in 62 head (53 %) and 69 <b>body</b> (69 %) <b>lice.</b> No difference was found in the presence of Acinetobacter sp. between head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> (p= 0. 58) or between males and females patients (p= 0. 34). Conclusion: Our study is the first showing presence of Acinetobacter sp. in head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> in Ethiopia. The percentage of lice infection in Ethiopia was much higher than in other countries such as in France or the Netherlands where respectively 18 % and 32 % of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> presented A. baumannii, or than in Rwanda where 58 % of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> were infected with A. baumannii 3. Head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> can be differentiated into 3 deeply divergent mitochondrial clades, each having unique geographic distribution. The first contains both head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> and is worldwide in distribution; the second occurs only in head lice and has been found in the New World, Europe, and Australia; and the third has been found only in black head lice from Nepal and Ethiopia 4. In our study, we have shown that all head lice presented the phylotype C and all <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> presented the phylotype A...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocal {{selective}} effects between coevolving {{species are}} often influenced by {{interactions with the}} broader ecological community. Community-level interactions may also influence macroevolutionary patterns of coevolution, such as cospeciation, but this hypothesis has received little attention. We studied two groups of ecologically similar feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that differ in their patterns of association with a single group of hosts. The two groups, “body lice” and “wing lice,” are both parasites of pigeons and doves (Columbiformes). <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> are more host-specific and show greater population genetic structure than wing lice. The macroevolutionary history of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> also parallels that of their columbiform hosts more closely than does the evolutionary history of wing lice. The closer association of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> with hosts, compared with wing lice, can be explained if <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are less capable of switching hosts than wing lice. Wing lice sometimes disperse phoretically on parasitic flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), but <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> seldom engage in this behavior. We tested the hypothesis that wing lice switch host species more often than <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and that the difference is governed by phoresis. Our results show that, where flies are present, wing lice switch to novel host species in sufficient numbers to establish viable populations on the new host. <b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> do not switch hosts, even where flies are present. Thus, differences in the coevolutionary history of wing and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> {{can be explained by}} differences in host-switching, mediated {{by a member of the}} broader parasite community...|$|R
50|$|This condition, {{is caused}} by <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus, {{sometimes}} called Pediculus humanus corporis) is a louse which infests humans and is adapted to lay eggs in clothing, {{rather than at the}} base of hairs, and is thus of recent evolutionary origin. Pediculosis is a more serious threat due to possible contagion of diseases such as typhus. Epidemiology and treatment of human <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> is described in the article on <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b>|$|R
40|$|As an {{obligatory}} parasite of humans, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus humanus) is {{an important}} vector for human diseases, including epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever. Here, we present genome sequences of the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> and its primary bacterial endosymbiont Candidatus Riesia pediculicola. The <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> has the smallest known insect genome, spanning 108 Mb. Despite its status as an obligate parasite, it retains a remarkably complete basal insect repertoire of 10, 773 protein-coding genes and 57 microRNAs. Representing hemimetabolous insects, the genome of the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> thus provides a reference for studies of holometabolous insects. Compared with other insect genomes, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> genome contains significantly fewer genes associated with environmental sensing and response, including odorant and gustatory receptors and detoxifying enzymes. The unique architecture of the 18 minicircular mitochondrial chromosomes of the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> {{may be linked to}} the loss of the gene encoding the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein. The genome of the obligatory louse endosymbiont Candidatus Riesia pediculicola encodes less than 600 genes on a short, linear chromosome and a circular plasmid. The plasmid harbors a unique arrangement of genes required for the synthesis of pantothenate, an essential vitamin deficient in the louse diet. The human <b>body</b> <b>louse,</b> its primary endosymbiont, and the bacterial pathogens that it vectors all possess genomes reduced in size compared with their free-living close relatives. Thus, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> genome project offers unique information and tools to use in advancing understanding of coevolution among vectors, symbionts, and pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The <b>body</b> <b>louse,</b> {{with its}} {{recently}} sequenced genome, is now primed {{to serve as}} a powerful model organism for addressing fundamental questions relating to how insects interact with their environment. One characteristic of the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> that facilitates this research is the size of its genome—the smallest insect genome sequenced to date. This diminutive genome must nonetheless control an organism that senses and responds to its environment, reacting to threats of corporal and genomic integrity. Additionally, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> transmits several important human diseases compared to its very close relative, the head louse, which does not. Therefore, these two organisms comprise an excellent model system for studying molecular mechanisms associated with vector competence. To understand more fully the development of vector/pathogen interactions, we have developed an in vitro bioassay system and determined that the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> genome appears to contain the genes necessary for RNAi. The <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> will therefore be useful for determining the set of conditions permissive to the evolution of vector competence...|$|R

40|$|Genomic and {{transcriptomics}} analyses {{have revealed}} human head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> {{to be almost}} genetically identical; although con-specific, they nevertheless occupy distinct ecological niches and have differing feeding patterns. Most importantly, while head lice are not known to be vector competent, <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> can transmit three serious bacterial diseases; epidemictyphus, trench fever, and relapsing fever. In order to gain insights into the molecular bases for these differences, we analyzed alternative splicing (AS) using next-generation sequencing data for one strain of head lice and one strain of <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> We identified a total of 3, 598 AS events which were head or <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> specific. Exon skipping AS events were overrepresented among both head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> whereas intron retention events were underrepresented in both. However, both the enrichment of exon skipping and the underrepresentation of intron retention are significantly stronger in <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> compared with head <b>lice.</b> Genes containing <b>body</b> louse-specific AS events {{were found to be}} significantly enriched for functions associated with development of the nervous system, salivary gland, trachea, and ovarian follicle cells, as well as regulation of transcription. In contrast, no functional categories were overrepresented among genes with head louse-specific AS events. Together, our results constitute the first evidence for transcript pool differences in head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> providing insights into molecular adaptations that enabled human lice to adapt to clothing, and representing a powerful illustration of the pivotal role AS can play in functional adaptation...|$|R
40|$|The human <b>body</b> <b>louse,</b> Pediculus humanus humanus (L.), and {{the human}} head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis, belong to the {{hemimetabolous}} order Phthiraptera. The <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> is the primary vector that transmits the bacterial agents of louse-borne relapsing fever, trench fever, and epidemic typhus. The genomes of the bacterial causative agents of several of these aforementioned diseases have been sequenced. Thus, determining the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> genome will enhance studies of host-vector-pathogen interactions. Although not important as a major disease vector, head lice are of major social concern. Resistance to traditional pesticides used to control head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> have developed. It is imperative that new molecular targets be discovered {{for the development of}} novel compounds to control these insects. No complete genome sequence exists for a hemimetabolous insect species primarily because hemimetabolous insects often have large (2000 Mb) to very large (up to 16, 300 Mb) genomes. Fortuitously, we determined that the human <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> has one of the smallest genome sizes known in insects, suggesting it may be a suitable choice as a minimal hemimetabolous genome in which many genes have been eliminated during its adaptation to human parasitism. Because many louse species infest birds and mammals, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> genome-sequencing project will facilitate studies of their comparative genomics.

40|$|AbstractThe human {{head louse}} (Pediculus humanus capitis) and <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> (P. humanus corporis or P. h. humanus) are strict, obligate human ectoparasites that differ mainly in their habitat on the host [1, 2]: the head louse lives and feeds {{exclusively}} on the scalp, whereas the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> feeds on the body but lives in clothing. This ecological differentiation probably arose when humans adopted frequent use of clothing, an important event in human evolution {{for which there is}} no direct archaeological evidence. We therefore used a molecular clock approach to date the origin of <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> assuming that this should correspond with the frequent use of clothing. Sequences were obtained from two mtDNA and two nuclear DNA segments from a global sample of 40 head and <b>body</b> <b>lice,</b> and from a chimpanzee louse to use as an outgroup. The results indicate greater diversity in African than non-African lice, suggesting an African origin of human lice. A molecular clock analysis indicates that <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> originated not more than about 72, 000 ± 42, 000 years ago; the mtDNA sequences also indicate a demographic expansion of <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> that correlates with the spread of modern humans out of Africa.

40|$|While being phenotypically and physiologically different, human {{head and}} <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> are indistinguishable based on {{mitochondrial}} and nuclear genes.

In this work, using a portion of the Phum_PHUM 540560 gene from the <b>body</b> <b>louse,</b> we aimed to develop a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to differentiate between <b>body</b> and head <b>lice</b> in a single reaction. Materials and Methods: A total of 142 human lice were collected from mono-infested hosts from 13 countries on five continents. We first identified the louse clade using a cytochrome b (CYTB) PCR sequence alignment. We then aligned a fragment of the Phum_PHUM 540560 gene amplified from head and <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> to design-specific TaqMan FAM- and VIC-labeled probes. Results: All the analyzed lice were Clade A lice. A total of 22 polymorphisms between the <b>body</b> and head <b>lice</b> were characterized. The multiplex real-time PCR analysis enabled the <b>body</b> and head <b>lice</b> to be distinguished in two hours. This method is simple, with 100 % specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: We confirmed that the Phum_PHUM 540560 gene is a useful genetic marker for the study of lice...|$|R

50|$|<b>Body</b> <b>lice</b> {{are spread}} through {{direct contact with}} the body, clothing, or other {{personal}} items of a person already carrying lice. Pubic lice are most often spread by intimate contact with an infested person. Head lice occur on the head hair, <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> on the clothing, and pubic lice mainly on the hair near the groin. Lice cannot burrow into the skin.|$|R

50|$|Pediculus humanus humanus (the <b>body</b> <b>louse)</b> is indistinguishable in {{appearance}} from Pediculus humanus capitis (the head louse) but will interbreed only under laboratory conditions.

In particular, <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> have evolved to attach their eggs to clothes, whereas head lice attach their eggs {{to the base of}} hairs.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a survey}} for trench fever among {{homeless}} people in Marseilles, France, we attempted isolation of Bartonella quintana from <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> A decontamination protocol of immersion in 70 % ethanol with 0. 2 % iodine was devised and was tested with a laboratory colony of <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> Lice which had been experimentally contaminated with either Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Acinetobacter spp. were successfully decontaminated, and this process did not prevent the culture of B. quintana from these lice. One hundred sixty-one lice obtained from homeless patients were studied by the protocol. B. quintana was isolated on axenic medium from 15 of 161 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> and was detected in 41 of 161 lice by PCR. Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens were also isolated from <b>body</b> <b>lice.</b> The sensitivities of PCR and culture of B. quintana were 98 and 36 %, respectively. These procedures may be useful for epidemiologic studies of trench fever and for the recovery of strains for characterization and comparison...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently, the <b>body</b> <b>louse</b> is {{the only}} {{recognized}} vector of Bartonella quintana, an organism that causes trench fever. In this work, we investigated the prevalence of this bacterium in human lice in different African countries. We tested 616 head <b>lice</b> and 424 <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> from nine African countries using real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting intergenic spacer region 2 and specific B. quintana genes. Overall, B. quintana DNA was found in 54 % and 2 % of <b>body</b> and head <b>lice,</b> respectively. Our results also show {{that there are more}} <b>body</b> <b>lice</b> positive for B. quintana in poor countries, which was determined by the gross domestic product, than in wealthy areas (228 / 403 versus 0 / 21, P < 0. 001). A similar finding was obtained for head lice (8 / 226 versus 2 / 390, P = 0. 007). Our findings suggest that head lice in Africa may be infected by B. quintana when patients live in poor economic conditions and are also exposed to <b>body</b> <b>lice...</b>|$|R
