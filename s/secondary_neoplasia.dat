Here, we report our experiences with 19 patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) within the GELTAMO co-operative group between 1992 and 2004. METHODS: The median age at transplantation was 46 yr. Fifteen patients underwent the procedure as front-line therapy and four patients as salvage therapy. Most patients received peripheral stem cells (90 %) coupled with BEAM or BEAC as conditioning regimen (79 %). RESULTS: A 79 % of patients achieved complete response, 5 % partial response and 16 % failed the procedure. After a median follow-up of 25 months, eight patients died (seven of progressive disease and <b>secondary</b> <b>neoplasia),</b> while actuarial overall survival and progression-free survival at 3 yr was 60 % and 55 %.

40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} histologic classi-fication and single histomorphologic pa-rameters in Hodgkin disease {{has been widely}} debated in the literature. Whereas several former studies identified single parameters to be of clinical relevance, some recent reports have doubted the prognostic value of histology using mod-ern treatment. Grading of the largest his-tologic category of Hodgkin disease, nodular sclerosis (NS), has been contro-versially discussed concerning clinical relevance. In this study, 965 cases of NS were reviewed to assess 9 histomorpho-logic parameters. The histologic results were correlated with laboratory and clini-cal findings and with overall survival and disease-free survival. Based on these re-sults, a new grading of the NS category was established. The new grading, based on the 3 criteria eosinophilia, lymphocyte depletion, and atypia of the Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells, was a significant indica-tor of prognosis in intermediate and ad-vanced stages. Patients investigated in this study represent an outstanding col-lection because {{all of them were}} enrolled in the prospective multicenter clinical trial of the German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group. All of them had been staged uni-formly according to the Ann Arbor sys-tem and had received stage-adapted mod-ern treatment according to multimodality protocols. A subtle analysis of histology could represent a possible way to identify patients with a significantly better or worse prognosis. This new grading should help to avoid overtreatment to reduce severe therapy-related side ef-fects such as acute toxicity and chronic sequelae such as cardiopulmonary com-plications and <b>secondary</b> <b>neoplasias...</b>|$|R

Materials and Methods: Between January 2000 and January 2010, we treated 14 patients with spinal ependymoma (10 males, 4 females; mean age: 48. 3 ± 18 years, range: 18 - 79 years). All patients were operated and received standard postoperative care. The outcome was estimated based on Frankel scale. Results: The most common presenting symptom was pain. All tumors were operated through a posterior approach and gross total resection {{was performed in}} 13 / 14 cases. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of one anaplastic ependymoma, nine grade II ependymomas, and four myxopapillary ependymomas. The mean Ki- 67 index was 1. 5 %.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are {{the leading}} mesenchymal {{neoplasia}} in the gastrointestinal tract, but GIST arising from the rectum is rare. When a <b>secondary</b> <b>neoplasia</b> coexists {{in the vicinity of}} a rectal GIST, more aggressive treatment strategies may be needed to cure the diseases. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We herein describe a 76 -year-old man with a large gastrointestinal stromal tumor along with an advanced adenocarcinoma in the rectum that coexisted with prostate carcinoma. Preoperative examination revealed an advanced adenocarcinoma of the upper rectum and a large pelvic mass suggestive of a GIST or a neuroendocrine tumor arising from the anterior wall of the lower rectum. To eradicate the tumor, total pelvic exenteration with ureterocutaneous fistula was carried out after obtaining written informed consent. Immuhistochemical studies revealed the concurrence of an advanced rectal cancer (T 3, N 1, M 0) and a malignant GIST (c-kit-positive, CD 34 -positive, vimentin-positive, and CAM 5. 2 -negative), and an incidental prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. The patient was given adjuvant chemotherapy with imatinib and remains disease-free as of 12 months after surgery. DISCUSSION: A PubMed search for the case of coexistence of GIST with two other malignancies revealed only four cases, making this very rare condition.

The patient was given adjuvant chemotherapy with imatinib and remains disease-free as of 12 months after surgery. DISCUSSIONA PubMed search for the case of coexistence of GIST with two other malignancies revealed only four cases, making this very rare condition. CONCLUSIONRadical surgery with perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the choice for treatment of large GISTs with a malignant potential. Our report suggests that aggressive surgical approach would be feasible, when a secondary tumor is present near the GIST...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the in vitro {{effects of the}} anti-tumoral drugs doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea on the G 2 -prophase checkpoint in lymphocytes from healthy individuals. At biologically equivalent concentrations, the induced DNA damage activated the corresponding checkpoint. Thus: i) there was a concentration-dependent delay of G 2 time and an increase of both the total DNA lesions produced and repaired before metaphase and; ii) G 2 -checkpoint adaptation took place as chromosome aberrations (CAs) started {{to appear in the}} metaphase, indicating the presence of unrepaired double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the previous G 2. The checkpoint ATM/ATR kinases are involved in DSB repair, since the recorded frequency of CAs increased when both kinases were caffeine-abrogated. In genotoxic-treated cells about three-fold higher repair activity was observed in relation to the endogenous background level of DNA lesions. The maximum rate of DNA repaired was 3. 4 CAs/ 100 metaphases/hour, this rise being accompanied by a modest 1. 3 fold lengthening of late G 2 prophase timing. Because of mitotic chromosome condensation, no DSBs repair can take place until the G 1 phase of the next cell cycle, when it occurs by DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Chromosomal rearrangements formed as a consequence of these error-prone DSB repairs ensure the development of genome instability through the DNA-fusion-bridge cycle. Hence, adaptation of the G 2 checkpoint supports the appearance of <b>secondary</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in patients pretreated with genotoxic drugs...|$|E
40|$|To asses {{the real}} {{contribution}} of pre-transplantation {{treatment in the}} incidence of <b>secondary</b> <b>neoplasia</b> after autologous transplant for lymphoproliferative disorders, we used stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. One hundred and forty-two patients out of 323 that underwent autologous transplantation for lymphoproliferative disorders were studied. The risk factors that were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis included: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy prior to conditioning regimen, disease status at peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) and type of harvest. Three patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML) and three patients developed solid neoplasia. By univariate analysis diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sMDS/AML. By multivariate analysis, the variables associated with sMDS/AML were the use of fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT. By univariate analysis, we found that radiotherapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only two variables significantly associated with new cancers were radiotherapy and prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies. We report the lowest incidence of sMDS/AML after autologous stem-cell transplantation for lymphoproliferative malignancies. Major reasons could be ascribed to the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria used to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML because of chemo-radiotherapy used before transplant procedure. The low incidence of secondary solid tumors could be caused by the absence of total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen or the short follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2004. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 15 - 16). A nine-year-old, female spayed Norwegian Elkhound {{presented to}} Cornell University Hospital for Animals on 9 / 18 / 03 with a chief complaint of renal disease and anemia. Significant findings on physical examination and diagnostic workup included thin body condition, grade 2 / 6 systolic murmur, non-regenerative anemia, proteinuria, azotemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypertension {{as well as}} multiple splenic and a single hepatic nodule. These findings were consistent with a glomerulopathy, but without biopsy glomerulonephritis could not be distinguished from amyloidosis. Pathogenesis of glomerular disease in Inga's case may include Lyme nephritis, immune complex glomerulonephritis <b>secondary</b> to <b>neoplasia,</b> amyloidosis or another unidentified cause. Inga was treated with multiple supportive therapies such as enalapril, amlodipine, famotidine, subcutaneous fluids and Epogen. Despite initial improvement in quality of life, Inga deteriorated in mid-October 2003 and was euthanized by her referring veterinarian. Dr. Jennifer McCabe, DV...|$|R
40|$|Background Autoantibodies {{directed}} against specific neuronal antigens {{are found in}} {{a significant number of}} patients with gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMDs) <b>secondary</b> to <b>neoplasia.</b> This study examined the presence of antineuronal antibodies in idiopathic GINMD and GINMD secondary to South American Trypanosomiasis. The GI distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) was also investigated. Methods Seventy-three patients were included in the study with diagnoses of primary achalasia, enteric dysmotility, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, esophageal or colonic dysmotility secondary to Chagas' disease. Sera were screened for specific antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs; P/Q subtype), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; α 3 subtype), and voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs, KV 1 subtype) using validated immunoprecipitation assays. The distribution of six VGKC subunits (KV 1. 1 - 1. 6), including those known to be antigenic targets of anti-VGKC antibodies was immunohistochemically investigated in all main human GI tract regions. Key Results Three patients (14 %) with chagasic GI dysmotility were found to have positive anti-VGKC antibody titers. No antibodies were detected in patients with idiopathic GINMD. The VGKCs were found in enteric neurons at every level of the gut in unique yet overlapping distributions. The VGKC expression in GI smooth muscle was found to be limited to the esophagus. Conclusions and Inferences A small proportion of patients with GI dysfunction secondary to Chagas' disease have antibodies against VGKCs. The presence of these channels in the human enteric nervous system may have pathological relevance to the growing number of GINMDs with which anti-VGKC antibodies have been associated. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
