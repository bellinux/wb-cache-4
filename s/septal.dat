5|$|If other {{interventions}} have failed, several {{operations have}} been reported to provide benefit. One is <b>septal</b> dermoplasty or Saunders' procedure, in which skin is transplanted into the nostrils, and the other is Young's procedure, in which the nostrils are sealed off completely.|$|E
5|$|Study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, {{medical officer}} to the 190709 expedition, {{suggests}} that Shackleton suffered from an atrial <b>septal</b> defect ("hole in the heart"), a congenital heart defect, {{which may have}} been a cause of his health problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships among}} stony corals were first {{examined in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime’s was based on macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with {{particular attention to the}} structure and pattern of the <b>septal</b> trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the <b>septal</b> trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding.|$|E
5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid {{as is the case in}} the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of <b>septal</b> insertion.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial <b>septal</b> nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial <b>septal</b> nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular <b>septal</b> wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scleractinians {{were not}} reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest {{diversity in the}} Jurassic and all but disappeared in the mass extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic <b>septal</b> insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial <b>septal</b> nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and <b>septal</b> muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular <b>septal</b> defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial <b>septal</b> defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent <b>septal</b> perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
25|$|The interatrial septum can {{be divided}} into five <b>septal</b> zones. If the defect {{involves}} two or more of the <b>septal</b> zones, then the defect is termed a mixed atrial <b>septal</b> defect.|$|E
25|$|The <b>septal</b> mucosal tissue flap is the {{indicated}} technique for correcting defects of the distal {{half of the}} nose, and for correcting almost every type of large defect of the mucosal lining of the nose. The <b>septal</b> mucosal tissue flap, which is an anteriorly based pedicle-graft supplied with blood by the <b>septal</b> branch of the superior labial artery. To perform such a nasal correction, the entire <b>septal</b> mucoperichondrium can be harvested.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the heart}} include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial <b>septal</b> defect, ventricular <b>septal</b> defect, and tetralogy of fallot.|$|E
25|$|The ostium secundum atrial <b>septal</b> defect is {{the most}} common type of atrial <b>septal</b> defect, and {{comprises}} 6–10% of all congenital heart diseases.|$|E
25|$|Heart: A {{heart murmur}} that {{frequently}} disappears by {{one year of}} age. Ventricular <b>septal</b> defect most commonly seen, followed by an atrial <b>septal</b> defect.|$|E
25|$|The nasal {{lining of}} the distal two-thirds of the nose can be covered with {{anteriorly}} based <b>septal</b> mucosal flaps; however, if bilateral septal-flaps are used, the <b>septal</b> cartilage does become devascularized, possibly from iatrogenic <b>septal</b> perforation. Furthermore, if the nasal defect is beyond the wound-correction scope of a <b>septal</b> mucosal flap, the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranial-flap (harvested from the frontal bone) or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia (harvested from the head), either {{of which can be}} lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Once {{someone is}} found to have an atrial <b>septal</b> defect, a {{determination}} of {{whether it should be}} corrected is typically made. If the atrial <b>septal</b> defect is causing the right ventricle to enlarge a secundum atrial <b>septal</b> defect should generally be closed. If the ASD is not causing problems the defect may simply checked every two or three years. Methods of closure of an ASD include surgical closure and percutaneous closure.|$|E
25|$|A {{defect in}} the ostium primum is {{occasionally}} classified as an atrial <b>septal</b> defect, {{but it is more}} commonly classified as an atrioventricular <b>septal</b> defect. Ostium primum defects are less common than ostium secundum defects. This type of defect is usually associated with Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Altered, {{turbulent}} blood flow. The {{areas that}} fibrose, clot, or roughen {{as a result}} of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular <b>septal</b> defects or patent ductus arteriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial <b>septal</b> defects.|$|E
25|$|Around a 5% {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} ventricular <b>septal</b> defects, atrial <b>septal</b> defects, and patent ductus arteriosus in offspring {{has been found to be}} correlated with advanced paternal age. Advanced paternal age has also been linked to increased risk of achondroplasia and Apert syndrome. Offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular <b>septal</b> defects, and the tetralogy of Fallot. It is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices.|$|E
25|$|Children {{born with}} Edwards {{syndrome}} {{may have some}} or all of these characteristics: kidney malformations, structural heart defects at birth (i.e., ventricular <b>septal</b> defect, atrial <b>septal</b> defect, patent ductus arteriosus), intestines protruding outside the body (omphalocele), esophageal atresia, intellectual disability, developmental delays, growth deficiency, feeding difficulties, breathing difficulties, and arthrogryposis (a muscle disorder that causes multiple joint contractures at birth).|$|E
25|$|Medial <b>septal</b> nucleus acts {{mainly on}} M1 receptors in the {{hippocampus}} {{and parts of}} the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|Separating the {{anterior}} horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum: a thin, triangular, vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum {{down to the}} fornix. During the third month of fetal development, a space forms between two <b>septal</b> laminae, known as the cave of septum pellucidum (CSP), which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment. During the fifth month of development, the laminae start to close and this closure completes from about {{three to six months}} after birth. Fusion of the <b>septal</b> laminae is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus, amygdala, <b>septal</b> nuclei, fornix, corpus callosum and other midline structures. Lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior-to-anterior fusion, resulting in the continuation of the CSP into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|End {{branches}} of the medial posterior choroidal arteries, superior thalamostriate, superior choroidal and <b>septal</b> veins also pass through the foramen.|$|E
25|$|Members of the clade from Iridaceae upwards have infra-locular <b>septal</b> nectaries, which Rudall {{interpreted}} as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Fetal alcohol {{syndrome}} – {{about one}} in four patients with fetal alcohol syndrome has either an ASD or a ventricular <b>septal</b> defect.|$|E
25|$|Diluted {{fluorescein}} dye {{has been}} used to localise multiple muscular ventricular <b>septal</b> defects during open heart surgery and confirm the presence of any residual defects.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{whether there is}} an increased prevalence of <b>septal</b> heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Common (or single) atrium is {{a failure}} of {{development}} of the embryologic components {{that contribute to the}} atrial <b>septal</b> complex. It is frequently associated with heterotaxy syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In transthoracic echocardiography, an atrial <b>septal</b> defect {{may be seen}} on color {{flow imaging}} as a jet of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|Sphenopalatine nerve – divides {{into the}} lateral branch and the <b>septal</b> branch, and conveys {{sensation}} {{from the rear}} and the central regions of the nasal cavity.|$|E
25|$|Ebstein's anomaly – about 50% of {{individuals}} with Ebstein anomaly have an associated shunt between {{the right and left}} atria, either an atrial <b>septal</b> defect or a patent foramen ovale.|$|E
25|$|The {{many types}} of atrial <b>septal</b> defects are {{differentiated}} from each other by whether they involve other structures {{of the heart and}} how they are formed during the developmental process during early fetal development.|$|E
