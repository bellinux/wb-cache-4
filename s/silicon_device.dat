5000|$|Intel {{suggests}} {{this light}} source {{could be used}} for optical communications when integrated with silicon photonics. Silicon manufacturing and fabrication is widely used in the electronic industry to mass-produce low-cost electronic devices. Silicon photonics uses these same electronic manufacturing technologies to make low cost integrated optical devices. One issue with using silicon for an optical device is that silicon is a poor light emitter and cannot be used to make an electrically pumped laser. This means that lasers have first to be fabricated on a separate III-V semiconductor wafer before being individually aligned to each <b>silicon</b> <b>device,</b> in a process that is both costly and time-consuming, limiting the total number of lasers that can be used on a silicon photonic circuit.|$|E

30|$|Due to its {{excellent}} {{mechanical and}} physical properties, monocrystalline silicon {{has been widely}} used in micro/nanoelectromechanical systems [1, 2]. The typical microscale and nanoscale fabrication technique of <b>silicon</b> <b>devices</b> is photolithography [3]. Although it has a strong merit in mass production, photolithography is not suitable for flexible machining of micro-mold and prototype fabrication in micro-systems. Moreover, as the scale-down of device dimensions continues, traditional fabrication methods have difficulty in meeting the resolution requirement [4, 5]. Therefore, it remains very essential to explore new nanofabrication methods especially for nanoscale <b>silicon</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary. This work {{examines}} electro-thermal transport in <b>silicon</b> <b>devices</b> and in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Non-local transport {{is found}} to strongly affect heat generation in quasi-ballistic <b>silicon</b> <b>devices.</b> Under such conditions, Joule heat is mainly dissipated in the drain region, and increasing power densities may lead to phonon non-equilibrium. Significant current degradation is observed in suspended SWNTs, which is attributed {{to the presence of}} hot optical phonons and to a decrease in thermal conductivity (as ~ 1 /T) at high temperature (T) under self-heating. The high temperature thermal conductivity can then be extracted by using the high bias characteristics of suspended SWNTs. ...|$|R

The growth of single individual nanotubes at lithographically defined locations on whole wafers as a key requirement for the successful implementation of nanotubes is shown. In terms of nanotube transistors we propose a vertical nanotube transistor concept which outperforms the ITRS requirements for the year 2016.
