40|$|The {{decision}} by Australia’s High Court {{to uphold the}} constitutionality of the country’s ground-breaking tobacco plain packaging laws 1 has been heralded as a victory for national sovereignty over vested interests. 2 However, the ability of governments worldwide to intro-duce and im plement public health policies and laws is increasingly threatened by trade and investment treaties that privilege investors over governments and provide avenues for international corporations to chal-lenge democratically enacted public health policies in diff erent countries. 3, 4 The risks are clearly shown by Philip Morris Asia’s challenge to Australia’s plain packaging laws under the investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions set out in an investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong. 3 The action by Philip Morris Asia seems {{to be part of a}} global strategy by the tobacco industry to use international trade and investment dispute mechanisms to undermine tobacco control measures. Other such disputes include investor-state actions by tobacco com-panies against Uruguay and Norway and challenges within the dispute mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) brought against both the USA and Australia by other countries. 5, 6 Through the ISDS mechanism, Philip Morris Asia is seeking the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of Australia’s plain packaging legislation, or millions of dollars in compensation on the grounds that the value of its in-vestment has been aff ected by the supposed expropri-ation of its trademarks and related branding. 7 Australia, however, has a strong case, in part because Philip Morris Asia acquired its holdings in Philip Morris Australia i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a right of a third party to prevent {{enforcement}} {{on the basis of}} a claim and evidence that rights or assets seized in enforcement proceeding belong to him (third party) and not to the enforcement debtor. In most of jurisdictions that were subject of analysis of this paper, this right of a third party is exercised by filing an objection to the court conducting enforcement proceedings. The claim of the third party is directed towards the enforcement creditor as well as against the enforcement debtor. In the event the claim of the third party is being contested, the court instructs the third party to initiate litigation proceedings for determining whether the third party is entitled to exclusion of such rights or assets from enforcement, especially if such third party holds property rights or some other rights over the assets that are being subject to enforcement proceedings. In majority of analyzed jurisdictions, enforcement proceedings are being suspended provided the third party, in the objection being filed makes prima facie likely, on the basis of credible evidence, that his assets were seized in the enforcement proceedings. However, according to the law of the Republic of Serbia, a credible objection of a third party does not result in <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> proceedings, something that is being criticized in this paper. As a result of this provision of the law, a bona fide third party is forced to endure the enforcement although his claim has been made likely and subsequently confirmed in the litigation proceedings. The author, in particular, points to the legal consequences of mala fide enforcement creditor that knew that the assets that are being subject of the enforcement proceedings do not belong to the enforcement debtor. The author is of the opinion that, in such cases, the enforcement creditor should be obliged to pay to the third party damages that such party suffered as a result of enforcement proceedings being instigated against his assets...|$|E

Ao se partir da premissa de que um contrato administrativo, tal como qualquer outro ato jurídico, introduz normas jurídicas no sistema jurídico-positivo, será preciso antes de tudo saber quando uma norma existe para o ordenamento jurídico, bem como quando ela será considerada válida ou inválida. Além disso, será importante apontar o sentido do termo eficácia. Em seguida, indicar-se-á o conceito de contrato administrativo a ser adotado neste trabalho, procurando analisá-lo a partir dos elementos e pressupostos do ato administrativo, o que se revelará bastante útil ao se estudar a convalidação dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Depois de se apresentar o conceito de invalidade e suas espécies no direito brasileiro, abordar-se-á as hipóteses de manutenção, no direito positivo, dos contratos administrativos inválidos, quais sejam, a convalidação, a conversão e o saneamento. Ao final deste trabalho, a invalidação e a sustação dos contratos administrativos inválidos pelo Poder Legislativo e pelos Tribunais de Contas que são formas de retirada de contratos administrativos inválidos serão objeto de estudoThe {{main purpose}} of this work is to argue about the ways to {{continue}} or terminate with the agreements executed by the Estate (or its companies) that were declared invalid (Administrative Contracts).

40|$|Two {{directions}} of amending the Polish penal code are {{considered by the}} authoress to be the leading ones. The first one {{is characterized by the}} strife to diminish the represiveness of the Polish penal law. The second one comprises the proposals aiming at the increase of the law abidingness. When discussing the first trend, the authoress considers the multiple changes of the penal code regulations concerning a capital punishment, deprivation of liberty pecuniary penalty and the directives of determining a penalty. The elimination of capital punishment, or its limitation to cases of manslaughter and high treason is suggested. The lower limit of deprivation of liberty is decreased (to equal one month) as well as other sanctions related to individual crimes. Deprivation of liberty up to three years is to alternate, as a rule, with a penalty of restricted liberty and a pecuniary penalty (fine). The adoption of the socalled "Scandinavian system" in meting out fines in days is advised. Varying regulations are called for in questions of criminal responsiblity of juveniles and young adult offenders. The regulation of recidivism has to be essentially changed. The conditional discontinuance of criminal proceedings is to be decided only in courts. The decrease in represiveness of penal law can also be effected by the new regulation <b>of</b> the conditional <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> punishment and of the release on licence. The authoress advocates that the second trend of the proposed changes comprising postulates aiming at the increase of the law abidingness is out of proportion to the proposed amendments diminishing the represiveness of penal law. The scope of protection of criticism is not extended there and the grounds for the criminal responsibility of persons guilty of abuse of authority are not secured. The range of changes concerning protection against corruption and speculation is not satisfactory either. No coordination with the provisions of the Code of Offences and the Speculation Control Act can be observed. It seems also necessary to verify the obsolete part of the detailed provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand, the extention of the smart money institution (paid by the perpetrator to the injured person) is to be classed among the changes of a right direction.

40|$|Polish {{penal law}} {{provides}} pledge and surveillance of social institutions, organizations and. collective groups under which defendant or the sentenced person: works, receives an education or {{is in the}} military service. These measures can be of a litigious or probational character. The litigious pledge is a preventive means aiming at securing {{the appearance of the}} defendant at summons before the organs conducting the proceedings and preventing his obstruction of a process. It cannot be geared on resocializing the defendant as there is a principle of presumption of the accused's innocence hold valid in the penal proceedings, as long as a perpetration of a crime is not established in the final judgement starting upon a resocialization of the defendant will be untimely. The pledge as a probational means is aimed, on the other hand, at the resocialization. The litigious pledge is applied in the course of proceedings and for its duration unless it was limited to a certain stage of a process. It is terminated, at the latest by the final completion of proceedings while the pledge as a probational means is ruled at the conditional discontinuance <b>of</b> proceedings, conditional <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> punishment and release on licence, it is undertaken for the time of testing a favorable behavior of perpetrator of a crime. A social organization, institution or a collective body which are undertaking a pledge have to appoint a person to perform the duties of a pledger directly. Surveillance is in principle a probational means. It can be applied as the litigious means of prevention only by the way of an exception, in case of stay of execution of a judgement pertinent to an extraordinary appeal against a valid judgement or a motion for instituting a trial de novo. A difference between the pledge and surveillance is not clear. The pledge is not limited itself to standing surety for the accused or the sentenced. It is related, as in the instance of the suryeillance, to the duties to control a conduct of the pledgee. Yet, the duties of surveilling person are regulated in a wider scope and more precisely. Theoreticians are advancing a proposition that a pledge is more flexible and less binding form of control. The pledge and surveillance are terminated upon the expiration of a probation period, earlier m the case of releasing a pledger from his duties and also in the instance of a final ruling <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> punishment or recalling a release on licence. The pledge expires also upon the reopening of conditionally discontinued proceedings. The social pledge — litigious and probational — is not often used in practice and so is the social surveillance performed by the social institutions and collective groups. Surveillance by court appointed curators (mostly social ones) is dominating.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the chapters on public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law and on criminal law from a general, forthcoming book, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Harvard University Press, 2003). By public {{law enforcement is}} meant the use <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> agents [...] such as police, tax inspectors, regulatory personnel [...] to enforce legal rules. A number of important dimensions <b>of</b> public law <b>enforcement</b> may be distinguished. One is {{the choice of the}} basic rule of liability: whether liability is strict or fault-based, and whether liability is imposed only if harm is done or may be imposed on the basis of acts alone (independently of the occurrence of harm). A second dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the type of sanction, whether monetary or nonmonetary, notably, imprisonment. A third aspect <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the magnitude of sanctions. And a fourth dimension <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> is the degree <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> effort, which determines the probability of imposition of sanctions. These dimensions <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> are discussed in the chapters that follow. In chapter 20, the basic theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> employing monetary sanctions is discussed; in chapter 21, the basic theory <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> using nonmonetary sanctions is examined; and in chapter 22, extensions to the basic theory are considered. Then, in chapter 23, functions of sanctions apart from deterrence, namely, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution, are discussed. Finally, in chapter 24, the subject of criminal law is addressed against the background of the theory <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> law. ...|$|R
