50|$|<b>Scalpel</b> <b>blades</b> {{are usually}} made of {{hardened}} and tempered steel, stainless steel, or high carbon steel; in addition, titanium, ceramic, diamond and even obsidian knives are not uncommon. For example, when performing surgery under MRI guidance, steel blades are unusable (the blades would be drawn to the magnets, or may cause image artifacts). Historically, the preferred material for surgical scalpels was silver, on account of its antimicrobial properties (although the mechanics were not understood at the time). <b>Scalpel</b> <b>blades</b> are also offered by select manufacturers with a zirconium nitride-coated edge to improve sharpness and edge retention. Others manufacture blades that are polymer-coated to enhance lubricity during a cut. Alternatives to scalpels in surgical applications include electrocautery and lasers.|$|R

50|$|In {{the sport}} of fencing, blades used in {{competitions}} run {{under the auspices of}} the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime are usually made with maraging steel.

Stainless maraging steel is used in bicycle frames and golf club heads. It is also used in surgical components and hypodermic syringes, but is not suitable for <b>scalpel</b> <b>blades</b> because the lack of carbon prevents it from holding a good cutting edge.|$|R

40|$|There are {{a plethora}} of penile cutting styles, penile cutting {{techniques}} and penile cutting locations present across the more than 800 cultural/language groups in Papua New Guinea. The 'Acceptability of Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in PNG' study is documenting diverse penile cutting practices at four study sites. Across the four sites between one third and two thirds of men reported having some form of penile cutting, with the majority having some form of longitudinal cut of the foreskin performed outside the medical system. Many men from cultural groups that cut the foreskin describe having their foreskin cut in or near a village by a male relative, friend or village expert and often linked to initiation ceremonies. Many men from cultural groups with no tradition of foreskin cutting and who had attended boarding school or university reported having their foreskin cut while at school or university by young men from circumcising groups or those who had learnt from circumcising groups. Tools used include bamboo, razor <b>blades,</b> <b>scalpel</b> <b>blades,</b> sharpened toothbrush handles, and large craft needles with strips of rubber tyre or fishing line.

5000|$|While his nontraditional knives were {{a way for}} Callahan to {{step outside}} the {{restrictions}} of the prehistoric typologies, his obsidian scalpels were a {{way for him to}} provide a service to mankind. [...] The technology to make <b>scalpel</b> <b>blades</b> out of smoky obsidian, a volcanic glass that allows for the sharpest blade production, was first developed by Don Crabtree in the late 1970s. The blades, which have edges only a few molecules thick, are 100 to 500 times sharper than the traditional surgical steel scalpels (The University Record 1997). These ultra-sharp edges produce less scarring and tissue damage and speed the healing process. Though they are not popular in the medical field, Callahan’s obsidian scalpels have been used with great success in hundreds of operations, many performed by doctors and scientists at the University of Michigan Health System who have done extensive research using scalpels produced by Callahan.|$|R
