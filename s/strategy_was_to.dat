5|$|Ghadar's {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} overthrow British colonial authority in India {{by means of an}} armed revolution. It viewed the Congress-led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter's constitutional methods as soft. Ghadar's foremost <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> entice Indian soldiers to revolt. To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the Yugantar Ashram press in San Francisco. The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the crossing, and began a guerrilla war in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curicó, demoralized the royalists.|$|E
5|$|As {{a ranking}} prisoner-of-war, Colonel Stacy {{was the subject}} of {{high-level}} correspondence and actions of General George Washington and other leaders of the Continental Army. During April 1780, General Lafayette, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, hand-carried a letter from General William Heath to General Washington, describing a reported Loyalist and British strategy concerning Stacy. The <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> continue holding Colonel Stacy as a prisoner-of-war, and to use Stacy in a prisoner exchange, should Colonel Butler or another ranking Loyalist officer, Sir John Johnson, be captured by the Continental Army. During September 1780, General Washington attempted to arrange a prisoner exchange for Colonel Stacy, but was unsuccessful. On November 1, 1781, the General Assembly of Massachusetts passed a Resolve urging Governor John Hancock to encourage General Heath to pursue a prisoner exchange for Stacy.|$|E
40|$|When climate {{forecasts}} {{are highly}} uncertain, the optimal {{mean squared error}} <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ignore them. When climate forecasts are highly certain, the optimal mean squared error <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use them as is. In between these two extremes there are climate forecasts with an intermediate level of uncertainty for which the optimal mean squared error <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make a compromise forecast. We present two new methods for making such compromise forecasts, and show, using simulations, that they improve on previously published methods...|$|R

One <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a digital portfolio to trap student outputs, relate these to industry expectations {{and provide a}} means for students to reflect emerging professional competence. Another <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> frame the learning experience {{through a series of}} authentic tasks. A third <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> visualise and track the attainment of skills in terms of industry criteria.

5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build up a disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late {{because he had to}} work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E

30|$|One last speed {{enhancing}} <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{substitute a}} different measure that <b>is</b> easier <b>to</b> compute, but has results that correlate with betweenness centrality. This has been attempted using such measures as Katz centrality [49], closeness centrality [1], κ-path centrality [50], and routing betweenness centrality [51]. A variation on this <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use local measures to estimate global betweenness centralities [52].|$|R

5|$|Kelendria Trene Rowland {{was born}} on February 11, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the {{daughter}} of Doris Rowland Garrison (December 6, 1947 – December 2, 2014) and Christopher Lovett. Kelly has an older brother named Orlando. When she was seven, her mother took her and left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic. At the age of eight, she relocated to Houston. In 1992, Rowland joined a girl group, originally named Girl's Tyme. Rowland's addition made it a six-member group. West coast R producer, Arne Frager, flew to Houston to see them and eventually brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studio, in Northern California. As part of efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major label record deal, Frager's <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> debut them on Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at that time. They participated, but lost the competition.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library. The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E
5|$|The Eretrian <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{defend their}} walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the}} only plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only {{suffered}} two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E

Two types of <b>strategies</b> have <b>been</b> {{proposed for the}} forecasting models which are provided {{in the next two}} subsections.

5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{grenadiers}} {{left the}} convent at dawn, preparing their formations behind the convent. San Martín {{returned to the}} tower to watch the enemy who disembarked at sunrise, 5:30 in the morning. He mounted his horse, gave a short harangue to the troops, and headed to battle. His <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> divide his cavalry forces into two columns, of nearly sixty horsemen each, and make a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces. The cavalry would not use their guns, relying instead on saber and spear attacks. The right-hand column was headed by Justo German Bermúdez, and the left-hand one by San Martín. The royalists marched in two columns with the two cannons, a deployed flag and military drummers. The clarion of the regiment of mounted grenadiers sounded for the first time, marking {{the beginning of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Winmark Corporation is an American {{franchisor}} of five retail {{businesses that}} specialize in buying and selling used goods. The company is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winmark was founded in 1988 as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation by Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg after they purchased the Play It Again Sports franchise rights from Martha Morris. They renamed the company to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. Grow Biz went public in August 1993. In 2000, John Morgan replaced Dahlberg as CEO and renamed the company to Winmark in 2001. Morgan rescued Winmark from the verge of bankruptcy by selling financially failing franchise concepts and stores and replacing the management team. The company's <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> move from owning stores itself to having franchisees own all the stores.|$|E

5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} treaty obligations, Manuel decided {{that it was time to}} deal with the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel's <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the only sound <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
5|$|From the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea (also known as the Republic of Korea) by the North, the North Korean People's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The North Korean <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> aggressively pursue UN and South Korean forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time.
