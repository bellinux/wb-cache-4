5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as <b>survey</b> <b>vessels,</b> training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the members of the class began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up {{or in the case of}} Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Royal Edward Dock {{was built}} in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was {{constructed}} {{on the opposite side}} of the mouth of the Avon, making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock. In 1977 Charles Hill & Sons, the last shipbuilder at the Albion Yard, closed after delivering the 1541 tonne beer tanker Miranda Guinness. Part of the yard reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating, who still produce a steady stream of small ferries, <b>survey</b> <b>vessels,</b> tugs and other craft.|$|E
25|$|The Cormorant-class gunvessels (sometimes {{known as}} Eclipse-class gunvessels) were {{a class of}} 4-gun {{first-class}} gunvessels built for the Royal Navy in the 1860s. They were somewhat unsuccessful; intended for shore bombardment in shallow water, they exceeded their design draft by 50%. Seven of the 13 ships ordered were suspended, with 3 finished or converted as survey ships and the other 4 cancelled. Racehorse was wrecked after only 4 years, and those ships that were completed as planned had short operational lives, in some cases less than 10 years. The <b>survey</b> <b>vessels</b> (Myrmidon, Sylvia and Nassau) lasted longest, with the last ship of the class, Sylvia, being broken up in 1890.|$|E
