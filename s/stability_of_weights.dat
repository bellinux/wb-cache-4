40|$|A {{generalised}} {{model of}} biological topographic map development is presented which combines both weight plasticity {{and the formation}} and elimination of synapses (synaptic rewiring) as well as both activity-dependent and -independent processes. The question of whether an activity-dependent process can refine a mapping created by an activity-independent process is investigated using a statistical approach to analysingmapping quality. The model is then implemented in custom mixed-signal VLSI. Novel aspects of this implementation include: (1) a distributed and locally reprogrammable address-event receiver, with which large axonal fan-out does not reduce channel capacity; (2) an analogue current-mode circuit for Euclidean distance calculation which is suitable for operation across multiple chips; (3) slow probabilistic synaptic rewiring driven by (pseudo-) random noise; (4) {{the application of a}} very-low-current design technique to improving the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> stored on capacitors; (5) exploiting transistor non-ideality to implement partially weightdependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity; (6) the use of the non-linear capacitance of MOSCAP devices to compensate for other non-linearities. The performance of the chip is characterised and it is shown that the fabricated chips are capable of implementing the model, resulting in biologically relevant behaviours such as activity-dependent reduction of the spatial variance of receptive fields. Complementing a fast synaptic weight change mechanism with a slow synapse rewiring mechanism is suggested as a method of increasing the stability of learned patterns.

40|$|Spike-timing-dependent {{plasticity}} (STDP) modifies the <b>weight</b> (or strength) <b>of</b> synaptic {{connections between}} neurons {{and is considered}} to be crucial for generating network structure. It has been observed in physiology that, in addition to spike timing, the weight update also depends on the current value <b>of</b> the <b>weight.</b> The functional implications of this feature are still largely unclear. Additive STDP gives rise to strong competition among synapses, but due to the absence <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> dependence, it requires hard boundaries to secure the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> dynamics. Multiplicative STDP with linear weight dependence for depression ensures stability, but it lacks sufficiently strong competition required to obtain a clear synaptic specialization. A solution to this stability-versus-function dilemma can be found with an intermediate parametrization between additive and multiplicative STDP. Here we propose a novel solution to the dilemma, named log-STDP, whose key feature is a sublinear weight dependence for depression. Due to its specific weight dependence, this new model can produce significantly broad weight distributions with no hard upper bound, similar to those recently observed in experiments. Log-STDP induces graded competition between synapses, such that synapses receiving stronger input correlations are pushed further in the tail <b>of</b> (very) large <b>weights.</b> Strong weights are functionally important to enhance the neuronal response to synchronous spike volleys. Depending on the input configuration, multiple groups of correlated synaptic inputs exhibit either winner-share-all or winner-take-all behavior. When the configuration of input correlation...|$|R

40|$|International audience—The {{identification}} of image regions associated with external variables through discriminative approaches yields ill-posed estimation problems.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, doubly robust estimators have been {{proposed}} {{for a variety of}} target parameters in causal inference and missing data models. These are asymptotically unbiased when at least one of two nuisance working models is correctly specified, regardless of which. While their asymptotic distribution is not affected by the choice of root-n consistent estimators of the nuisance parameters indexing these working models when all working models are correctly specified, this choice of estimators can have a dramatic impact under misspecification of at least one working model. In this article, we will therefore propose a simple and generic estimation principle for the nuisance parameters indexing each of the working models, which is designed to improve the performance of the doubly robust estimator of interest, relative to the default use of maximum likelihood estimators for the nuisance parameters. The proposed approach locally minimizes the squared first-order asymptotic bias of the doubly robust estimator under misspecification of both working models and results in doubly robust estimators with easy-to-calculate asymptotic variance. It moreover improves the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weights</b> in those doubly robust estimators which invoke inverse probability weighting. Simulation studies confirm the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Supplementary materials for this article are available online...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{effect of}} {{heterozygosity}} on the phenotypic <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> six morphological plant characteristics was studied in hybrid crosses of two self-pollinated barley species Hordeum vulgare L., emend Lam. and Hordeum distichum L., emend Lam. Experimental material consisting {{of parents and}} their F₁ diallel progeny were grown at two field locations and one greenhouse location {{in the spring of}} 1967. The phenotypic stability for plant height, kernels per spike, kernel weight, grain yield per plant and awn length was determined by the use of two statistics, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation. These statistics were computed on each individual plot based on measurements taken from three plants per plot. The mean coefficient of variation and standard deviation values representing the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> each of the entries were compared at each of three locations and across the three locations. Analyses of variance facilitated the comparison of four groups. Two of the four groups were composed of homozygous genotypes (parental groups) and two of the groups were composed of highly heterozygous genotypes (6 X 6 and 2 X 2 crosses). The associations between the phenotypic <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> all characteristics measured were studied by the use of linear correlations. Further, associations between the mean values of each characteristic measured and its phenotypic stability were determined. In addition, the association between the two statistics coefficient of variation and standard deviation utilized in this study as a basis <b>of</b> measuring phenotypic <b>stability</b> was determined by correlation studies. The results of this research indicated that the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> heterozygotes as a group was neither greater nor less than the homozygotes for any morphological characteristic when compared across the three locations. This would suggest that heterozygosity per se does not influence phenotypic stability over rather diverse environments. On the other hand heterozygosity did increase the phenotypic variation <b>of</b> kernel <b>weight</b> and plant height at the Klamath Falls field location. And, the phenotypic variation of tiller number was increased at the Corvallis field location. The phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> heterozygotes and homozygotes was greatest for all characteristics measured under the minimal environmental stress at the greenhouse location. The phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> kernel <b>weight,</b> plant height, kernels per spike and awn length were associated. Evidence also indicated associations between the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> plant height and the phenotypic <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> kernels per spike and awn length. Additional evidence indicated that the phenotypic <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> kernels per spike and awn length were associated. This association among the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> several plant characteristics may suggest a common control mechanism for phenotypic stability within the plant. If as the evidence indicated, the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> several plant characteristics are associated, the selection for levels <b>of</b> phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> one plant characteristic could lead to increased stability for certain other plant characteristics. It was found that the parents used in a hybrid barley cross can influence the phenotypic <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the hybrid. These results suggest the possibility of selecting parents which when crossed would result in hybrids which exhibit high phenotypic stability for particular morphological characteristics. The coefficient of variation and standard deviation were highly associated when used to measure phenotypic <b>stability.</b> The coefficient <b>of</b> variation was the most reliable of the two statistics because it was not influenced {{by the size of the}} mean as was the standard deviation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the {{quantization}} error for Dynamic Cell Structures (DCS) Neural Networks (NN) as defined by Bruske and Sommer provides a measure <b>of</b> the Lyapunov <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weight</b> centers <b>of</b> the neural net. We also show, however, that this error is insufficient in itself to verify that DCS neural networks provide stable topological representation of a given fixed input feature manifold. While {{it is true that}} DCS generates a topology preserving feature map, it is unclear when and under what circumstances DCS will have achieved an accurate representation. This is especially important in safety critical systems where it is necessary to understand when the topological representation is complete and accurate. The stability analysis here shows that there exists a Lyapunov function for the <b>weight</b> adaptation <b>of</b> the DCS NN system applied to a fixed feature manifold. The Lyapunov function works in parallel during DCS learning, and is able to provide a measure of the effective placement of neural units during the NN’s approximation. It does not, however, guarantee the formation of an accurate representation of the feature manifold. Simulation studies from a selected CMU-Benchmark involving the use of the constructed Lyapunov function indicate the existence of a Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS) state for the placement of neural units, but an example is given where the topology of the constructed network fails to mirror that of the input manifold even though the quantization error continues to decrease monotonically.

We hypothesised that after a 16 -week supervised exercise program, patients would maintain longer-term improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, liver fat and endothelial function. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: Ten NAFLD patients [5 / 5 males/females, age 51 ± 13 years, BMI 31 ± 3 [*]kg. m 2 (mean±s. d.) ] underwent a 16 -week supervised moderate-intensity exercise intervention. Biochemical markers, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2 peak), subcutaneous, visceral and liver fat (measured by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy respectively) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were assessed at baseline, after 16 weeks supervised training and 12 -months after ending supervision. RESULTS: Despite no significant change in body weight, there were significant improvements in VO 2 peak [6. 5 [*]ml. kg− 1. min− 1 (95 % CI 2. 8, 10. 1); P= 0. 003], FMD [2. 9 % (1. 5, 4. 2); P= 0. 001], liver transaminases (P 0. 05) and liver fat [1. 4 % (− 13. 0, 15. 9); P= 0. 83] {{were not significantly different}} from baseline.

50|$|The bike has an {{asymmetrical}} design, {{which means}} the left hand side has a different design and weight distribution than the right hand side. This allows for a better <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the bike, as the gear system is installed on only one side {{and needs to be}} counterbalanced in terms <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and power.|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} properties of porous high-pressure crystallized ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene containing vitamin E as a plasticizing agent and an antioxidant were studied. Two porous ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene samples, {{with and without}} vitamin E, were produced by mixing ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene powder and sodium chloride micro particles before the high-pressure crystallized process. A solid ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene without vitamin E additive was made as a benchmark. The porosities of both porous samples were evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of cross-sectional areas. The crystallinity of the composites was examined by thermal (differential scanning calorimetry) and spectral (X-ray diffraction) analyses. The short-term and long-term oxidative <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> porous ultra-high-molecular <b>weight</b> polyethylenes, with or without incorporated vitamin E, were investigated, respectively, by evaluations of differential scanning calorimetry oxidation induction time and Fourier transform infrared oxidation index. The tribological performance was also studied by a pin-on-disk test under lubrication with normal saline. The particulate size distribution of wear debris demonstrated the better biocompatibility <b>of</b> ultra-high-molecular <b>weight</b> polyethylenes with higher porosity. However, the antiwear capability and the oxidation resistance of the porous ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene were inferior {{to those of the}} solid one. These drawbacks were significantly reduced by the influence of the vitamin E agent...|$|R
30|$|The DTG {{curve of}} the sample shows an {{endothermic}} peak around 60  °C. This represents a weight loss due to the combustion of organic residues. A sharp endothermic peak positioned around 428  °C also indicates a change <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> suggesting the oxidative degradation of the sample. Thermal analysis confirms the thermal <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the nanocomposite in the temperature range.|$|R
