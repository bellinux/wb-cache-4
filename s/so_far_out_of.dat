40|$|XML {{has become}} a widely popular {{standard}} for storing and exchanging structured data, particularly on the Web. Many languages and language extensions have been proposed for manipulating XML data, {{and a number of}} these employ static analyses in order to statically guarantee the validity of their XML output against some schema. Among the XML manipulation languages, XSLT has been embraced as an XML-to-XML tranformation language, and although some research efforts have gone into statically analyzing the output of such transformations, no pratically useful analysis technique has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. We attempt to remedy this by designing such an analysis technique, conservatively approximating an answer for the property of schema-conforming output. Our analysis technique centers around a detailed analysis of the possible flow of template instantiations in the transformation, as well as the application of an abstraction, which has already proven useful in other contexts...|$|R

40|$|Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) {{are known}} to play im-portant {{functional}} roles in the cell. However, their identification and recognition in genomic sequences remains challenging.

40|$|We {{study the}} average {{performance}} of several neural-net heuristics {{applied to the}} problem of finding the size of the largest clique in an undirected graph. This function is NP-hard even to approximate within a constant factor in the worst case [ALM + 92], but the heuristics we study are known to do quite well on average for instances drawn from the uniform distribution on graphs of size n. We extend a theorem of M. Li and P. Vitanyi [LV 92] to show that for instances drawn from the universal distribution m(x), the average-case performance of any approximation algorithm has the same order as its worst-case performance. The universal distribution is not computable or samplable. However, we give a realistic analogue q(x) which lends itself to efficient empirical testing.
