At low Mach numbers, the tripped airfoil exhibits qualitative similarity with the behavior of the untripped airfoil.

The formation of the laminar separation bubble is found to have a favorable influence in delaying dynamic stall on the untripped airfoil flow. In both Mach number regimes, the tripped flow actually stalls at slightly lower angles of attack.

We show that Markov decision processes (MDPs) and the policy-gradient approach, or perturbation analysis (PA), can be derived easily from two fundamental sensitivity formulas, and such formulas can be flexibly constructed, by first principles, with performance potentials as building blocks. Second, with this sensitivity view we propose an event-based optimization approach, including the event-based sensitivity analysis and event-based policy iteration. This approach utilizes the special feature of a system characterized by events and illustrates how the potentials can be aggregated using the special feature and how the aggregated potential can be used in policy iteration. Compared with the traditional MDP approach, the event-based approach has its advantages: the number of aggregated potentials may scale to the system size despite that the number of states grows exponentially in the system size, this reduces the policy space and saves computation; the approach does not require actions at different states to be independent; and it utilizes the special feature of a system and does not need to know the exact transition probability matrix.

This work investigates 3 D effects which give the opportunity to better predict not only sensor sensitivity but also power dissipation. Experimental sensitivity values and 3 D FEM ones are compared for two different sensor geometries and two different heater temperatures. For a prototype having a heatercavity border distance of 340 mu m and a heater length of 230 mu m, maximum <b>sensitivity</b> <b>point</b> is obtained for detectors localized at a distance of 125 mu m from heater center.

Moreover, optimal detectors location shifts closer to the heater as heater length shrinks. We also show that if heater length is reduced by 80 % (from 230 to 50 mu m), then both electrical power and sensitivity decrease by 63 % and 55 %, respectively. So, best efficiency is obtained for shorter heaters. In addition, detectors length decrease is found to {{have a significant effect on}} sensitivity, with an increase of 58 % and 87 % using heater lengths of 230 mu m and 50 mu m, respectively.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study on {{performance}} optimization of Markov systems. As is well known, performance optimization {{plays an important role in}} both applied and theoretical research. Many practical systems arisen in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as in engineering and commerce fit Markov models. Hence, performance optimization of Markov systems attracts wide attention in many fields. First, we propose a new sensitivity-based performance optimization approach to theory of finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), including ergodic and multi-chain systems. The criteria to be optimized in this thesis are average opti-mality, bias optimality, and high-order bias optimality. Based on average reward and bias difference formulas derived in this thesis, we develop a complete opti-mization theory for average optimality and nth-bias optimality. We not only show the existence of average optimal policies and nth-bias optimal policies, but also give one-phase policy iteration algorithms leading to nth-bias optimal policies, in a unified way, which are more efficient than the two-phase algorithms in the previous literature. Our approach is simple, direct, natural and intuitive since it depends on neither Laurent series expansion nor discounted MDPs. Furthermore, we obtain some very interesting properties for high-order bias optimality. More precisely, we establish high-order bias optimality equations and prove that each nth-bias optimal policy has to satisfy the first (n+ 1) bias optimality equations. We also prove that a policy which satisfies the first (n+ 2) bias optimality equations must be an nth-bias optimal policy. With <b>sensitivity</b> <b>point</b> of view of optimization and fiexible construction of sen-sitivity formulas, we also propose an event-based optimization approach. This approach utilizes special feature of a system and illustrates how potentials can be aggregated based on the special feature. Aggregated potentials can be used to build two performance sensitivity formulas which lead to gradient based opti-mization and, with some conditions, event-based policy iteration. This approach applies to many practical problems that do not fit the standard MDP formu-lation very well. It provides structural insights and overcomes some difficulties associated with determining transition probability matrices in large state spaces...|$|E
