500|$|Rheinmetall {{introduced}} a larger 130mm tank gun at Eurosatory 2016 in June 2016. [...] Development commenced in 2015, financed entirely using internal funding, {{as a response}} to the Russian introduction of new generation armored vehicles like the T-14 Armata tank, and the first technical demonstrator (TD) was completed in May 2016. [...] The new 130mm gun has an L/51 chrome-lined <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> with a vertical sliding breech mechanism, increased chamber volume, no muzzle brake, a thermal sleeve, and a muzzle reference system (MRS) enabling it to be bore sighted on a more regular basis without the crew needing to leave the platform. [...] Compared to the 2700kg 120mm gun, the 130mm has a [...] barrel and an all-up weight of 3000kg including the recoil system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{essential}} part of any improvised firearm is the barrel and chamber. For small, low-pressure cartridges, like the common [...]22 caliber (5.5mm) rimfire cartridges, even very thin-walled tubing will suffice. Author Harlan Ellison describes the zip guns used by gangs in 1950s New York City as being made from tubing used in coffee percolators or automobile radio antennas, strapped to a block of wood {{to serve as a}} handle. A rubber band provided the power for the firing pin, which is pulled back and released to fire. The use of such weak tubing results in a firearm that can be as dangerous to the shooter as the target; the poorly fitting <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> provides little accuracy and is liable to burst upon firing.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 1839 Carbine {{features}} a standard [...] round barrel with a browned finish. [...] The other metal parts are blued. [...] Although the 24-inch barrel length is most common, [...] and [...] lengths were produced. [...] The overall {{length of the}} 24-inch carbine is [...] {{and the weight of}} the firearm is [...] [...] Unlike Colt Ring Lever rifles, the Model 1839 Carbine {{features a}} <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> that is chambered in [...]525 caliber. [...] The [...] six-shot cylinder features an elaborate roll scene including depictions of a naval battle, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and a hunter with lion. [...] The front and rear edges of the cylinder were originally square, though by late production, the rear cylinder edge was rounded. [...] Loading levers affixed to {{the right side of the}} frame were not present on early models, becoming standard during mid-production in August 1840. [...] The stock is varnished walnut and the buttplate features a rounded heel.|$|E
50|$|The first models {{featured}} rifled barrels, {{but this}} made loading {{a long and}} cumbersome process, resulting in all following models being manufactured with <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most early firearms, {{such as the}} blunderbuss, arquebus, and musket {{had large}} diameter, <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels,</b> and could fire shot as well as solid balls. A firearm {{intended}} for use in wing shooting of birds {{was known as a}} fowling piece. The 1728 [...] Cyclopaedia defines a fowling piece as: ...|$|R
50|$|The upper two <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> used 12.5×70 mm {{ammunition}} (40 gauge), and {{the lower}} rifled barrel used 5.45×39mm ammunition. The pistol {{could be used for}} hunting, to defend against predators and for visible and audible distress signals. The detachable buttstock was also a machete that came with a canvas sheath.|$|R
50|$|The Hirtenberger M6C-210 {{is a light}} mortar with <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> {{designed}} by Hirtenberger.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1961 the 572 SmoothBore had {{the same}} specs as the Model 572A except with a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel.</b> It was {{discontinued}} in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Short barreled {{shotguns}} (SBSs): This {{category is}} defined similarly to SBRs, but {{with either a}} <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> less than 18" [...] long or a minimum overall length under 26".|$|E
50|$|Category B (restricted) {{includes}} semi-automatic or repeating short firearms, single-shot short centerfire firearms, single-shot rimfire firearms {{less than}} 28 cm overall, semi-automatic long firearms with greater than 3-round capacity (including the chamber) (or {{which can be}} converted to such), repeating and semi-automatic long firearms with <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> less than 60 cm long, and semi-automatic firearms which resemble fully automatic weapons.|$|R
50|$|The term swivel gun usually {{refers to}} a small cannon, mounted on a {{swiveling}} stand or fork which allows a very wide arc of movement. Another type of firearm {{referred to as a}} swivel gun was an early flintlock combination gun with two barrels that rotated along their axes to allow the shooter to switch between rifled and <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some S&W model 29s were rebuilt by the AAI Corporation to {{make the}} Quiet Special Purpose Revolvers (QSPR). These had new, short, <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> (35 mm / 1.375 inch), with [...]40" [...] / 10mm bore, with {{cylinder}} chambers reamed to accept special QSPR ammunition which externally resembled metal-cased [...]410-gauge shotgun shells but internally worked as a piston to trap the gases. This special ammunition was made by AAI.|$|R

5000|$|Like all Model 1816 derivatives, the Model 1842 has a [...]69 caliber <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> {{that was}} 42 inches in length. The Model 1842 had an overall length of 58 inches and a weight of 10 lbs.|$|E
5000|$|The mortar is of {{traditional}} design with a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel,</b> round baseplate (350 mm diameter), bipod and sight unit and is generally available {{in three different}} ballistical barrel lengths, which is usually stated in the model's name: ...|$|E
50|$|An unusual but notable {{drilling}} is the TP-82, {{or space}} gun, is a short-barreled drilling pistol {{consisting of two}} 12.5 mm <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> over a 5.45 mm rifled barrel, with a detachable shoulder stock. It {{was developed by the}} Soviet Union as a survival gun for their space program, and was in use from 1987 to 2007, when it was retired {{due to the fact that}} the unique ammunition it uses had degraded too far to be reliable.|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} the Foster slug is the deep hollow in the rear, which places the center of mass very near the front tip of the slug, much like a shuttlecock or a pellet from an airgun. If the slug begins to yaw in flight, drag will tend to push the lightweight rear of the slug back into straight flight, stabilizing the slug. This gives the Foster slug stability and allows for accurate shooting through <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> out to ranges of about 75 yd.|$|R
50|$|Ball {{and shot}} guns {{resemble}} {{side by side}} double-barrelled shotguns, typically with pistol grips and flip up sights. The ball and shot gun has broad, shallow rifling in the chokes of <b>smoothbore</b> shotgun <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A short-barreled shotgun (SBS) {{is defined}} as: (1) a shotgun having a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> or barrels {{of less than}} 18 inches in length;(2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as {{modified}} has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length ...|$|E
50|$|A {{ratio of}} 2 between caliber and {{penetration}} was good by World War II standards and {{is explained by}} the late design and lack of penetration degrading spin (the 10H64 had a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> and fin stabilized shells). 200mm penetration {{would have been enough}} to defeat all existing tanks of World War II unless the angle of impact prevented proper fusing.|$|E
5000|$|Rentaka: Rentaka (or lantaka) {{is a term}} in Malay {{language}} for cannons smaller in calibre than lela, with long barrel and made from iron. This term is for differing these type of cannon from lela, which is bigger. These weapon mainly used in 16, 17, and 18th century. Filipinos still using rentakas in Philippine-American war. Rentaka is a swivel gun with <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel,</b> and is loaded from the front (muzzle loaded).|$|E
5000|$|The BB {{was once}} the most common air gun {{ammunition}} in the USA. A BB is a small ball, typically made of steel with a copper or zinc plating, of 4.5 mm/.177" [...] diameter. Lead [...] "Round Balls" [...] are manufactured in numerous calibers too; these are often 4.5 mm/.177" [...] diameter and designed for use in [...]177 caliber rifled guns normally used for shooting pellets. Steel BBs can be acceptably accurate at short distances when fired from properly designed BB guns with <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels.</b> Lead number 3 buckshot pellets {{can be used in}} [...]25" [...] caliber airguns as if they were large BBs.|$|R
5000|$|Duelling pistols {{had long}} <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> - {{typically}} around 10 in and fired large, heavy bullets. Pistols with calibers of 0.45 in, 0.52 in, 0.58 in or even 0.65 in were common. The bullets loaded in them could weigh [...] in [...]52 caliber, {{or more in}} larger calibers. Bullets were fired with a muzzle velocity of approximately 830 ft/s, which made a [...]52 caliber bullet about as lethal as a current [...]45 ACP round - and therefore capable of inflicting very severe wounds. These injuries, coupled with the primitive state of emergency medicine {{at the time when}} duels were commonplace, meant that pistol duels frequently resulted in fatalities, either immediately or a few days afterwards. This was the fate of Alexander Pushkin, a highly experienced pistol duellist who had fought 29 duels before being wounded in the stomach by Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès on 8 February 1837. Pushkin managed to return fire, slightly wounding d'Anthès, but died two days later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} meaning of Escopeteros (in Spanish) was those {{armed with a}} <b>smoothbore</b> long <b>barrel</b> firearm, sometimes a trabuco or blunderbuss, and {{has been used in}} this general context in histories of Spain and Latin America. It has been used to describe a pitcher in baseball, or a sniping journalist. It has also been used in the context of fighting to until victory [...] "El credo del escopetero".|$|R
50|$|For example, the Brown Bess musket, {{in service}} with the British army from 1722 to 1838, had a 19 mm (.75 inch) <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{roughly the same}} as a 10 gauge shotgun, and was 157 cm long, just short of the above {{recommended}} 168 cm (5 feet). On the other hand, records from the Plymouth colony show a maximum length of 137 cm (4 feet) for fowling pieces, shorter than the typical musket.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, rifling {{will have}} twist rates that {{increase}} {{down the length}} of the barrel, called a gain twist or progressive twist; a twist rate that decreases from breech to muzzle is undesirable, as it cannot reliably stabilize the bullet as it travels down the bore. Extremely long projectiles such as flechettes may require high twist rates; these projectiles must be inherently stable, and are often fired from a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rheinmetall Borsig {{proposed}} a new medium velocity gun with a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel</b> that relied on hollow charge ammunition to defeat tanks. The design used the High-Low Pressure principle where the high pressures {{generated by the}} propellant did not act directly on the projectile but instead seeped into the main chamber at a controlled rate. This allowed a very simple light-weight barrel with a conventional heavy breech. A simple light-weight carriage was designed for the weapon.|$|E
50|$|The {{ball and}} shot gun {{was invented by}} COL George Fosbery, VC, who in 1885 took out the English patent (patent number 7565) for a system of very shallow rifling in the chokes of <b>smoothbore</b> shotgun <b>barrels.</b> Fosbery {{immediately}} offered the patent to Holland and Holland, who bought it and from 1886 until 1899, when the patent expired, had exclusive rights to build this class of firearm, marketing it as the Paradox gun.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quality of}} the gun is high, with the main {{functional}} components being made from firearms quality steel and the plastic parts (trigger, main receiver housings, buttstock, lower magazine cover) being made from firearms quality fiber reinforced polymers. One item of note is the barrel, which is rifled steel and extremely thick and rugged for an airgun. Although such components do not translate into increased accuracy, they do tend to increase durability. For instance, the rifling does not significantly (if at all) increase the gun's accuracy; spherical projectiles demonstrate little, if any, accuracy differences between rifled and <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels</b> (moreover, steel shot will not engage the rifling in an effective fashion, instead riding {{on top of the}} rifling). However, the gun is manufactured by a company that also manufactures and designs military firearms (best known for their WWII production of the Tokarev TT-33 and M1895 Nagant revolver), and many of the parts are thus [...] "over engineered" [...] with military-style durability. The price of the Drozd is much higher than typical [...] "department store" [...] airguns, partly due {{to the use of the}} higher quality components and increased durability.|$|R
5000|$|Maynard and his {{financial}} backers founded the Maynard Arms Company in 1857, contracting the Massachusetts Arms Company to manufacture the new gun for {{civilian and military}} use. The guns, known as Maynards, were offered in [...]35 and [...]50 caliber, and could be purchased with interchangeable <b>smoothbore</b> shotgun <b>barrels.</b> A second army test resulted in a military contract for four hundred [...]50 caliber Maynard carbines, with the original long-range aperture tang sight replaced with a barrel mounted open sight. The Revenue Cutter Service (later the United States Coast Guard) and United States Navy ordered smaller numbers.|$|R
50|$|The K6 fires fin-stabilized {{ammunition}} from a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel.</b> Unlike its smaller ammunition cousins, the 81 mm and 60 mm mortars, the fin {{blades of}} the ammunition {{fired from the}} M120 are not canted. Thus, no spin is imparted to the projectile in flight. Although heavy mortars require trucks or tracked mortar carriers to move them, they are still much lighter than field artillery pieces. They outrange light and medium mortars, and their explosive power is much greater. An improved version {{is known as the}} K6A3.|$|E
5000|$|Daisy also makes, {{as part of}} the Avanti line, the Model 499B Champion, {{billed as}} the [...] "world's most {{accurate}} BB gun". This is a true competition BB gun, with a micrometer adjustable rear peep sight, a sling, and a precision <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel.</b> It is to be used with Daisy's precision-ground steel BBs that are made for the 499. The 499 is unusual in that it is a single-shot, muzzleloading spring airgun. The 499 is most commonly used in [...] BB gun competitions by youth groups such as 4H and Boy Scouts.|$|E
5000|$|The armour-piercing gun {{evolution}} {{has also shown}} up in small arms, particularly the now abandoned U.S. Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program. The ACR [...] "rifles" [...] used smoothbore barrels to fire single or multiple flechettes (tiny darts), rather than bullets, per pull of the trigger, to provide long range, flat trajectory, and armor-piercing abilities. Just like kinetic-energy tank rounds, flechettes are too long and thin to be stabilized by rifling and perform best from a <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrel.</b> The ACR program was abandoned due to reliability problems and poor terminal ballistics.|$|E
50|$|The bullet must tightly fit {{the bore}} {{to seal the}} high {{pressure}} of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally {{not much of a}} concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about 300 m/s, lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult to scrub out without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to 460 m/s, can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over 460 m/s, nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough temperature to reduce build-up in the bore. Copper build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed 760 m/s, and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels,</b> such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} was the fully rifled shotgun barrel by Hastings, a {{manufacturer}} of aftermarket shotgun barrels. Hasting's Paradox shotgun barrels were offered as aftermarket replacements for the most common brands of pump and semi-automatic shotguns and they quickly became popular with slug shooters. Hastings rifled shotgun barrels are designed for firing slugs and {{are not to be}} confused with barrels of the Holland & Holland Paradox gun. [...] "Paradox" [...] has been used by Holland & Holland of London since the late 19th century to describe large bore guns with the last few inches of the barrel rifled with a special [...] "ratchet" [...] style of rifling. Holland & Holland purchased the rights to the Paradox gun from the inventor, Col George Vincent Fosbery VC. They chose the name [...] "Paradox" [...] because shotguns are defined by their <b>smoothbore</b> <b>barrels,</b> and a [...] "rifled shotgun" [...] was something of a contradiction in terms. Holland & Holland's Paradox and Nitro-Paradox guns are not slug guns as they fire standard shotgun shells and cartridges with special Paradox bullets fully interchangeably. [...] Under normal circumstances, any firearm with a rifled barrel over 12.7 millimeters (.50 inches) is legally considered a destructive device in the United States. A BATFE ruling was obtained stating that a firearm designed to fire shotgun shells that was converted to fire shotgun slugs with the addition of a rifled barrel was still a shotgun, and thus not a destructive device. Now many manufacturers offer shotguns for sale with rifled barrels already installed. Bolt action and single shot break-open designs are particularly accurate, and with modern saboted slugs designed for use only with rifled barrels, the modern slug gun offers nearly the accuracy of a typical rifle.|$|R
5000|$|The Garland Trench Mortar was {{an improvised}} mortar used by Australian and British forces at Gallipoli during the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915 - 16. Developed {{early in the}} war by Herbert Garland, a pre-war {{metallurgist}} and superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel, {{it was the most}} numerous mortar of the Gallipoli campaign. A simple, improvised design the Garland mortar consisted of a <b>smoothbore</b> steel <b>barrel</b> fixed at 45 degrees to a solid wooden base. By means of a powder charge it propelled a variant of the Jam Tin Grenade. Its design meant that the whole weapon had to be turned to change its traverse and raised on a box to increase its range but despite these limitations it was reported to have done [...] "good work" [...] in the front line.|$|R
