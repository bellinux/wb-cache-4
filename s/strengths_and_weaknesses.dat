5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a new fuzzy multiple criteria decision making {{model for the}} evaluation of airline competitiveness over a period. The evaluation problem is formulated as a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making problem and solved by our strength-weakness based approach. For finding out the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> of an airline over another airline, we present a preference function based on the extended fuzzy preference relation. The <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> matrices are then calculated based on the preference function. We propose a method to aggregate the weights of criteria, <b>strength</b> matrix <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> matrix into the <b>strength</b> indices <b>and</b> the <b>weakness</b> indices of airlines, by which each airline can identify its own <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>weakness.</b> The <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> indices can be further integrated into an overall performance indices, by which airlines can identify their competitiveness ranking. Key Words: fuzzy multiple criteria decision making, airline competitiveness Airline competitiveness can be measure by a range of efficiency and effectiveness performance measures across a number of distinct dimensions that can reflect the capabilities and offerings of airlines in serving their customers. The performance evaluation of airlines ca...|$|R

A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E

Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing the <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> of the factions, {{the goal was to}} suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses.</b> The hero, while {{unable to}} use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses,</b> and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal, on {{the other}} hand, had {{deployed}} his forces based on the particular fighting qualities of each unit, taking into consideration both their <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses.</b> This aspect of Hannibal's leadership was highlighted {{in the use of}} a Spanish unit, the Balearic slingers, whom he placed behind the infantry to hurl their ranged missiles into the masses of Roman troops. He placed his Iberians and Gauls in the middle, alternating the ethnic composition across the front line, with himself at the front and center. Infantry from Punic Africa was on the wings at the very edge of his infantry line. These infantry were battle-hardened, remained cohesive and would attack the Roman flanks.|$|E
5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses.</b> Many {{practitioners}} believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player mode, Seeds of Evil features a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other in}} several game types.

For example, the Raptor is limited to close-range attacks, but is also extremely fast and agile. Multiplayer games in the Nintendo 64 version of the game support up to four players via split screen. In contrast, multiplayer games in the Microsoft Windows version support up to 16 players via LAN or internet.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{eventually}} {{resumed his}} naval career, first {{as an assistant}} to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful appraisal of the expedition's <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses.</b> In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something intrinsically more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried forward into later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a turn-based combat {{system in which}} party members and enemy Mirages take turns to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, {{with the exception of}} main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both inside and outside of battle. Similar to both Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tenseis battle systems, party members and enemies each have <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.|$|E
5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses,</b> and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E
