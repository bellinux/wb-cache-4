40|$|There {{is a large}} un-tapped {{potential}} for cost effective energy savings in the industrial sector due to barriers to the uptake of energy efficiency. The need to overcome these barriers has widely been stressed in literature. Amongst others, information barriers appear to be very relevant for {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Energy audits and energy management systems are important concepts to overcome these barriers and to help companies in achieving cost-effective energy savings. Instruments to promote both concepts have been established in many countries. Through Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the European Commission has further strengthened their relevance by requiring the European Member States (EU- 28) to develop <b>instruments</b> that encourage <b>SMEs</b> to undergo energy audits and to implement their recommendations. In addition, various Member States have also established instruments that target energy management systems in <b>SMEs.</b> <b>Instruments</b> addressing these areas are diverse in nature, but there is no up-to-date review of them. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a structured and comprehensive review of existing policy instruments targeting energy audits and energy management systems in SMEs including regulatory, voluntary, financial and information-based elements. Results indicate 50 instruments are in place in the EU- 28. Another 15 instruments have been identified across Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the USA. Within our analysis, we provide an overview of the different instruments by clustering them, and discuss the major design features of their implementation. Through our analysis, we intend to increase the transparency of the current implementation of policy instruments dealing with energy audits and energy management systems for SMEs in the EU- 28 and beyond. This shall enable researchers and policy makers to further enhance policy making on industrial energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The <b>SME</b> <b>Instrument</b> (SMEI) {{is a new}} {{consolidated}} {{funding scheme}} within Horizon 2020. It was introduced in 2014 as a dedicated tool to support high potential innovation, ultimately {{as a way to}} consolidate EU policy efforts to foster European competitiveness in advanced technologies in order to match its excellence in science. The expectations were pinned on small firms – the drivers of knowledge economy. There was never previously a tool dedicated exclusively to supporting the technological entrepreneurship of small and medium-sized companies in the European policy landscape. Therefore, the introduction of the <b>SME</b> <b>Instrument</b> was eagerly expected and widely welcomed by both policymakers and European small companies. However, both practitioners and experts have been growing increasingly frustrated with the pace and the rates of implementation of the Instrument. With the extraordinary rate of response from European SMEs that the Instrument received, it has so far been financially constrained in satisfying the demand, which has eventually led to some losses of investment and the neglect of talent. this report, we provide the description and initial analysis of the <b>SME</b> <b>Instrument,</b> as well as first lessons that can be extracted from the ongoing stream of applications. We first note that Europe has long been experiencing a paradoxical disbalance between its strength in scientific research and its low capacity in innovation. We illustrate how the need for a dedicated tool of technological innovation support within the European policy landscape has been growing, becoming increasingly recognised throughout the successive framework programmes. In essence, the design of the <b>SME</b> <b>Instrument</b> mimics that of the U. S. Small Business Innovation Research Program in its 3 -phase structure, amounts of the awards and focus on technology commercialisation. We analyse evaluation reports and academic literature of SBIR and provide initial comparison between the two programmes. What we note is that SBIR had multiple unexpected non-financial positive externalities, such as the facilitation of entrepreneurship culture, and we make multiple propositions about the likelihood of these effects occurring {{as a result of the}} <b>SME</b> <b>Instrument</b> funding. The report identifies three main policy implications based on first years of implementation of the SMEI: while it is extremely popular, it is way too competitive. The low probability of funding may discourage future applications once the hype for the new tool fades. Second, the variety of firms applying for the SMEI support discloses the variety of strategies and ways of coping with early stage lack of financing that exist in Europe. Many lessons can be extracted from the narratives of applicant firms and their business models. Third, there is still a lot of ambiguity about the 3 rd phase of the SMEI and the ways in which SMEI awardees can access further sources of European finance. Finally, the report profiles the proposals in terms of their technological area, country where the proposals submitted from, countries with the highest rates of funded proposals, size and age of applicant and successful SMEs, the amount of funding allocated. Eventually, we open up discontinuities in funding between phase 1 and phase 2 of the SMEI, calling them ‘Wasted Talent’. This data can be a source for ongoing research in innovation management. Among others, the paper provides initial insights into how the SMEI awardee data can be used for the analysis of fast growing firms across sectors, how the applicant and awardee data can be used in the evaluation of the SMEI as a policy tool, a comparative dimension with the US SBIR and how it is possible to study synergies with other entrepreneurship policies on the European and national levels...|$|E
30|$|Business {{coaching}} is {{the second}} management concept recommended by {{the authors of the}} paper, which would be instrumental to introducing the high-impact learning culture model and the attaining of the desired level of foresight maturity. The advantages of the coaching method are the following: the increasing effectiveness of entire companies, the optimization of decision-making processes, and more effective change management [59]. These advantages are naturally inherent in the concept of corporate foresight. Practicable coaching models are behavioural coaching based on the GROW model [57], a coaching model oriented to searching for solutions [60], and integrative coaching [61, 62]. In addition to the above mentioned advantages of the method, coaching has been recognized and is now being promoted by the European Commission, which, in the framework of the Horizon 2020 scientific research programme, has launched three calls for proposals under the Industrial Leadership pillar [63] in order to enhance the innovation capacity of companies through coaching services and through the implementation of an <b>SME</b> <b>instrument</b> that includes business coaching itself [64].|$|E

40|$|Evaluations of {{programmes}} {{are currently}} in vogue in the European context. Public programmes and other <b>SME</b> policy <b>instruments</b> are being evaluated by many different organisations. However {{the growing number of}} evaluations does not guarantee that government funds are wisely spent nor does it automatically improve the quality of actions, programmes or other policy instruments. This paper focuses on creating awareness among SME policy makers to consider evaluations as tools for learning in developing policies for SMEs. Based on the results from the evaluation, activities and resources can be directed to more effective means of action. An external evaluation can also encourage the SME policy makers to implement on-going internal evaluation procedures. This learning approach emphasises also the importance of qualitative methods {{to be used in the}} evaluation studies. At its best an evaluation helps SME policy makers to improve the entrepreneurial conditions. This also means that SME policy makers should have a better understanding of the types of evaluations and the advantages and drawbacks attached to each type. Otherwise the evaluation process lies too heavily on the expertise and interest areas of the person or organisation conducting the evaluation study. The paper is based on the evaluation literature including evaluation best practice recommendations as well as empirical evidence from several evaluation studies conducted by the authors...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies three {{horizontal}} {{policy instruments}} and two vertical ones in Chilean industrial policy, particularly regarding small and medium enterprises (<b>SMEs).</b> The horizontal <b>instruments</b> are (1) a guarantee program for borrowing by SMEs (FOGAPE), (2) a small subsidy to new exports that was applied from 1985 through 2003, and (3) the innovation subsidies {{provided by the}} Corporaci 3 n de Fomento de la Producci 3 n (CORFO). The vertical policy instruments are the activities of Fundaci 3 n Chile (FCh), a semi-public entrepreneur cum venture capitalist, and a CORFO program to attract foreign direct investment in information technology. Although most programs are well designed, they are numerous and insufficiently funded; Chile could benefit from a prioritization of needs and consolidation of these programs. Moreover, the instruments for making strategic bets on new sectors are particularly weak. In particular, FCh needs to refocus its activities on high-risk projects with long payoffs, something it cannot do with its small endowment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} challenges and prospects which sellers and distributors of agricultural input in the SMEs sampled from the City of Arusha face in accessing credit from financial institutions. The study aimed to attain three objectives, namely: To assess {{the nature of}} the SMEs in which the sellers and distributors of agricultural input belonged, identify the challenges faced in accessing financial credit and lastly to identify the strategies used in accessing financial credit from financial institutions. Both purposive and random sampling techniques were used to obtain 100 respondents from <b>SMEs.</b> The <b>instruments</b> of data collection were questionnaires and checklists. The findings from the study indicated a 50 % of the SMEs dealing with agricultural input in Arusha had registered as the Family Owned Businesses. Moreover, the retail traders were many (constituting 62 %) of the SMEs studied. Data revealed that 70 % of the total respondents faced the challenge of lack of collateral/security. Moreover, the SMEs operating in Arusha city are skewed more towards the internal sources of funding. The study concluded that the constraints faced in accessing credit from financial institutions inhibit the growth of SMEs. There study recommends {{that there is a need}} of reinforcing the Credit Reporting Act to regulate and focus on how to flexibility to accommodate SMEs. Furthermore, the government has to provide incentives and subsidy for the banks with outstanding records of lending to SMEs. It is also recommended that the Ministry of Industry and Trade need to intensify campaigns through the mass media aimed at educating the general public in Tanzania about the potentials of SMEs to the national development...|$|R
40|$|Scholars are in {{agreement}} that ‘innovation is the successful implementation of creative ideas within an organization’. This notion implies intricate interconnections between constructs. However, creativity per se would not lead to innovation. It must be coupled with conducive organizational climate to enable successful innovations.

As the key moments of development of instruments of the state support of SME are noted involvement of subjects of small and average business in implementation of the state contracts and their inclusion in again formed territorial and production clusters. In research it is shown that development of instruments of the state support of SME has to promote their production cooperation that in modern conditions is realized by means of participation in territorial and production clusters and will allow to carry out restructuring of SME in the direction of transition from trade and intermediary activity to innovative in real sector of economy. Relevance of this process in the conditions of realization of economic policy of import substitution is shown.

40|$|The Dutch Working Conditions Act {{requires}} {{employers to}} perform a Risk Inventory and Evaluation (RIE). Until recently, small business owners (SMEs) in particular were unhappy about this rather time-consuming obligation. However, the introduction of digital RIE instruments disseminated through the web has simplified the process enormously. This approach is strongly supported and subsidised by the Dutch ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. By using these digital <b>instruments,</b> <b>SMEs</b> can {{comply with the law}} cheaply and easily, and help to ensure a healthy work environment. This article describes the (legal) background and development of the digital RIE approach, focusing particularly on the SMEs sector. It touches on important features to keep in mind when implementing such an approach on a national level. Each sector has its own tailor-made instrument digital RIE with questions that are truly relevant to their particular field, related to its specific risks and providing detailed solutions. In the digital RIE project approach it was stipulated that if the digital instrument was developed and accepted by social partners, the members of the sector organisation would be subject to less severe enforcement by the Dutch labour inspectorate. The government and the sector organisations now need to publicise these <b>instruments</b> more among <b>SMEs.</b> It is also necessary to keep access to the web simple and to ensure the digital instruments are easy to use and kept up to date...|$|R
40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are very important}} to employment creation, poverty alleviation and the sustainable economic development of a nation. Encouraging SMEs, especially start-ups is crucial for sustainable economic growth. However, the failure rate of start-up SMEs in South Africa is one of the highest in the world. In reviewing the literature of the causes of the failure of start-up SMEs, access to finance emerged as a prime challenge. Start-up SMEs find it very difficult to obtain external finance from commercial banks and venture capitalists. The national and provincial governments in South Africa have realised that access to finance is a major constraint to the growth and survival of start-up SMEs and have put in place certain measures to improve access to finance by start-up SMEs. One of the primary measures put in place by government to improve access to finance by start-up SMEs is the provision of Business Development Service by some government agencies. This research investigates the role of Business Development Services Providers (BDSs) in improving access to finance for start-up SMEs. Questions arise as to why the failure rate of start-up SMEs is high in South Africa despite all these government measures aimed at assisting start-ups to access finance. Empirical research was conducted to investigate the role of BDS in improving access to finance by start-up <b>SMEs.</b> The <b>instrument</b> used for data collection was the self-administered questionnaire. The statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, T-test, ANOVA, correlation and regression analysis. The Cronbach‟s alpha was used as a measure of reliability. The results of the study revealed that: Access to finance is still a major problem hindering the survival of start-up SMEs. There is a lack of awareness of BDS providers and their services by the majority of start-up SMEs. There is a significant positive relationship between the use of BDS by start-up SMEs and success in accessing finance. Start-up SMEs that are aware of BDS do make use of the services. The results suggest that BDS are important to improving access to finance by start-up SMEs. However, {{there is a need to}} build awareness and encourage the use of BDS by start-up SMEs to improve their access to finance and ultimately increase their chances of survival...|$|R
40|$|Relationship {{marketing}} {{has received}} much {{attention in the}} last two decades from both practitioners and researchers as one of the strategies firms can employ to remain competitive. Despite this attention, little empirical research has been performed about relationship-marketing practices among SMEs, especially those in developing countries. However, it is now widely accepted that SMEs play a crucial role in economic development. Consequently, their effectiveness in relating to customers in a sustainable way is considered an important contribution to macro-economic development of industries as well as countries. This article intends to investigate the relationship-marketing <b>instruments</b> employed by <b>SMEs</b> in Uganda and to suggest practical tools that policy makers in developing countries can use to enhance SME competitiveness. The current study is part of a wider study to investigate the relationship-marketing practices of SMEs in Uganda and to propose a suitable model that can be used to improve their competitiveness. Data was collected from SME owner-managers, frontline employees, and regular customers to identify (1) the relationship-marketing <b>instruments</b> employed by <b>SMEs</b> and (2) their contribution to SME competitiveness. Findings revealed that the instruments employed vary between different SME sectors and that, in general, those SMEs that were perceived to be more relationship- marketing oriented had higher customer-satisfaction levels compared to those that were not. In particular, the mediating role of customer experiences was confirmed. The findings show that relationship-marketing practices are expected to have a big impact on SME competitiveness in Uganda. The study fills a gap in the existing literature on the relationship-marketing practices of SMEs in developing countries and establishes a foundation for future research in related fields.

Buscaram-se respostas quanto à indagação: Quão aderente é a estrutura conceitual proposta por COSO às pequenas e médias empresas de TI? Partiu-se de pressupostos presentes em pesquisas realizadas em outros países, as quais estudaram qualidade e efetividade dos controles internos. Adotando-se um enfoque qualitativo foram realizadas entrevistas com responsáveis pelas áreas financeiras de sete pequenas e médias empresas de tecnologia da informação, sendo que dessas, seis possuem auditoria externa independente. A metodologia da pesquisa utilizada é a análise de conteúdo, sendo operacionalizada através do NVIVO, versão 9. Os resultados apresentam onze categorias, dentre as oitenta e seis unidades de significado. A pesquisa sugere que a percepção dos responsáveis pelos controles internos em pequenas e médias empresas de TI como instrumentos ou processos operacionais, sendo que, em muitas situações o ambiente de controle, entre outros aspectos são deixados de lado. As empresas pesquisadas buscam conhecimento sobre o assunto em consultorias e na literatura. Dois dos aspectos apontam que uma estratégia prospectiva influenciam positivamente os controles internos, uma situação aplicável as empresa de TI tendo em vista a instabilidade de suas operações e os crescimentos existentes em curto espaço de tempo. Dentre os aspectos propostos por COSO, os aspectos relacionados com a atuação do conselho de administração, qualidades dos sistemas de informação, existência de auditoria interna, ainda estão em fase de aprimoramento ou mesmo, ainda inexistentes. This {{study was}} aimed at investigating the internal controls in the Small and Medium-Size Enterprises (SMEs) of information technology. Responses were sought on: How adherent is the said SMEs to the conceptual framework proposed by COSO? Our assumptions {{were based on the}} studies conducted in other countries, which expatiated on the quality and effectiveness of internal controls. By adopting a qualitative method interviews were focus on those responsible financial statements of seven IT-Based SMEs in the region of Campinas. Of these, six had independent auditors.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a new {{legislative instrument}} called “network contract,” {{which was designed}} to support inter-firm cooperation, in order to verify whether this type of formal cooperation represents a relevant driver of change in small firms’ strategic orientation in regards to internationalization. Results indicate that internationalization does not represent the main goal of firms participating in network contracts: Italian <b>SMEs</b> use this <b>instrument</b> to achieve different strategies of growth and long-term objectives. We found some firms that have increased their business activity abroad after joining the network; however, firms with a previous history of internationalization do not seem to have changed their approach regarding the international dimension. Consequently, the network contract is not qualified to be the most suitable tool for promoting internationalization among domestic firms, although internationalization may emerge as a by-product of inter-firm relationships. INTRODUCTION Globalization, increasing competition, and the recent financial crisis have severely distressed small and medium-size European enterprises (SMEs). Today more than ever, SMEs need to rethink their strategies and organizational structures in order to be competitive and survive in the long term. In this context, and especially in Italy, networking still appears to be the most viable way to compensate for SMEs’ shortage of capabilities and financial resources, to expand their product offerings, and to attain international expansion, thus helping firms escape from domestic market constraints and search for new opportunities for growth. 	Past studies have already established the positive influence of network relationships (latu sensu) in the internationalization process of smaller firms through the traditional stage-wise development models, including the network perspective (Welch 1992; McDougall et al. 1994; Bell 1995; Jones 2001); although few studies have argued that inter-organizational relationships do not always have a positive impact (Coviello and Munro 1997; Ritter and Gemünden 2003; Sasi and Arenius 2008; Mort and Weerawardena 2006). 	Among different forms of networks available to companies, we decided to focus our research on formal networks, namely the network contract,: an example of which is a new legislative tool introduced by the Italian government in 2009 to support company innovation and competitiveness. We believe that firms’ commitment (somehow implied by the creation of a common entity and the establishment of specific functioning rules as indicated by the law) and related formal links, may have greater influence on firms’ decisions than loose relationships characterizing other types of organizational networks, including industrial districts (Kontinen and Ojala 2011). We chose this instrument, called formal networks, as the national data indicates that it is widespread among SMEs (Rapporto Unicredit 2011; Unioncamere 2012) and not exclusive to large corporations: 75 per cent of firms involved have less than 50 employees. Moreover, we decided to focus on the network contract since our previous research (Aureli et al. 2011) found that it is a flexible and dynamic instrument, which can be used to undertake a plurality of strategic objectives such as international expansion. The increase in contracts between SMEs in all sectors as well as the plurality of planned objectives and programs as recorded by Cafaggi et al. (2012) is testament to this fact. 	Consequently, this chapter aims to analyze if and how the internationalization process of single nodes is affected by network relationships,; therefore our research question is: Does SMEs’ involvement in formal networks contribute to start or, augment, its international expansion? 	Analytically, we first reviewed national and international literature on SMEs’ international strategy and networking. Second, we examined formal objectives associated with existing network contracts. Then, we shifted our basic unit of analysis from networks to single node by sending a semi-structured questionnaire to 231 Italian firms (which correspond to the first-built 39 formal networks). Data obtained from respondents were used to evaluate the effectiveness (and the limitations) of this new tool in starting or improving small business internationalization. 	This chapter aims to fill the current gap in the literature which has mainly investigated consortia as contract-based collaborative instruments for exporting purposes (Bertoli and Bertuzzi 2002; UNIDO 2009), while very few studies (with the exception of practically-oriented) refer to network contracts. Moreover, it aims to shed some light on the existence of goals’ differences among the single nodes and the network as whole (previously under-researched) which can potentially impact the process of internationalization. 	Structurally, the chapter first describes Italian small business internationalization patterns, revealing whether they focus more on upstream or downstream market expansion, the preferred foreign market modes of entry, the relevance, geographic scope and duration of international activity. Second, it explores the usage of the network contract for the development of international strategies in comparison with other purposes that may have led small firms to undertake formal cooperation. Last, but most importantly, the chapter points out in which cases companies belonging to a formal network have succeeded in starting or improving their international expansion, revealing the role played by dimension, and companies’ goals and the pre-existing relationships...|$|R
