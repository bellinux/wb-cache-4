500|$|Spears {{traveled}} to Sweden {{to work with}} producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop, and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R group TLC; however, they rejected the track. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit record. By June 1998, the album had been finished.|$|E
500|$|The believability of the song's lyrics, which conveys love testaments {{as well as}} its {{timeless}} endurance, sung on sensual vocal arrangements by Beyoncé, who additionally {{adopts a}} sneering attitude, demonstrates her alter ego Sasha Fierce. Lyrically, [...] "Radio" [...] explores the relationship between Beyoncé as the female protagonist and the songs played on the radio, shown in the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that Papa allowed in my room with the door closed / We'd be alone / And Mama never freaked out when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> go boom / 'Cause she knew we were in the zone". Amy Linden of Vibe magazine felt that [...] "Radio" [...] could make an ideal [...] "valentine" [...] song because of its lyrical content.|$|E
500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped into my head, and I thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A Mr. Berdmore!" [...] Clara as she {{repeated}} the name felt convinced that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before, and that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> {{in connection with}} Mrs. Askerton. <b>She</b> certainly had <b>heard</b> the name of Berdmore pronounced, or had seen it written, or had in some shape come across the name in Mrs. Askerton's presence; or at any rate somewhere on the premises occupied by that lady. More than this she could not remember; but the name, as <b>she</b> had now <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from her cousin, became at once distinctly connected in her memory with her friends at the cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I took it a {{bit easier}} going to Bridge Street, but the evening seemed 'otter than ever, {{and by the time}} I got to the 'ouse I was pretty near done up. A nice, tidy-looking woman opened the door, but she was a' most stone deaf, and I 'ad to shout the name pretty near a dozen times afore <b>she</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right; good-by," [...] she replied as briefly, {{but with the}} faintest color. He {{wondered}} if <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> too.|$|R
500|$|... "I did {{all that}} {{stuttering}} in Logic. It's very, very complicated, slice by slice. You have to experiment a lot to make it work. I put Auto-Tune on individual syllables. Sometimes I use 40 tracks of audio just on one vocal track. Each has a different level and treatment, and then I do a composite. I couldn't do this with a normal analog studio setup. The starting and stopping thing, it's an idea I've had for [...] Normally, it takes about {{six months to a}} year for people I'm working with to understand my ideas. With Madonna, the first time <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> she loved it. She had a chemical reaction to it. She listened to it and she said, 'Okay, let's do it.' It's because of this that I love to work with her. You don't have to spend six months explaining things." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{one group}} number, [...] "Pure Imagination", {{received}} reviews that touched on the song itself {{as much as}} the performance. Fallon called it [...] "unsettling yet touching" [...] and Poniewozik described it as [...] "odd but perfect". Berk, on the other hand, characterized it as [...] "pure dreck". Benigno felt that while the song was [...] "really quite good", the [...] "stupidity of the scene" [...] it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of [...] "B+", while Gonzalez, when she gave it an [...] "A−", said she hadn't been a [...] "huge fan of the cover" [...] when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before the show aired, but it grew on her in context. Futterman wrote, [...] "The New Directions break into a restrained, tender take on [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] with lush harmonies on the chorus that's exactly right for the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} over a 12-day period on Granada's sets and on location around Manchester, following {{a week of}} rehearsals. It was shot entirely on film stock. For the climax involving the rose, Nesbitt was required to be nearly naked on an open set, save for a small pouch that was not visible on screen. There was a risk that production could be shut down if residents of the street they were filming on complained to the police, so the production manager ensured that Nesbitt was covered up {{when he was not}} being filmed. Filming the five-minute scene took about two hours. The song [...] "Female of the Species" [...] by Space was used throughout the programme; the instrumental version plays over the opening credits and the full lyrical version is heard during a first-act montage. The track was chosen by Langan after <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> on The Chart Show. The rest of the incidental music and the main end credits theme was composed by The Other Two. Adam's song was originally scripted to be Nilsson's [...] "Without You" [...] but the rights to the song were too expensive. The song was substituted with [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin".|$|E
50|$|Although Mitchell {{spoke to}} Elizabeth quietly, Mary Katherine thought Mitchell's voice seemed somehow familiar, but she couldn't {{pinpoint}} where or when <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Who brought it?" [...] {{asked the}} Queen, and when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>it</b> was Humfrey himself {{who was at}} the door, she bade him be called in.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Lord 'Ampstead, {{mind and}} {{be true to}} that dear young lady who was well-nigh heart-broke when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> as <b>it</b> were you who was smashed up." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing the}} material, {{president}} Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where {{half of the}} album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit. [...] "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to [...] "...Baby One More Time". The singer revealed that she [...] "didn't do well at all the first day in the studio , I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'." [...] By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oreal. ...Baby One More Time was released as Spears' debut album on January 12, 1999.|$|E
500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let them go,' {{said the}} wife of Iarlaid, when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>it.</b> 'My brother the Red Gruagach will take the head off Manus as well in Old Bergen as elsewhere.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite well. But {{the fact}} that old Crabtree is at large {{disturbs}} her very much. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>it,</b> <b>she</b> {{went over to the}} Lanings' home to stay." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of Talk That Talk, Giovanny Caquias of CultureBlues placed the song in a [...] "slut-core quartet" [...] {{alongside}} [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and [...] "Watch n' Learn". He explained that [...] "Roc Me Out" [...] "is more developed than the others, but still much too mediocre to become Rihanna's twelfth number-one single." [...] Reem Buhazza of The National wrote that [...] "Roc Me Out" [...] together with [...] "You da One" [...] and [...] "Talk That Talk" [...] are [...] "the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility". Laurence Green from MusicOMH labeled the track as [...] "a surprising late-album standout". Edward Keeble from Gigwise called [...] "Roc Me Out a [...] "vibrant track" [...] {{and concluded that the}} co-production by Rob Swire of Pendulum is [...] "evident on all facets of it". Tuyet Nguyen of The A.V. Club criticized the song by describing it as [...] "almost laughable". However, he also explained that [...] "Rihanna is a performer, not a songwriter", and what she sings is [...] "less relevant than what she sells: a provocation that is enough to seem empowering, but not so radical that it’s alienating." [...] Maz Halima from Flavour Magazine was unfavorable of the song in her album review of Talk That Talk, stating that when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> she was [...] "a bit [...] off" [...] because of its similar sound to Rihanna's single [...] "Rude Boy".|$|E
500|$|Martin showed Spears and her {{management}} a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", {{which was}} originally written for American group Backstreet Boys and R group TLC; however, when {{the song was}} submitted to them, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit record. [...] "We at JIVE said, 'This is a ... smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive at the time Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, later being revised to [...] "...Baby One More Time". Spears recorded her vocals for the song on May 2 and 3 of 1998 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The singer revealed that she [...] "didn’t do well at all the first day in the studio , I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing ‘… Baby One More Time’." [...] The track was produced by Denniz Pop, Martin and Rami, and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios. Thomas Lindberg played the guitar, while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. Spears also recorded a track called [...] "Autumn Goodbye", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to [...] "...Baby One More Time". The track was recorded in 1998 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey. [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was released as Spears's debut single on October 23, 1998, by Jive Records, when she was only 16 years old. The singer has named [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] as one of her favorite songs from her entire career, naming [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "He About to Lose Me" [...] as the other two.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dance Again" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop song, with {{a length}} of three minutes and fifty-seven seconds (3:57). It was written by Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat, The Chef, Enrique Iglesias, Achraff Janussi and Armando [...] "Pitbull" [...] Perez, who is also {{featured}} on the song. During an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Lopez stated that the song was nearly complete when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> and that she only changed minor details, but kept {{the message of the}} song the same. The electro beat begins, and the song kicks off with Pitbull's brief rap introduction. The beat of the song shifts from upbeat pings and claps to a bass backdrop as Lopez takes over the vocals.|$|E

2500|$|Despite her {{religious}} upbringing, Ruiz describes {{herself at the}} time as a skeptic and a [...] "Sunday morning Catholic". [...] A successful, sophisticated woman, Ruiz was embarrassed by Reyes' religiosity and was jealous of his affection for the dark-skinned Virgin. [...] While her husband was gone, Ruiz almost took down the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe (painted by Reyes) that hung in their home. [...] She decided to leave it up, however, and the next day as she walked past the painting, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> wish her a good morning. [...] She dismissed the greeting as a figment of her imagination or a signal of mental instability. [...] The next week, the painting greeted her again, and Ruiz felt a sensation that the voice was coming from the Virgin Mary. [...] Following the two auditory experiences, Ruiz began waking up early with a strong desire to attend six o'clock mass. [...] By the time Reyes returned, he found his wife much more open to his spirituality, and when he asked for her help to spiritually revitalize the family, she agreed.|$|E
