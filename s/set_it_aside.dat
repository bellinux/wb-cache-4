5|$|Madonna: An Intimate Biography {{is a book}} by American author J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{chronicling the}} life of American singer Madonna. The book was {{released}} in April 2001 by Sidgwick & Jackson in the United Kingdom, and in August 2001 by Simon & Schuster in the United States. Taraborrelli first considered writing the book in 1990, but, realizing the project might be premature in respect to Madonna's fledgling career, <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside.</b> He began writing the book in 1996, when Madonna {{gave birth to her}} daughter Lourdes.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} this summer retreat {{was in a}} secluded hollow. It had {{originally}} been owned by the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then {{became one of the}} many properties of the Portuguese king, João IV. He <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch. Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of João V.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside,</b> and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E

25|$|Heywood was a royalist presbyterian, {{and though}} he took no part in the insurrection under George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer, he disobeyed the order {{requiring}} a public thanksgiving for its suppression, and was accordingly apprehended and threatened with sequestration in August 1659. On the news that Monck had declared for the king, he breaks out in his diary into a psalm of praise. With the Restoration, however, his serious troubles began. Richard Hooke, the new vicar of Halifax, prohibited baptism in the outlying chapelries. Heywood continued to baptise, making his peace by sending the customary perquisites to the vicar. On 23 January 1661 his 'private fast' was stopped by authority. Among his parishioners an influential party, headed by Stephen Ellis of Hipperholme, the man of most substance in the chapelry, was in favour of the resumption of the prayer-book. A copy was accordingly laid on the pulpit cushion on 25 August 1661. Heywood quietly <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside.</b> At the instigation of Ellis, Heywood was cited to York on 13 September, After several hearings his suspension from ministering in the diocese of York was published on 29 June 1662 in Halifax Church. For two or three Sundays he persisted in preaching; within a month of the taking effect of the Uniformity Act (24 August 1662) he was excommunicated, the sentence of excommunication being publicly read in Halifax Church on 2 November, in the parish church of Bolton, Lancashire, on 4 January 1663, and again at Halifax on 3 December 1663. Hence {{attempts were made to}} exclude him from churches, even as a hearer; while, on the other hand, Ellis, as churchwarden, claimed fines for his non-attendance at Coley Chapel, under the statute of Elizabeth. John Angier, his father-in-law, admitted him to the communion at Denton Chapel, Lancashire; on 5 June 1664 he preached, by the vicar's invitation, in the parish church of Mottram-in-Longdendale, Cheshire; and on 13 August 1665 he preached at Shadwell Chapel, near Leeds, Hardcastle, the minister, being then in prison for nonconformity.|$|E
500|$|Enamorada de Ti (...) is {{the second}} remix album by American Tejano singer Selena. It was {{released}} posthumously on 3 April 2012 through Capitol Latin and Q-Productions. Enamorada de Ti was produced by Sergio Lopes, Leslie Ahrens, Andres Castro, Moggie Canazio, Cesar Lemons and Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica. Gatica had the idea of modernizing songs recorded by Selena into today's popular music genres. Selena's family had already {{been working on a}} similar idea, but they <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> in favor of Enamorada de Ti, which had gained the approval of Capitol Latin. The selection of artists to sing duets with Selena began in late summer 2011.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Original Soundtracks1 {{began with a}} two-week session in November 1994 at Westside Studios in London, and continued for another five weeks in mid-1995 at Hanover Quay in Dublin. [...] "Slug" [...] was originally titled [...] "Seibu", after the Japanese department store of the same name. [...] The song was written to create the visual of lights turning on at dusk in a city like Tokyo, beginning with [...] "tinkling" [...] opening notes resembling Christmas lights, and a gradually rising and falling synthesizer rhythm throughout the song. [...] After recording [...] "Seibu", the band <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside,</b> and the piece was forgotten as the sessions progressed.

500|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} to adapt [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into an animated film {{soon after the}} studio released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, but the project was ultimately abandoned when the story {{turned out to be}} [...] "a really hard nut to crack". According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1961 President John F. Kennedy—encouraged by Stewart Udall, an Arizonan who {{was then}} Secretary of the Interior—added [...] of cactus lands in the Tucson Mountains to the monument.

In the 1920s, the Tucson Game Protective Association had persuaded the Department of the Interior to withdraw about [...] in the Tucson Mountains from homesteading and mining and to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> as a park and game refuge. Land leased by the county in this set-aside became the Tucson Mountain Recreation Area in 1932. Between 1933 and 1941 CCC workers built structures at eight picnic areas in the county-park portion of the set-aside, five of which later {{became part of the}} TMD of the national monument. Their other projects involved road- and trail-building, landscaping, erosion control, and enhancing water supplies for wildlife. Kennedy's 1961 proclamation created the TMD from {{the northern part of the}} county park and renamed the original monument lands east of Tucson the RMD. Expansions in 1976 and 1994 brought the total TMD acreage to [...] In 1994 Congress elevated the combined TMD and RMD to National Park status.|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{house in}} London was {{destroyed}} by German bombing in May 1941, after which {{he spent much of}} his time at Alice Wimborne's family house at Ashby St Ledgers in the countryside of Northamptonshire in the middle of England. While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with Les Illuminations (1940), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1942), and Peter Grimes in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece. The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, calls it one of his finest achievements and [...] "a sure sign that he had thrown off the trammels of his cinema style and rediscovered his true voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Glen Keane, the film's {{original}} director, {{first began}} working on the story for what became Tangled about 14 years prior to its release, then directed the film's development from 2002 to 2008. In October 2003, the film was announced as Rapunzel Unbraided, as a computer animated feature scheduled for a 2007 release which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version {{and we had a}} couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside</b> and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." [...] In November 2005, Unbraided was pushed back to a summer 2009 release in order to give Keane [...] "more time to work on the story." [...] According to Ed Catmull, at one point Michael Eisner himself had proposed using modern-day San Francisco as the initial setting at the start of the film and then somehow transporting the heroine into a fairy tale world, but Keane could not make that idea work. [...] The film was shut down about a week before Catmull and John Lasseter were placed in charge of the studio in January 2006, and one of their first decisions was to restart the project and ask Keane to keep going with the film. It had originally been announced in April 2007 that Annie-nominated animator and story artist Dean Wellins would be co-directing the film alongside Glen Keane. On October 9, 2008, it was reported that Keane and Wellins had stepped down as directors due to other commitments, and were replaced by the team of Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, director and storyboard director, respectively, of Disney's 2008 animated feature Bolt. Keane stayed on as an executive producer and animation supervisor, while Wellins moved on to developing other short and feature films. After the film's release, Keane revealed that he had [...] "stepped back" [...] from the role of director because of a heart attack in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require <b>setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>aside.</b> First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to <b>set</b> Harmelin's sentence <b>aside,</b> <b>it</b> would necessarily have to reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant.
