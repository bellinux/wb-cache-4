A historical review of delayed failure of alumina scales and TBC s on superalloys is presented herein. Similarities with metallic phenomena suggest that hydrogen embrittlement from ambient humidity, resulting from the reaction Al+ 3 H 2 O=Al(OH) 3 + 3 H(+) + 3 e(-), is the operative mechanism. This proposal was tested by standard cathodic hydrogen charging in 1 N H 2 SO 4, applied to Rene N 5 pre-oxidized at 1150 C for 1000 1 -hr cycles, and monitored by weight change, induced current, and microstructure.

Long exposure times {{of up to}} 1000 h were used. At the lowest temperature, the material having 1 % yttria develops from the earliest stage of oxidation an α-alumina scale on the surface, leading to a more protective and thinner scale.

40|$|AbstractCatastrophic {{failure of}} thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs), usually occurs due to large <b>scale</b> buckling and <b>spallation,</b> primarily originating at the bond coat and TGO interface.

In this paper, a finite element model of the two and three layer TBC’s is developed in the commercial code ANSYS to investigate the buckle and interface delamination mechanisms and develop a simplified parametric understanding of these mechanisms. The models for simulation are validated with analytical and experimental results.

40|$|Restricted Access. Production {{rates of}} cosmogenic nuclides at the earth's surface are {{controlled}} by the intensity of energetic cosmic-ray nucleons, which changes rapidly with elevation. An incomplete knowledge of how nucleon fluxes vary with elevation remains a major obstacle to utilizing cosmogenic nuclides as geochronometers in applications requiring highly accurate ages. One problem is that attenuation characteristics depend on nucleon energy. Measurements of high-energy (> 50 MeV) nucleon fluxes tend to give shorter attenuation lengths than low-energy (< 1 MeV) fluxes, but these differences are not well characterized {{due to a lack}} of data at lower energies. Another problem is that the atmospheric attenuation length for nucleon fluxes varies with the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity (a parameter related to geomagnetic latitude), RC, and that there has been an incomplete mapping of nucleon fluxes at high RC (low geomagnetic latitude). We report new measurements of nucleon fluxes from altitude transects in Hawaii (RC = 12. 8 GV) and Bangalore, India (RC = 17. 3 GV). Our measurements in Hawaii of low-energy neutrons (median energy 1 eV) and energetic nucleons (median energy 140 MeV) confirm that nucleon scaling functions are energy-dependent in the range of energies at which cosmogenic nuclides are produced.

A scanner method and a Finite Element model {{have been developed to}} evaluate the critical strain for scale cracking and removal after cantilever bending. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), together with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), energy diffraction spectrum (EDS) and X-ray element mapping analysis, was used to characterize the scale before and/or after bending test. The effects of laying temperature, cooling conditions, ageing time, relative humidity and temperature, and coil positions on scale cracking and removal behaviour were studied. It was found that laying temperature has a larger effect on descalability than cooling conditions. The effect of relative humidity and temperature on descalability depended on a critical holding time. Beyond it, relative humidity and temperature had no further effect on descalability. The higher the environmental temperature, the less the critical holding time. Ageing time had an effect on descalability, but the effect was relatively small. Failure in tension started with first cracks formed at the places with high stress concentration. As tensile strain increased, new cracks formed midway between the existing cracks.

The first type was a crystalline scale with an irregular outer surface composed mostly of wustite, and a negligible amount of magnetite. The second type was the classical three-layer scale composed of wustite, magnetite and hematite. In general, the experiments showed that the furnace atmosphere, oxidation time and temperature influence the phase composition of the scales. Low carbon steel was oxidized in air over the temperature range 600 - 1200 °C for 120 s to approximate the formation of secondary and tertiary scale in hot rolling. The mole fraction of wustite, magnetite and hematite was determined by the direct comparison method The phase composition of the scales changed with temperature and time. During the initial 30 s of oxidation, wustite was the predominant phase in the temperature range 800 - 1200 °C, and as oxidation proceeded, the percentages of magnetite and hematite increased. In addition, the texture of the scales was investigated by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM); it was found that temperature influences the texture of the scales. The experiments indicated that 850 °C is the ideal temperature for the finishing mill in order to reduce surface defects and work roll wear. The adhesion of scales formed in air on low carbon steel in continuous heating and isothermal conditions was investigated with a four-point bending test. The separation (crack) always occurred inside the scale indicating that the strength of the scale is lower than the strength of the scale/steel interface.

The principle change that did occur was {{a reduction in}} the sulfur content from 10 ppmw to 3 ppmw after 25 cycles at 1120 C. These observations are used to support the model of Al 2 O 3 scale adherence put forth by Smeggil et al. which claims that Al 2 O 3 <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> occurs due to sulfur segregation and bond deterioration at the oxide-metal interface...|$|E

Characterization of the oxidized specimens was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The {{results show that the}} oxidation kinetics of Cu- 38 at. %Zn alloy obeys parabolic law. The activation energy during oxidation of the alloy is calculated to be 176 kJ mol - 1, based on the parabolic growth constant analyses. An external ZnO oxide scale, internal ZnO oxide and a Zn depletion zone on substrate formed after alloy oxidation are discussed.

40|$|CMSX- 4 is a single-crystalline Ni-base {{superalloy}} {{designed to}} be used at very high temperatures and high mechanical loadings. Its excellent corrosion resistance is due to external alumina-scale formation, which however can become less protective under thermal-cycling conditions. The metallic substrate in combination with its superficial oxide scale has to {{be considered as a}} composite suffering high stresses. Factors like different coefficients of thermal expansion between oxide and substrate during temperature changes or growing stresses affect the integrity of the oxide scale. This must also be strongly influenced by the thickness of the oxide scale and the substrate as well as the ability to relief such stresses, e. g., by creep deformation. In order to quantify these effects, thin-walled specimens of different thickness (t = 100500 lm) were prepared. Discontinuous measurements of their mass changes were carried out under thermal-cycling conditions at a hot dwell temperature of 1100 C up to 300 thermal cycles. Thin-walled specimens revealed a much lower oxide-spallation rate compared to thick-walled specimens, while thinwalled specimens might show a premature depletion of scale-forming elements. In order to determine which of these competetive factor is more detrimental in terms of a component’s lifetime, the degradation by internal precipitation was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Additionally, a recently developed statistical spallation model was applied to experimental data [D. Poquillon and D. Monceau, Oxidation of Metals, 59, 409 – 431 (2003) ]. The model describes the overall mass change by oxide <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> during thermal cycling exposure and is a useful simulation tool for oxide <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> processes accounting for variations in the specimen geometry. The evolution of the net-mass change vs. the number of thermal cycles seems to be strongly dependent on the sample thickness...|$|E
40|$|The cyclic {{oxidation}} {{performance of}} a Fe-Cr-modified silicide coating on Nb-alloy C- 103 was evaluated in air at temperatures between 1100 and 1500 degrees C and the microstructural changes examined. The coating was oxidation resistant and the duration of protection increased from 60 minutes at 1100 degrees C to 255 minutes at 1500 degrees C. The formation of the surface glassy silica layer {{and its ability to}} heal the cracks in the coating enhanced the oxidation performance at high temperatures.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the effects of}} single or {{combined}} minor additions of Zr, Hf, Ti and C on the oxidation behaviour of Y-containing, FeCrAl alloys have been studied. For this purpose high-purity, model alloys with single or multiple minor alloying additions were used. The results of long term discontinuous oxidation tests and detailed kinetics studies using thermogravimetry were complemented with extensive microstructural characterisation of the formed alumina scales using SEM and STEM. Hence, the oxidation kinetics and <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> rates and failure modes were correlated with the oxide composition and microstructure. The results demonstrate that the frequently reported positive effect of Zr, Hf and Ti on the lifetime oxidation behaviour of FeCrAl alloys can only be fully exploited if the concentrations of the above elements are carefully adjusted and the interaction with typical alloy impurities, such as carbon, is considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of molybdenum addition and alloymicrostructure on the oxidationbehaviour of aTi– 46. 8 Al– 1 Mo– 0. 2 Si alloy was studied in air at temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 °C. The alloy produced by arc melting exhibited {{a structure of}} coarse lamellar grains in as-cast condition that transformed to a duplex microstructure after hot extrusion at 1300 °C. Oxidation rate and <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> resistance were not affected {{by the type of}} microstructure. The effect of molybdenum addition was related to the formation and thickening of a protective continuous nitride layer. The low mass gain measured can be associated with the low oxidation rate of the nitride layer. Finally, the poor spalling resistance of the oxide scale at 900 °C was attributed to the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of the oxide scale and the nitride layer. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the main effects}} of sulfur impurity content on the cyclic oxidation resistance of single crystal superalloys, with emphasis on scale and TBC adhesion. Eleven hundred degrees C cyclic oxidation of PWA 1480 produces <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> leading to a weight loss of more than 30 Mg/sq cm after 500 one-hr cycles for a sulfur content of 6 ppmw. The sulfur content was reduced to levels below 0. 1 ppmw by hydrogen annealing, resulting in weight gains of only 0. 5 to 1. 0 Mg/sq cm after 1000 one-hr cycles. Samples were produced with various sulfur contents by adjusting the annealing temperature, time, and sample thickness (i. e., diffusion product Dt/L(exp 2)). The subsequent cyclic oxidation behavior, mapped over a sulfur content/thickness diagram, shows a transition to adherent behavior at sulfur levels equivalent to 1 monolayer of total segregation.

Argon annealing of lanthanum sol-gel coatings have been performed at various temperatures. Kinetic results show that lanthanum sol-gel coatings lead to a lower oxidation rate compared to blank specimens. On blank 330 specimens <b>scale</b> <b>spallation</b> is observed after cooling to room temperature. On the non-annealed sol-gel coated specimen and the argon annealed specimens at 600, 800 or 1000 °C, the oxide scale formed at 900 °C is adherent after 48 hours isothermal oxidation. The adherent oxide scales are convoluted. It results from o an anionic and a cationic mixed diffusion process in the chromia scale Thermal cycling tests on lanthanum the sol-gel coated specimen show that the oxide scale remains adherent after 250 cycles.
