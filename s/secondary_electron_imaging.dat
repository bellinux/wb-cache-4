25|$|In <b>{{secondary}}</b> <b>electron</b> <b>imaging,</b> or SEI, {{the secondary}} electrons are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E

It consists of a stand-alone real-time scanning and imaging instrument based on a Compact Reconfigurable Input/Output (Compact RIO) device from National Instruments™. It {{is based on a}} real-time controller, a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), input/output modules and Ethernet connectivity.

Prior to labelling, cellular membranes are removed by tritonization and antigens of non-interest blocked by serum incubation. Adhesion plaque-associated vinculin and S-phase nuclei were both separately labelled with a 1. 4 nm gold colloid and visualized by subsequent colloid enhancement via silver deposition.

40|$|The ORIONR PLUS {{scanning}} helium ion microscope (HIM) images at sub nanometer resolution. Images of the <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> emission have superior {{resolution and}} depth of field compared to a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ionoluminescent imaging is not {{an area that has}} been extensively explored by typical ion beam systems as they have large spot sizes in the region of microns, leading to poor spatial resolution. This thesis confirms that the ORIONR PLUS can form images from the ionoluminescent signal, resolutions of 20 nm can be obtained for images of bright nanoparticles. Ionoluminescence spectra can also be obtained from some samples. The position of emission peaks in samples under the ORIONR PLUS does not deviate significantly from cathodoluminescence (CL) peaks under SEM. However, the relative heights of the emission peaks in a sample can vary between ionoluminescence (IL) and CL. In addition, It is found that there exists a proportional relationship between acceleration voltage and ionoluminescent signal in the ORIONR PLUS, this relationship is also exhibited in CL. However, when normalised for current and acceleration voltage {{there appears to be no}} samples that show greater luminescence under ionoluminescence than cathodoluminescence, with ionoluminescent intensities up to an order of magnitude lower. Ionoluminescence under the ORIONR PLUS is found to be a poor candidate for the analysis of direct band gap semiconductors, this is attributed to the smaller interaction volumes and achievable beam current of the ORIONR PLUS. It is also found that some direct band gap materials are very susceptible to beam damage under the ion beam at beam doses typically used for <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> (SE) <b>imaging.</b> It is possible to obtain simultaneous IL and SE images of organic fluorospores in a biological sample. However, the luminescence of the fluorospores was only just sufficient to form images with a 200 nm resolution.

It has a distinct microstructure made up of: prepolymerized beads, an interbead matrix polymer, a radiopacifier {barium sulphate (BaS 04) or zirconium dioxide (Zr 02) }, and pores or voids; the radiopacifier is found only in the interbead matrix of the cured bone cement. The mechanism of slow or fatigue crack growth appears to be initial micro-cracking through the interbead matrix, followed by coalescence of the microcracks to form a continuous crack.
