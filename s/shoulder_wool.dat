40|$|This study {{determines how}} levels of various trace metals in wool and the colour of the fibre {{change as a}} result of {{sunlight}} exposure and treatment with chelating compounds during wool growth. Twenty-four yearling Merino sheep were clipped on the shoulders and rumps and fitted with sheep coats modified with transparent patches. Patches over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>wool</b> (one per sheep) were either polyethylene (PE) that transmits ultraviolet light or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that excludes ultraviolet light. The rump wool on each sheep was treated either with a copper chelator treatment (kojic acid or methyl gentisate in aqueous alcohol) or aqueous alcohol only. For 12 of the sheep the rumps were exposed to sunlight through PE patches while rump wool on the other sheep was covered by the sheep coat. Wool was harvested after 11 weeks’ growth with yellowness (Y-Z) and individual mineral contents measured using the same clean wool sample. Sunlight exposure through PE patches caused a mean increase in Y-Z to 9. 1 (shoulder) or 9. 5 – 10. 1 (rump) from a base level of 7. 1 – 7. 2 (shoulder) or 7. 0 – 7. 6 (rump) in wool protected by the sheep coat. In contrast, there was no significant change in Y-Z for the PVC patch (shoulder). Therefore, it appears that ultraviolet light damage caused the increased Y-Z. Most of the trace metals analysed increased in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>wool</b> exposed to sunlight but the paired differences for PVC were lower than PE. It appears that changes in fibre caused by sunlight exposure (especially ultraviolet light) facilitate adsorption of minerals from the environment, including the animal’s own suint. Application of the chelating compounds to the rump wool caused pronounced yellowing of the wool with Y-Z increase being most pronounced for kojic acid. Copper levels in the wool were reduced by kojic acid and methyl gentisate while calcium levels were increased by kojic acid and reduced by methyl gentisate. It is not clear from these findings whether minerals and copper in particular contribute to yellowing of wool. However, the different effects of sunlight and chelation on mineral contents in wool shown may well relate to alternative mechanisms of discoloration (i. e. photoyellowing versus bacterial) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out, {{measuring}} the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability of the shoulder, thigh and tail wool, and analysing the correlations {{of the degree of}} the fiber fineness and its variability between the tail and <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool</b> in lamb's docking time of the Corriedale sheep, with the object of determining whether the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability over the fleece of the adult sheep can be predicted and so whether the sheep uniform in the degree of the fibre fineness over the fleece can be selected, by discrimirating macrcscopically the degree of the fiber finenes and its variability of the tail wool in the early age of lamb. A total of 12 Corriedale lambs was used in this study. A few staples on the threes body regions were cut from each lamb on the day of docking, and the wool samples to be examined were taken from these staples. The samples were washed by immersing them in bath of ether, and were then mounted with balsam, and microscopically examined. The diameters of the wool fibres were subsepuently measured with an ocular, micrometer and then the coefficients of variation of the degree of the fibre fineness were calculated. The results obtained are as follows; 1. In general, the mean diameter of the tail wool was greater than those of the <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool</b> in such early age as in dccking time of the Corriedale lamb. 2. In the early age of lamb, relatively high positive correlations of the degree of fibre finenss between the tail and <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool</b> were found and thus, {{it can be said that}} more the mean diameter of the tall wool greater, the more those of the <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool</b> greater. 3. Positive correlations of the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness were found between the tail and the <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool,</b> and especially between the tail and thigh wool, a high correlation of the variability of the degree of the fiber fineness was found. So it may be concluded that generally the more the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the tail wool greater, the more those of the <b>shoulder</b> and thigh <b>wool</b> greater, especially the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the thigh wool greater. 4. It seems that the degree of the fiber fineness and its variability of the adult fleece can be predicted, and a selection of the sheep uniform in the degree of the fibre fineness over the fleece can be made by discriminating macroscopically the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability in the early age of lamb of the corriedale sheep. The auther is grateful to the Tsuyama livestock farm of the Okayanma prefecture, for their help and for providing all the wool samples tested...|$|R
500|$|... 0n 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for {{the first}} time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, {{formation}} flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured <b>shoulder</b> with <b>wool,</b> held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|R

The Spanish replaced this image with that of the Virgin of the Remedies. Very early on 8 September, residents and pilgrims come to the pyramid and sanctuary to sing [...] "Las mañanitas" [...] and carrying paper lamps. This is the most important religious event in the city, with events related to it on almost every block. This event brings in people from all parts of the city and from many parts of the region. One tradition associated with this is the exchange of small gifts among the strangers in the crowd. Traditional dress is usually worn only for this event. For women, this includes a black or dark blue skirt, with trim in magenta, or emerald green, a wrap belt tied on the hip, a blouse embroidered with flowers, a rebozo or neckerchief, with earrings and a cross of silver. Men wear loose pants and shirts of natural cotton cloth, huaraches, a wrap belt with one end hanging loose in front, and <b>wool</b> <b>shoulder</b> wrap decorated with geometric designs and a palm frond hat. Concurrent with the feast of the Virgin from the 1 to the 16th of September is the regional fair. The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.|$|R

The trueque, while still practiced in its original form, has also evolved into this regional fair, called the Feria de Cholula. It features local food and music, culminating on Mexico's Independence Day.The next most important citywide event is called the Bajada de la Virgen, which also involves the Virgin of the Remedies. This time, instead of the masses climbing the pyramid to honor her, she comes down for two weeks in May or June to visit the various neighborhoods and surrounding rural communities. The tradition of bringing down the image from the pyramid began in 1825. The next occurred in 1870 and the third in 1890. Today, it is an annual event, but it is not the original image which leaves, rather it is a substitute. The reason for this is that the processions take a toll on the ancient image. The replicas of the image are considered to be [...] "sisters" [...] to the original, with the impression that it is the idea of the Virgin which is important, not the physical image. The last time the original image left the church was in 1999, due to the earthquake. It was kept at the monastery of San Gabriel until it could be returned after repairs. During the Bajada, the image is carried through the streets in some portion of the city every morning, which has been prepared with elaborate gateways of flowers, and more decorating the route. When the image comes down off the pyramid, she travels through all ten neighborhoods three times in an event called the [...] "circulares." [...] Each circulare is dedicated to a different saint, and presided over by a mayordomo. Each neighborhood sponsors one of the circulares every ten years, providing food and drink, incense and other necessities for the rite. She descends again on August 11, all the way to the town of San Luis Tehuiloyocan.|$|R
