5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and <b>short-sighted</b> decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He {{argued that the}} United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from <b>short-sighted</b> executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually <b>short-sighted</b> because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the <b>short-sighted</b> Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E
5|$|This <b>short-sighted</b> belief had a {{detrimental}} {{impact on}} the tactical effectiveness of RAF Fighter Command until the summer, 1940. With German bombers perceived as the only prey, AOC Fighter Command Hugh Dowding and his planners devised a system and tactics which used unwieldy and tight fighter formations to bring the RAF fighters into combat with bombers, followed by set-piece tactics for the engagement. Because the bomber's return fire was considered so dangerous, fighter pilots were trained to open fire at long range, 300 to 400 yards, then break away without closing to short-range. These tactics, practised so thoroughly over the years, proved totally useless in the battle situation facing them over Britain in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was <b>short-sighted,</b> mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which {{took a long time to}} dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named <b>short-sighted</b> leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, Chauvel was {{promoted}} to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement {{in the face of}} defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of <b>short-sighted</b> politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin's government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.|$|E
25|$|The Melians {{argue that}} though the Athenians are far stronger, {{there is at}} least a slim chance that the Melians could win, and they will regret not trying their luck. The Athenians counter that this {{argument}} is emotional and <b>short-sighted.</b> If the Melians lose, which is highly likely, they will come to bitterly regret their foolish optimism.|$|E

25|$|The losing bid by the Brisconnections {{consortium}} incorporated three {{lanes of}} traffic {{in each direction}} (as opposed to two lanes for the winning bid). With a price difference of A$20million the decision to build a two-lane tunnel was criticised in some circles as <b>short-sighted.</b> Brisconnections won the tender for the Airport Link with a similarly aggressive bid that requires almost double the traffic anticipated by government to be successful.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} various parties who {{question}} {{the capability of}} the numerous expressways in Klang Valley to overcome traffic congestion, which does not show signs of improvement {{with the construction of}} new expressways. Three chief factors were blamed for the urban expressway congestion, namely the <b>short-sighted</b> policies by the authorities, greedy property developers, and the failure of local municipal councils to control the development in the Klang Valley.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} his life, in 1832, Losh criticised {{publicly}} {{his fellow}} coal owners for a <b>short-sighted</b> view, in leaving pitmen illiterate. One owner who heeded him was Robert William Brandling. The context was the rise in the early 1830s of the North-East Pitmen's Union: Brandling who chaired the local coalowners had addressed Losh in the Newcastle Chronicle on the union's power, while Losh had publicly denied the owners were a cartel.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 1203, {{in an act}} of <b>short-sighted</b> zeal some Crusaders went to {{the city}} and set the mosque, located outside the city walls, on fire. The fire spread, {{destroying}} not only the mosque, but countless homes and churches. The fire was the worst to hit Constantinople since the Nika riots of 532, under the reign of Justinian I. A few days later, the Crusaders demanded their payment once again. When Alexios IV told them of the situation, war became unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|The {{revision}} of her fame and {{status as an}} author {{began in the early}} decades of the 18th century and led to manifest defamations in the 19th and early 20th centuries: she became seen as a scandalous female author who, some critics audaciously asserted, did not deserve to be ever read again. Later critics, however, looked back on the conclusions of Richetti and others were <b>short-sighted</b> and perhaps even outright misogynistic and more reflective of their era than of general historic scholarship on the author as an important political satirist.|$|E
25|$|A few {{well-known}} people {{fought on}} the Republican side, such as English novelist George Orwell (who wrote Homage to Catalonia (1938), {{an account of}} his experiences in the war) and Canadian thoracic surgeon Norman Bethune, who developed a mobile blood-transfusion service for front-line operations. Simone Weil added herself {{for a while to}} the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti, though fellow fighters feared she might inadvertently shoot them because she was <b>short-sighted,</b> and tried to avoid taking her on missions. By the account of her biographer Simone Petrement, Weil was evacuated from the front after a matter of weeks because of an injury sustained in a cooking accident.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Derbyshire for the 2008 season, playing as their overseas player when Mahela Jayawardene declared himself unavailable {{due to his}} commitments with Sri Lanka and the Indian Premier League, and has since become the temporary captain after the resignation of Rikki Clarke. Despite being both <b>short-sighted</b> and colourblind (a fact that was said to put him at a bigger disadvantage when using the pink ball for the first day-night test against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval), Rogers has proven {{himself to be a}} sharp player both at and away from the crease. Rogers has also played for Shropshire, representing them during one match of the C Trophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{disastrous}} {{consequences of}} the erroneous and <b>short-sighted,</b> during the reigns {{of the first two}} Vasa kings, Cossack policies of the Polish Republic of Nobility were about to make their impact, first of many. In April and May 1648, in the Battle of Zhovti Vody and the Battle of Korsuń the joined Cossack-Tatar forces completely destroyed the Crown army, capturing Crown Hetmans Mikołaj Potocki and Marcin Kalinowski. Thousands of Registered Cossacks, sent into combat with the Polish forces, were persuaded by the rebels to change sides. As a result of the dramatic events, vast expanses of Dnieper Ukraine became engulfed in the spreading social upheaval and the region's separation from the Polish kingdom had begun.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{report found}} serious {{shortcomings}} to China’s national innovation system. There were problems with services to help turn S work into {{results and the}} allocation of national funding to support S was far from optimal. Sometimes researchers became <b>short-sighted</b> if they {{get too close to}} the market. Another serious problem was that companies facing severe competition looked first to purchase foreign technology rather than investing in developing technology and technology development capacity at home in China. Many of the patent applications came from medium-sized enterprises (70%) since small enterprises invest little in research. China's hierarchical, top-down society where authority is greatly respected and feared has been argued to stifle creative debate.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett's studies {{relating}} to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals. The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, {{with the result that}} some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that this is not only <b>short-sighted,</b> but it questionably presumes that the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.|$|E
25|$|The Poona Division's {{had planned}} on {{a maximum of}} 6 percent of the {{division}} becoming casualties. In addition to each battalion's surgeons, there were the field ambulance units assigned {{to each of the}} brigades. However, these units were not intended to function as hospitals, and were only supposed to triage and stabilize the wounded before sending them back to field hospital units. Line of communication troops had to donate their own supplies to the medical units that were overrun with casualties. With Townshend's offensive, there was only one river boat equipped as a hospital ship. With the ambulances full, many of the wounded were placed on A.T. carts, which were nothing more than simple carts pulled by animals that performed most of the land hauling {{at this point in the}} campaign. In some cases, the wounded were simply laid atop boxes of ammunition or other supplies. With animal transport limited by <b>short-sighted</b> decisions of Nixon and his predecessors, the Poona Division only 330 animal pulled carts and 740 animals to pull them.|$|E
25|$|Beeching's reports made no {{recommendations}} {{about the}} handling of land after closures. British Rail operated a policy of disposing of land that was surplus to requirements. Many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and the land sold for development. Closed station buildings on remaining lines have often been demolished or sold for housing or other purposes. Increasing pressure on land use meant that protection of closed trackbeds, as in other countries (such as the US Rail Bank scheme, which holds former railway land for possible future use) was not seen to be practical. Many redundant structures from closed lines remain, such as bridges over other lines and drainage culverts. They often require maintenance {{as part of the}} rail infrastructure while providing no benefit. Critics of Beeching argue that the lack of recommendations on {{the handling of}} closed railway property demonstrates that the report was <b>short-sighted.</b> On the other hand, retaining a railway on these routes, which would obviously have increased maintenance costs, might not have earned enough to justify that greater cost. As demand for rail has grown since privatisation, the failure to preserve the routes of closed lines (such as the one between Bedford and Cambridge, which was closed despite Beeching recommending its retention) has been criticised.|$|E
25|$|Scarlett, {{notoriously}} <b>short-sighted,</b> remained {{unaware that}} the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of {{the proximity of the}} Russian cavalry on their left flank. Scarlett gave the order 'Left wheel into line' which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett's men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip. Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient was he to attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, to sound the charge – but nothing happened. An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order his trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, to sound the charge. The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.|$|E
25|$|No tactical-technical section {{existed in}} either the RLM or Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL), with a near-complete lack of any system for a direct manner for combat pilots to place field {{requests}} for improvements to existing weapons systems, and to address improved tactics for their use. The Luftwaffe was therefore unable to provide appropriate equipment for the task asked of its units. Starting in 1940, all planning was <b>short-sighted</b> {{as a matter of}} policy. The need for technical improvements was resisted as pushing through upgrades would have reduced production rates of standard aircraft. Hardware would have to {{be turned over to the}} production of new types, causing a drop in output. This meant obsolete sub-variant or main types were kept in production too long. The OKL failed to produce adequate numbers of aircraft and refused to cut bomber production in favour of fighters until mid-1944. Even when these events were corrected, procurement was poor. As one key example late in the war, the Messerschmitt Me 262 was unable to be introduced rapidly enough. Partly through the pioneering nature of its axial-flow jet engines, the first ever placed in production, requiring much development time to make them reliable enough for front-line use, and too much time was wasted between operational testing, tactical-doctrinal development and training. General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters) Adolf Galland took responsibility for this failure.|$|E
500|$|However, Emanuel also faced some {{criticism}} for {{his failure to}} support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated. Emanuel had [...] "aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited such as Heath Shuler ending up [...] " [...] against important Obama Administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was <b>short-sighted</b> as it [...] "contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties" [...] when the Democrats {{lost control of the}} House in the 2010 midterm elections.|$|E
500|$|In December 1788, King Louis XVI {{approved}} {{construction of}} a reservoir to supply water to the canal in dry periods. François Zacharie had proposed a site for the reservoir high up near Saint-Etienne, but the chosen site was low down on the Couzon river near to Rive-de-Gier. This <b>short-sighted</b> decision ruled out the plan to continue the canal up to Saint-Etienne and then down to the Loire. The French Revolution (1789–1799) delayed the work, but the Barrage de Couzon (Couzon Dam) was completed in 1809, capable of containing [...] of water. It was modeled on the dam built at Saint-Ferriol for the Midi canal.|$|E
500|$|Nunn {{also became}} an {{advocate}} of legalizing industrial hemp in Kentucky, writing, [...] "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years because I had been of the opinion hemp was marijuana. I was <b>short-sighted</b> in my thinking, and I was wrong." [...] In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. [...] Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, {{at the base of}} Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
500|$|Congress had {{expressed}} concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944. In discussions about the legislation's details, the American Legion insisted on a specific provision to provide benefits to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable. The Legion believed {{a large number of}} veterans had been given blue and other less-than-honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial. In testimony before the United States Senate, Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs strongly opposed this provision {{on the grounds that it}} would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record. Senator Bennett Champ Clark, a sponsor of the bill, dismissed his concerns, calling them [...] "some of the most stupid, <b>short-sighted</b> objections which could be raised". Clark went on to say: ...|$|E
500|$|Lu'lu' al-Kabir died in 1008 and was {{succeeded by}} Mansur. Mansur {{attempted}} to concentrate further power {{into his hands}} {{at the expense of}} the Aleppine aʿyān (local elite), though he formally continued his predecessors' policy of separating the Emirate of Aleppo's civil administration from its military command. On the diplomatic front, he maintained the Byzantines' virtual protectorate over Aleppo, though he also developed contacts with the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate. Basing his information on the chronicles of medieval Aleppine historians, historian Suhayl Zakkar wrote, Unlike his father, Mansur was over-confident, <b>short-sighted,</b> a drunkard, ' oppressor and unjust'. Because of this the Aleppines hated him and several of their poets cursed him in their poems. ... The population of Aleppo ... began to search for a way to get rid of him. As time went by he was heedlessly and arrogantly increasing his oppression. ... the Aleppines found that the restoration of the Hamdanid dynasty would be the solution. They recalled and emphasized the fact that Mansur himself was the son of [...] Hamdanids' slave who had betrayed his masters and who had usurped their rights.|$|E
500|$|Andronikos' {{decision}} aroused considerable {{opposition and}} criticism from contemporary scholars and officials {{almost from the}} outset, and historians like Pachymeres and Nikephoros Gregoras dwell long on the disastrous long-term effects of this <b>short-sighted</b> decision: piracy flourished, often augmented by the crews of the disbanded fleet who took service under Turkish and Latin masters, Constantinople was rendered defenceless towards the Italian maritime powers, {{and more and more}} Aegean islands fell under foreign rule—including Chios to the Genoese Benedetto Zaccaria, Rhodes and the Dodecanese to the Hospitallers, Lesbos and other islands to the Gattilusi. As Gregoras commented, [...] "if [...] had remained masters of the seas, as they had been, then the Latins would not have grown so arrogant , nor would the Turks ever have gazed upon the sands of the [...] sea, [...] nor would we have to pay to everyone tribute every year." [...] After 1305, bowing to popular pressure and the need to contain the Catalan Company, the Emperor belatedly tried to rebuild the navy of 20 vessels, but although a few ships were built and a small fleet appears to have been active {{over the next couple of}} years, it eventually was disbanded again.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} fashion as the {{original}} Star Wars films, the story opens with a large, yellow crawl of text, with the text in this variation calling out 20th Century Fox for their lack of foresight in terms of merchandising rights, thus allowing George Lucas and Lucasfilm to keep all the rights to every film in the Star Wars franchise. The text then addresses the stockholders of 20th Century Fox, and cites Family Guys two cancellations as {{another example of the}} company's <b>short-sighted</b> decisions, and spending budget money in a useless manner. As the Imperial Fleet approaches, a Star Destroyer deploys Elroy Jetson, a character from the Hanna-Barbera animated sitcom The Jetsons, along with a series of probe droids. Elroy Jetson proceeds to the Little Dipper School, in imitation of the original intro to The Jetsons. One of the probe droids, portrayed by Joe Swanson, then lands in the snow near Luke Skywalker. Luke mistakes the droid for a meteorite and approaches the device, before being attacked by a snow beast, which looks like Cookie Monster from PBS' Sesame Street. The character had previously appeared in the fourth season episode [...] "Model Misbehavior" [...] as a [...] "cookie addict".|$|E

It {{was not well}} received on its release; Ganga Bruta was labeled [...] "the worst film of all time" [...] by critics and resulted in [...] "huge financial losses" [...] for Cinédia. Time Out Rio de Janeiro stated that [...] "It was roundly rejected by traditional critics and <b>short-sighted</b> viewers." [...] Opinions were revised after its restoration in 1952 for a screening at the 1st Brazilian Cinema Retrospective, when it [...] "deeply impressed" [...] the directors who {{would be part of}} Cinema Novo movement in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Glauber Rocha was especially impressed and later cited it as [...] "one of the 20 best films of all time" [...] in his book Revisão Crítica do Cinema Brasileiro. Another film director, Walter Lima, Jr., declared, [...] "there are two films that are such clear archetypes of Brazil's eternal quest, namely Limite and Ganga Bruta. They represent something that you have to polish and something that determines its own space, suggesting {{at the same time that}} something more exists beyond its confines." [...] In 2015 it would be further recognized by the Brazilian Film Critics Association as the 24th best Brazilian film of all time on its Top 100.|$|E
500|$|In his prime, Smith {{was widely}} {{recognised}} by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator.

He had an [...] "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague PK van der Byl, and a reputation for [...] "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or raised his voice. He spoke with [...] "a nasal monologue" [...] as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an [...] "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as {{a major factor in}} his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an [...] "almost hypnotic influence" [...] over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win [...] "election after election... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by People magazine in 1976, asserted that [...] "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago."

500|$|Paparrigopoulos extols Demosthenes's patriotism, but criticises him {{as being}} <b>short-sighted.</b> According to this critique, Demosthenes should have {{understood}} that the ancient Greek states could only survive unified {{under the leadership of}} Macedon. Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip's inevitable triumph. He is criticised for having overrated Athens's capacity to revive and challenge Macedon. His city had lost most of its Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over Macedonia and was master of enormous mineral wealth. Chris Carey, a professor of Greek in UCL, concludes that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist. Nevertheless, the same scholar underscores that [...] "pragmatists" [...] like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that which is just and honourable, before their own safety and preservation. The people preferred Demosthenes's activism and even the bitter defeat at Chaeronea was regarded as a price worth paying in the attempt to retain freedom and influence. According to Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickarde, success may be a poor criterion for judging the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were motivated by the ideal of political liberty. Athens was asked by Philip to sacrifice its freedom and its democracy, while Demosthenes longed for the city's brilliance. He endeavoured to revive its imperilled values and, thus, he became an [...] "educator of the people" [...] (in the words of Werner Jaeger).|$|E
500|$|Mona came up {{with the}} idea of the club after {{watching}} a TV report about The 2i's Coffee Bar in London's Soho, where several singers had been discovered. She decided to open the club, which was located in her cellar, on 29 August 1959, for her sons, their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day, unlike The Cavern Club, which had a jazz-only policy at that time. Mona charged half a crown annually for membership—to [...] "keep out the rough elements"—and served soft drinks, snacks, cakes, and coffee from an espresso machine, which no other club had at that time.
