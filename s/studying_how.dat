5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

She moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978–83), where she became Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in 1980, and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981, and returned as a full professor two years later (staying 1983–87). In addition, she was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan (1985) and {{research associate at the}} Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin (1983–87). Early in her career, Warren became a proponent of on-the-ground research based on <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> people actually respond to laws in the real world. Her work analyzing court records, and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.|$|E

The first chapter <b>studies</b> <b>how</b> the organizational structure of banks affects {{the processing of}} information.

The last chapter is joint work with Hans Degryse, Jose Liberti and Steven Ongena and <b>studies</b> <b>how</b> banks use ‘soft information’ to monitor small firms. This dissertation uses hand collected internal bank data which opens the black box on how banks communicate internally, negotiate and monitor small firms. The dissertation shows that {{a change in the}} organizational structure of a bank affects the incentives of loan officers to manipulate information and that the private information of a bank about small firms affects their bargaining power in credit negotiations and explains discretionary lending decisions of loan officers...|$|R

By comparing the differential gene expression of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing C57BL/6 mouse strain, 36 genes have been identified that are good candidates for <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> the healing process differs in MRL mice and other mice.

25|$|When <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> {{diseases}} are caused, incidence rates {{are the most}} appropriate measure of disease frequency as they assess risk directly. However, incidence {{can be difficult to}} measure with rarer chronic diseases such as autism. In autism epidemiology, point or period prevalence is more useful than incidence, as the disorder starts long before it is diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Research focuses mostly on whether point or period prevalence is increasing with time; cumulative incidence is sometimes used in studies of birth cohorts.|$|E

The latter research study was intended {{to pave the way}} for potential human use if successful. However, xenotransplantion is often an extremely dangerous type of transplant because of the increased risk of non-compatibility, rejection, and disease carried in the tissue.

25|$|Her husband {{left his}} {{engineering}} firm and enrolled at Columbia University in 1971 {{with a major}} in hospital planning.

Wald conducted a two-year research program <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> terminally ill patients fared {{at home or in}} a healthcare facility, and tracked how patients and their families felt throughout the process. After returning to the United States, she organized a team of doctors, clergy and nurses to investigate the needs of dying patients. In 1974, she, along with two pediatricians and a Yale medical center chaplain, founded the first hospice in the United States at the Connecticut Hospice, located in Branford, Connecticut. Initially the program provided home care, and had its first inpatient location in 1980, a 44-bed facility in Branford. Disagreements had been brewing within the board about her vision for the hospice program, and she was forced to resign shortly after its opening.|$|E
