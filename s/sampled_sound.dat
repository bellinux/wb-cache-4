25|$|In earlier {{computers}} and video game systems, sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis. In modern systems, {{the increases in}} storage capacity and playback quality has allowed <b>sampled</b> <b>sound</b> to be used. The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio, often with hardware acceleration, and real-time audio post-processing, which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development. Based on the internal state of the game, multiple different calculations can be made. This will allow for, for example, realistic sound dampening, echoes and doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|During {{the golden}} age of hip hop, samples were heavily used. The ability to sample {{different}} beats, riffs and patterns {{from a wide variety of}} sources gave birth to a new breed of producers, DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, just a good ear for sound collages. These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from jazz, funk and soul to rock and roll. For example, Paul's Boutique, the Beastie Boys' second studio album, drew from over 200 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album. Samples and sound bites were not limited to just music. RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective formed in the 1990s, <b>sampled</b> <b>sound</b> clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu films to bolster and frame the group's gritty lyrical content. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.|$|E
2500|$|The initial demo also {{featured}} the percussive, keyboard hook which {{would become the}} song's musical trademark. [...] "I followed an old philosophy, which {{is to try to}} catch the listener's attention," [...] explained Stewart. [...] "I wanted to make a statement with that hook, creating a special sound that people would react to and remember. It was like a loud horn blast, which was derived from a <b>sampled</b> <b>sound,</b> and then enhanced with my K-25 keyboard." [...] Soon after completing the demo, Stewart played the song for Harrison and she [...] "immediately loved it." [...] The following day, she recorded her vocals at Stewart's studio for the master version.|$|E

2500|$|The samples used in Chill Out {{contribute}} fundamentally to {{the character}} of the composition. In particular, the recurring <b>sampled</b> <b>sound</b> effects of rolling stock and other transport illustrate the journey concept, often during segues between parts of the composition. Many of these effects are taken from the 1987 CD version of Elektra Records' Authentic Sound Effects Volume 2. The tracks used are [...] "Crossing Bells and Horn with Electric Train Pass" [...] and [...] "Short Freight Train Pass", along with processed versions of [...] "F18 Diamond Fly-By", [...] "Dodge Van Starts, Drives Out", and [...] "Surf". Samples of American, British and Russian radio stations are also used, including the BBC pips and a jingle from Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1: [...] "Rock radio into the nineties and beyond". Some of the more obscure sounds (Tuvan throat singers and Basque shepherds in the Pyrenees) come from the Saydisc Records soundtrack of the 1980s [...] "Disappearing World" [...] series on Granada TV in the UK. The phrase [...] "Your feeling of helpnessness is your best friend, savage" [...] is taken from the 1957 science fiction film The Brain from Planet Arous.|$|E

As the raster scan {{returned}} from {{the right side of}} the screen to the left, one byte of data was placed into a PWM generator instead of the screen. This provided 8-bit sampled monaural sound sampled at the 22.25 kHz horizontal blanking rate. A general-purpose 6522 output could mute the <b>sampled</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

50|$|Jules Maxwell (born October 28, 1965 in Bangor, Northern Ireland) is a songwriter, and composer. He played {{keyboards}} for Dead Can Dance {{on their}} 2012/13 world tour.

5000|$|Dense rhythmic constructions {{and the use}} of <b>sampled</b> <b>sound</b> {{to create}} unusual percussive {{instruments}} are two of the hallmarks of his compositions.

Powered by big drum sounds, surging phrases, and throbbing rhythms, it attacks the listener with stealth and force.” ...|$|E

When a channel is in D/A mode the frequency is as fast as the CPU can stream bytes to the port, though in practicality it is limited to 6.99 kHz when using the TIMER interrupt with its smallest loop setting (1023 cpu cycles) or 15.7 kHz using the scanline interrupt.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{approach}} to sound and music developments had become {{common in the}} arcades by this time and {{had been used in}} many arcade system boards since the mid-1980s. This was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like Street Fighter II (1991) on the CPS-1, which used voice samples extensively along with <b>sampled</b> <b>sound</b> effects and percussion. Neo Geo's MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included surround sound.|$|E
