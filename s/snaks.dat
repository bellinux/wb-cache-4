40|$|The {{dietary habits}} of {{adolescents}} {{have been a}} cause for concern for quite a number of years. Large-scale studies into adolescent eating habits have been carried out (Friel, 1999), but to date little work has focused on nutrition knowledge in this age group or the use of peer-led education to improve nutrition knowledge. The School Nutrition Action and Knowledge Survey (<b>SNAKS)</b> II initiative sought to look at his issue School Nutrition Action and Knowledge Survey (<b>SNAKS)</b> was an initiative which was commenced in 2000, by the Midland Health Board (MHB), Ireland, through the Midland Schools Health Project and the Community Nutrition Service (CNS) with Bord Bia, Irish Food Board and post-primary schools. It was initiated as a response to feedback from the Midland Schools’ Health Project, which determined, through post-primary school contact, that there was an urgent need for nutritional intervention in this setting, with teachers expressing concern regarding the nutritional status and habits of their pupils...|$|E

40|$|The docking and {{fusion of}} cargo-containing vesicles with target {{membranes}} of eukaryotic cells is {{mediated by the}} interaction of SNARE proteins present on both vesicle and target membranes. In many cases, the target membrane SNARE, or t-SNARE, exists as a complex of syntaxin {{with a member of}} the SNAP- 25 family of palmitoylated proteins. We have identified a novel human kinase <b>SNAK</b> (SNARE kinase) that specifically phosphorylates the nonneuronal t-SNARE SNAP- 23 in vivo. Interestingly, only SNAP- 23 that is not assembled into t-SNARE complexes is phosphorylated by <b>SNAK,</b> and phosphorylated SNAP- 23 resides exclusively in the cytosol. Coexpression with <b>SNAK</b> significantly enhances the stability of unassembled SNAP- 23, and as a consequence, the assembly of newly synthesized SNAP- 23 with syntaxin is augmented. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of SNAP- 23 by <b>SNAK</b> enhances the kinetics of t-SNARE assembly in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana SNF 1 -related-kinase 1 (SnRK 1) -activating kinase 1 (AtSnAK 1) and AtSnAK 2 {{have been}} shown to phosphorylate in vitro and {{activate}} the energy signalling integrator, SnRK 1. To clarify this signalling cascade in planta, a genetic-and molecular-based approach was developed. Homozygous single AtSnAK 1 and AtSnAK 2 T-DNA insertional mutants did not display an apparent phenotype. Crossing of the single mutants did not allow the isolation of double-mutant plants, whereas self-pollinating the S 1 -/- S 2 +/- sesquimutant specifically gave approximatively 22 % individuals in their offspring that, when rescued on sugar-supplemented media in vitro, were shown to be AtSnAK 1 AtSnAK 2 double mutants. Interestingly, this was not obtained {{in the case of the}} other sesquimutant, S 1 +/- S 2 -/- Although reduced in size, the double mutant had the capacity to produce flowers, but not seeds. Immunological characterization established the T-loop of the SnRK 1 catalytic subunit to be non-phosphorylated in the absence of both <b>SnAKs.</b> When the double mutant was complemented with a DNA construct containing an AtSnAK 2 open reading frame driven by its own promoter, a normal phenotype was restored. Therefore, wild-type plant growth and development is dependent on the presence of SnAK in vivo, and this is correlated with SnRK 1 phosphorylation. These data show that both <b>SnAKs</b> are kinases phosphorylating SnRK 1, and thereby they contribute to energy signalling in planta...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>snaks</b> from the Guianan region got {{an early start}} in 1705 when several species were pictured by Merian. As {{relatively}} {{large proportion of the}} snakes described by Linnaeus originated from Surinam. Interest for and knowledge of this group of animals steadily increased in the 18 th and 19 th century (80 species known {{at the turn of the}} century), but only in the second part of the 20 th century detailed studies of snake faunas from (part of) the Guianan region appeared. No such study for the entire area has been published till now. At present a total of 134 species of snakes, belonging to 159 taxa, is known. Only 19. 4 % is endemic, the majority (43. 4 %) belong to species with an Amazonian distribution. Seventeen species (12. 7 %) are venemous, ten belonging to the Elapidae, seven to the Crotalidae. Several taxonomic problems are discussed, Cercophie auratus (Schlegel) is restored as a valid taxon and redescribed. Analysis of available distribution data shows that forest snakes are fairly evenly distributed throughout Amazonia and Guiana. Snakes restricted to open formations are spread evenly throughout Guiana, but most of them are absent in western Amazonia. When taking together ubiquists and snakes restricted to open formations there is a fair resemblance between the faunas of Guiana and. Iquitos, but only a moderate one between Santa Cecilia and Guiana,possibly reflecting the influence of species belonging to the Andes foothill fauna (Napo refuge). Within Guiana apparently there are no unsurmountable barriers to snakes, the differences that are observed between the western and eastern/Brazilian part can be explained. by the presence of species barely raching these areas. Probably these species are still in the process of expanding their range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the design and}} dynamic analysis {{of a new generation}} of fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) that offer bidirectional bending developed as motion segments of a pressure-operated soft robotic snake. Our prior work on FEAs has identified a number of limitations, namely a high center of gravity, narrow base, slow dynamics, and a small range of pressure inputs. We developed two versions of FEAs based on an improved design concept with different geometric parameters and characterized their dynamic response under a custom visual tracking system. Compared with the previous actuators, the FEAs developed in this work offer robust op-eration, safety at larger input pressure values, faster response, lower center of gravity and a flat bottom for better compatibility for snake-like undulatory locomotion.

40|$|Endotoxin-induced {{changes in}} nonspecifie {{resistance}} to bacteria and viruses have received widespread attention in recent years. Animals pretreated with Gram-negative endotoxins {{are more susceptible}} to viruses and both Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria for a short period, and many of them later develop increased resistance to such organisms and their destructive effects (1 - 6). The spectrum of increased resistance was recently reviewed by Shilo (7), Gledhill (8), and Bennett and Cluff (9). In an investigation of the biologic interrelationships of Escherichia coli endotoxin and Agkistrodon piscivorus venom, another instance of endotoxininduced hypersusceptibility came to our attention (10). Rabbits given a single injection of endotoxin intradermally or intravenously showed greatly increased susceptibility to A. piscivorus venom administered 18 to 24 hours later; and those given a 7 -day course of endotoxin injections were highly susceptible to venom challenge as long as 3 days after completion of the endotoxin regimen.
