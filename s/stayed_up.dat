5|$|In March 2008, Comedy Central {{made every}} episode of South Park {{available}} for free full-length on-demand legal streaming {{on the official}} South Park Studios website. From March 2008 until December 2013 new episodes {{were added to the}} site the day following their debut, and an uncensored version was posted the following day. The episode <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> {{for the remainder of the}} week, then taken down, and added to the site three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland {{appeared}} {{in their first}} League Cup final in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City. In 1987, Sunderland {{saw one of the}} lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the Third Division of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> for one year before being relegated {{on the final day of}} the following season.|$|E
5|$|The 2012–13 season saw Newcastle regain European {{football}} {{for the first}} time since 2007. Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season, including layoffs to key midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa, and defenders Steven and Ryan Taylor. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of ten losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. In January, Newcastle signed five French players, and advanced to the Europa League quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica. Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> after a 2–1 victory over already-relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014–15 season, {{a dismal}} run of form saw the team slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously <b>stayed</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E
25|$|By winning four {{of their}} last five games, Blackpool <b>stayed</b> <b>up,</b> {{but it had been}} a close call. There was little {{interest}} in the cups, apart from a two-legged victory over First Division Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup.|$|E
25|$|The next notable city derby came on 18 October 1997, when Everton triumphed 2–0 at Goodison in {{a victory}} that {{ultimately}} saved them from relegation (they only <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> {{by having a}} greater goal difference than Bolton Wanderers) and helped end Liverpool's title bid.|$|E

25|$|Following a tough {{championship}} loss to Kyle Busch in 2015, Harvick {{would be}} determined {{to stay in}} championship form going into the 2016 season.

Harvick ran exceptionally well at Atlanta, where he led 131 laps, but faltered late in the race and finished 6th. At Las Vegas, Harvick would race with the flu. Harvick led only 1 lap, but despite not being a contender for the win, Harvick would finish 7th in the race.|$|E

25|$|In August 1994, the Club {{were placed}} under a {{transfer}} embargo, {{at one point}} even being refused permission to sign a player on a free transfer and willing to playing for free. This led to the club only having 18 registered players, five of which were aged 18 or under. The continued financial troubles saw the club sell St James Park to Beazer Homes for £650,000 in November 1994. In March 1995, the club were reported to be £1.2million in debt. City came close to {{dropping out of the}} Football League in 1995 when they finished bottom of Division Three, but <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> because Conference National champions Macclesfield Town's ground did not meet league requirements.|$|E
25|$|While Bennett was, and is still, often {{criticized for}} lack of {{compassion}} for the impoverished masses, he <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> through many nights reading and responding to personal letters from ordinary citizens asking for his help, and often dipped into his personal fortune to send a five-dollar bill to a starving family. The total amount he gave personally is uncertain, although he personally estimated that in 1927–37 he spent well over 2.3 million dollars. Bennett was a controlling owner of the E.B. Eddy match company, which was the largest safety match manufacturer in Canada, {{and he was one}} of the richest Canadians at that time. Bennett helped put many poor, struggling young men through university. Relative to the times he lived in, he was likely the wealthiest Canadian to become prime minister.|$|E
25|$|With Luton's spell {{in the top}} flight finally over, it {{was always}} going to be {{difficult}} to keep hold of prize assets. So it proved when Mick Harford signed for Chelsea for £300,000. The first season in the new, three-division Football League almost saw Luton drop into the third tier of English football. The team was not helped by the involvement of Scottish duo Paul Telfer and Darren Salton in a motor accident early on in the season – under-21 international defender Salton was nearly killed, and never played again. Luton were bottom of the table shortly into the New Year, and Pleat reacted by procuring a loan deal to bring Luton-born England international Kerry Dixon to the club on loan from Southampton. Dixon gelled well alongside Phil Gray up front, and Luton <b>stayed</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
