40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that readers {{spend a great deal of}} time <b>skim</b> <b>reading</b> on the Web and that if readers <b>skim</b> <b>read</b> they reduce their comprehension of what they have read. There have been a number of studies exploring <b>skim</b> <b>reading,</b> but relatively little exists on the <b>skim</b> <b>reading</b> of hypertext and Webpages. In the experiment documented here, we utilised eye tracking methodology to explore how readers <b>skim</b> <b>read</b> hypertext and how hyperlinks affect reading behaviour. The results show that the readers read faster when they were <b>skim</b> <b>reading</b> and comprehension was reduced. However, the presence of hyperlinks seemed to assist the readers in picking out important information when <b>skim</b> <b>reading.</b> We suggest that readers engage in an adaptive information foraging strategy where they attempt to minimise comprehension loss while maintaining a high reading speed. Readers use hyperlinks as markers to suggest important information and use them to <b>read</b> <b>through</b> the <b>text</b> in an efficient and effective way. This suggests that <b>skim</b> <b>reading</b> may not be as damaging to comprehension when reading hypertext, but it does mean that the words we choose to hyperlink become very important to comprehension for those <b>skim</b> <b>reading</b> text on the Web...|$|R

40|$|Readers on the Web often skim <b>through</b> <b>text</b> to {{cope with}} the volume of {{available}} information. In a previous study, Duggan and Payne [11] tracked readers' eye movements as they skimmed <b>through</b> expository <b>text</b> under time pressure. This article presents novel analyses of these eye-movement data. Results indicated that readers were able to explicitly direct attention to the most important information in the text and that this improved performance on a subsequent test of memory for the meaning of text. We suggest readers achieve this by satisficing - <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> <b>text</b> until the rate of information gain drops below threshold and then skipping to the next section of text. Further analyses of gaze patterns for paragraphs and pages supported this explanation.

The design of the study was a Pretest-Posttest Control-Group Design.

The experimental group received reading instruction in the characteristics of narrative and expository text structures and how to discuss the details of story by applying knowledge of text structures. The control group, on the other hand, read each story silently by themselves and answered comprehension questions. The posttest means of the two groups were compared, and a t test was used to test the significance difference of the means. The results did not reveal any differences between the means. The short time of the intervention may be a crucial factor that made the two strategies yield the same effects.

40|$|The idea {{to teach}} {{critical}} <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> literary <b>texts</b> {{comes from the}} analogy that language and literary works are like two sides of a coin.

It stresses on the exploration literary works by encouraging the learners to interact with literary texts based on their background knowledge and to acquire the new one. Such exploration is crucial since understanding the text type by merely reading and answering comprehension questions is not sufficient enough to stimulate EFL learners’ critical thinking. Incorporating reasoning skills in the reading comprehension to some extent will help EFL learners to develop a habit of thinking critically. Accordingly, by applying the seven critical reading strategies {{as well as the}} learning prompt introduced in this paper, the goal of critical pedagogy can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} {{the profile of}} reading accuracy acquisition of children from the elementary school, considering word extension and syllabic structure. METHODS: This study counted on 29 children from the third grade and 28 from the fourth grade of the Brazilian elementary school, with mean age of 8 : 5 and 9 : 3 years, respectively, who did not present learning disorders. All participants underwent oral <b>reading</b> assessment <b>through</b> <b>texts</b> according to each school level. The texts were analyzed considering the range of word length and syllabic structure. The performance of the students was analyzed according to the accuracy percentage concerning word length and syllabic structure. All data underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS: We noticed that the variability in the percentage increased due {{to the number of}} syllables, with more incidences of error in students from the third year. Furthermore, data pointed out greater accuracy of students from the fourth year with regard to word length and syllabic structure. Analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated interaction effect between both groups and the studied variables. CONCLUSION: This study showed evidence that word length is a strong factor to reading accuracy acquisition in Brazilian Portuguese. In addition, words with syllabic structure different from the pattern commonly seen in the Portuguese language are more difficult to be read by children of lower schooling levels...|$|R
40|$|A {{motivation}} for the 1984 Manchester conference was to question the applicability of scientific truth tests {{to the study of}} socio-technical systems. While most IS researchers now agree that such tests are not appropriate, or at least are not always appropriate, the debate on the use of alternatives continues. This paper examines several truth tests applied to two truth statements in one piece of published research. Since the paper was published in a mainstream IS journal, it is argued that the standard of truth tests applied to this paper is indicative of the standard of truth tests acceptable within the IS community. It is observed that different standards of truth test are applied, for different purposes, at different stages of the review process, reflecting the different purposes and standards of the truth statements made. Whereas the truth tests applied to the first truth statement (an inductive statement reporting the findings of the research) can be <b>read</b> <b>through</b> the <b>text,</b> those applied to the second truth statement (a deductive statement seeking to generalize these research findings) cannot. The observed differences in the application of internal and external validity tests point to the need for greater transparency in the application of this (second) type of truth test to better inform authors, reviewers, and readers alike; thereby improving the quality of truth statements made and of resultant publications...|$|R

This contribution presents {{a study from}} empirical teaching research in secondary education ("Sekundarstufe 1 ") by Grütz/Belgrad/Pfaff (2005). 4500 pupils, male and female, from the 7 th form of primary and secondary school were examined to determine which of the reading strategies usually adopted {{lead to a more}} successful text understanding with girls and which with boys. This study follows up a previous study done in 4 th form primary school by Belgrad/Grütz/Pfaff (2003). The research design is based on the psychological cognition model of text understanding following van Dijk/Kintsch (1983), which sees the process of reading comprehension as interactional and constructive. Cognitive reading strategies were tested which are usually adopted during lessons. Major results of the study are that boys prefer similar reading strategies both in primary and secondary schools. Good results are achieved when a text is read quietly and discussed afterwards. The worst results are obtained by all boys when words have to be copied from the text.
