Jackie Robinson credited him with trying to further the rights of African American players, but warned him that he <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much. In 1971, Ellis testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Public Health about his experiences with sickle cell and later worked with people who had the disease and raised money for sickle cell research.|$|E

500|$|Through several fliers {{issued in}} Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, a drug {{trafficking}} organization offered a $600,000 peso (roughly US$46,000) reward to anyone {{that could give}} them information on the whereabouts of the administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas, or to identify any of his family members, whether they are his parents, brothers and sisters, children or wife. The flier included the phone number (834)-104-7370, which has the area code of Tamaulipas. The administrator responded by saying that [...] " [...] not playing at being a hero, [...] doing what [...] {{to do as a}} citizen." [...] He also thanked the visitors who contributed to the page and gave him support throughout the project, and asked the Mexican Armed Forces to continue their fight against organized crime. The administrator <b>said,</b> <b>too,</b> that he would continue to his crime reporting at Valor por Tamaulipas even if that might cost him his life. On its page the administrator stated that after hearing about the threat, his wife and children left to the United States for security reasons. He also asked his visitors to refrain from using their personal Facebook or Twitter accounts when uploading information to the page since that could put them at risk. He believes that the Mexican criminal organization known as Los Zetas or state officials working for them are probably responsible for this threat.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E

[...] Yet he also warned, [...] " [...] return to 'free' competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the state." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Columbus Manor School, a {{suburban}} Chicago elementary {{school with a}} student body nearly half Muslim Arab American, school board officials have considered eliminating holiday celebrations after Muslim parents complained that their culture's holidays were not included. Local parent Elizabeth Zahdan said broader inclusion, not elimination, was the group's goal. [...] "I only wanted them modified to represent everyone," [...] the Chicago Sun-Times quoted her as saying. [...] "Now the kids are not being educated about other people." [...] However, the district's superintendent, Tom Smyth, <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much school time was being taken to celebrate holidays already, and he sent a directive to his principals requesting that they [...] "tone down" [...] activities unrelated to the curriculum, such as holiday parties.|$|E

2500|$|During his {{appearance}} at Libby's trial, Cooper recounted how he first learned about Valerie Wilson on July 11, 2003, from Rove. Cooper testified that Rove {{told him to}} be wary of Joe Wilson’s criticisms in The New York Times. [...] "Don't go too far out on Wilson," [...] Cooper recalled Rove saying, adding that Wilson's wife worked at [...] "the agency." [...] Rove reportedly ended the call by saying, [...] "I've already <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much." [...] Cooper testified that when he spoke to Libby, he told Libby that he had heard that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A. According to Cooper, Libby responded, [...] "I heard that too." [...] In Libby's grand jury testimony, Libby recalled telling Cooper that he'd heard something to that effect but that he didn't know for sure if it were true. In Libby's trial, Cooper's notes became the subject of intense scrutiny by the defense.|$|E
2500|$|In Dune, Lady Jessica is {{pregnant}} when she undergoes the spice agony while among the Fremen; her resulting daughter, Alia, is born a full Reverend Mother, {{the mind of}} an adult in a child's body. She pretends to be a child, but others notice that she is different. The Bene Gesserit are eventually outraged and horrified by Alia's existence, but she is out of their control. Mohiam says, [...] "I've <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much, {{but the fact remains}} that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us." [...] In Children of Dune, an adult Alia eventually succumbs to the ancestral ego of her grandfather, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who wants nothing more than the destruction of the Atreides, and is given another opportunity, from the inside, to realize it.|$|E

The old man had arisen with the sun and had taken a long walk in the woods to see the {{squirrels}} and hear the birds sing, he said. After breakfast, the Chief said that {{he wanted to go to}} church. A car was brought around, loaded to capacity, and the old Chief, in full dress and just a little paint on his face to cover his wrinkles, took place beside his host for a trip of two miles to the big Catholic edifice on State Street in the city's First Ward. Throughout the service the Chief responded with dignity to every detail of the long and solemn ceremony--and it may be <b>said</b> <b>too</b> that he attracted the gaze of everyone present. When formal service ended, the popular Father McGivney came to take his hand in welcome and gave his blessing, but it was long before the Chief was permitted to take leave of his friends and neighbors gathered about him to shake hands. The Chief was visibly agitated and frequently referred to his disappointment in having to go. He said he would not likely ever come again; he felt that he would soon go to join his friends in the Sand Hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{four o'clock}} in the afternoon, while Thomas A. Hendricks was {{speaking}} at the Democrat state convention, of which there were 10,000 participants, some eight or ten soldiers with bayonets fixed and rifles cocked entered the crowd and advanced slowly toward the stand, causing a great uproar. [...] The multitude scattered in every direction. A high fence {{on the east side}} of the state-house square was pushed down by the rushing crowd. A squad of cavalry galloped along Tennessee street adding to the tumult. The soldiers who were moving towards the stand were ordered to halt by Colonel Coburn, who had been guarding the quartermaster's stores north of the State-house, but who came out when he heard the disturbance. He asked what they were doing. They said they were [...] "going for Tom Hendricks," [...] that he had <b>said</b> <b>too</b> much, and they intended to kill him. Coburn expostulated with them and they desisted. There was much confusion on the stand. Hendricks closed his remarks prematurely, suggesting that the resolutions be read and the meeting dismissed. The resolutions declared that the Federal government had two wars upon its hands, one against the rebels and one against the constitution. The Republicans in the late legislature, who had broken the quorum, were denounced, and it was declared that the Governor could not clear himself from complicity, except by taking steps to prevent repudiation.|$|E
2500|$|Cicero {{makes no}} {{reference}} to any myth of Bona Dea. Later Roman scholars connected her to the goddess Fauna, a central figure in Latium's aristocratic foundation myth, which was thus re-embroidered as a Roman moral fable. Several variants are known; Fauna is daughter, wife or sister of Faunus (also named Faunus Fatuus, meaning Faunus [...] "the foolish", or seer). Faunus was son of Picus, {{and was the first}} king of the Latins, empowered with the gift of prophecy. In Roman religion he was a pastoral god and protector of flocks, with a shrine and oracle on the Aventine, sometimes identified with Inuus and later, with Greek Pan. As his female counterpart, Fauna had similar gifts, domains and powers in relation to women. In Plutarch's version of the myth, the mortal Fauna secretly gets drunk on wine, which is forbidden her. When Faunus finds out, he thrashes her with myrtle rods; in Lactantius's version, Faunus thrashes her to death, regrets the deed and deifies her. Servius derives the names Faunus and Fauna, collectively the Fatui, from fari (to prophesy): they [...] "are also called Fatui because they utter divine prophecy in a state of stupor". Macrobius writes that Bona Dea is [...] "the same as Fauna, Ops or Fatua... It is <b>said</b> <b>too</b> that she was the daughter of Faunus, and that she resisted the amorous advances of her father who {{had fallen in love with}} her, so that he even beat her with myrtle twigs because she did not yield to his desires though she had been made drunk by him on wine. It is believed that the father changed himself into a serpent, however, and under this guise had intercourse with his daughter." [...] Macrobius refers the serpent's image at the goddess' rites to this mythical transformation, and to the live, harmless serpents who roamed the goddess' temple precincts.|$|E
