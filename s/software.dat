25|$|The DACS was {{established}} in the late 1970s. The <b>software</b> community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information about computer <b>software,</b> its development process and the <b>software</b> technology area in general. The rapid expanison of <b>software</b> engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the <b>software</b> engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in <b>software</b> research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the <b>software</b> research environment to the user sector of the <b>software</b> community.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the package will be the <b>software</b> package.

Another concept of the <b>software</b> package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the <b>software</b> product. By relating it to the <b>software</b> package the vendor and the customer are able {{to keep track of the}} functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.|$|E
25|$|Richard Stallman has {{expressed}} concern that the Pirate Party’s goal of reducing copyright term to 5 years could harm the free <b>software</b> movement. Many free <b>software</b> licenses, mainly the GPL, are based on long-term copyrights. Stallman argues that if copyright terms are reduced to 5 years, proprietary <b>software</b> vendors would be able to take free <b>software</b> and use it in proprietary <b>software</b> once the copyright expires. But proprietary <b>software</b> is restricted by EULAs in addition to copyright, and the source code is not available, rendering the proprietary <b>software</b> unusable for free <b>software</b> developers even after its copyright expires. Stallman suggests that under this new copyright law, proprietary <b>software</b> developers should put their code in escrow when the software's binaries are released and then release their <b>software</b> into the public domain immediately after their copyright expires.|$|E
