5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} {{has been}} compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists; five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines. Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing tie ins and marketing events to promote the series. When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime, heavily edited and localized, fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series. After previews of the retooled series were released, viewers were less disappointed, but still annoyed by the cultural <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> still desired an uncut DVD release. Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids, becoming the highest rated 4Kids show {{at the start of the}} fall 2005 season, but it was never released to DVD in North America. The 4Kids dub, rather than original Japanese version, was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, South Africa and Israel.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the new fort {{was similar to that}} of the other Royal Commission forts on the Thames, with an arc of granite-faced casemates, {{reinforced}} by iron shields. These, it was believed, would be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire. It was originally envisaged that the fort would have two tiers (in a design similar to that of Garrison Point Fort at Sheerness) mounting around 56 guns; 28 in casemates and the rest in barbettes on the fort's roof. Construction began on this basis in July 1861 but as the work progressed the design was changed, leaving the fort with only a single tier of casemates. Like its predecessors, its construction was seriously affected by the poor ground conditions and was disrupted by <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> cracking foundations. Colonel Charles George Gordon, who was later to die in the Siege of Khartoum, supervised its final phases of construction. The fort cost a total of £130,000 to build.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A CPS {{translation}} is a syntactic translation of programs, which {{is useful for}} describing their operational behavior. By iterating the standard callby-value CPS translation, Danvy and Filinski discovered the CPS hierarchy and proposed a family of control operators, <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset, that {{make it possible to}} capture successive delimited continuations in a CPS hierarchy. Although <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset have found their applications in several areas such as partial evaluation, most studies in the literature have been devoted to the base level of the hierarchy, namely, to level- 1 <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset. In this article, we investigate the whole family of <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset. We give a simple calculus with level-n <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> level-n reset for an arbitrary n> 0. We then give a set of equational axioms for them, and prove that these axioms are sound and complete with respect to the CPS translation. The resulting set of axioms is concise and a natural extension of those for level- 1 <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset...|$|R

The Rhine Glacier is currently {{the subject of the}} most detailed studies. Glaciers of the Reuss and the Limmat advanced sometimes as far as the Jura.

25|$|None of {{the models}} {{developed}} so far succeed to explain exchange rates and volatility in the longer time frames. For shorter time frames (less than a few days), algorithms can be devised to predict prices. It is understood from the above models that many macroeconomic factors affect the exchange rates {{and in the end}} currency prices are a result of dual forces of demand and supply. The world's currency markets {{can be viewed as a}} huge melting pot: in a large and ever-changing mix of current events, supply and demand factors are constantly <b>shifting,</b> <b>and</b> the price of one currency in relation to another shifts accordingly. No other market encompasses (and distills) as much of what is going on in the world at any given time as foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|Certain genes {{have been}} {{identified}} with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman et al. (2008), the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) with 7'-repeating polymorphism (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD. The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene (COMT) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set <b>shifting)</b> <b>and</b> the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD. Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.|$|E
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission.

40|$|The <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset operators, {{proposed}} by Danvy and Filinski, are powerful control primitives for capturing delimited continuations. Delimited continuation {{is a similar}} concept as the standard (unlimited) continuation, but it represents part {{of the rest of}} the computation, rather than the whole rest of computation. In the literature, the semantics of <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset has been given by a CPS-translation only. This paper gives a direct axiomatization of calculus with <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset, namely, we introduce a set of equations, and prove that it is sound and complete with respect to the CPS-translation. We also introduce a calculus with control operators which is as expressive as the calculus with <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset, has a sound and complete axiomatization, and is conservative over Sabry and Felleisen's theory for first-class continuations...|$|R

25|$|Head motion {{correction}} {{is another}} common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a voxel move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that {{of some other}} voxel in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one voxel to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the cut-and-paste produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint {{to see how well}} they match, using a cost function such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal cost function is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, {{it is not possible to}} search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations we try in a chain.|$|E
25|$|Maricello {{was pushing}} hard but {{lost control of}} his car at the R Bend and {{collided}} heavily with the barriers. He retired from the race and this put pressure off Félix da Costa who made use of his situation {{to close the gap}} to Lynn.

Félix da Costa reduced the deficit to Lynn to just over one second with four laps left in the event. He got this gap down to 1.3 seconds under yellow flag conditions for Wolf's stranded car at Lisboa corner, but was unable to get close to affect an pass on Lynn who maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to win.
