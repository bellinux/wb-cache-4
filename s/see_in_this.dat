He was Singapore's Ambassador to Germany from 6 February 1998 to July 2003, and was concurrently accredited to Greece from March 2000 to July 2003. He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy <b>See.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar {{at the funeral}} mass of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City on 8 April 2005, {{believed to be the}} largest gathering of heads of state in history. In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic men and women in recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.|$|E

[...] He went on being {{positive}} towards a dance sequence of the clip, calling the dancers [...] "professional", and acclaimed Stan's and Lionezz' appearances.

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 August 2016 that the stunt which would air {{as part of}} the thirtieth anniversary would be a helicopter crash into the emergency department after an air ambulance collides with a drone. Hossington revealed in an interview with Radio Times that the show had been working with the Association of Air Ambulances for over half a year on the storyline. The storyline was also created by the Association of Air Ambulances, who suggested the idea of an air ambulance colliding with a drone. Commenting on the storyline, Hossington said: [...] "What you <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode is such a complex and unfortunate series of events." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's most-quoted line of dialogue, {{spoken by}} Octave, is [...] "You <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world, {{there is one}} awful thing, {{and that is that}} {{everyone}} has his reasons." [...] Renoir's sentiment of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he did not wish to stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.|$|E

500|$|Grimm connects Eddic {{references}} to Sif's golden hair (gold {{is referred to}} as Sifjar haddr; Sif's hair) with the herb name haddr Sifjar (polytrichum aureum). Grimm says that [...] "expositors <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> the [...] golden fruits of the Earth burnt up by fire and growing again, they liken Sif to Ceres", and Grimm says that [...] "with it agrees the fact that O. Slav. Siva is a gloss on 'Ceres dea frumenti'" [...] but cites etymological problems between the potential cognate. Grimm says that Thor's mother was the earth, and not his wife, yet [...] "we do find the simple Sif standing for earth." [...] Grimm adds that he is inconclusive regarding Sif and that, [...] "we ought to have fuller details about Sif, and these are wholly wanting in our mythology. Nowhere amongst us is the mystic relation of the seed-corn of Demeter, whose poignant grief for her daughter threatens to bring famine on mankind (Hymn to Cer. 305–306), nor anything like it, recorded." ...|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{introduction}} to his book Topics in Geometric Group Theory, Pierre de la Harpe wrote: [...] "One of my personal beliefs is that fascination with symmetries and groups {{is one way of}} coping with frustrations of life's limitations: we like to recognize symmetries which allow us to recognize more than what we can <b>see.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> sense the study of geometric group theory is a part of culture, and reminds me of several things that Georges de Rham practices on many occasions, such as teaching mathematics, reciting Mallarmé, or greeting a friend" [...] (page 3 in [...] ).|$|E

[...] After the event, journalist Maggie O'Kane conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda: [...] "...we, the media, were harnessed like 2,000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> nice clean war".|$|E

[...] On 20 February 2002 the Grand Masters, Grand Mistresses and Presidents of nine Masonic obediences met in Paris to sign the founding text of [...] "French Freemasonry" [...] ("Maçonnerie française"), an expression originated as a 'brandname' by the Grand Orient de France.

2500|$|Matthew, {{alone among}} the gospels, {{alternates}} five blocks of narrative with five of discourse, marking each {{off with the}} phrase [...] "When Jesus had finished..." [...] (see Five Discourses of Matthew). Some scholars <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> a deliberate plan to create a parallel to the first five books of the Old Testament; others see a three-part structure based around the idea of Jesus as Messiah; or a set of weekly readings spread out over the year; or no plan at all. Davies and Allison, in their widely used commentary, {{draw attention to the}} use of [...] "triads" [...] (the gospel groups things in threes), and R. T.

2500|$|The {{iconographic}} {{identification of}} Livilla has posed many problems to date, mainly {{due to the}} damnatio memoriae voted against her by the Senate after her death. Several possibilities have been advanced but none has to date received widespread acceptance. However, a portrait type that survives {{in at least three}} replicas and which we may refer to as the [...] "Alesia type" [...] may very well represent Livilla. All these replicas show the head of a lady in her blossom years, with a hairstyle clearly from the Tiberian period. The physiognomy is close but not identical to portraits of Antonia Minor, Livilla's mother, and some replicas seem to bear the marks of voluntary damage (that one would expect from a damnatio memoriae). For all these reasons, it has been proposed to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> portrait type a representation of Livilla.|$|E
