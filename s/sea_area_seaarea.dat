40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the question of}} classifying the <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> difficult for navi-gation, unrestricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> restricted by land (bottom or shore). Most of all, the article depicts the characteristics of restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas.</b> It presents the attempt to define {{in a new way}} the following notions: ‘safety of shipping’, ‘safety of navigation’, ‘risk of navigation’, ‘risk of collisions’, ‘navigational obstacle’, and ‘sea area difficult for naviga-tion’. In this paper author also presents methods {{that can be used for}} estimating safety of navigation (navigational risk) in the restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> by means of the model of the ship’s domain. The essence of the method suggested in the thesis is the systematic approach to sea vessel operation in the aspect of estimating its safety when navigating in restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{only one}} player's ships occupy a <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> after {{movement}} is finished, that player controls the <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> for the turn, and {{he or she}} scores points for it (the number of points varies, depending on which <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> is controlled by which player). If there are ships from both sides in the same <b>sea</b> <b>area,</b> the two fleets must fight at least one round of combat.|$|R

U.S. ships whose voyage allows them to always remain within VHF channel 16 coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply to the Federal Communications Commission for an individual waiver to fit to <b>Sea</b> <b>Area</b> A1 requirements. Similarly, those who remain within 2182 kHz coverage of U.S. Coast Guard stations may apply for a waiver to fit to <b>Sea</b> <b>Area</b> A2 requirements.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in surface sediments from Minjiang Estuary-Mazu and Xiamen-Jinmen <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> of China were investigated during 1995 - 1996. The concentration ranges of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in the Minjiang Estuary-Mazu <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> were 16. 4 - 37. 2, 33. 4 - 69. 6, 92. 1 - 128, 0. 087 - 0. 336 mg/kg(dry wt.), respectively; those for Xiamen-Jinmen <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> were 11. 0 - 24. 5, 36. 0 - 80. 3, 77. 5 - 161, 0. 135 - 0. 285 mg/kg(dry wt.), respectively. The concentrations and distributions of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in surface sediments of Minjiang Estuary-Mazu and Xiamen-Jinmen <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> were analyzed and evaluated. The {{results showed that}} the values of Zn and Pb exceeded those of sediment quality criteria. The average concentration of Cu in Minjiang Estuary-Mazu <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> was higher than that in Xiamen-Jinmen <b>sea</b> <b>area.</b> The obviously higher {{concentrations of}} Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd were found at outlets of Minjiang and Jiulong River. From the estuaries to open sea, the concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd had a decreasing trend, and then elevated in the <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> near Mazu and Jinmen, suggesting that Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in Minjiang Estuary-Mazu and Xiamen-Jinmen <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> may come from both the mainland and Taiwan of China...|$|R

The article gives an overview over existing international environment agreements regarding the North Sea and the Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>areas</b> and evaluates successes and failures of these agreements.

40|$|The algal {{flora and}} coastal environments were {{investigated}} in May at 10 stations in Haidaura, 1999. The {{number of species}} identified was 71 including 8 species of Chlorophyceae, 14 species of Phaeophyceae, 49 species of Rhodophyceae. Considering the algal flora and their distribution, Haidaura was divided into 2 areas, i. e. inner <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> and open <b>sea</b> <b>area.</b> In the inner <b>sea</b> <b>area,</b> {{there were a few}} algal species. The “isoyake” areas were found at most inner parts of the bay. The open <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> was characterized by developed Sargassum zone. S. micracanthum was the dominant species in this zone. The decline of floristic diversty in the inner <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> of Haidaura was probably related to self-pollution by fish culture. 1999 年 5 月に尾鷲市早田浦の 10 地点において海藻植生，海岸線の状況について調査を行った。採集された海 藻は緑藻綱 8 種，褐藻綱 14 種，紅藻綱 49 種の計 71 種であった。海藻植生から考察した結果，早田浦は内海域， 外海域の 2 つに区分された。海藻相は内海域，特に湾奥部で貧弱で磯焼けも見られた。外海域では海藻相は豊富 でトゲモクが優占するガラモ場が湾口部で広がっていた。湾奥部における海藻植生衰退の原因の 1 つとして魚類養 殖の影響が考えられた...|$|R

Firstly, tidal current of Jiangsu <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> was simulated by the Delft 3 D flow model. Then, wave parameters of East China Sea and Jiangsu <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> were computed, and then buoy data was used to compared with the modeled, they validated well. Last, the average wave height and period are calculated, {{and the distribution of}} wave height on each direction was studied. The result shows that the largest annually average wave height of Jiangsu is up to 1. 6 m. The average wave height is decreasing from southeast to northwest. The wave height in winter is larger than other seasons’. In this <b>sea</b> <b>area,</b> waves mainly come from NE and SE directions. Strong waves come from NE or NNE direction...|$|R
