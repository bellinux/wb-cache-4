40|$|The steel {{with various}} {{contents}} of carbon tempered {{for a long}} period of time after quenched in the water (10 ℃). In this case, the present investigators observed the process of <b>spherodizing</b> of carbide for each tempering time. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The higher the tempering temperature is, the more rapid the <b>spherodizing</b> velocity is for the same carbon steel. Especially the low carbon steels have this tendency. (2) The time of <b>spherodizing</b> cementite is shorter for the high carbon steel than the low carbon steel, and the size of <b>spherodizing</b> carbide is larger. (3) The majority of the drop of hardness was done for a very short time, and it was very small to drop the hardness for a long tempering. (4) The dispersion of <b>spherodizing</b> carbides in consequence of tempering for a low carbon steel is better than it done for a long heating of normalized steels...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of rapid}} heat {{transfer}} using a fluidized bed on the heat-treating response of Al-Si-Mg alloys (both unmodified and Sr modified) were investigated. The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in conventional air convective furnaces. Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to conventional air convective furnaces. The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a conventional air convective furnace is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster <b>spherodizing</b> rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains. Whereas the alloy solutionized using a conventional air convective furnace showed two exothermic reactions, one due to annihilation of point defects and the other due to recrystallization, and coarsening of the eutectic grains in the aluminum matrix. The recrystallization temperature of the alloy solutionized in the fluidized bed is lower {{than those in the}} conventional air convective furnace. Both tensile strength and elongation of fluidized bed solutionized alloys are greater than those solutionized using the air convective furnace. The optimum heat-treatment time for T 4 temper using a fluidized bed for unmodified and Sr-modified alloy was reduced to 60 and 30 minutes, respectively...|$|E

In extending the DLF process technology to refractory metals for producing fully dense, structurally sound deposits, several problems have become evident. (1) Control of porosity in DLF-deposited refractory metal is difficult because of gases, apparently present in commercially purchased refractory metal powder starting materials. (2) The radiant heat from the molten pool during deposition melts the DLF powder feed nozzle. (3) The high reflectivity of molten refractory metals, at the Nd-YAG laser wavelength (1. 06 {micro}m), produces damaging back reflections to the optical train and fiber optic delivery system that can terminate DLF processing. (4) The current limits on the maximum available laser power to prevent back reflection damage limit the parameter range available for densification of refractory metals.

40|$|Melting and {{solidification}} of a beryllium alloy containing 1. 5 % BeO {{by weight}} in the weightless environment of space has produced cast beryllium with a relatively uniform dispersion of BeO throughout. Examination of the cast material shows that it is coarse grained, although the BeO is not heavily agglomerated in the flight specimen. Ground based comparison experiments show extreme agglomeration and segregation of BeO, resulting in large zones which are practically free of the oxide. Several postulated hypotheses for the failure to grain refine the beryllium are formulated. These are: (1) spherodization of the BeO particles during specimen preparation and during the molten phase of the experiment; (2) loss of nucleation potency through aging in the molten phase; and (3) inability of BeO {{to act as a}} grain refiner for beryllium. Further investigation with non <b>spherodized</b> particles and shorter dwell times molten may delineate which of these hypotheses are valid. The results of this flight experiment indicate that the weightless environment of space is an important asset in conducting research to find grain refiners for beryllium and other metals for which cast dispersions of grain refining agents cannot be prepared terrestrially due to gravitationally driven settling and agglomeration...|$|R
40|$|In situ micro-cantilever {{fracture}} {{testing is}} used to demonstrate changes in fracture behavior of nanostructured, heavily cold drawn pearlitic steel wires {{as a function of}} drawing strain and annealing conditions. It is shown that these steels exhibit a sharp transition in fracture behavior between a drawing strain of 320 % and 520 % with a drop in fracture toughness from 7. 5 to 4 MPam(1 / 2). This is confirmed from the nature of fracture which is stable with some degree of plasticity at drawing strains below 320 % and changes to catastrophic cleavage fracture at drawing strains of 420 % and above. This transition and associated brittleness is attributed to structural (cementite decomposition and strain induced increase in tetragonality) and microstructural (increasing nanocrystallinity and dislocation density) evolution that these steels undergo at higher drawing strains. On heat treating, the 420 % strained sample, brittle cleavage fracture continues for low temperature (200 degrees C) annealing with no visible changes in microstructure, while crack growth is suppressed and large-scale plasticity is recovered for high temperature (500 degrees C) annealing with accompanying grain coarsening, and re-precipitation of <b>spherodized</b> cementite at grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{evolution of}} submicron sized ferrite in bimodal structural ultrafine grained ferrite/cementite steels with 0. 15 pct carbon content and 0. 45 pct carbon content upon annealing below the austenized temperature was investigated. The average grain sizes of the ferrites {{with a normal}} density and with a high density of cementite particles were plotted, respectively, {{as a function of}} the annealed temperature and time, and exhibited different coarsening behaviors. The average grain sizes of the ferrites with a normal density of cementite particles gradually coarsened by increasing the annealing temperature or time, while those with a high density of cementite particles hardly changed at first, and then coarsened after reaching a certain annealing condition. The coarsening of the ferrite grain size in the steel with 0. 15 pet carbon content occurred much more readily than that in the steel with 0. 45 pet carbon content upon annealing. The spacing and the critical spacing of cementite particle were measured and hypothetically calculated, respectively. The size and the distribution of cementite particles was one of the critical factors affecting the microstructural evolution in this type of cementite particle <b>spherodized</b> steels. Most of the coarsening of the ferrite grain size occurred after the cementite particle spacing reached the required critical value...|$|R

In the present work phosphate glass microspheres were produced with different compositions and particle size distribution {{in the range of}} 20 - 30 mu m. Two different thermal processes were used to <b>spherodize</b> glass particles originally with irregular shapes. Samples were characterized by X-rays diffraction to check the amorphous structure, energy dispersive X-rays fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the final glass composition, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy to determine the structural groups in the glass structure. The dissolution rate of glass samples in water was determined at 90 degrees C, and in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 degrees C. Classes with dissolution rates close to 10 (- 5) g/(cm(2) day) were obtained, which make them suitable for the present application. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the shape of the microspheres before and after the dissolution tests.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to evaluate the effects of grain refiner TiCal 315 (3 %Ti, 0. 15 %C) and Al- 5 Ti- 1 B on the metallurgicalproperties of as-cast A 356 gravity die castings {{as well as the}} improvement brought about by T 6 heat treatment. The TiCal 315 and Al- 5 Ti- 1 B grain refiners were added separately into the A 356 melt in different weight percentages of 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 to produce the gravity die casting samples. The geometry of the casting is designed to be cylindrical shape according to JIS H 5202. The results show that TiCal 315 is relatively more effective than Al- 5 Ti- 1 B to improve the tensile strength, hardness and elongation of A 356 alloy by 10 ~ 20 %. T 6 heat treatment is confirmed to have more significantly improved the mechanical properties of A 356 alloy compared to grainrefinement. An Olympus imaging software was used to measure the average grain size of α-Al phase and the results do not showsignificant difference between TiCal 315 and Al- 5 Ti- 1 B to grain-refine the A 356 dendritic structures.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{microstructure}} of two ductile steels on their solid particle erosion were determined. The steels chosen allowed microstructural changes to be made without drastically changing their hardness, which {{is reported to be}} a direct function of erosion resistance. The steels used were plain carbon 1075 and 1020 in the coarse pearlite, fine pearlite, and spheroidized forms for the 1075 and in three <b>spherodized</b> conditions for the 1020 steel. Single particle and multiple particle erosion tests were conducted using 240 {micro}m diameter SiC particles, angles of impingement of 15 °, 30 °, and 90 ° and velocities of 30. 5 mps (100 fps) and 61 mps (200 fps). Both surface and subsurface analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy. In the room temperature erosion tests, the spheroidized microstructure of the 1075 steel eroded less than either of the two pearlitic microstructures. It was found that the pearlitic steels exhibited cracking at the eroded surface as well as beneath it, causing greater material removal. The spheroidized structure showed no surface cracking; however, cracking did occur at a depth of approximately 20 {micro}m below the surface. The carbide particle spacing in the 1020 spheroidized steel also had a measureable effect on the erosion rate, The hardness of the various microstructures had an inverse relation to the erosion rate...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spherodized</b> {{graphite}} iron (SG iron) or {{popularly known as}} Ductile iron is a special variety of cast iron having carbon content more than 3 % and has graphite present in spherical shapes. mechanical properties which are much higher than other cast irons and which can be comparable to steels. Thus enables SG irons {{to be used for}} numerous industrial applications. Alloying element addition greatly affects the mechanical properties of SG iron with Mn, Cu, Si and Ni being more predominant. While copper helps increasing the hardness causing no embrittlement in the matrix, Ni helps enhancing the ultimate tensile strength without affecting the impact energy values. Therefore addition of Cu and Ni plays key role in determining the end properties of SG iron after heat treatment. The high ratio of performance to cost which it offers to the designer and end user makes it to be used extensively for industrial uses. However, to enhance the consistency & range of properties of SG iron beyond its properties while in as-cast condition, Heat treatment is a required operation. Tempering & Austempering are two most widely used heat treatment operations in Ductile iron. For example a ferritic iron containing 70 - 80 % ferrite has a yield strength of 350 Mpa while a similar material which is given a step quenching treatment shows a yield strength of 550 - 1250 Mpa.

The man for cast iron longevity are its wide range of mechanical and physical properties coupled with its competitive price. Ductile iron or popularly known as <b>spherodized</b> graphite iron (SGiron) is a special variety of cast iron having carbon content more than 3 % and has graphite present in compact, spherical shapes. These compact spheroid hamper {{the continuity of the}} matrix much less than graphite flakes which results in higher strength and toughness with a structure that resembles gray cast iron, thus imparting superior mechanical properties i. e. much higher than all other cast irons and which can be compared to steel. This unique property enables ductile iron to be used for numerous industrial applications. The excellent combination of mechanical properties obtained in S. G. iron can further be improved by the heat treatment. The most recent development in this regard is the production of Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI). It provides an excellent combination of high tensile strength, wear resistance along with good corrosion resistance and quite significant amount of ductility. Due to these factors, S. G. or ductile iron is austempered when a very favouurable combination of various properties is required. But this type of treatment is bit tricky, since it require controlled heating and isothermal holding of the material. So it is necessary to find some attractive methods for property development in S. G. iron. The present work is an attempt to study the properties enhancement of ductile iron by heat treatment. Normalizing, Austenitization, Quenching & Tempering, Austempering methods are applied to study the hardness, tensile strength, and impact strength of the material. The mechanical properties obtain by various technique have been compared to one another using two different grades of S. G. Iron (one with copper and another without copper).

40|$|Microstructural {{evolution}} during {{heat treatment}} and the precipitation hardening response of Mg-Ca-Zn alloys were investigated. The binary Mg- 2. 5 Ca alloy {{was chosen as}} the base alloy and the effects of adding one and two wt% zinc on the microstructural characteristics and precipitation hardening of the alloy system were studied. The as-cast microstructure of all three alloys showed dendritic solidification of α-Mg and the formation of the eutectic mixtures and/or multiple phases within the interdendritic regions. Homogenization heat treatment of the binary alloy removed the dendritic structure of α-Mg and <b>spherodized</b> the lamellar eutectic of α-Mg+Mg 2 Ca. Homogenization heat treatment in the ternary Mg-Ca-Zn alloys resulted in the formation of α-Mg grains with Mg 2 Ca and zinc-containing particles mainly dispersed along the grain boundaries. The EDS analysis suggested that zinc is incorporated in Mg 2 Ca particles. To study the precipitation hardening response of the alloys, homogenized alloys were aged at 175 °C, 200 °C and 220 °C. At all three isothermal aging temperatures, the binary alloy showed only a slight increase in hardness, i. e. from 50 VHN in the homogenized state to approximately 53 VHN when peak aged. On the other hand, adding zinc was found to promote the age hardening response of the ternary alloys and caused the hardness to increase up to 70 VHN at the peak-aged condition. To further study the precipitation hardening behavior of the alloys, DSC and IC studies were conducted on the homogenized, as–quenched, alloys. The DSC result of the binary alloy showed only one exothermic heat effect, while the ternary alloys showed multiple exothermic peaks. Analysis of the DSC and IC traces, along with the evaluation of the slight increase in microhardness, suggested that non-coherent equilibrium precipitates formed in the aged binary alloy. In addition, it was suggested that the formation of coherent precipitates during aging can be the cause of the pronounced increase in hardness in the aged ternary alloys. The IC traces of the alloys were used to evaluate the kinetics of precipitation in the ternary alloys. It was concluded that increasing aging temperature from 175 °C to 220 °C greatly increased the precipitation rate. Finally the JMAK model was fit to the experimentally analyzed data for the evolution of the relative volume fraction of precipitates. It was found that the experimentally analyzed data was reasonably well described by the JMAK model. The corresponding JMAK kinetic parameters k and n were relatively close for the two ternary alloys at any aging temperature. The temperature dependence of k was modeled using the Arrhenius-type rate relationship. This analysis resulted in a smaller value for the apparent activation energy in the ternary alloy containing the higher zinc level, i. e. in Mg- 2 Ca- 2 Zn alloy...|$|R
