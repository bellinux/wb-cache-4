50|$|The Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault {{system is}} located in northwestern South America, where the 20 ± 2 mm/yr east to southeastward moving Caribbean, 60 mm/yr eastward subducting Nazca, and South American Plates converge. Since Early Mesozoic times, the western portion of Colombia was {{subjected}} to different episodes of subduction, accretion and collision, at {{the boundaries of the}} South America continental and the oceanic Farallon, Nazca, and Caribbean Plates and various island arcs. The interaction of the plate tectonic movements formed the Northern Andean Block, separated from the Maracaibo Block by the Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault. The Northern Andean Block is subdivided into tectonic realms, with the Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault separating the Central Continental <b>Sub-plate</b> Realm in the west from the Maracaibo <b>Sub-plate</b> Realm in the east. It has been suggested that these two realms are dominated by respectively Nazca and Caribbean Plate subduction. The compressional stress regime caused the formation of the oblique sinistral Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault and dextral Oca and Boconó Faults.|$|E

[...] This magnificent fit, however, has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward-propagating break-up.

The plate has two opposite simply supported edges that are parallel to the load direction while the other remaining edges may take any combination of free, simply supported or clamped conditions. Both the incremental theory of plasticity and the deformation theory of plasticity are considered in bounding the plastic behaviour of the plate. The buckling problem is solved by decomposing the plate into two sub-plates at the boundary where the intermediate load acts. Each <b>sub-plate</b> buckling problem is solved exactly using the Levy approach and the two solutions brought together by the continuity equations at the separated interface. There are eight possible solutions for each <b>sub-plate</b> and consequently there are 64 combinations of solutions to be considered for the entire plate.

The westward propagating and slowly diverging Cocos-Nazca Ridge cuts between the two <b>sub-plates</b> toward the East Pacific Rise. However, the tip of Cocos-Nazca Ridge does not fully meet the East Pacific Rise and, in fact, the westerly propagating Cocos-Nazca Ridge generates secondary transient rifts by shear stresses. The tip of the Cocos-Nazca ridge has maintained a distance of 50 km from the East Pacifc Rise and slightly moved its position into {{the eastern part of the}} microplate due to clockwise rotation of the GMP.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} disordered and {{irregular}} rib spacing on the vibration response of finite plates is studied in this paper. It is found that general vibration {{reduction in the}} pass bands {{can be achieved by}} simply imposing a single disorder to a periodic ribbed plate. We further found that irregular rib spacing on the ribbed plate can only localize the group of modes, where the modal response is dominated by coupling of flexural waves in the <b>sub-plates</b> and interfacing beams. Vibration confinement for the other group of modes associated with the coupling of torsional waves at the interfaces requires torsional stiffness irregularity to be imposed on the stiffened beams.

5000|$|The {{most common}} use for this {{technique}} is controlling {{the path of a}} stream of electrons in a vacuum. One application is in small cathode ray tubes for oscilloscopes. In these tubes the electric field is created by two sets of paired electrodes, mounted at right angles, that the electron stream flows between. This arrangement allows independent deflection of the beam in two dimensions (usually perceived as up/down (vertical) and right/left (horizontal)). The electrodes are commonly called deflection plates. Traditionally, the electrons pass through the vertical deflection plates first, yielding slightly higher sensitivity because of the longer travel time from the vertical deflection plates to the phosphor screen as compared to the horizontal deflection plates. In very high speed oscilloscopes, the deflection plates were often complex structures, combining a series of <b>sub-plates</b> with an electrical delay line. By matching the propagation speed of the electrical signal with the transit speed of the electrons, maximum bandwidth (frequency response) was achieved.|$|R

In fact, differential tectonism between exotic or suspect geological terrain explains much of the spatial patterns of west coast tide-gauge data. Peltier's isostatic model appears not to explain the spatial pattern, implying glacio-isostatic adjustment is not the dominant contribution to the low-frequency signals.

The result revealed certain anomalous pre-earthquake deformation and some large co-seismic changes. Prior to the 2008 Wenchuan Ms 8. 0 earthquake, the seismogenic Kunlunshan fault zone became a geographic boundary between different regional movements. At {{the time of the}} earthquake, there was an average cross-fault crustal shortening of − 1. 04 m and an average right-lateral strike slip of 0. 76 m along the ruptured segment, as well as a strain-energy release of − 62. 66 × 10. 7...|$|E
40|$|Inventory of road {{infrastructure}} represents a key application for integrated mobile mapping systems. The classical {{approach is to}} post-process geo-referenced imagery that has been captured from mobile mapping vans while driving within the road. Problems arise then within city centres where dense traffic and parking vehicles may often hinder occlusion free image captures of the objects of interest. We present an alternative solution {{in terms of a}} mobile PDA based geo-information system for pedestrian based road sign data collection which is targeted towards complementing the classical approach, particularly in city centres. The novel system consists of a mobile computing unit which is equipped with a GPS sensor, a digital camera, a standard mobile GIS software, and a user interface for minimal user intervention. Imagery for road sign inventory is firstly captured and geo-referenced in the street and then analyzed in a second, off-line processing step. We present a post-processing tool for semi-automated classification of road signs, and in parallel an identification of the <b>sub-plate</b> information, strongly supporting the processing of huge data sets, e. g., for the processing of data from complete city areas. The tool includes advanced image analysis methodology with (i) localization of selective key descriptors and regions of interest, (ii) the fitting of geometrical constraints to the extracted set of interest descriptors, and (iii) the matching of content information from the visual information within the sign plate. Text information on the <b>sub-plate</b> is first detected using a wavelet based texture filter, and then post-processed with segmentation operators and standard OCR software.

40|$|Large, shallow, thrust {{earthquakes}} in the Solomon Islands region tend {{to occur}} in closely related pairs. Two recent sequences are July 14, 1971 (M_S = 7. 9) and July 26, 1971 (M_S = 7. 9) and 14 ^h 37 ^m, July 20, 1975 (M_S = 7. 9) and 19 ^h 54 ^m, July 20, 1975 (M_S = 7. 7). The mechanism of these seismic doublets has important bearing on the triggering mechanism of earthquakes in subduction zones. Detailed analysis of the seismic body waves and surface waves were performed on the 1971, 1974, and 1975 doublets, providing a better understanding of: (1) the mechanics of seismic triggering, (2) the state of stress on the fault plane, and (3) the nature of subduction between the Pacific and Indian plates. The results indicate that although the geometry of the subduction zone in the Solomon Islands {{is complicated by the}} presence of several <b>sub-plates,</b> the slip direction of the Indian plate with respect to the Pacific plate is relatively uniform over the entire region. The large seismic moments of the 1971 sequence (1. 2 · 10 ^ 28 and 1. 8 · 10 ^ 28 dyne cm) indicate that these events directly represent the underthrusting of the Indian and Solomon plates beneath the Pacific plate. The body waves from these doublets, recorded on the WWSSN long-period seismograms, are remarkably impulsive and simple compared with those from events of comparable seismic moment in other subduction zones. In addition, the source dimensions of the body waves are 30 – 70 km in length, substantially smaller than the overall rupture surfaces radiating the surface waves which are 100 – 300 km in length. These facts suggest the existence of relatively large, isolated high-stress zones on the fault plane. This type of stress distribution is distinct from other regions which have more heterogeneous stress distribution on the fault plane, and this is proposed as the principal characteristic of this region responsible for the occurrence of the doublets and for the apparent efficiency of triggering in the Solomon trench. Prior to the 1971 sequence, similar sequences have occurred in the same area in 1919 – 1920 and 1945 – 1946. From the amount of slip (1. 3 m) determined for the 1971 sequence and the apparent recurrence interval of 25 years, a seismic slip rate of 5 cm yr^− 1 is determined. This value is {{a significant portion of the}} convergence rate between the Indian and Pacific plates indicating that the plate motion here is taken up largely by seismic slip...|$|R
40|$|African Reference Frame (AFREF) is the {{proposed}} regional three-dimensional standard frame, {{which will be}} used to reference positions and velocities for geodetic sites in Africa and surrounding. This frame will {{play a crucial role in}} scientific application for example plate motion and crustal deformation studies, and also in mapping when it involves for example national boundary surveying, remote sensing, GIS, engineering projects and other development programs in Africa. ^ To contribute to the definition of geodetic reference frame for Africa and provide the first continent-wide position/velocity solution for Africa, we processed and analyzed 16 years of GPS and 17 years of DORIS data at 133 GPS sites and 9 DORIS sites continuously operating geodetic sites in Africa and surroundings to describe the present-day kinematics of the Nubian and Somalian plates and constrain relative motions across the East African Rift. We use the resulting horizontal velocities to determine the level of rigidity of Nubia and updated a plate motion model for the East African Rift and revise the counter clockwise rotation of the Victoria plate and clockwise rotation of the Rovuma plate with respect to Nubia. The vertical velocity ranges from - 2 to + 2 mm/yr, close to their uncertainties with no clear geographical pattern. This study provides the first continent-wide position/velocity solution for Africa, expressed in International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF 2008), a contribution to the upcoming African Reference Frame (AFREF). ^ In the next step we used the substantial increase in the geologic, geophysical and geodetic data in Africa to improve our understanding of the rift geometry and the block kinematics of the EAR. We determined the best-fit fault structure of the rift in terms of the locking depth and dip angle and use a block modeling approach where observed velocities are described as the contribution of rigid block rotation and strain accumulation on locked faults. Our results show a better fit with three <b>sub-plates</b> (Victoria, Rovuma and Lwandle) between the major plates Nubia and Somalia. We show that the earthquake slip vectors provide information that is consistent with the GPS velocities and significantly help reduce the uncertainties in plate angular velocity estimates. However, we find that 3. 16 My average spreading rates along the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) from MORVEL model are systematically faster than GPS-derived motions across that ridge, possibly reflecting the need to revise the MORVEL outward displacement correction. ^ In the final step, we attempt to understand the hydrological loading in Africa, which may affect our geodetic estimates, particularly the uplift rates. In this work, we analyze 10 years (2002 - 2012) of continuous GPS measurements operating in Africa, and compare with the modeled hydrological loading deformation inferred from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) at the same GPS location and for the same time period. We estimated hydrological loading deformation based on the Equivalent Water Height (EWH) derived from the 10 -days interval reprocessed GRACE solution second release (RL 02). We took in to account in both GPS and GRACE the systematic errors from atmospheric pressure and non-tidal ocean loading effects and model the Earth as perfect elastic and compute the deformation using appropriate Greens function. We analyze the strength of association between the observation (GPS) and the model (GRACE) in terms of annual amplitude and phase as well as the original data (time-series). We find a good correlation mainly in regions associated with strong seasonal hydrological variations. To improve the correlation between the two solutions, we subtract the GRACE-derived vertical displacement from GPS-observed time series and determine the variance reduction. Our solution shows average variance between the model and the observation reduced to ~ 40 %. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

Analyses concerning the nucleation of sub-plates have been presented. Having two models assumes that the <b>sub-plate</b> growth is of a logarithmic and exponential character. In order to calculate a volume fraction of two components of bainite fB 1 and fB 2, formulas linking an actual volume increase of the components with their current growth have been applied, leading to extended volume.

The directions of two strips cut successively are either parallel or orthogonal. The algorithm generates the optimal UB pattern recursively, and selects optimally the first strip to cut from the current <b>sub-plate.</b> It uses upper bound to prune some unpromising branches during the searching process, and can control {{the complexity of the}} cutting process through adjusting the number of sections included in the pattern. The computational results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in solving large-scale problems, and the material utilization is better than that of the two-staged pattern...|$|E
30|$|Brain {{development}} in the piglet is more analogous to that of full-term gestation human newborns than to non-human primates with prenatal brain growth spurts, or rodents with postnatal growth spurts [14]. The multilayer cortical <b>sub-plate</b> of the developing pig brain and the expression pattern of reelin, a glycoprotein that influences neuronal migration, are strongly analogous to the developing human brain [10, 19]. Grey and white matter distributions and patterns are similar in human neonates and piglets, and the maturation of the postnatal pig brain is comparable to humans with respect to myelination and electrical activity [18, 20]. Another important consideration is the time difference in brain development between piglets and human infants. Ten to 14 -day old piglets show the rapid brain growth, neuronal maturation, and dendritic arborisations/connections comparable to a 2 -month-old human infant [18]. Perhaps most importantly, an impressive homology exists between the genomes of humans and pigs, with many genes being conserved across both species [21].|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{assumed that the}} {{boundary}} layer above the core {{is the source of}} intraplate volcanoes such as Hawaii, Samoa, and Yellowstone, and that the <b>sub-plate</b> boundary layer {{at the top of the}} mantle is thin and entirely subsolidus. In fact, this upper layer is thicker and has higher expansivity, buoyancy, and insulating power than the lower one, and may have higher potential temperatures. The observed seismic structure of the low-velocity zone (LVZ) including attenuation, anisotropy, sharp boundaries, and a reduction of both compressional and shear moduli can be taken as strong evidence for the ubiquitous presence of melt in the upper mantle. If the LVZ contains as little as 1 %– 2 % melt, then it is the most plausible and accessible source for midplate magmas; deeply rooted active upwellings are unnecessary. The upper boundary layer is also the most plausible source of ancient isotopic signatures of these magmas and their inclusions...|$|E
40|$|Crustal {{receiver}} functions {{have been}} calculated from 128 events for two three-component broadband seismomenters {{located on the}} south coast (FOMA) and in the central High Plateaux (ABPO) of Madagascar. For each station, crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio were estimated from H- κ plots. Self-consistent receiver functions from a smaller back-azimuthal range were then selected, stacked and inverted to determine shear wave velocity structure {{as a function of}} depth. These results were corroborated by guided forward modeling and by Monte Carlo error analysis. The crust is found to be thinner (39 ± 0. 7 km) beneath the highland center of Madagascar compared to the coast (44 ± 1. 6 km), which is the opposite of what would be expected for crustal isostasy, suggesting that present-day long wavelength topography is maintained, at least in part, dynamically. This inference of dynamic support is corroborated by shear wave splitting analyses at the same stations, which produce an overwhelming majority of null results (> 96 %), as expected for vertical mantle flow or asthenospheric upwelling beneath the island. These findings suggest a <b>sub-plate</b> origin for dynamic support...|$|E

The results of five campaigns carried out between 1990 and 2008 are presented. Four campaigns were measured annually between 1990 and 1993 using a Mekometer ME 5000. An additional campaign was carried out in the summer of 2008 using a Leica TC 2002. The large time interval between the campaigns contributed dramatically to the ability of the Kfar-Hanassi network to detect movements. The distance measurements were analyzed by a Two-Step analysis. In the first step the distance measurements were processed sequentially without modeling the variations in the plane position of the network benchmarks. In the second step the variations in the network geometry were modeled by means of a physical model. In this study a linear model of movements was tested to describe the plane position of the network benchmarks. The results indicate a left-lateral motion along the DSR with a rate of a few tenths of millimeters per year...|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{is used to}} analyze the Cenozoic uplift history of South America. Residual depth anomalies of oceanic crust abutting this continent help to determine the pattern of present-day dynamic topography. Admittance analysis and crustal thickness measurements indicate that the elastic thickness of the Borborema and Altiplano regions is ≤₁₀ km with evidence for <b>sub-plate</b> support at longer wavelengths. A drainage inventory of 1827 river profiles is assembled and used to investigate landscape development. Linear inverse modeling enables river profiles to be fitted {{as a function of the}} spatial and temporal history of regional uplift. Erosional parameters are calibrated using observations from the Borborema Plateau and tested against continent-wide stratigraphic and thermochronologic constraints. Our results predict that two phases of regional uplift of the Altiplano plateau occurred in Neogene times. Regional uplift of the southern Patagonian Andes also appears to have occurred in Early Miocene times. The consistency between observed and predicted histories for the Borborema, Altiplano, and Patagonian plateaux implies that drainage networks record coherent signals that are amenable to simple modeling strategies. Finally, the predicted pattern of incision across the Amazon catchment constrains solid sedimentary flux at the Foz do Amazonas. Observed and calculated flux estimates match, suggesting that erosion and deposition were triggered by regional Andean uplift during Miocene times...|$|E

Cerebral cortical developmental disorders (including schizophrenia and autism) and perinatal injuries involve cortical neurons with early connectivity. The major hindrance of progress in understanding the early neural circuits during cortical development and disease has been the lack of reliable markers for specific cell populations. Due to the advance of powerful approaches in gene expression analysis and the utility of models with reporter gene expressions in specific cortical cell types, our knowledge of the early cortical circuits is rapidly increasing. With focus on the <b>sub-plate,</b> layer VI and layer V projection neurons, we shall illustrate the progress made in the understanding of their neurochemical properties, physiological characteristics and their integration into the early intracortical and extracortical circuitry. This field benefited from recent developments in mouse genetics in generating models with subtype specific gene expression patterns, powerful cell dissection and separation methods combined with microarray analysis.

A rigorous statistical analysis based on the F (Fisher) test applied on the detected coordinate differences showed significant displacement at all the sites located on the Sinai peninsula {{with respect to the}} others. The planar displacements of the Sinai sites are of the order of 1. 5 cm in the considered time span. The agreement exhibited by the Sinai displacements, both in magnitude and azimuth, taking into account the associated errors, provides evidence that the Sinai peninsula behaves like a rigid block or <b>sub-plate</b> with respect to the African plate. A raw estimate of its mean velocity gives about 3. 0 cm/yr and 208 ° of azimuth. Although {{it is not possible to}} draw exhaustive conclusions on the geodynamics of the Suez and Sinai areas and the lack of GPS data on the Arabian peninsula makes the analysis incomplete, our results agree well with the left lateral motion of the Aqaba-Levant fault.

40|$|Convective {{circulation}} of the Earth's mantle maintains some fraction of surface topography that varies with space and time. Most predictive models {{show that this}} dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 2 km, dominated by wavelengths of 10 $^ 4 $ km. Here, we test these models against our comprehensive observational database of 2, 120 spot measurements of dynamic topography that were determined by analysing oceanic seismic surveys. These accurate measurements have typical peak amplitudes of ± 1 km and wavelengths of approximately 10 $^ 3 $ km, and are combined with limited continental constraints to generate a global spherical harmonic model, the robustness {{of which has been}} carefully tested and benchmarked. Our power spectral analysis reveals significant discrepancies between observed and predicted dynamic topography. At longer wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 4 $ km), observed dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 500 m. At shorter wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 3 $ km), significant dynamic topography is still observed. We show that these discrepancies can be explained if short-wavelength dynamic topography is generated by temperature-driven density anomalies within a <b>sub-plate</b> asthenospheric channel. Stratigraphic observations from adjacent continental margins show that these dynamic topographic signals evolve quickly with time. More rapid temporal and spatial changes in vertical displacement of the Earth's surface have direct consequences for fields as diverse as mantle flow, oceanic circulation and long-term climate change.

40|$|We analyze {{data from}} four GPS campaigns carried out between 1997 and 2002 {{on a network}} of 11 sites in the Suez-Sinai, the area of {{collision}} between the African and the Arabian plates. This is the key area to understand how and in which way Sinai behaves like a <b>sub-plate</b> of the African plate and the role played between seismic and geodetic (long term) deformation release. Our analysis shows that, on average, the Suez-Sinai area motion (in terms of ITRF 00 velocities) matches African plate motion (NNR-NUVEL- 1 A model). However, the baseline length variations show transient deformations in Sinai and across the Gulf of Suez, reaching up a maximum value of about 1. 5 cm in five years. Since current geodynamical models do not predict significant tectonic deformation in this area, we worked under the hypothesis that a contribute {{may be due to}} post-seismic relaxation. Under this hypothesis, we compared the baselines length variations with the post-seismic relaxation field associated with five major local earthquakes occurred in the area, testing two different viscoelastic models. Our results show that the transient deformations are better modelled for viscosity values of 1018 Pa s in the lower crust and 1020 Pa s in the asthenosphere. However, since the modelled post-seismic effect results modest and a certain amount of the detected deformation is not accounted for, we think that an improved modelling should take into account the lateral heterogeneities of crust and upper mantle structures...|$|E

The majority of marginal zone cells are generated at embryonic day 12 (E 12), E 13 and E 14, although some cells generated later can incorporate into this stratum after the cortical plate forms. The nature and {{the origin of the}} cell populations that colonize the preplate/marginal zone was studied by means of immunohistochemistry using cell markers for γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), reelin and the calcium binding proteins calretinin and calbindin. At early stages of development, the preplate is formed by Cajal-Retzius cells, subplate cells, subpial granular layer cells, some interneurons and some glial cells. With the arrival of the cortical plate cells, the <b>sub-plate</b> cells descend to occupy the stratum below. Layer 1 cells are of diverse origin as some of them are generated in the ventricular zone of the cortical neuroepithelium, whereas other cell populations come from extracortical regions such as the olfactory placode or the ganglionic eminences of the basal telencephalon. The predominant cell type in the marginal zone is the Cajal-Retzius cell, which expresses reelin and calretinin, and is probably generated in the cortical neuroepithelium. These cells can be readily distinguished from cells that come from the ganglionic eminences as these later populations mainly express GABA and calbindin. Finally, our results suggest that the cells of the subpial granular layer might be generated in the rostral pole of the lateral ganglionic eminences. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|The Dead Sea rift (DSR), {{known by}} a variety of other names (Levant fault, Jordan rift, or the archaeic Syrian-African rift) had played a {{prominent}} {{role in the development of}} plate tectonics theory (Quennel, 1959; Wilson, 1965). Significant gaps persist in our knowledge of basic properties of the fault. The physiographic features created by fault activity, sighted so vividly since early space missions (cover), do coincide with political boundaries that hamper research in general and international collaboration in particular. Nevertheless, the fundamental tectonic framework has been outlined: the rift can be attributed to a small divergence component across this dominantly left-lateral plate boundary, the junction of the Arabia Plate with the Sinai block (a <b>sub-plate</b> coupled with the Africa Plate) (Freund, 1970; Freund et al., 1968; Garfunkel, 1981). Earthquake activity along the DSR has been low since the 1927 M 6. 2 Dead Sea earthquake (Salamon et al., 2003). A surge of activity during the two decades ending the millennium has culminated with the M 7. 2 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake in 1995. This event sparked renewed efforts to understand rift tectonics and associated seismic hazard. Some of these studies involved ground breaking international collaborations. These include Amit et al. (1996), Hofstetter et al. (1996), Ellenblum et al. (1998), Ben Avraham et al. (1999), Baer et al. (1999), Klinger et al. (2000), Al Zoubi and ten-Brink, (2001), Gomez et al. (2001), Ken-Tor et al.

40|$|The structure, {{density and}} {{effective}} viscosity of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Central Mediterranean influence lithospheric deformation, mantle flow, and tectonic stress state. To estimate {{the contribution of}} buoyancy forces to regional dynamics, three-dimensional finite-element models are devel- oped to determine contemporary uppermost mantle flow and tectonic stresses. We use density models for the crust and uppermost mantle derived from S-wave seismic velocities and constrained by gravity data. The viscosity model is constrained by the observed strain rate and regional heat flow data. The modeled movement of the uppermost crust {{is consistent with the}} northeast-oriented motion of the lithosphere and is in an agreement with the geodetic measurements. The modeled flow patterns of the lower crust and uppermost mantle are consistent with the regional observations. The models predict (i) northwest-oriented movements beneath the southeast part of the Adriatic Sea region, (ii) the northeastern subduction beneath {{the western part of the}} Adriatic Sea, (iii) the upwelling beneath the Tyrrhenian Sea and its eastern coast, (iv) the western movement of the Ionian Sea <b>sub-plate,</b> and (v) the subduction beneath the western Calabria region. Our models predict also a distinct compressional regime along the northeast part of the Italian peninsula and to the east of Sicily, and a tensional regime beneath the Tyrrhenian Sea, Umbria–Marche region, and Ionian Sea. The predicted tectonic stress regimes in the northern and central Apennines are in agreement with stress regimes derived from earthquake fault-plane solutions. Changes in the predicted crustal stress pattern and magnitude are likely to be caused by buoyancy-driven mantle circulation beneath the region rather than by gravitational potential energy differences in the crust itself. Based on the model results, we conclude that the buoyancy forces play an important role in the contemporary tectonics of the region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the nervous}} system, {{as in other}} organs, Cu/Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) is a key antioxidant enzyme involved in superoxide detoxification in normal cellular metabolism and after cell injury. Although {{it has been suggested}} that immature brain has a different susceptibility to oxidative damage than adult brain, the distribution and cell-specific expression of this enzyme in immature brain and after postnatal brain damage has not been documented. Methods In this study, we used immunohistochemistry and western blot to analyze the expression of Cu/Zn SOD in intact immature rat brain and in immature rat brain after an NMDA-induced excitotoxic cortical injury performed at postnatal day 9. Double immunofluorescence labelling was used to identify Cu/Zn SOD-expressing cell populations. Results In intact immature brain, Cu/Zn SOD enzyme was widely expressed at high levels in neurons mainly located in cortical layers II, III and V, in the <b>sub-plate,</b> in the pyriform cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the hypothalamus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells only showed Cu/Zn SOD expression in the glia limitans and in scattered cells of the ventricle walls. No expression was detected in interfascicular oligodendroglia, microglia or endothelial cells. Following excitotoxic damage, neuronal Cu/Zn SOD was rapidly downregulated (over 2 – 4 hours) at the injection site before neurodegeneration signals and TUNEL staining were observed. Later, from 1 day post-lesion onward, an upregulation of Cu/Zn SOD was found due to increased expression in astroglia. A further increase was observed at 3, 5 and 7 days that corresponded to extensive induction of Cu/Zn SOD in highly reactive astrocytes and in the astroglial scar. Conclusion We show here that, in the intact immature brain, the expression of Cu/Zn SOD was mainly found in neurons. When damage occurs, a strong and very rapid downregulation of this enzyme precedes neuronal degeneration, and is followed by an upregulation of Cu/Zn SOD in astroglial cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{observations}} from eight GPS campaigns carried out between 1997 and 2005 {{on a network}} of 13 sites in the Suez–Sinai area, where separation between the African and the Arabian plates takes place. This is the key area to understand if and in which way Sinai behaves like a <b>sub-plate</b> of the African plate and {{the role played by}} seismic and geodetic (long-term) deformation release. Our analysis shows that, on average, the Suez–Sinai area motion, in terms of ITRF 00 velocities, matches the African plate motion defined by the NNR-NUVEL- 1 A model. The horizontal principal strain rate axes estimated separately in the Gulf of Suez area and in the northern Sinai vary from compression across the Gulf (− 2. 2 ± 1. 2) × 10 − 8 year− 1 to NE extension (1. 0 ± 1. 5) × 10 − 8 year− 1 in the North, showing the presence of two distinct domains, so that in our opinion Sinai cannot be considered simply a unique rigid block. The analysis of GPS baseline length variations shows short-term deformations across the Gulf of Suez, reaching up a maximum value of more than 1 cm in 8 years. Since current geodynamical models do not predict significant tectonic deformation in this area, we work under the hypothesis that a contribute may be expected by post-seismic relaxation effects. Under this hypothesis, we compare the baselines length variations with the post-seismic relaxation field associated with five major local earthquakes occurred in the area, testing two different viscoelastic models. Our results show that the detected short-term deformations are better modeled for viscosity values of 1018 Pa s in the lower crust and 1020 Pa s in the asthenosphere. However, since the modeled post-seismic effect results modest and a certain amount of the detected deformation is not accounted for, we think that an improved modeling should take into account the lateral heterogeneities of crust and upper mantle structures...|$|E
40|$|The northeastern {{margin of}} the African plate, in the Latakia region of {{northwest}} Syria, has an important bearing on the closure and collisional history of the Tethys Ocean in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This field-based study focuses on the Tertiary geology of the Nahr El-Kabir basin and provides new insights on the sedimentation, biochronology, structure and regional tectonics of the area. Three unconformity-bound megasequences of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary age are identified, which were strongly influenced by tectonic processes: 1. Late Maastrichtian-Mid Eocene; 2. Miocene; 3. Late Miocene (Messinian) -Late Pliocene. Megasequence 1 was initiated by a Late Maastrichtian-age marine transgression over Maastrichtian-emplaced ophiolitic rocks and melange (Baer Bassit Massif). Water depths increased in the Palaeocene, giving rise to outer-shelf-depth carbonate deposition, rich in planktic foraminifera. Marine high productivity is reflected in common diagenetic chert formation. Nummulite-rich carbonates accumulated on a shallower shelf during Early-Mid Eocene time. Shallowing of marine conditions, coupled with tectonic instability, culminated in emergence, followed by a Late Eocene-Oligocene hiatus. Megasequence 2 is spatially restricted to the Nahr El-Kabir Graben and begins with Early Miocene carbonate deposition of mainly pelagic facies. In the Middle Miocene, there was an increasing input of basin margin-derived high-density turbidites and debris flows. Minor ongoing tectonism was followed by regression during the Messinian salinity crisis. Megasequence 3 begins with the accumulation of mainly laminated gypsum, followed by gypsum debris flows and selenitic gypsum. Initial Pliocene transgression led to shallow-marine, open-shelf muddy sedimentation, shallowing up, prior to the Late Pliocene into marls and bioclastic carbonates. Late Pliocene-Quaternary time was marked by progressive uplift, marine and continental terracing and erosion. A Maastrichtian to Paleogene submerged shelf succession on the Arabian Platform culminated in a regional hiatus during the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Early Neogene rifting led to development of a transtensional basin (the Nahr El-Kabir Graben, a probable half graben). Strike-slip deformation (probably sinistral) and regional uplift followed during Late Neogene-Quaternary time. The Miocene Nahr El-Kabir Graben developed along an important, inferred, transform fault system. The resulting El-Kabir Lineament demarcates the northern {{margin of the}} African Plate (Arabian <b>sub-plate).</b> The El-Kabir Fault links southwestwards with the southern Cyprus active margin and northeastwards with the Dead Sea Transform Fault and, thus, represents an important, previously unrecognised, segment of the Africa-Eurasia plate boundary...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{external}} thrustbelt of Albania {{consists of}} some tectonic zones (Ionian, Kruja and Krasta-Cukali zones), that are westward overthrust, {{with a large}} amplitude (50 – 100  km), above the Apulian platform and South Adriatic Basin. The relative movement of the Adriatico-Apulian <b>sub-plate</b> between, the Euro Asiatic and African plates during from the Mesozoic to the Tertiary period, mainly controlled the tectonic evolution of the Albanides. The Ionian zone consists of anticline belts (Berati, Kurveleshi and Cika), that are overthrust toward the west with an amplitude about 20 – 30  km Their overthrustings was realized through regional sliding evaporitic horizons, which caused the masking of folded structures in the subthrust, with the perspective plays. The Kurveleshi anticlinal belt represents a mega-anticlinal with a length of 210  km and a width of about 20  km, and it is characterized by anticline structures with heterogeneous dimensions, predominantly those of great dimensions and linear type. The overthrusting of the anticline units has a local character, and it is more developed in the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt. Its magnitude is about 8 – 10  km. As {{a result of these}} overthrusts, imbrication and duplex styles are formed, leadind to the masking of the subthrust complex with structures of large interest (e. g. Delvina, Karbunara, etc.) where two oil fields have been dioscovered beneath the Mali Gjere anticline (Delvina oil field) and the Kremenara anticline (Karbunara oil field). Backthrust faults phenomena are secondary and they taken place in the post-collision stage. Generally they are easterward thrust faults of structural units with an amplitude of 5 – 10  km. The Kurveleshi anticlinal belt, based on tectonic features, is divided into two parts: The southern part, from Qafa Sevaster in the north down to Greece to the south. and northern part, from Qafa Sevaster in the south up {{to the end of the}} Patos-Verbas structure. In the southern part these features predominate: The anticline structures are large in size, and overthrust with a large amplitude (8 – 10  km) westward. The evaporitic diapirs have erupted through local faults of the anticline structures of the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt (Mali Gjere, Kurveleshi and Fterra anticlines). These eruptions (Delvina, Picar-Kapariel-Bashaj, etc.) have helped in the overthrusting of these structural units. It must be mentioned that the backthrusting is also affected by the diapir action. Moreover, vertical diapir occur, in the center of the structures like Navarica. In the northern part, the anticline structures are generally small to medium in size. Only the Patos-Verbas anticline is larger in size. In the Kurveleshi anticlinal belt the Ballsh and Visoka oilfields have developed. The eastern flank of the Shushica synclinal belt apears folded, and the carbonate anticline structures have developed. Existing oil fields include the Gorisht-Kocul, Cakran-Moallaj-Kreshpan and Amonica. These oil fields shoud continue towards the north (under the overthrust of the Patos-Verbas antcline) and in the south (under the regional ovethrust of the Kuervelesh anticlinal belt) ...|$|E
40|$|Bathymetry, seismic {{reflection}} profiles, magnetic data, and dredged basalt {{indicate that}} two centres of spreading have existed near {{the northern end}} of Juan de Fuca Ridge in the last 0. 7 m. y. (Brunhes Geomagnetic Polarity Epoch). A short-lived eastern branch functioned only {{in the early part of}} the Brunhes Epoch. More prolonged and recent activity has occurred on the western branch, and has involved extrusion of basalt, rifting, and uplift. The anomalous relief of {{the northern end of}} Juan de Fuca Ridge compared to the ridge further south is the result of a tectonic event which occurred 100, 000 - 350, 000 years ago. Prior to this, turbidites were deposited over most of the northern part of the ridge, which consisted of a series of basement ridges and valleys of subdued relief trending NNE parallel to the magnetic anomalies. During the event, the igneous basement together with the overlying turbidites was faulted, tilted, and uplifted along the primary structural trends. The basement relief was increased in places to more than 2 km. Subsequent turbidite deposition has been confined to valleys. The Sovanco Fracture Zone between Juan de Fuca and Explorer Ridges also suffered uplift. The tectonic disturbance may have resulted from an increase in spreading rate or the change in location of the axis of spreading on Juan de Fuca Ridge, or compressional interaction between Explorer <b>sub-plate</b> to the north and Sovanco Fracture Zone and the northern end of Juan de Fuca Ridge. Sovanco Fracture Zone, consisting of a WNW-trending basement ridge (Sovanco Ridge) with complex associated magnetic anomalies, may have originated as a strike-slip fault or fault-zone trending east-west about 5 m. y. ago. Location of present transform movement within the fracture zone is equivocal, but apparently trends NW. A specimen of basalt from the eastern end of Sovanco Ridge yielded a fission track age of < 309, 000 years. Basalts dredged from 13 locations on Juan de Fuca Ridge, Sovanco Ridge, and Heck and Heckle Seamount Chains on the western flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge are low-potassium tholeiites of the ocean ridge type. Twenty-seven representative specimens of fresh basalt, as well as 15 samples of glass selvages and altered basalt, were analyzed for 9 major elements by an atomic absorption technique set up by the author. The analyses are closely similar, showing no well-developed differentiation trend. They straddle the boundary between the olivine-normative and quartz-normative fields, and the basalts may have been derived by segregation from the mantle at a depth of about 15 km. A specimen from NE of the eastern spreading centre yielded a fission track age of 0. 95 ± 0. 53 m. y. which is in reasonable agreement with the age of 0. 7 - 0. 9 m. y. predicted by the magnetic anomaly time scale. Increasing thicknesses of Fe-Mn coatings on dredged basalts indicate that the two NW-trending seamount chains increase in age away from the crest of Juan de Fuca Ridge. The seamounts originated and grew to virtually their present sizes while still at or near the ridge crest. Reflection profiles across the continental slope indicate that it has formed by folding, reverse faulting, and uplift of strata of Cascadia Basin. Internal deformation has caused these sediments to behave as acoustical basement in the structures beneath the slope but their sedimentary nature has been confirmed by dredging. The presence of magnetic anomalies 5 - 8 m. y. old beneath the lower and middle continental slope indicates subduction. The magnetic basement dips below the slope at an angle of more than 10 °...|$|E
