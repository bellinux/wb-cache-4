5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A <b>single</b> <b>duct,</b> the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E

25|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{are typically}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a <b>single</b> <b>duct</b> that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims {{by means of a}} long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.|$|E

25|$|The Stipa-Caproni, also {{generally}} {{called the}} Caproni Stipa, was an experimental Italian aircraft designed in 1932 by Luigi Stipa (1900–1992) and built by Caproni. It featured a hollow, barrel-shaped fuselage {{with the engine}} and propeller completely enclosed by the fuselage—in essence, the whole fuselage was a <b>single</b> <b>ducted</b> fan. Although the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) {{was not interested in}} pursuing development of the Stipa-Caproni, its design was an important step in the development of jet propulsion.|$|R

25|$|Sea urchins are dioecious, having {{separate}} {{male and}} female sexes, although distinguishing the two is not easy, except for their locations on the sea bottom. Males generally choose elevated and exposed locations, so their milt can be broadcast by sea currents. Females generally choose low-lying locations in sea bottom crevices, presumably so the tiny larvae can have better protection from predators. Indeed, very small sea urchins are found hiding beneath rocks. Regular sea urchins have five gonads, lying underneath the interambulacral regions of the test, while the irregular forms have only four, with the hindmost gonad being absent. Each gonad has a <b>single</b> <b>duct</b> rising from the upper pole to open at a gonopore lying {{in one of the}} genital plates surrounding the anus. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water where fertilization takes place.|$|E
500|$|Red foxes have {{a pair of}} anal sacs lined by sebaceous glands, both {{of which}} open through a <b>single</b> <b>duct.</b> The anal sacs act as {{fermentation}} chambers in which aerobic and anaerobic bacteria convert sebum into odorous compounds, including aliphatic acids. The oval-shaped caudal gland is [...] long and [...] wide, and reportedly smells of violets. The presence of foot glands is equivocal. The interdigital cavities are deep, with a reddish tinge and smell strongly. Sebaceous glands are present on {{the angle of the}} jaw and mandible.|$|E
60|$|The male organs {{have been}} well {{described}} by M. Martin St. Ange, whose observations have since been confirmed by R. Wagner.[18] The testes are small, often leaden-coloured, either pear or finger-shaped, or branched like club-moss,--these several forms sometimes occurring in the same individual; they coat the stomach, enter the pedicels, and even the basal segments of the rami of the cirri, and in some genera occupy certain swellings on the thorax and prosoma, and in others the filamentary appendages: the testes seen in the apex {{in one of these}} appendages in Conchoderma, is represented in Pl. IX, fig. 5. The two vesiculæ seminales are very large; they lie along the abdominal surface of the thorax, and generally (but not in some species of Scalpellum) enter the prosoma, where their broad ends are often reflexed; here the branched vessels leading from the testes enter. The membrane of the vesiculæ seminales is formed of circular fibres; and is, I presume, contractile, for I have seen the spermatozoa expelled with force from the cut end of a living specimen. The two canals leading from the vesiculæ generally unite in a <b>single</b> <b>duct</b> {{at the base of the}} penis; but in Conchoderma aurita, half-way up it. The probosciformed penis, except in certain species of Scalpellum, is very long; it is capable of the most varied movements; it is generally hairy, especially at the end; it is supported on a straight unarticulated basis, which in Ibla quadrivalvis alone (Pl. IV, fig. 9 a), is of considerable length; in this species, the upper part is seen to be as plainly articulated as one of the cirri; in Alepas, the articulations are somewhat less plain, and in the other genera, the organ can be said only to be finely ringed, but these rings no doubt are in fact obscure articulations. In the females of Ibla Cumingii and Scalpellum ornatum, there is, of course, no penis.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency and}} complications of <b>single</b> lacrimal <b>duct</b> intubation versus annular lacrimal duct intubation with 5 -fluorouracil and tobramycin/dexamethasone eye ointment injection in lacrimal duct obstruction treatment. METHODS:A total of 74 patients(92 eyes) with lacrimal duct obstruction who received surgical treatment by Department of Ophthalmology in Qinhuangdao Haigang Hospital were consecutively recruited between August 2015 and September 2016. They were randomly allocated to Group A or Group B. After probing of lacrimal passage, Group A(46 eyes) were treated by using <b>single</b> lacrimal <b>duct</b> intubation. Group B(46 eyes) were treated by using annular lacrimal duct intubation combined with 5 -fluorouracil and tobramycin/dexamethasone eye ointment injection. Between the two groups, Mann-Whitney Rank sum {{test was used to}} comparing the operative effect, and Chi-square test was used to comparing the occurrence of complications. RESULTS:The cure rate was 61 % in Group A and 89 % in Group B; the improvement rate was 22 % in Group A and 4 % in Group B. Group B had better effect and less complications(2 cases) than Group A(8 cases),the {{differences between the two groups}} were significantly(P CONCLUSION: Compared with <b>single</b> lacrimal <b>duct</b> intubation, annular lacrimal duct intubation combined with 5 -fluorouracil and tobramycin/dexamethasone eye ointment injection has better operative effect and less complication in lacrimal duct obstruction treatment...|$|R

5000|$|The other feature {{was a new}} cooling {{arrangement}} (aft positioned, <b>single</b> <b>ducted</b> {{water and}} oil radiators assembly) that reduced the cooling drag. It was later [...] discovered that, after lot of development, the cooling assembly {{could take advantage of}} the [...] "Meredith Effect", in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust. Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature, it used the GALCIT 10 ft wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang's cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA's engineer Edgar Schmued or by Curtiss, although NAA had purchased the complete set of P-40 and XP-46 wind tunnel data and flight test reports for US$56,000. The NA-73X {{was also one of the}} first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections; this resulted in smooth, low drag surfaces.

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} for VAV systems is providing adequate temperature control for multiple zones with different environmental conditions, such as an office on the glass perimeter of a building vs. an interior office down the hall.
