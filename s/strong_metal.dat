5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It is a <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> with low density {{that is quite}} ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|MacGill was {{admitted}} to the University of Toronto's Bachelor of Applied Sciences program in 1923. During the summers she worked in machine shops repairing electrical motors to supplement the theory and practical teachings during the school year. It is also here that Elsie became exposed to the nascent field of aeronautical engineering. Contracting polio just before her graduation, MacGill was told that she would probably spend {{the rest of her life}} in a wheelchair. She refused to accept that possibility, however, and learned to walk supported by two <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> canes. When she convocated she was Canada's first woman graduate in electrical engineering.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{style has}} been disputed by fans {{because of the}} complex {{combination}} of different musical styles and the more mature, serious, and heavy sound in later albums. The band's EP Half Hour of Power is described as punk rock, skate punk and pop punk. All Killer No Filler was described as pop punk and skate punk (except for [...] "Pain for Pleasure", which is purely heavy metal). Does This Look Infected? {{has been described as}} punk rock, pop punk and melodic hardcore. Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> influences and an alternative rock sound, but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots, which created an even more mature side than the group's previous effort. Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band's pop punk style. Screaming Bloody Murder and 13 Voices saw the band return some alternative metal influences. Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; [...] "The Jester" [...] is an [...] "anti-Bush screed", [...] "Underclass Hero" [...] is a song about class struggle, and [...] "Dear Father" [...] is about Deryck's absent father.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tailhook}} is a <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> bar, {{with its}} free end flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook {{is mounted on}} a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E

60|$|But {{now these}} grew rare and more rare in their recurrence; the <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> {{resisted}} triumphantly the utmost {{efforts of the}} exhausted rabble who assailed it. As the minutes moved on, the blows grew rapidly fainter and fewer; soon they diminished to three, struck at long intervals; soon to one, followed by deep execrations of despair; and, after that, a great silence sank down over the palace and the street, where such strife and confusion had startled the night-echoes but a few moments before.|$|E
60|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} five parts; the rocket, the stand, the line, the whip, and the hawser. The rocket is a <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> cylinder, of about eighteen inches in length, {{and more than}} two in diameter. When about to be used a long stick is attached to it, and the principle on which it acts is precisely {{similar to that of}} the small rockets used in our pyrotechnic displays. The stand is a tripod supporting a rest for the rocket. The line, which is made of the best material, is coiled in a large box in a zig-zag manner on a number of pegs; these pegs, when withdrawn in a mass by removing the bottom of the box to which they are attached, leave the line loose and free to fly out with the utmost rapidity. The end of the line is fastened to the head of the rocket.|$|E

60|$|The miry clay which Nebuchadnezzar saw {{mixed with}} the iron of Rome, had {{by the end of}} the fourth century nearly {{overcome}} the <b>strong</b> <b>metal,</b> and the time had come when the great horn of the devouring beast was to be broken off, and give place to ten others. The Romans for the last two hundred years had been growing more and more selfish and easy in their habits; and instead of fighting their own battles, had called in strangers to fight for them, till these strangers became too strong for them. The nations to whom these hired soldiers belonged, were the forefathers of most of the present people of Europe. They were called Teutons altogether, and lived in the northern parts of Europe. They were tall, fair, large people, very brave and spirited, with much honour and truth, though apt to be savage and violent; and they showed more respect to their women than any of the heathens did. They had many gods, of whom Odin, who left his name to the fourth day of the week, was the chief and father. Freya, the Earth, was his wife, and Thor was Thunder. There was a story of Baldur, a good and perfect one, who died by the craft of Lok the Destroyer, and yet still lived. This seemed like a copy of the truth; and so did the story of Lok himself, the power of evil, with a serpent on his brow, who lay chained, and yet could walk forth over the earth, and whose pale daughter, Hela, was the gaoler of the unworthy dead. They thought the brave who died in battle had the happiest lot their rude fancies could devise; they lived in the Hall of Odin, hunting all day, feasting all night, and drinking mead from the skulls of their conquered enemies.|$|E
60|$|Throughout the ravaging {{course of}} the Christians over the temple, they had been {{followed}} with dogged perseverance, {{and at the same}} time with the most perfect impunity, by the only Pagan of all his brethren who had not sought safety by flight. This man, being acquainted with every private passage and staircase in the sacred building, was enabled to be secretly present at each fresh act of demolition, in whatever part of the edifice it might be perpetrated. From hall to hall, and from room to room, he tracked with noiseless step and glaring eye the movements of the Christian mob--now hiding himself behind a pillar, now passing into concealed cavities in the walls, now looking down from imperceptible fissures in the roof; but, whatever his situation, invariably watching from it, with the same industry of attention and the same silence of emotion, the minutest acts of spoliation committed by the most humble follower of the Christian ranks. It was only when he entered with the victorious ravagers into the vast apartment occupied by the idol Serapis that the man's countenance began to give evidence of the agony under which his heart was writhing within him. He mounted a private staircase cut in the hollow of the massive wall of the room, and gaining a passage that ran round the extremities of the ceiling, looked through a sort of lattice concealed in the ornaments of the cornice. As he gazed down and saw the soldier mounting, axe in hand, to the idol's head, great drops of perspiration trickled from his forehead. His hot, thick breath hissed through his closed teeth, and his hands strained at the <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> supports of the lattice until they bent beneath his grasp. When the stroke descended on the image, he closed his eyes. When the fragment detached by the blow fell on the floor, a groan burst from his quivering lips. For one moment more he glared down with a gaze of horror upon the multitude at his feet, and then with frantic speed he descended the steep stairs by which he had mounted to the roof, and fled from the temple.|$|E

50|$|Brother George O'Donnell of Shaker Village in New Lebanon, New York {{came up with}} a <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> {{attachment}} {{device in}} 1852. It replaced the wooden ball bearing that was inserted into the wooden legs and secured with a leather strap. The metal ball-bearing mechanism was patented by him. It consisted of brass ferrules and balls. It was a practical <b>strong</b> <b>metal</b> attachment to the back two legs of wooden chairs to allow the sitter to tilt back without gouging the floor. A version of O'Donnell's tilt device is still being used on chairs in the twenty-first century.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} {{men who have}} been {{credited}} with the creation of squeeze casting. Together, the team of scientists devised a new way to combine extremely high temperatures and 15,000 psi(pounds per square inch) of air pressure to reshape molten metal. Along the way, there were many drawbacks to this creation. Some problems they encountered included combining the exact temperature with the correct pressure in order to form the <b>strongest</b> <b>metal.</b> However, even with so many challenges, it was officially patented on the 18th of October, 1994.|$|R
