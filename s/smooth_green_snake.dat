25|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> mostly eats {{insects and}} spiders, {{including}} spineless caterpillars, harvestmen, moths, ants, snails, worms, and slugs. While hunting, it uses both chemical and visual clues to find prey, and kills with a strike instead of constriction.|$|E
25|$|During {{months when}} the weather is warmer, the <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> tends to be active both day and night; while in the colder winter months, it hibernates in groups. Ant hills and rodent burrows are used during {{hibernation}} as part-time homes.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the festival}} is near, White <b>Snake</b> pushes <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> to leave the village knowing that a special wine {{consumed}} only on this day will make <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> reveal her true form (due to her inexperience). <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> sulks, rebelling to leave because of her envy towards White Snake and Hsui Xien. The night of the festival, White Snake drags an obviously-scared Hsui Xien to drink the special wine together. Hsui Xien instead secretly dumps the wine into their pond where <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> consumes it; White Snake {{was not able to}} prevent Hsui Xien from seeing <b>Green</b> <b>Snake's</b> true form and he dies from shock. They are interrupted by the Taoist and his two apprentices again, which White Snake disposed of hasily. She decides to go to Kwun Lun Mountain to obtain the Lin-Chi Herb, but because it is guarded by a Holy Crane, <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> decides to help out of guilt. Fat-hoi notices their presences and immediately follows them. After obtaining the Lin-Chi Herb, White <b>Snake</b> leaves <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> to fight against Fat-hoi but was quickly defeated. To let her go, the monk decided to challenge his own mentality by letting <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> distract him in any way while he meditates. When he loses the challenge, <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> quickly makes her way back to White <b>Snake.</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> tells White Snake of Fat-hoi's challenge, White Snake shrugs her off, leaving <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> to assume that her older sister thinks she is inferior. To get a response out of White Snake, she seduces Hsui Xien and the two gets into a fight in which White Snake triumphed. She reveals to <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> that she is pregnant and cannot be with her anymore.|$|R
25|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> is only {{native to}} the Nearctic region. The range spreads through southeastern Canada, west to Saskatchewan, and south through Illinois and Virginia. It {{can also be found}} in other areas, such as Wyoming, New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri, Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi and {{northern}} Mexico.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some {{research}} showing {{the population of the}} snake is declining, {{only a small number of}} states (Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Montana, and Texas protect the <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake.</b> Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado also protect the snake under state law. This law prohibits commercial collection of the snake and collection by individuals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> {{relies on}} an {{environment}} matching its green scales for camouflage {{to protect itself}} from predators. If threatened, a <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> will usually flee. It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell. When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger. When it hunts, it turns its {{head from side to}} side, finding prey with its tongue and an organ on the roof of its mouth that interprets chemical signals. It has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong over short distances. Due to stretchy ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even those that are larger than its own body diameter. It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for growth.|$|E

25|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> {{population}} is also declining {{due to the}} use of pesticides, as well as destruction of habitats. Pesticides are particularly harmful to the snake when used in riparian areas, mountain foothills and meadows. Because the smooth green snake's diet consists mainly of insects, insecticides put the snake at great risk in areas where they are applied. The reduction of its prey is a major cause of the death of the snakes, as well {{as one of the most}} important natural threats to its population.|$|E
25|$|O. vernalis can {{be found}} in many {{different}} habitats, including marshes, meadows, the edges of streams, and open woods. It prefers to be on the ground, in open areas without a lot of shrubs. During hibernation, the <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers. It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage. Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding.|$|E
25|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{is caused by}} road building, logging, cattle grazing, and the draining of streams. Logging and mining conducted in a <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> habitat can {{be a source of}} snake mortality. Roads and highways are a major cause of deaths, especially those near streams or other habitats the snake occupies. Livestock grazing has been found to reduce snake populations in some areas, where five times the amount of snakes were found on ungrazed areas, compared to grazed areas. The effects of livestock grazing include the reduction of grass, changes in tree species, compaction of soil, and more erosion, which affect the reptile population in these areas. Flooding, freezing, and destruction of dens can destroy large numbers of smooth green snakes, as well as other species of snake with which it may hibernate.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the area}} was urbanized, mammals such as bighorn sheep, mule deer, coyote, wolves, beaver, muskrat and jack rabbits would have been seen along the river. A [...] "varmint hunt" [...] was {{organized}} by John D. Lee around 1848, after the arrival of Mormon settlers. The final count of the hunt included [...] "two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens." [...] None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; they have, for the most part, been replaced by raccoons, red foxes and domestic pets. [...] Animals from the Jordan River area found on the Utah Sensitive Species List include the <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake,</b> the western toad, kit fox, spotted bat, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> (Opheodrys vernalis) is {{species of}} North American nonvenomous snake {{in the family}} Colubridae. The species is also {{referred}} to as the grass snake. It is a slender, [...] "small medium" [...] snake that measures [...] as an adult. It gets its common name from its smooth dorsal scales, as opposed to the rough green snake, which has keeled dorsal scales. The <b>smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> is found in marshes, meadows, open woods, and along stream edges and is native to regions of Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. A non-aggressive snake, it seldom bites and usually flees when threatened. It mates in late spring to summer, and females lay their eggs from June to September.|$|E

2500|$|Sexually mature smooth green snakes mate in {{the late}} spring or summer, and gravid females lay eggs from June to September. Usually, two {{clutches}} are laid, each containing four to six eggs. Females usually lay their eggs in rodent burrows, mounds of rotting vegetation, sawdust piles, or rotting logs. In the northern habitats of this species, communal nesting has been observed. [...] <b>Smooth</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> eggs are white and oval; they have thin shells and are about one inch in length. They have an average mass of 2.6grams. The eggs hatch four to 23 days after being laid.|$|E
