5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{discharge}} of West Creek is usually {{less than two}} cubic meters per second. However, it <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> between two and five cubic meters per second and has occasionally been as high as nearly ten cubic meters per second. The conductance of the creek ranges from slightly over 40 to more than 60 micro-siemens per centimeter.|$|E
5|$|With atelic verbs, {{there is}} a regular {{contrast}} between indirective evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu. Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and sima <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> marked.|$|E

Tsikhistavis subordinated to the Eristavt-eristavi, Eristavi and Mouravi of a city. [...] In the 17th and 18th centuries, Tsikhistavis <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> named as a Minibashi (მინიბაში).|$|R
5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E
5|$|P. l. maculatus, {{known as}} the Marozi or spotted lion, <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly coloured individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion hybrid commonly known as a leopon.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E

25|$|The term true conchs, being {{a common}} name, {{does not have}} an exact meaning. It may refer {{generally}} to any of the Strombidae but <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> used more specifically to include only Strombus and Lambis or just Strombus itself.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a highly}} gregarious duck outside the {{breeding}} season and can form large flocks. It is commonly found in sheltered wetlands and feeds on seeds and aquatic invertebrates.

25|$|The Rhagophthalmidae are a glow-worm-like {{lineage of}} Elateroidea.

25|$|If we {{suppose the}} {{polarization}} of the dipoles was induced by an external field, the polarization field opposes the applied field and <b>sometimes</b> <b>is</b> called a depolarization field.
