5000|$|CTLA4 is {{a member}} of the {{immunoglobulin}} superfamily that is expressed by activated T cells and transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells. CTLA4 is homologous to the T-cell co-stimulatory protein, CD28, and both molecules bind to CD80 and CD86, also called B7-1 and B7-2 respectively, on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 binds CD80 and CD86 with greater affinity and avidity than CD28 thus enabling it to outcompete CD28 for its ligands. CTLA4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells, whereas CD28 transmits a <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal.</b> [...] CTLA4 is also found in regulatory T cells and contributes to its inhibitory function. T cell activation through the T cell receptor and CD28 leads to increased expression of CTLA-4.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, the precursor of the enzymes of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), requires a programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshift. This frameshift has been investigated so far only for subtype B of HIV- 1 group M. In this subtype, the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> {{was found to be}} a two-stem helix, in which a three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. In this study, using a luciferase reporter system, we compare, for the first time, the frameshift efficiency of all the subtypes of group M. Mutants of subtype B, including a natural variant were also investigated. Our results with mutants of subtype B confirm that the bulge and the lower stem of the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> contribute to the frameshift in addition to the upper stem–loop considered previously as the sole participant. Our results also show that the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> of all of the other subtypes of group M can be folded into the same structure as in subtype B, despite sequence variations. Moreover, the frameshift efficiency of these subtypes, when assessed in cultured cells, falls within a narrow window (the maximal deviation from the mean value calculated from the experimental values of all the subtypes being ~ 35 %), although the predicted thermodynamic stability of the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> differs between the subtypes (from − 17. 2 kcal/mole to − 26. 2 kcal/mole). The fact that the frameshift efficiencies fall within a narrow range for all of the subtypes of HIV- 1 group M stresses the potential of the frameshift event as an antiviral target...|$|E

This frameshift occurs at a specific slippery sequence followed by a <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal,</b> which was recently {{shown to be a}} two-stem helix, for which a three-purine bulge separates the upper and lower stems. In the present study, we investigated the response of the bacterial ribosome to this signal, using a translation system specialized for the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter. The HIV- 1 frameshift region was inserted {{at the beginning of the}} coding sequence of the luciferase gene, such that its expression requires a − 1 frameshift. Mutations that disrupt the upper or the lower stem of the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> or replace the purine bulge with pyrimidines decreased the frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory mutations that re-form both stems restored the frame-shift efficiency to near wild-type level. These mutations had the same effect in a eukaryotic translation system, which shows that the bacterial ribosome responds like the eukaryote ribosome to the HIV- 1 frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal.</b> Also, we observed, in contrast to a previous report, that a stop codon immediately 3 ′ to the slippery sequence does not decrease the frameshift efficiency, ruling out a proposal that the frameshift involves the deacylated-tRNA and the peptidyl-tRNA in the E and P sites of the ribosome, rather than the peptidyl-tRNA and the aminoacyl-tRNA in the P and A sites, as commonly assumed. Finally, mutations in 16 S ribosomal RNA that facilitate the accommodation of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site decreased the frameshift efficiency, which supports a previous suggestion that the frameshift occurs when the aminoacyl-tRNA occupies the A/T entry site...|$|E

Analysis of Gag processing in infectious mutant virions revealed processing defects to various extents, with no clear correlation with frameshift decrease. Nevertheless, the observed frameshift reductions translated into equivalently reduced viral infectivity and replication kinetics.

GPA- 2, GPA- 3, GPA- 5, and GPA- 6 are also present in cell bodies and axons and GPA- 5 specifically localizes to synaptic sites.

40|$|Synthesis of the Gag-Pol protein of {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) requires a programmed – 1 ribosomal frameshifting when ribosomes translate the unspliced viral messenger RNA. This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence followed by an RNA structure motif that stimulates frameshifting. This motif is commonly {{assumed to be a}} simple stem–loop for HIV- 1. In this study, we show that the frameshift <b>stimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> is more complex than believed and consists of a two-stem helix. The upper stem–loop corresponds to the classic stem–loop, and the lower stem is formed by pairing the spacer region following the slippery sequence and preceding this classic stem–loop with a segment downstream of this stem–loop. A three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. This structure was suggested by enzymatic probing with nuclease V 1 of an RNA fragment corresponding to the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV- 1. The involvement of the novel lower stem in frameshifting was supported by site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment encompassing the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV- 1 was inserted {{in the beginning of the}} coding sequence of a reporter gene coding for the firefly luciferase, such that expression of luciferase requires a – 1 frameshift.
