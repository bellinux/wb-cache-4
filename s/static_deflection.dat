40|$|A {{new method}} for {{predicting}} subsonic flutter and <b>static</b> <b>deflections,</b> including divergence, has been developed. The present method accounts for aspect ratio and, {{in the case}} of flutter, <b>static</b> <b>deflections.</b> The angle of attack is limited only by the occurrence of stall or vortex bursting near the wing. The innovation in the present method is to integrate simultaneously and interactively the equations of motion of the structure and the flowfield. The present approach employs an iterative scheme based on the predictor-corrector method. The general unsteady vortex-lattice method (UVLM) is used to predict the aerodynamic loads. Because the UVLM predicts the wakes as part of the solution, the history of the motion is taken into account; hysteresis is predicted. The deflection (for both bending and torsion) is expressed as an expansion in terms of the free-vibration modes. The time-dependent coefficients in these expansions serve as the generalized coordinates. Numerical examples illustrating the calculation of <b>static</b> <b>deflections</b> and transient dynamic responses above and below the flutter boundary are included...|$|R

2500|$|When rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 the {{amplitude}} of the vibration is actually {{less than the}} <b>static</b> <b>deflection</b> [...] In this region the force generated by the mass (Fnbsp&=nbsp&ma) is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, X, is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (Fnbsp&=nbsp&kx) to the base is reduced. Therefore, the massndash&springndash&damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the mounting base – referred to as vibration isolation. Interestingly, more damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 because the damping force (Fnbsp&=nbsp&cv) is also transmitted to the base.|$|E

While properly selected vibration frequencies drastically improve filtration, a deflection factor occurs as the vibrations displaces smaller particles. They do not properly {{pass through the}} screen due to excess movement. This is a property of the system's natural frequency. The natural frequency preferably vibrates at Fn is 188(1/d)2 (cycles per min) where d = (188/Fn)2 (inches). <b>Static</b> <b>deflection</b> corresponds to this frequency. Vibration isolation is a control principle employed to mitigate transmission.
