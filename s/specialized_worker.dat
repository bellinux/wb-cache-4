Marx also states that a <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> doing only one task can use a more specialized tool, which cannot do many jobs but can do the one job well, in a more efficient manner than a traditional craftsman using a multi-purpose tool on any specific task.|$|E

Suppose the firm employees two (initially) identical workers, each of whom is capable of performing both jobs. Thus in a two-period model, each worker could produce the same amount in the first period. By assuming the workers are identical in their intrinsic skills, we focus on the effect of the organization of work related skills. According to a well-known principle spelled out by Adam Smith, a <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> improves his or her skill over time by repetitively performing the same task. The gain from specializations thus arises in the second period if workers remain in the same job for both periods. In that case, we assume that the with the second period that his or her counterpart had produced in the first period. To capture this we let Y1 denote the total output in the first period, and Y2, and Y2, denote the output in the second period under rotation and specialization respectively. When workers rotate jobs in the second period, Y2,= Y1; when the specialize and remain in the same job, Y2>Y1. Specialization thus yields greater output over the two periods by the amount Y2-Y2. This differential represents the cost of job rotation in terms of forgone output."A problem faced by companies is the possibility of having to pay incentives to workers for cooperation with the job rotation implementation which can lead towards inequality.11The utilization of job rotation may have the effect of reducing a workforce due to the cross-training involved; a company may not be required to hire additional staff to cover positions and may cause a layoff of current employees no longer considered necessary.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: There are few {{empirical}} studies relating components {{of long-term care}} to {{quality of life for}} residents with dementia. This study relates elements of dementia care in residential care/assisted living (RC/ AL) facilities and nursing homes to resident quality of life and considers the guidance this information provides for practice and policy. Design and Methods: We used a variety of report and observa-tional measures of the structure and process of care and 11 standardized measures of quality of life to evaluate the care for and quality of life of 421 residents with dementia in 35 RC/AL facilities and 10 nursing homes in four states. Data were collected cross sectionally on-site, and we conducted a 6 -month follow-up by telephone. Results: Change in quality of life was better in facilities that used a <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> approach, trained more staff in more domains central to dementia care, and encouraged activity participation. Residents perceived their quality of life as better when staff was more involved in care planning and when staff attitudes were more favor-able. Better resident–staff communication was related to higher quality of life as observed and reported by care providers. Also, more stable resident–staff assignment was related to care providers ’ lower quality-of-life ratings. Implications: Improvement in resident quality of life may be achieved by improved training and deployment of staff...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{societies}} {{owe their}} success to an efficient {{division of labour}} that, in some social insects, is based on <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> phenotypes. The system of caste determination in such species is therefore critical. Here, we examine in a leaf-cutting ant (Acromyrmex echinatior) how a recently discovered genetic influence on caste determination interacts with the social environment. By removing most of one phenotype (large workers; LW) from test colonies, we increased the stimulus for larvae to develop into this caste, while for control colonies we removed {{a representative sample of}} all workers so that the stimulus was unchanged. We established the relative tendencies of genotypes to develop into LW by genotyping workers before and after the manipulation. In the control colonies, genotypes were similarly represented in the large worker caste before and after worker removal. In the test colonies, however, this relationship was significantly weaker, demonstrating that the change in environmental stimuli had altered the caste propensity of at least some genotypes. The results indicate that the genetic influence on worker caste determination acts via genotypes differing in their response thresholds to environmental cues and can be conceptualized as a set of overlapping reaction norms. A plastic genetic influence on division of labour has thus evolved convergently in two distantly related polyandrous taxa, the leaf-cutting ants and the honeybees, suggesting that it may be a common, potentially adaptive, property of complex, genetically diverse societies...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of ant workers and, notably their aggregation/segregartion behaviour, is a key-element {{of the colony}} social organization contributing to the efficiency of task performance and division of labour. In polymorphic species, <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> castes notably differ in their intrinsic aggregation behaviour. In this context, knowing the preponderant role of minors in brood care, we investigate how a stimulus such as brood can influence the spatial patterns of Pheidole pallidula worker castes. In a homogeneous area without brood, it was shown that minors display only {{a low level of}} aggregation while majors form large clusters in the central area. Here we find out that these aggregation patterns of both minors and majors can be deeply influenced by the presence of brood. For minors, it nucleates or enhances the formation of a large stable cluster. Such high sensitivity of minors to brood stimuli fits well with their role as main brood tenders in the colony. For majors, interattraction between individuals still remains the prevailing aggregation factor while brood strongly influences the localisation of their cluster. We discuss how the balance between interattraction and sensitivity to environmental stimuli determines the mobility of each worker castes and, consequently, the availability of minors and majors to participate in everyday colony tasks. Moreover, we will evoke the functional value of majors' cluster location close to the brood, namely with respect to social regulation of the colony caste ratio. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The article uses two adverts for Microsoft Office {{products}} {{as a springboard}} from which to discuss claims about the democratic potential of IT (information technology). Adverts for technological products frequently use glamorous icons as metaphors for the exploratory mode of hypermedia technologies (including the World Wide Web). These metaphors find subtle expression in the textual conflation of virtual and physical 'realms' exemplified by the Microsoft slogan 'Where {{do you want to}} go today?'. It is a small step from suggesting that you can go anywhere you want to go, to the assertion that you can be anyone you want to be. This assertion underlies the textual construction of democracy that is singled out in the first advert: a democracy that is forged from individual versatility rather than cultural diversity. Roles and functions become blurred as <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> is transformed into jack-of-all trades through the use of technology. This vision of democracy is contrasted with two related pictures of contemporary technologies: the Internet as a world-wide cooperative community and hypermedia texts as the poststructural antithesis of the modern univocal text. Claims of this nature, and their critiques, are positioned within discourse about the impact of technology, both personally and culturally. Personally, job satisfaction and versatility are indicators of success in the texts examined. Culturally, constructions of 'cooperative community' and 'self-sufficiency' are examined with reference to the myth about the computer as an isolationist tool, revealing a theoretical ambivalence towards the impact of technology that underscores recent intense media and academic attention.

International medical graduates were more likely to practice in primary care shortage areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas (67. 8 %) than U. S. medical graduates (39. 8 %). Over the past 30 years, the number of international medical graduates in the physician workforce has steadily increased. Many entered the United States on visas that allowed them to stay in the United States if they agreed to work in an underserved area for 3 years following residency. During the last decade, however, the number of international medical graduates on these visas declined by 47 % as use of less-restrictive temporary <b>specialized</b> <b>worker</b> visas increased. The declining number of international medical graduates serving in underserved areas has made recruiting physicians in these areas more difficult.
