500|$|On October 18, 2003, [...] "Everytime" [...] was {{performed}} by Britney {{for the very first}} time during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show Saturday Night Live. She also performed it at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. [...] "Everytime" [...] was also performed by Spears at 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour.

It was the first song of the third act, titled [...] "Mystic Garden". It began with a video interlude in which Spears walked into a garden wearing a rainbow-colored dress and sat in a flower-covered piano. As the video ended, it was revealed that she was sitting onstage in a similar setting. She started the performance talking to the audience about the media coverage of her personal life. She played the piano and sang until the second verse, where <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and walked to the center of the stage to continue the performance.

500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century advocates of women's rights began to {{accumulate}} rebuttals to arguments used against them founded on traditional interpretations of Bible scriptures. Lucretia Mott countered {{those who would}} put her in her place by quoting other Bible passages, or by challenging the original interpretation of the scripture. In 1849, Mott wrote Discourse on Woman which discussed Adam and Eve, the activities of various women who appear in the Bible, and argued that the Bible supported woman's right to speak aloud her spiritual beliefs. Independently from Mott, Lucy Stone determined for herself that the male-dominant interpretations of the Bible must be faulty—she worked to learn Greek and Hebrew and thereby gain insight into the earlier Bible translations which she believed would contain wording more favorable to women's equality. In New York, aided by Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton helped draft the Declaration of Sentiments in 1848 and included two Resolutions which protested against man's usurpation of rights relating to her position in church and to her role under God. By the 1850s, Mott had become expert at disarming men who used Scripture against her. At the National Women's Rights Convention in 1852, and again in 1854, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to debate men who came prepared with Scripture in hand. Reverend Henry Grew told the 1854 convention audience that the Bible proved men were naturally superior to women. He was countered point-by-point by Hannah Tracy Cutler, then in broad societal and political terms by Mott who began by saying: [...] "It is not Christianity, but priestcraft that has subjected woman as we find her. The Church and State have been united, and it is well {{for us to see}} it so." ...|$|E

[...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lisa's departing storyline {{revolved}} around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking {{her daughter to}} live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: [...] "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark— passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, [...] "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him walk all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. <b>She</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.” ...|$|E
