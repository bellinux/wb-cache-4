He also served as Vice President for Research but stepped down on July 1, 2011. Marburger died Thursday, July 28, 2011, at his home in Port Jefferson, New York, after four years of treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a grandson. His final publication, a book on quantum physics for laypeople called Constructing Reality: Quantum Theory and Particle Physics, was published shortly after his death.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E

Its reasoning method {{is the same as}} that of any particular science and of all particular sciences. And by that same method of reasoning, the inductive method, philosophy fuses all particular sciences into one great science. As Spencer says, the data of any particular science are partially unified knowledge. Philosophy unifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences.

60|$|It is in {{this sense}} that logic is, what it was so expressively called by the schoolmen and by Bacon, ars artium; the <b>science</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> itself. All science {{consists}} of data and conclusions from those data, of proofs and what they prove: now logic points out what relations must subsist between data and whatever can be concluded from them, between proof and every thing which it can prove. If there be any such indispensable relations, and if these can be precisely determined, every particular branch of science, as well as every individual in the guidance of his conduct, is bound to conform to those relations, under the penalty of making false inferences—of drawing conclusions which are not grounded in the realities of things. Whatever has at any time been concluded justly, whatever knowledge has been acquired otherwise than by immediate intuition, depended on the observance of the laws which it is the province of logic to investigate. If the conclusions are just, and the knowledge real, those laws, whether known or not, have been observed.|$|E
