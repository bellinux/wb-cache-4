Dynamic telepathology allows the referring pathologist to capture by himself images supporting their diagnosis. Using static telepathology the pathologist could be limited in diagnosis by problems in fields selection. We devoted a whole year to collecting all the technical parameters characterizing the use of digitized neuropathological data files in order to investigate the feasibility of telepathology {{and the extent to which}} its use could improve diagnoses. Our results on a series of 38 histological brain examinations illustrate how we successfully established an international connection between two departments of pathology in Belgium and the USA. The referring pathologists gave diagnoses in 35 cases and deferred only 3. Despite a time-consuming procedure for the telepathology session of a few cases, this tool provides easy access to expert diagnosis and real-time discussion, both of which are of considerable interest and offer significant improvements in neuropathology.

40|$|Background People {{with disabilities}} have {{reported}} worse health status than people without disabilities and receiving fewer preventive health {{services such as}} counseling around exercise habits. This is noteworthy considering the negative consequences associated with physical inactivity. No {{research has been conducted}} on physical activity in cervical dystonia (CD), despite its possible major impact on self-perceived health and disability. Considering the favorable consequences associated with physical activity {{it is important to know}} how to promote physical activity behavior in CD. Knowledge of variables important for such behavior in CD is therefore crucial. The aim of this study was to explore factors related to physical activity in individuals with cervical dystonia. Methods Subjects included in this cross-sectional study were individuals diagnosed with CD and enrolled at neurology clinics (n[*]=[*] 369). Data was collected using one <b>surface</b> <b>mailed</b> self-reported questionnaire. Physical activity was the primary outcome variable, measured with the Physical Activity Disability Survey. Secondary outcome variables were: impact of dystonia measured with the Cervical Dystonia Impact Scale; fatigue measured with the Fatigue Severity Scale; confidence when carrying out physical activity measured with the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale; confidence in performing daily activities without falling measured with the Falls Efficacy Scale; enjoyment of activity measured with Enjoyment of Physical Activity Scale, and social influences on physical activity measured with Social Influences on Physical Activity in addition to demographic characteristics such as age, education level and employment status. Results The questionnaire was completed by 173 individuals (47  % response rate). The multivariate association between related variables and physical activity showed that employment, self-efficacy for physical activity, education level and consequences for daily activities explained 51  % of the variance in physical activity (Adj R 0. 51, F (5, 162) [*]=[*] 35. 611, p[*]=[*] 0. 000). Employment and self-efficacy for physical activity contributed most strongly to the association with physical activity. Conclusions Considering the favorable consequences associated with physical activity it could be important to support the individuals with CD to remain in work and self-efficacy to physical activity as employment and self-efficacy had significant influence on physical activity level. Future research is needed to evaluate causal effects of physical activity on consequences related to CD...|$|R

The polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles can firmly adhere on HNTs <b>surfaces</b> in a <b>mail</b> environment of pH 8. 5 via the oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine and synthesize a rough nano-layer assisted with vitamin M, which provides a catechol functional platform for the secondary reaction to graft hydrophobic long-chain alkylamine for preparation of hierarchical micro/nano structures with superhydrophobic properties. The micromorphology, crystal structure, and surface chemical composition of the resultant superhydrophobic HNTs were characterized by field emission scanning electron (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-formed surfaces exhibited outstanding superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle (CA) of 156. 3 ± 2. 3 °, while having {{little effect on the}} crystal structures of HNTs. Meanwhile, the resultant HNTs also showed robust stability that can conquer various harsh conditions including strong acidic/alkaline solutions, organic solvents, water boiling, ultrasonic cleaning, and outdoor solar radiation. In addition, the novel HNTs exhibited excellent packaged capabilities of phase change materials (PCMs) for practical application in thermal energy storage, which improved the mass fractions by 22. 94 % for stearic acid and showed good recyclability. These HNTs also exhibited good oil/water separation ability. Consequently, due to the superior merits of high efficiency, easy operation, and non-toxicity, this bionic surface modification approach may make HNTs have great potentials for extensive applications...|$|R
40|$|Voice mail is a {{computer-aided}} {{telephone system}} which {{is capable of}} storing and forwarding spoken messages. The voice mail market has been and is still focused on larger companies since they comprise a sizable amount of the installed base of voice processing systems (Radisich, 1994). Consequently, all voice mail research has been centered on the large company and concentrates on advantages or disadvantages found in these substantial companies. This study focused on the implementation and diffusion of a relatively new communication technology and its consequences in an unresearched arena [...] the small company. Also a comparatively new methodology {{in the field of}} communications research, grounded theory, was used to explore the impact of a new technology, thus possibly advancing the credibility of this research methodology. The results of this pilot study on voice mail in a small company found diffusion to be extremely successful, {{even to the point of}} surprising some of the subjects with their total acceptance of the technology. The study results indicated that the small company can benefit from voice mail usage in similar ways to the large company, especially if the company has travelers or off-site locations. The results implied that there are some ways that voice mail can assist in the small company where it has not previously had a reported effect in the large company [...] -as a negotiating, organizing, and delegating tool. The results of the study could provide insights for other small companies concerned with successful usage of the voice mail technology in similar environments.
