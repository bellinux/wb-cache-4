[...] It has a wood frame structure with shiplap exterior siding and wood shingle roof. [...] The interior walls are rough boards with <b>saw</b> <b>dust</b> insulation. [...] The building was originally used to store blocks of ice needed to keep meat. [...] During the winter, Boyd cut blocks of ice from Swalley Pond and packed them in sawdust. [...] The building’s sawdust insulation preserved the blocks until they were needed in the summer. There are two sets of large double-doors {{on the south side}} of the building that were installed in the 1940s when the building was converted into a garage. [...] It was used for that purpose until it 1978. [...] Like the other two building, the ice house was placed on a concrete slab when it was moved to its current location in 1979.|$|E

40|$|Concern of {{environmental}} issues especially related to the river pollution and air pollution has attracting effort to produce sustainable construction material made of by product from industrial waste such as wood dust. The increasing price of the construction materials also become of the factor for researcher to find an alternative for construction materials replacement. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study the <b>saw</b> wood <b>dust</b> on the sand brick strength and engineering properties. The experiment have been conducted using <b>saw</b> wood <b>dust</b> as replacement material for sand in proportion 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. Control samples contain 0 % of wood dust is use to compare the data obtained with the samples containing wood dust. The water cement ratio was determined by using trial and error with cement to sand ratio 1 : 3. The mixes are cured using two types which is air and water curing for 7 and 30 days. Then the number of samples were tested for compressive strength, water absorption and dimension test. Based on the result of the experiments, it shows that the objectives were achieved. The strength of the <b>saw</b> wood <b>dust</b> bricks decrease with the increasing of <b>saw</b> wood <b>dust</b> percentages.

He had a bow bent double, and suddenly it straightened. Allie <b>saw</b> <b>dust</b> fly from Frank's back. He threw up his arms and slid off under the horse, the saddle slipping with him. The horse, wounded and terrorized, began to plunge, dragging man and saddle.|$|E

They had reached the road and were proceeding along it when Yussuf <b>saw</b> <b>dust</b> rising in the distance. He called {{the attention of the}} sheik to it, and the camels were pressed forward to their utmost speed. But camels will seldom go far beyond their accustomed walk; and it soon became apparent that they were being rapidly overtaken by the strangers who were pressing on behind. By this time it could be seen that the party following them were also mounted on camels. Two riders had detached themselves from the main body and were coming on at a rapid pace.|$|E

40|$|Araecerus fasciculatus (Coleoptera: Anthribidae) is {{a primary}} pest mostly found in cocoa bean storage. Controlling A. fascuculatus is highly necessary, as this action would also reduce {{infestation}} of secondary pests. Utilization of natural materials as bait or trap is one applicable method to lessen damage and loss during storage. Vitex trifolia L., Acorus colomus L., and Andropogon nardus L are plant species that posess insecticidal properties {{that can be used}} to control post harvest pests. Materials used in this experiment are leaves of V. trifolia, rhizome of A. colomus and leaves of A. nardus. The three types of materials are blended and sieved with 300 mesh until finely broken up for make powder formulation. As much as 1 g of powder extract was taken then mixed with additional substract (water + CMC + <b>saw</b> <b>dusts).</b> The mixtures were then shaped in the form of ellipse resembling cocoa beans with approximately similar weight of 0. 6 g (± 20 beans).
