When Alex confesses that her only motive {{to join the}} Academy was {{to find out the}} truth about her father and was about to leave, Ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent. Alex's on-again off-again relationship with Ryan has been described by Chopra as star-crossed. She said [...] "Alex and Ryan are star-crossed lovers. You love them and they fight and have this intense passionate bond. But Alex is also a little self-destructive. She's a <b>solitary</b> <b>person</b> and she's not vulnerable enough, whereas Ryan really is. She's a little rough around the edges and whatever's happened in the past, she has trust issues. So that leads to issues in their relationship." [...] Fans have dubbed Alex and Ryan [...] "Ralex". On being asked about the possibility of having to choose between Ryan and saving the world, Chopra said [...] "I'm pretty sure she'd pick saving the world, because she's that kind of person." ...|$|E

In social situation like this, a solitary death of aged person becomes a serious problem and to establish the system to prevent it is urgent necessity. Some safety equipments for aged people are already sold in Japan, but they have not been widely used because most of them are considerably expensive and users need to pay contract price or usage fee. By taking into consideration an increase in <b>solitary</b> aged <b>persons</b> toward an aged person society, we studied and developed the application, “Anshin”, for mobile devices to prevent solitary death and the network system, “Otassha Tushin”, to monitor and support conditions of <b>solitary</b> aged <b>persons</b> on a server.

The story begins in a legend about creatures who lived as one partner, until a curse separated their bodies; cursed to wander as <b>solitary</b> <b>persons,</b> until they find their true loves and be one again. Each character who buys a flower from Rosa will discover that love unexpectedly blooms {{in his or her}} own life. A new love story will be introduced to viewers every Monday and usually ends on a Friday, except for the story of Rosa herself, which will slowly unfold as the season progresses.|$|R

Every one seems to have their own little circle, and a <b>solitary</b> <b>person</b> remains so often just outside. Yet if you have friends--and tastes--London is a paradise. Oh, how fascinating I used to find it just at first--before the chill came. You, too, will feel that. You will be content at first to watch, to listen, to wonder! Every type of humanity passes before you like the jumbled-up figures of a kaleidoscope. You are content even to sit before a window in a back street--and listen. What a sound that is--the roar of London, the voices of the street, the ceaseless hum, the creaking of the great wheel of humanity as it goes round and round. And then, perhaps, in a certain mood the undernote falls upon your ear, the bitter, long-drawn-out cry of the hopeless and helpless. When you have once heard it, life is never the same again. Then, if you do not find friends, you will know what misery is." ...|$|E
6000|$|That was {{the saving}} of us. Unless {{it was for}} one corpulent old gentleman in a bath-chair, who {{certainly}} did start {{at the sight of}} us and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, and, finally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt if a <b>solitary</b> <b>person</b> remarked our sudden appearance among them. Plop! We must have appeared abruptly. We ceased to smoulder almost at once, though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot. The attention of every one--including even the Amusements' Association band, which on this occasion, for the only time in its history, got out of tune--was arrested by the amazing fact, and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable, over-fed lap-dog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west--in a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through the air. In these absurd days, too, when we are all trying to be as psychic, and silly, and superstitious as possible! People got up and trod on other people, chairs were overturned, the Leas policeman ran. How the matter settled itself I do not know--we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make minute inquiries. As soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up and, skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along the road below the Metropole towards Gibberne's house. But amidst the din I heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chair-attendants who have [...] "Inspector" [...] written on their caps. [...] "If you didn't throw the dog," [...] he said, [...] "who DID?" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seems to}} me {{more and more as}} I live longer, that most poetry and most {{literature}} and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety, the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to-day. It is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours, lived by people who loved and hated more naïvely, aged sooner and died younger than we do. <b>Solitary</b> <b>persons</b> and single events dominated them as they do not dominate us. We range wider, last longer, and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding. And already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events, as a thing strange and terrible indeed, but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life, part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood. For a time the death of Mary obscured her life for me, but now her living presence is more in my mind again. I begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not the accidents of her end that matter most. It signifies less that she should have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only have meant disaster to herself and to all she loved, than that all her life should have been hampered and restricted. Through all her life this brave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her possibilities, wasted in a splendid setting, magnificently wasted if you will, but wasted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} {{problems}} involved in maintaining safety for {{different kinds of}} handicapped workers. One {{of the biggest problems}} is how these persons can commute to their workplace safely. One possible solution to this problem is using a teleworking system. This system is also good for saving money and the environment because it does not require commuting. The teleworking system has many other merits including enhanced safety and can be applied to many other aspects of life. For example, it can be used for the care of <b>solitary</b> elderly <b>persons,</b> watching small children in a two-income family, and working or providing medical treatment in remote and underpopulated areas. However, these applications are not yet common, and few reports have dealt with such merits. The case studies of disabled workers using teleworking reported here demonstrate the safety, financial and environmental benefits of teleworking. Key words...|$|R

50|$|Obermann, {{which is}} {{to a great extent}} {{inspired}} by Rousseau, was edited and praised successively by Sainte-Beuve and by George Sand, and had a considerable influence both in France and England. It is a series of letters supposed to be written by a <b>solitary</b> and melancholy <b>person,</b> whose headquarters are placed in a lonely valley of the Jura. The idiosyncrasy of the book in the large class of Wertherian-Byronic literature consists {{in the fact that the}} hero, instead of feeling the vanity of things, recognizes his own inability to be and do what he wishes. Professor Brandes has pointed out that while Chateaubriand's novella René was appreciated by some of the ruling spirits of the century, Obermann was understood only by the highly gifted, sensitive temperaments, usually strangers to success.|$|R

This thesis reports {{the development of a}} prototype that would ensure step detection,posture detection, indoor localization, tumble detection and heart rate detection using themicrocontroller, AltIMU- 10 v 4 module, heart rate monitor, WiFi module and battery. Veryimportant part of the thesis is algorithm, which uses comparison function. Thanks to thewireless nature of a prototype, the system collects data regardless of an environment and sendthem directly to every device supported by Microsoft Windows platform, Linux platform orOS X platform, which are monitored by the supervisor, who takes care of the <b>solitary</b> <b>person.</b> The main contributions of the prototype are: indoor localization, identification andclassification of occurring situations and monitoring vital signs of the <b>solitary</b> <b>person.</b> To ensure indoor localization the prototype must collect data from accelerometer. Ofcourse data from AltIMU- 10 v 4 module in basic form are useless for the supervisor, so thealgorithm, using by the prototype, is programmed to processing and filtering it. Algorithm is also used to identification and classification occurring situations. Datafrom accelerometer are processed by it and compared with the created pattern. Monitoring vital signs of the <b>solitary</b> <b>person</b> are more complicated function, because itrequires not only data from accelerometer, but also from heart rate monitor.
