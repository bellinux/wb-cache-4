His most recent album, , {{was released in}} late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a neotraditionalist country influence {{with a mix of}} novelty songs and ballads.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
5000|$|Wrote The New York Times: [...] "Cokal's {{storytelling}} blends the morbid and the titillating with imaginative exuberance. ... It {{brings to}} mind the question Martin Amis asked of Lolita: how was it possible to limit her adventures to this 300-page blue streak -- to something <b>so</b> embarrassingly <b>funny,</b> <b>so</b> unstoppably inspired, so impossibly racy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they all}} say <b>so.</b> That <b>funny</b> little doctor yesterday--he made me tired--but he said so. I heard him as dad put him into the car." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jason Hughes of TV Squad {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review saying [...] "There were <b>so</b> many <b>funny</b> moments in this episode, {{as there are}} every episode." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E
500|$|Double Nickels on the Dime {{contained}} several inside {{jokes that}} were missed by the band's audience. Watt later remarked: [...] "No {{one knew what}} the fuck we were talking about. We'd explain it to people and they'd say, 'I don't get it, what's <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> about that?' And we couldn't tell them because it was our whole angle on the rock & roll, our worldview on the music scene." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Brangwen turned {{round with}} a {{slightly}} puzzled, exasperated look. 'Oh indeed!' she said. 'What is there <b>so</b> very <b>funny</b> about ME, I should like to know?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Toby, {{at a loss}} to {{understand}} what there was <b>so</b> very <b>funny</b> in his very natural question. [...] "I thought that I was goin' to ride with Ella." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Rachel departed, while Rose {{crept up}} to her aunt, asking, [...] "Aunt Ermine, why do you look <b>so</b> very <b>funny?</b> It was very tiresome. Are not you glad it is over?" ...|$|R
500|$|Fazekas {{called him}} [...] "a comedy guy, {{who plays the}} lab tech who is kind of disgruntled. He feels like, 'You agents, you just look down your nose at the lab techs,' and he’s a thorn in Sousa’s side. He’s <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> because {{everything}} he says is completely earnest, but hilarious. He just annoys everyone ... he also has his little hero moments as well." [...] Butters called Braunger [...] "a great comic addition to our cast." ...|$|E
500|$|Squidward's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to that of Jack Benny's. Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's something just <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|In this episode, Liz {{says the}} line [...] "I {{want to go}} to there", twice, which {{according}} to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey was [...] "coined" [...] by her daughter, Alice. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Jane Krakowski, who portrays Jenna Maroney, revealed [...] "Some of the great catchphrases of 30 Rock have come from Alice. Like, 'I want to go [...] there!'– that's Alice. It's <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> because I hear people say it on the street, and that was [...] daughter!" ...|$|E
5000|$|He would {{inspire you}} out of sheer {{necessity}} {{to come up with}} stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and <b>so</b> damn <b>funny.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Times.--"Such {{a perfect}} piece of social {{observation}} and joyful [...] castigation as {{the description of}} the last man in Europe ... the [...] portrait of So-and-so {{is not likely to be}} forgotten ... it is <b>so</b> [...] <b>funny</b> and <b>so</b> true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here he comes! an' now we'll {{see what}} a country jay looks like when he gits ready to leave town!" [...] was Skip's greeting; and his {{particular}} cronies thought the remark <b>so</b> very <b>funny</b> that they laughed long and loud.|$|R
500|$|Two new sets {{of parents}} are {{introduced}} during the episode. Emma's parents, Rose and Rusty Pillsbury, are played by Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most. Mays {{was very excited}} when she learned Most, who played Ralph Malph on the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, had been cast, and exclaimed, [...] "What? He's my father?!" [...] Both Most and Mahaffey were <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> during the shooting of their sequence {{that she had to}} apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, [...] "I'm so sorry, the back of my shoulders were shaking because I was laughing so hard." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer {{and acting}} coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He {{assembled}} {{a collection of}} video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he [...] "completely embodied the person". Ryan concluded that [...] "what made [...] <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors." [...] Hartman described this process as [...] "technical." [...] Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a [...] "rare talent for morphing into [...] anybody he wanted to be".|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jason Hughes of TV Squad {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review saying [...] "Its brilliance in its simplicity, brilliantly executed. Not only {{did we get}} <b>so</b> many <b>funny</b> moments throughout, but if we paid close attention, we learned several lessons about life and parenthood between the laughs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Gliatto, {{television}} {{critic for}} People Magazine, gives Family Tree 3 1/2 stars and says [...] "It {{is still a}} distinctly Guest production: often poky, always charmingly whimsical and, from time to time, <b>so</b> astoundingly <b>funny</b> {{you seem to have}} shot into a distant stratosphere of pure comedy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I can't understand, Mr Wimpole," [...] said Muriel Beaumont eagerly, [...] "is how you {{contrive}} {{to treat}} all this so easily. You say things quite philosophical and yet <b>so</b> wildly <b>funny.</b> If I thought of such things, I'm sure I should laugh outright when the thought first came." ...|$|R
500|$|Lyricist Tim Rice, who {{was working}} with {{composer}} Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin, was invited to write the songs, and accepted {{on the condition of}} finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John, after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina från Duvemåla. John expressed an interest in writing [...] "ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book, where he felt the [...] "music was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> and appealed to kids and adults".|$|E
500|$|The duel scene {{itself was}} shot {{over the course}} of six hours in the {{exterior}} parking lot setting. Natural lighting from the sun changed so drastically over that time, large bounce cards had to be placed above the hedges so the shadows would remain consistent throughout the shoot. Ed Helms actually drove the car during the scenes, and Rainn Wilson performed his own stunts. The crew considered using a stunt double for Wilson, but they found his acting <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> during filming that they decided against it. At the end of [...] "The Duel", Michael Scott talks directly to the camera with a New York City background behind him. The scenes were not filmed in the city, but rather behind a greenscreen where the scenery images were later added.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Leslie visits Tom at home, only to {{find him}} wearing a robe and {{entertaining}} Lucy. Tom insists {{he is about to}} have sex, explaining, [...] "Why else would Boyz II Men's [...] "On Bended Knee" [...] be playing right now?", referring to a song in the background. The line was improvised by Aziz Ansari and, originally, the song was not playing, but Michael Schur said the line was <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> that he successfully sought permission to use the song and added it to the background in post-production. [...] At the Freddy Spaghetti concert, Leslie asks a little girl which song was her favorite, to which she replies [...] "Penne and the Jets", a pasta-inspired version of the Elton John song [...] "Benny and the Jets". This line was thought of by Amy Poehler.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, Mr. Forsyth," [...] she cried, {{when he had}} done, [...] "I am--so--sorry! I wish I hadn't {{laughed at}} you--only you know you really were <b>so</b> {{exceedingly}} <b>funny.</b> But I wish I hadn't, and I wouldn't either if I had only known." [...] And she gave him her hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, I'll {{drink to}} that", [...] "I {{did not know}} that!" [...] & [...] "That's <b>funny,</b> <b>so</b> did she" [...] - Martin ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I, {{when the}} mere idea of you, married and settled, is <b>so</b> irresistibly <b>funny</b> that I can't keep sober!" [...] {{answered}} Jo, smiling {{all over her}} face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.|$|R
500|$|Greaney {{needed a}} setpiece for the episode that {{enabled him to}} get into a vision of the {{characters}} in the future, and The Simpsons writer George Meyer {{came up with the idea}} of the Indian casino. When Homer and Bart first enter the casino, Homer tells Bart that [...] "Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian." [...] He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying [...] "Hi-how-are-you?" [...] in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, Dan Castellaneta (who voices Homer) [...] "did [...] <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> when we were at the table-read so we decided to put it in and risk offending." ...|$|E
500|$|His other {{release that}} {{year was the}} studio album Life's <b>So</b> <b>Funny.</b> It was led off by [...] "Bigger Than the Beatles", the last number one single of his career. The album's other two singles were [...] "COUNTRY" [...] and [...] "Whole Lotta Gone" [...] (previously the b-side of [...] "Bigger Than the Beatles"), both of which peaked at 23 on the country music charts in 1996. Country Standard Time critic George Hauenstein praised the album for {{containing}} [...] "songs that are slightly different from [...] those other artists sing." [...] Owens {{thought that it was}} a [...] "varied collection of ballads and midtempo rockers", but said that it was not [...] "as consistently engaging" [...] as Third Rock from the Sun. Nash gave [...] "Bigger Than the Beatles" [...] a C-minus rating, calling it [...] "just a lame device to evoke the names of beloved rock heroes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's <b>so</b> <b>funny</b> and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
3000|$|It’s <b>funny,</b> <b>so</b> {{sometimes}} they are like that. After that they will tell people, “My maid did this this this just now....” [...]...|$|R
50|$|Lion Lu and rabbit Bun were friends, {{but they}} have {{characters}} and favourites which were different each other. <b>So,</b> there're many <b>funny</b> and dramatic situations which happened.|$|R
60|$|The {{face that}} Charlie made in these {{circumstances}} was <b>so</b> ineffably <b>funny,</b> that Toc burst into uncontrollable laughter. Hearing this, the roarers opened their eyes, slid quickly into the same key, and tumbled head over heels on the grass, in which evolutions they were imitated by the whole party, except such as had not at that time passed beyond the staggering age.|$|R
