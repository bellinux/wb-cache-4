By phase portrait method, the vehicle stability differences of three cases, front wheels steering/four-wheel <b>steering</b> <b>case,</b> front/rear/four-wheel braking case, and high/low road friction case, are characterized. With the Jacobian matrix, the stable equilibrium point is found and stable areas are calculated out. Similarly, the stability boundaries corresponding to different working conditions are also captured. With vehicle braking or accelerating in the steering process, the relationship between front/rear wheel slippage and the stable area is examined.

40|$|Double-motor drive tracked {{vehicles}} (2 MDTV) {{are widely used}} in the tracked vehicle industry due {{to the development of}} electric vehicle drive systems. The aim {{of this paper is to}} solve the problem of insufficient propulsion motor torque in low-speed, small-radius steering and insufficient power in high-speed large-radius steering. In order to do this a new type of steering system with a coupling device is designed and a closed-loop control strategy based on speed is adopted to improve the lateral stability of the vehicle. The work done entails modeling and simulating the 2 MDTV and the proposed control strategy in RecurDyn and Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the 2 MDTV with the coupling device outputs more torque and power in both <b>steering</b> <b>cases</b> compared to the 2 MDTV without the coupling device, and the steering stability of the vehicle is improved by using the strategy based on speed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Strip threadability is {{an ability}} to keep a strip flowing {{smoothly}} between inter-stands and run-out tables without severe longitudinal and lateral movements. The occurrence of a longitudinal movement is mainly related to looper–tension control performance, while a lateral movement is affected by steering control actions. Unstable threading may induce folding and pinching of a strip, thus resulting in damage to the strips and rolls and, in the worst case, an emergency shutdown. This paper investigates the potential of an MPC algorithm for the strip threading control problem and evaluates its efficacy through looper–tension and strip <b>steering</b> control <b>case</b> studies. 1...|$|R
40|$|Pervasive service {{ecosystems}} {{are a new}} paradigm {{for the design of}} context-aware systems featuring adaptivity and self-awareness. A theoretical and practical framework has been proposed for addressing these scenarios, taking primary inspirations from natural ecosystems and grounding upon two basic abstractions: “live semantic annotations” (LSAs), which are descriptions stored in infrastructure nodes and wrapping data, knowledge, and activities of humans, devices, and services; and “eco-laws”, acting as system rules evolving the population of LSAs as if they were molecules subject to chemical-like reactions. In this paper, we aim at deepening how self-organisation can be injected in pervasive service ecosystems in terms of spatial structures and algorithms for supporting the design of context-aware applications. To this end, we start from an existing classification of self-organisation patterns, and systematically show how they can be supported in pervasive service ecosystems, and be composed to generate a self-organising emergent behaviour.

The methodology {{can be applied}} on any kind of measurements performed by a CMM, and {{it is intended to}} be especially useful when performing reference measurements of geometrical and dimensional characteristics of workpieces. Master parts calibrated using this approach can be used in connection with ISO/TS 15530 - 3 for the uncertainty assessment of other CMMs, when measuring similar parts. Consistent measurement strategies and the real measurand definition according to the technical drawing are the foundations of this methodology, generally based in high-density measurement points. Assessment of uncertainties is performed using models in complete agreement with the measurement procedure, considering all major uncertainty contributions. Resources from artificial intelligence were applied to accelerate the development of adequate measurement procedures, simplifying the work of the CMM operator.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis {{was carried out in}} the Computer Graphics & CAD/CAM group at Delft University of Technology. The project was directly supervised by Frits Post. It is the sixth project in a series of PhD projects on data visualization, but the first project concerned with Virtual Reality and data visualization. In summer 1998, the Responsive Workbench facility was installed at the High Performance Applied Computing Center (HPaC) at TU Delft. The Workbench was intended to serve as a high performance visualization system, working in a cluster with the other HPaC supercomputers. This PhD project was initiated to set up an environment for high-performance data visualization, so that our group and other research groups of TU Delft could use this VR facility. Another aspect was to include computational steering facilities, which would enable the user to control a supercomputer simulation directly from the virtual environment displayed on the Workbench. For the purposes of our research we developed the RWB Library and the VRX toolkit, together a basic environment for visualization and interaction on the RWB. The thesis covers three main topics: design and development of VR applications, interaction in virtual environments, and visualization of data, originating from scientific simulations. On various case studies we have demonstrated that the Responsive Workbench concept with our software and techniques can provide an efficient visualization environment with natural spatial interaction. The case studies were done in co-operation with internal TU Delft and external research groups. One of the early applications was an interactive 3 D visualization of the flooding risk simulations, provided by WL|Delft Hydraulics. The Molecular Dynamics visualization and computational <b>steering</b> <b>case</b> study has been conducted in close co-operation with the Computational Physics group (Faculty of Applied Sciences, TU Delft).

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{three main}} {{criteria}} for the adaptive beamformer design are discussed: maximal signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR), minimal mean-squared error (MMSE), and minimal least-square error (MLSE). Although {{in the case of}} exactly known power and steering vector of the signal-of-interest (SOI), there are beamformers that can simultaneously meet the MMSE and MSINR criteria, this is no longer true when the exact knowledge of the steering vector is unavailable. To account for steering vector errors, a meaningful approach is to model the actual steering vector as random. In this paper, it is shown that in the latter case, the MMSE and MSINR criteria can not be simultaneously attained. We study the achievable region in the MSE-SINR plane and propose a new adaptive beamformer that can attain a frontier of operating points on the boundary of this region and, therefore, provide an optimal performance tradeoff among the MSINR and MMSE criteria. It is also shown that in the random <b>steering</b> vector <b>case,</b> the MLSE and MSINR criteria are simultaneously achievable and a new adaptive beamformer is proposed that satisfies both these criteria.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the driver's <b>steering</b> {{behavior}} in <b>case</b> of overtaking on a two-lane highway. Furthermore, in the {{paper we propose a}} customized steering controller for an automated vehicle. When observing current models of human steering controllers, it can be concluded that these models more or less share the same configuration in which three elements are of importance, namely: trajectory planning, prediction horizon and the steering controller. In the proposed model, the assumption that a driver envisages a trajectory before the process of overtaking is problematic in real-time applications due to inaccurate reflection of driving behavior and computational complexity. As an alternative to this method, a target and control scheme is implemented to mimic human overtaking behavior on the highway. Through controller customization and implementation on a validated vehicle model, it is suggested that the control strategy holds great potential for further application on the real road...|$|R

A possible solution to overcome this disadvantage is given by using electric beam <b>steering.</b> In most <b>cases</b> conventional array-feed networks are very complex, large and expensive. This fact restricts the mobile usage of such systems. The proposed design of a SIW slot array antenna allows steering of the main lobe by a simple frequency change.

40|$|Novel {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) lead designs are currently entering the market, which are hypothesized to provide a way to steer the stimulation field away from neural populations responsible for side effects and towards populations responsible for beneficial effects. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the performances of a new eight channel steering-DBS lead and compare this with a conventional cylindrical contact (CC) lead. The two leads were evaluated in a finite element electric field model combined with multicompartment neuron and axon models, representing the internal capsule (IC) fibers and subthalamic nucleus (STN) cells. We defined the optimal stimulation setting as the configuration that activated the highest percentage of STN cells, without activating any IC fibers. With this criterion, we compared monopolar stimulation using a single contact of the steering-DBS lead and CC lead, on three locations and four orientations of the lead. In addition, we performed a current <b>steering</b> test <b>case</b> by dividing the current over two contacts with the steering-DBS lead in its worst-case orientation. In most cases, the steering-DBS lead is able to stimulate a significantly higher percentage of STN cells compared to the CC lead using single contact stimulation or using a two contact current steering protocol when there is approximately a 1 mm displacement of the CC lead. The results also show that correct placement and orientation of the lead in the target remains an important aspect in achieving the optimal stimulation outcome. Currently, clinical trials are set up in Europe with a similar design as the steering-DBS lead. Our results illustrate the importance of the orientation of the new steering-DBS lead in avoiding side effects induced by stimulation of IC fibers. Therefore, in clinical trials sufficient attention should be paid to implanting the steering DBS-lead in the most effective orientatio...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mental health {{problems}} {{have a high}} prevalence. Most adults with mental {{health problems}} in need of help, receive primary care treatment. Since 2008 mental health practice nurse (in Dutch named Praktijkondersteuner Huisartsenzorg GGZ (POH-GGZ)) are available to support GPs with the care of patients with mental health problems. Most important functions are problem clarification, advising, process <b>steering,</b> guiding, <b>case</b> management and short treatment. Practice research of the mental health practice nurse {{is needed to determine}} to which extent the mental health practice nurse works in accordance with the intended task assignment. In part 1 of this current survey, the task realisation of 19 mental health practice nurses working in the province Groningen (The Netherlands) has been studied. This second part of the study focuses on patients’ experiences with the help of their mental health practice nurse. Method: During three months the 19 mental health practice nurse have registered their first contact and the follow-up contacts with the patient in registration forms. The patients completed a questionnaire after the first contact and in case informed consent was given, a second questionnaire three months after the first contact. The registration forms and patient questionnaires have been processed and analyzed with SPSS 19. 0. It appeared form the non-response analysis that patients who completed the second patient questionnaire (N= 159) were a good reflection of the patients who have completed the first patient questionnaire (N= 456). Results: 68 % of the patient population seeing the mental health practice nurse is female and the mean age is 45 years. After three month the patients especially pointed out that they got help for the problems ‘stress/stressed’ and ‘depressive feeling’. 82 % of the patients reported to have received ‘counselling’ and as such it is the most frequently received service. Patients consider ‘information about the possibilities for help or treatment’ and ‘availability’ as the most important issues. Improvement occures on five of the seven aspect of the functional status according the WONCA-COOP. The patients give a mean value of 7. 5 to the aid of the mental health practice nurse. 87 % of the population points out that they see surplus value of the involvement of the mental health practice nurse. Conclusion and discussion: Concluding, patients experience the help of the mental health practice nurse as good. The results of this study are mainly based on the patients of a limited number of mental health practice nurse. There are no relations between the improvement in functional status and the kind of problems patients come with or the kind of received help. The tendency towards the increase of inflow of mental health practice nurse, is a good sign for the future and must be stimulated. ...|$|R

However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one emergency hatch in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and <b>steering</b> and two <b>cases</b> with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable aiming circle, one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR echo depth finder with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 portable mine detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their operating position in under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds.

40|$|Our {{energy supply}} chain is {{changing}} rapidly, {{driven by a}} societal push towards clean and renewable resources. However, these resources are often uncontrollable (e. g., wind and sun) and are increasingly being exploited on smaller scales (e. g., rooftop photovoltaic). This poses a reliability challenge for the operation of our energy supply chain, specifically for our electricity grid. In this grid, supply and demand must be matched at all times, since storage is virtually on-existent. Traditionally, the supply is controlled centrally and follows the load, where the latter {{is assumed to be}} uncontrollable. With the growing number of uncontrollable distributed renewable resources in the system, the centralized paradigm is quickly becoming infeasible. To combat the decreasing flexibility due to loss of controllability on the generation side, often the exploitation of flexibility on the consumption side is considered. This flexibility comes from devices that can adapt their energy use, e. g., smart white goods or electric vehicles (EVs) with smart chargers. Such resources of flexibility on the consumer side are called distributed energy resources (DERs). With the expected growth of the number of DERs in future energy systems, their coordination offers potential to operate the grid more efficiently and allows the integration of more (uncontrollable) energy from renewables into the grid. Traditional steering approaches in the electricity grid do not scale well with the number of DERs and were not designed for the diversity (i. e., heterogeneity) of the envisioned DERs. Thus, new energy management approaches are required. In this thesis we introduce and study such an energy management approach called profile steering. The profile steering approach decentralizes (part of) the computational effort to ensure scalability, making it a decentralized energy management approach. Profile steering relies on predictions and scheduling,meaning that it predicts the future system state and requirements and schedules the use of flexibility of the available DERs to best meet the system goals. We focus on the distribution grid, as {{a large part of the}} DERs are expected to be present in this part of the grid. The profile steering approach influences the energy use of DERs using generic steering signals. We show that the approach can incorporate a broad class of such steering signals. This implies that the approach is flexible enough to be applied in many different situations. Furthermore, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the electricity grid to set up a corresponding hierarchical control structure. This structure allows us to incorporate local limitations into our approach, for instance maximum cable loading of the considered grid section. As the developed approach is decentralized, we distribute (part of) the required computation to a local level, i. e., to a controller inside a home or embedded in a device. Such controllers often do not have large computational power. To ensure the computations can be feasibly executed on these local controllers with low computational power the resulting distributed scheduling problems have to be researched. We show that many of these problems fall into the class of resource allocation problems, which are well studied in literature. Several of these problems are extensions of known problems. Therefore, we apply some of the techniques found in literature and extend them to include common cases (current and futuristic) in residential energy settings. In particular we consider buffering devices. Such buffering devices can utilize an internal buffer to decouple (part of) the time they require energy for their operation and the time this energy is taken from the grid. The first type of such a device we consider is the electric vehicle (EV). Scheduling the energy use of the EV is similar to a classical resource allocation problem if it can charge at any rate between zero and a given maximum. To solve this case we apply techniques from literature. However, if the EV can only be charged at a finite number of rates, the problem becomes NP-hard, even if we are only interested in obtaining feasible solutions. To circumvent this issue we consider an adaptation of the problem for which we develop an efficient solution method giving results that are nearly identical to feasible solutions to the original problem. In a follow up chapter we extend the results found for the EV to devices that also allow discharging, e. g., residential stationary batteries and EVs with vehicle-to-grid capabilities. Furthermore, we study heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems as a special case. In these systems the energy losses depend on the energy present in the storage (in this case the house itself). Next to developing a method to control such a device, we also study the effect of prediction errors on our approach and show that we can effectively deal with them in the case of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems using an approach inspired by model predictive control. We use simulations to show the validity of profile <b>steering</b> using several <b>cases.</b> We show that profile steering can also be used to achieve near optimal results when minimizing the degradation of a power transformer. This indicates that the benefits that can be expected from using our approach are not limited to energy markets, but also include increased lifetime of grid assets resulting in reduced investment costs in these assets. Summarizing, the introduced profile steering decentralized energy management approach promises to be a valuable approach in the future (smart) electricity grid where it can unlock the potential of many residential DERs and assist in an effective and efficient energy transition...|$|R
