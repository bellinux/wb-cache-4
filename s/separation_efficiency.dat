2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve <b>separation</b> <b>efficiency</b> and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC.

Although processing of cellulosic fibres in airstream has been utilised for decades in airlaid processes, no attempts to fractionate fibres in dry state have been reported.

Also evaluations of quality and capacity of fractionation operation are made.

A double-view, orthogonal imaging approach is applied obtaining statistics of three-dimensional shape, dimensions and coordinates of detected fibre flocs. Fraction and fibre properties are determined with Metso Fractionator and Metso Fiberlab. Results show that fibre behaviour in a given system strongly depends on the pulp properties.

Several operating parameters were explored, including input material concentration, splitter position and feed rate. Experimental design for the tests is presented.

The separation process was less sensitive to material concentration and feed rate which are specifiable.
