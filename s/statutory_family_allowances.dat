40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{short history of}} <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> and documents that Keynes supported <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> {{as early as the}} 1920 s and continuing through the 1930 s and early 1940 s. Keynes saw this policy as a way to help households raise their children and also as a way to increase consumption without reducing business investment. The paper goes on to argue that a policy of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> is consistent with Keynesian economics. Finally, the paper uses the Luxembourg Income Study to estimate the impact of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> on child poverty in several developed nations and estimates the poverty-reducing impact of several possible <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> programs for the US...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{socioeconomic}} {{differences in}} the effect of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> on fertility. Although several {{studies have examined the}} relationship between cash benefits and fertility, few studies have addressed the possible differential effects of cash benefits on families of different income or education levels. I reconstructed the birth histories of women in the past two Israeli censuses of 1983 and 1995 to study socioeconomic {{differences in the}} effect of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> up to the seventh parity. The results indicate that <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> have a significant effect at every parity. Using female education as an indicator of socioeconomic status, I find that socioeconomic status is a significant modifier of the effect of <b>family</b> <b>allowances.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>allowances</b> seem to have a relatively large impact on more-educated women...|$|R
25|$|Both Chilean men {{and women}} qualify for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if they have {{dependent}} {{children under the age}} of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> since a man qualifies for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if he has a dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage.

These benefits had been legislated for the previous year by Churchill's <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> Act 1945, {{and was the first}} measure pushed through parliament by Attlee's government.

40|$|The first {{significant}} GATT case regarding {{the principle of}} trade discrimination was Belgian <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances,</b> a complaint by Denmark and Norway against Belgium. This 1952 decision expounding {{the meaning of the}} unconditional most-favoured-nation principle is often cited for the proposition that origin-based conditions are inconsistent with that core principle. This article reconsiders <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> through the window of Professor Hudec s classic case study written in 1975. In particular, the article considers whether the panel and Professor Hudec correctly interpreted the term unconditionally, in light of the pre- 1947 international trade law practices. In addition, the article explores the status of <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances</b> as the first GATT case holding that a governmental social program violated trade rules. Although Belgium did not invoke GATT Article XX as a defense, this paper assesses how current WTO jurisprudence would be applied to the facts in <b>Family</b> <b>Allowances,</b> and concludes that Belgium would still lose the case. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project is to {{discover}} more spécifie answers than have hitherto been recorded as to the use and meaning of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> in a small, closely defined group of families. The purpose is also to learn the attitudes and opinions of such <b>families</b> towards <b>family</b> <b>allowances.</b> It was questioned whether there had been any influence on family spending patterns, and if so, how the patterns were affected. The différences, if any, that <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> hâve made in family consumptionand spending will be studied. The {{question of whether or}} not <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> must be used only to replace income lost elsewhere, and thus leave the children no better off than before, will also be of concern. The study will be largely exploratory in nature as the field is a new one. In addition, the findings cannot be expected to be of general application. They will apply only to the particular kind of family in the local sample chosen, which is a relatively small one. [ [...] . ...|$|R

The rates of <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> and of existing benefits for the unemployed, miners, invalids, widows, the blind, and the aged were increased. The qualifying age for old-age benefits was reduced from 65 to 60. <b>Family</b> <b>allowances</b> were extended. New welfare benefits were introduced for orphans and those whose incomes had ceased on account of sickness. Provision was made for emergency benefits for persons suffering hardship who were not entitled to any other benefits.

40|$|In {{this paper}} reforms of both present Italian {{personal}} income taxation and <b>family</b> <b>allowances</b> are evaluated {{with the aim}} to make the tax benefit system able to better support family burden. Two kind of reforms are considered: family quotient, based on the change of the tax unit from persons to families, and a new generalized <b>family</b> <b>allowance,</b> based on equivalent income and absorbing current family tax credits and allowances. After an evaluation of some limits of family quotient (higher effective marginal tax rate for spouse with lower income and a reduced support for low income families) and the current mix of tax credits and <b>allowances</b> (<b>families</b> with higher equivalent income can receive higher support for family burden), the comparison among two specific reforms is performed using a microsimulation model built on Bank of Italy survey about the Italian household and personal incomes. Results shows {{that it is possible}} to shape quotient family based reforms with redistributive effects, but also that the new generalized <b>family</b> <b>allowance</b> here presented is able to better support bottom quintiles of population, with or without dependent children. Each of the two reforms would cost about 9 billion of euro, an acceptable share of both the Italian GNP and the public budget.
