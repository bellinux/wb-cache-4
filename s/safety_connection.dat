In fulfilling the electricity needs, there was dividing in loads, which previously balanced, {{but because of}} the improper electricity needs, it created imbalance load influenced the electricity preparation. Load imbalance among rooms (phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3) caused neutral flow of voltage regulator. Overload would increased the transformer temperature which could break the transformer. There was temperature increasing which could be tolerate a transformer. While the transformer’s temperature more than maximum temperature line, it would cause the transformer isolation broken. That’s why there needed a tool to reduce the possibility of broken transformer. The safety tool worked when in a phase, like phase 1 there was overload, micro-controller would respond the tool so that overload in phase 1 would automatically turn to phase 2 or phase 3. So that the heavy load would be reduced and the power of three phases (phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3) could be balanced. Basically, simple <b>safety</b> <b>connection</b> flow could work fast to minimize the damage, like mechanic damage, and temperature rise damage which would follow simple connection flow and transformer connection.

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a rescue}} treatment for newborns with severe respiratory insufficiency. In veno-arterial ECMO, venous blood is drained {{from the right}} atrium, oxygenated in an artificial lung and reinfused in the aorta. For vascular access the right internal jugular vein and right common carotid artery are ligated permanently. This invasive treatment may have major complications. In this thesis we described the results of ECMO treatment in the University Medical Center Nijmegen of 186 newborns {{over a period of}} 12. 5 years. Survival varied between 65 % and 95 %, depending on the diagnosis. Major causes of death were respiratory insufficiency and intracranial haemorrhage. In this thesis we studied lung vascular morphology in newborns with pulmonary hypertension treated with ECMO and demonstrated a decrease in the abnormal morphometry that exists in the small pulmonary blood vessels. Furthermore, we studied the effects of ECMO on the brain. We demonstrated that intermittent opening of the so-called bridge, a <b>safety</b> <b>connection</b> in the ECMO circuit, has important negative effects on the cerebral oxygenation and circulation. This can be prevented with adaptation of this bridge. We also demonstrated that a patent ductus arteriosus with left to right shunt can diminish cerebral oxygenation and perfusion and should therefore be identified early. Others suggested that ECMO causes cerebral lesions predominantly in the right cerebral hemisphere, related to ligation of the right common carotid artery. We demonstrated that the initiation of ECMO has effects on the cerebral oxygenation and circulation, but that these effects were equal for both cerebral hemispheres. In veno-venous ECMO, drainage and reinfusion of blood take place both in the right atrium and ligation of the right common carotid artery is not necessary. To optimize the use of veno-venous ECMO {{it is important to be}} informed about recirculation. We developed a bedside method to quantify the amount of recirculation during veno-venous ECMO...|$|E
40|$|Bolted road <b>safety</b> barrier <b>connections</b> utilise {{slotted holes}} that are {{perpendicular}} to {{the direction of the}} safety barrier beam. Due to the clearance between the slotted holes and the bolts, a varying amount of slippage is seen before contact with the edge of the slot is made. The stiffness characteristics of bolted road <b>safety</b> barrier <b>connections</b> have been examined with a representative test coupon that incorporates a full size <b>safety</b> barrier <b>connection</b> slot to industry standard dimensions. Previous research work has successfully determined the stiffness characteristics of the bolted connections at quasi-static strain rates. Representative non-linear finite element models of the bolted test coupons have been constructed. When compared to the laboratory results the initial stiffness, maximum force and displacement of the bolted connections are similar to the finite element model predictions. Current investigations have moved onto strain rates comparable to those observed in actual vehicle crash tests. Explicit dynamic finite element(FE) models have been constructed and validated, using experimental data produced using a series of high strain rate laboratory tests fora number of bolt configurations.

50|$|A {{major fire}} in the Mont Blanc Tunnel in March 1999 {{involved}} 39 fatalities {{and led to a}} general review of road tunnel safety in France. The Tunnel Maurice-Lemaire was closed, initially to trucks and subsequently, in April 2004, to all vehicles, in order that major safety improvements could be implemented. The principal development was the construction of a second parallel ‘safety tunnel’, having a diameter of six meters, bored through the mountain beside the main tunnel. The main tunnel is connected to the safety tunnel by means of a series of <b>safety</b> <b>connections.</b> The upgrade having been completed, the tunnel reopened to vehicles early in October 2008. In the meantime, alternative autoroute based routes were signed for long distance traffic, while local drivers were obliged to renew their acquaintance with the Pass of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. Fortunately most motor vehicles used in France in the present decade are significantly more powerful than their 1970s predecessors.|$|R
