5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too <b>small.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
25|$|Most Duployan letters cursively {{connect to}} any {{adjacent}} letters. Circle vowels will sometimes reduce to as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> semi-circle {{in order to}} accommodate the incoming and outgoing strokes of adjacent letters, and orienting vowels will rotate to meet the preceding letter at a straight angle, while mirroring to present themselves to the following letter.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the use of}} radial {{engines in}} {{land-based}} fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as {{it was believed that}} their large frontal area would cause too much drag on something as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} things, {{prevention}} {{is the best}} cure. Any open wound, even one so <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blister, is a potential infestation site, and should be treated accordingly with approved pesticides. At {{times of the year}} when livestock are most vulnerable (castration, birthing, etc.), daily inspections should be conducted when possible. Infestations detected early are quite treatable, but fatalities can and do result from advanced infestation, particularly in sheep and newborn calves.|$|E
25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team {{as soon as possible}} to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E

25|$|Aliens are eusocial life-forms with a {{caste system}} ruled {{over by a}} queen. Their life cycle {{comprises}} several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an egg, which hatches a parasitoid larval form known as a facehugger, which then attaches itself to a living host by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the Alien 3 novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would likely {{be able to use}} a host as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cat, or as large as an elephant.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are capable}} of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes, owing to the smaller de Broglie wavelength of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail—even as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in cancer research, virology, and materials science as well as pollution, nanotechnology and semiconductor research.|$|E
25|$|Garrincha {{was born}} in Pau Grande, a {{district}} of Magé, {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little bird she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends.|$|E

25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single drop. This {{makes it possible for}} crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} above common forms, body casts could come in nearly any size and configuration. For example, from the 1910s to the 1970s, use of a {{turnbuckle}} cast, which used metal turnbuckles to twist two halves of the cast so as to forcibly straighten the spine before surgery, was common. The turnbuckle cast had no single configuration, and could be as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body jacket split in half, or could include the head, one or both legs to the knees or feet, and/or one arm to the elbow or wrist depending on {{the choice of the}} doctor.|$|E
25|$|In nature, radium {{is found}} in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium ores in trace amounts as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not {{necessary}} for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it {{was used as a}} radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has since become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.|$|E

25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use {{in the manufacture of}} photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E
25|$|At {{the scale}} of a large nation or region, at least in most industrialized economies, the {{economic}} value of sectors with low vulnerability to climate change greatly exceeds that of sectors with high vulnerability (Wilbanks et al., 2007, p.366). Additionally, the capacity of a large, complex economy to absorb climate-related impacts, is often considerable. Consequently, estimates of the aggregate damages of climate change – ignoring possible abrupt climate change – are often rather <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> percentage of economic production. On the other hand, at smaller scales, e.g., for a small country, sectors and societies might be highly vulnerable to climate change. Potential climate change impacts might therefore amount to very severe damages.|$|E

She was <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child and {{suffered}} poor health with chronic tonsillitis. When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Pine Level, just outside the state capital, Montgomery. She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), a century-old independent black denomination founded by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Oceania, particularly the Outer Party members, {{have no real}} privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way telescreens {{so that they may}} be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.|$|E

In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847.
