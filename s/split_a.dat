5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to <b>split</b> <b>a</b> substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, {{and the issue of}} whether or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to <b>split</b> <b>a</b> payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|The bowl {{earned the}} right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which {{guarantees}} {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Before 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third. After 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl has steadily increased its payouts in order to keep pace with the trend across college football. In the 2009 game, the ACC and SEC <b>split</b> <b>a</b> payout of $6.02 million, with the ACC receiving more because it offered an earlier selection.|$|E

5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued {{to appear to be}} addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed of light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light. In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he <b>split</b> <b>a</b> beam of light into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E

Léon Blum, the French prime minister, believed that support for the Republic would have led to a fascist takeover in France and ultimately no change in Spain.|$|E
5|$|William Little of Livingston, Alabama is {{credited}} with being responsible for the introduction of football at the university. After playing the game in 1891 while in attendance at a northern prep school, Little returned to Alabama where he helped establish the first team at the university for the 1892 season. The first game in Alabama football history was played on November 11, 1892, against Birmingham High School and was won by the Cadets 56–0. They then <b>split</b> <b>a</b> pair of games with the Birmingham Athletic Club, and closed out {{the season with a}} 32–22 loss in the first Iron Bowl against Auburn on February 22, 1893.

Past CR 561, the road passes {{to the east of}} Harleigh Cemetery prior to crossing Cooper River into Pennsauken Township. In Pennsauken, US 30/US 130 comes to the Airport Circle. Airport Circle is an intersection with several flyovers; US 30 splits to the west, while Route 38 heads east, soon splitting with Route 70. US 130, meanwhile, continues northeast through more commercial areas. The road briefly enters Camden again right before an interchange with CR 537. The route crosses under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line before coming to a large interchange with Route 90 that provides access to the Betsy Ross Bridge. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 130 <b>split.</b> <b>A</b> short distance later, the route reaches an interchange with Route 73, which runs to the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Back in Dawson Creek in November, the Rage <b>split</b> <b>a</b> three-game {{series against}} the Monsters, 1-1-1, and won both games against the Chicago Hitmen. Following another 6-game road trip to Alaska, the Rage {{continued}} into December winning approximately one-in-three games, with an 11-22-2 record near the mid-season break, when they traded their 20-year-old captain, Blaine Bokenfohr, to the Merritt Centennials in exchange for future considerations. Scott Fellnermayr became the new captain of the Rage, and would remain the captain {{for the remainder of}} the season and the next. In January, the Rage split two-game {{series against the}} Wild and split another in Chicago. The team put together a six-game winning streak in January–February, winning games against the Brown Bears and the Avalanche before splitting a two-game series with the Monsters. On their next road trip, they lost their two games against the Wild and won the next three against the Monsters. The season ended in early March with Rage in fifth place with a 24-31-3 record, in the six-team West division.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the {{hurricane}} left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands. For example, North Bunces Key—an island of southern Pinellas County—lost {{most of its}} vegetation to the storm, and overwashing shifted {{the southern part of}} the island up to 330ft (100 m) from its original settlement. More extensive changes were seen on and near Caladesi Island, which formed in 1921 after a hurricane <b>split</b> <b>a</b> larger barrier island into two by a new channel. The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south, which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach, allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of {{the hurricane}}'s passage. As a result, Clearwater Beach became connected to Caladesi Island. Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy's Cut, which existed until 1991. Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project. Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance, no action was taken.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to <b>split</b> <b>a</b> heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
