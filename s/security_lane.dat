25|$|Until 2014, Terminal B {{was split}} into {{north and south}} {{building}}s, with a parking garage located between the two buildings. The gates of the south building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and housing an Admirals Club) are divided into three groups: B1–B3, B4–B14 and B15–B19. Gates B1–B3 are the exclusive use of Air Canada. There is a single <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> for these three gates resulting in short wait times. However, to reach other gates in Terminal B including connections to Air Canada's Star Alliance partner United, {{it is necessary to}} leave the secure area and re-enter. Post-security, there is only a grab-and-go restaurant and there is no lounge access. As passengers arriving from Canada are pre-cleared by US Customs and Border Protection, passengers do not need to pass through Terminal E's international arrival facility. Gates B4–14 and B15–B19 are connected by a walkway post-security. The gates of the north building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and United Airlines, both of which operate airline lounges in the terminal) are divided into two groups: B20–B36 and B37–B38. Gates B20–29 are used by United Airlines while gates B30–B36 serve American Airlines. Gates B37 and B38 are home to Spirit Airlines.|$|E

Passengers will voluntarily {{pay a fee}} and submit to a background check to become a Registered Traveler. Passengers who pass the background check will be issued a smartcard credential for use at the security checkpoints of airports that participate in the program. Registered Travelers {{will have access to}} a reserved <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> and will enjoy a shorter wait at the security checkpoint. Other benefits, such as allowing Registered Travelers to keep their coats and shoes on and their laptops in their bags have also been discussed.

40|$|The file {{attached}} to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link. Airports face pressures to reduce costs at the <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> area by reducing lane opening hours whilst maintaining a passenger service level. Evolutionary methods {{have been shown to}} design schedules that minimise both objectives. However, by reducing lane opening hours schedules have a tendency to over-fit the expectation of passenger arrivals at security resulting in long delays with deviations from this forecast. Evolutionary dynamic re-optimisation can mitigate for this reducing passenger waiting times but the <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> problem {{is an example of a}} constrained problem in that schedules cannot be significantly altered. Consequently, this paper will investigate the consideration of flexibility when evolving initial schedules to facilitate the evolutionary dynamic re-optimization process. Several differing methods of measuring flexibility will be investigated alongside reducing <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> opening hours and passenger waiting times. Results demonstrate that considering flexibility in the initial design of schedules improves the effectiveness of evolutionary dynamic re-optimisation of schedules...|$|E

40|$|The file {{attached}} to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link. Reducing costs whilst maintaining passenger satisfaction is an important problem for airports. One area this can be applied is the <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> checks at the airport. However, reducing costs through reducing lane openings typically increases queue length and hence passenger dissatisfaction. This paper demonstrates that evolutionary methods {{can be used to}} optimise airport <b>security</b> <b>lane</b> schedules such that passenger dissatisfaction and staffing costs can be minimised. However, it is shown that these schedules typically over-fit the forecasts of passenger arrivals at security such that in actuality significant passenger delays can occur with deviations from the forecast. Consequently, this paper further demonstrates that dynamic evolutionary re-optimisation of these schedules can significantly mitigate this over-fitting problem with much reduced passenger delays...|$|E

It is based on its observations, which are the flight schedule, the number of <b>security</b> <b>lanes</b> opened, and the number of passengers in the security checkpoint queue. Specifically, the agent determines whether the queue length at the security checkpoint is above an acceptable threshold value defined based on the IATA waiting standard corresponding to a reasonable level of service. This standard specifies a maximum of 10  min waiting time for Economy Class at a security checkpoint (Stewart Head 2014).|$|R

Compared to the decentralised model (with security at the gate) the expected arrival time of passengers (and the amount of cabin baggage that they bring along) will be less easy to predict.   The centralised model will therefore {{be more difficult to}} manage and result in an increase of time passengers have to spend in queues. Supply chain management based on ideas of the extended enterprise, offers a solution that will lead to better tuning of supply (available <b>security</b> <b>lanes)</b> and demand (arriving passengers). A number of aspects, that are essential for the success of this approach, are addressed in this article. The benefits (lower cost and higher passenger satisfaction) warrant adoption of this approach...|$|R

In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of implementing virtual queuing at airport <b>security</b> <b>lanes,</b> by offering some passengers a time window during which they can arrive to enter a priority queue. This process {{could result in a}} smoother distribution of arriving passengers, such that the required security personnel (costs) can be decreased. While this concept has received attention in a number of settings, such as theme parks, virtual queuing at airports bears an additional level of complexity related to the flight schedules, i. e., passengers can only be transferred forward in time to a limited extent, which we denote by the transfer time limit. We conducted a major simulation study in collaboration with a large international airport in Western Europe to determine the potential impact of virtual queuing and find that nearly one million Euro can be saved on security personnel cost without negatively impacting the passenger waiting time...|$|R
