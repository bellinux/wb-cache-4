500|$|On 20 June, the King's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, and Robert Tresilian, the {{replacement}} Chief Justice, were given special commissions {{across the whole}} of England. Thomas oversaw court cases in Essex, backed up by a substantial military force as resistance was continuing and the county was still {{in a state of}} unrest. Richard himself visited Essex, where he met with a rebel delegation seeking confirmation of the grants the King had given at Mile End. Richard rejected them, allegedly telling them that [...] "rustics you were and rustics you are <b>still.</b> <b>You</b> will remain in bondage, not as before, but incomparably harsher". Tresilian soon joined Thomas, and carried out 31 executions in Chelmsford, then travelled to St Albans in July for further court trials, which appear to have utilised dubious techniques to ensure convictions. Thomas went on to Gloucester with 200 soldiers to suppress the unrest there. Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was tasked to restore order to Yorkshire.|$|E

2500|$|After {{considering}} his situation, believing {{that not only}} would he never walk again, but that he might never move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide. He mouthed to Dana, [...] "Maybe we should let me go." [...] She tearfully replied, [...] "I am only {{going to say this}} once: I will support whatever you want to do because this is your life, and your decision. But I {{want you to know that}} I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're <b>still</b> <b>you.</b> And I love you." [...] Reeve never considered euthanasia as an option again.|$|E

2500|$|Magnani {{worked with}} Tennessee Williams {{again for the}} 1960 film, The Fugitive Kind (originally titled, Orpheus Descending) {{directed}} by Sidney Lumet, in which she played Lady Torrance and starred with Marlon Brando. The original screenplay Orpheus Descending was another play inspired by Magnani, although she similarly did not feature in the Broadway play. In the film she played a woman [...] "hardened by life's cruelties and a grief that will not fade." [...] It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward {{in one of her}} early roles. In an article he wrote for Life magazine Williams discussed why he chose her for the part:"Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in The Fugitive Kind would be her greatest triumph to date... She is simply a rare being who seems to have about her a little lightning-shot cloud all her own.... In a crowded room she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and <b>still</b> <b>you</b> feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum {{in the air like a}} live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna's is like the presence of royalty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cronin {{also came}} to feel that [...] "If we {{consider}} the physical universe,... we cannot escape {{the notion of a}} primary Creator.... Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species, its scientific doctrine of natural causes. And <b>still</b> <b>you</b> are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. Ex nihilo nihil, as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." [...] This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting [...] "a frankly atheistic approach," [...] described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, [...] "though he did not say how," [...] of the first primitive life-form from lifeless matter. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, [...] "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," [...] and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The na√Øve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer [...] "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into a howl of laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by one word of challenge from a simple-minded boy." ...|$|E
