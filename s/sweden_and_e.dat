40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} costs of treating venous leg ulcers in <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> the United Kingdom during 1 year and to quantify costs in different health states, The costs of treating four different types of venous leg ulcers were estimated for 52 weeks by a stochastic health economic model, which simulated resource use data obtained from prospectively collected patient data, expert panels in the two countries, and published scientific. literature, The average cost of treating an ulcer varied between <b>E</b> 1332 <b>and</b> <b>E</b> 2585 in <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> from <b>E</b> 814 to E 1994 in the United Kingdom. Cost of treating large ulcers (greater than or equal to 10 cm(2)) of long duration (greater than or equal to 6 months) was highest in both countries. Frequency of dressing changes and duration of time for each dressing change were higher in Sweden than in the United Kingdom, resulting in higher total cost per patient in Sweden. An important factor for the total costs was time to heal. Other important variables influencing treatment costs were frequency and duration of dressing changes, Actions to reduce time used for dressing changes and the total time to healing are thus very important in reducing costs spent on treatment of venous leg ulcers in both countries...|$|R

40|$|Geomagnetic storms (GMS) can inject geomagnetically induced {{currents}} (GICs) {{into high}} voltage power transmission grids, causing instabilities and eventually leading the grid to collapse. Since GMS {{are expected to}} cause more pronounced disturbances at high latitudes, we consider the effects of extreme GMS on the northern portion of the 400 kV interconnected European power transmission grid, which includes Finland, <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> Norway. Potential space-weather triggered voltage instabilities in the power grid were analyzed considering mono-phase transformers, which {{are known to be}} more vulnerable to GIC injection, and three phase transformers, which are less vulnerable. Our simulations show that for the three-phase configuration of the network, the likelihood of grid collapse is very low, compared to the mono-phase configuration, and collapse only occurs with extremely high geoelectric field intensities. Transmission lines of the system that experience higher reactive power losses during normal operation are more likely to increase losses during a GMS event. In our study, we identified the portion of the Scandinavian interconnected power transmission where the highest reactive losses in transmission lines and in voltage magnitudes are observed. This corresponds to the southern parts of <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> Norway. JRC. <b>E.</b> 2 -Technology Innovation in Securit...|$|R

Today there are four protected carnivore species, brown bear (Ursus arctos), wolverine (Gulo gulo), wolf (Canis lupus) and lynx (Lynx lynx), together with the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Scholars {{have argued}} {{that the end of the}} Cold War and the War on Terror have radically changed the context of war and defense, diminished the role of nation-states in favor of multi-lateral defense activities, and placed a new focus on human security. International {{peacekeeping}} has superseded the traditional act of war-making as the most important defense strategy among wealthy, liberal-democratic nations. And, per UN Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted in 2000, all member nations must consider the needs of women and girls during repatriation, resettlement, and post-conflict reconstruction efforts. Gender, Sex, and the Postnational Defense looks at the way that a postnational defense influenced by SC 1325 and focused on human security affects gender relations in militaries. Interestingly, despite the successful implementation of gender mainstreaming in training, the number of women involved in military peacekeeping remains low. Contradicting much of the gender mainstreaming literature, Annica Kronsell shows that increasing gender awareness in the military is a more achievable task than increasing gender parity. Employing a feminist constructivist institutional approach, Kronsell questions whether military institutions can ever attain gender neutrality without confronting their reliance on masculinity constructs. She further questions whether "feminism" must always be equated with anti-militarism or if military violence committed in the name of enhancing human security can be performed according to a feminist ethics. Kronsell builds her theoretical argument on a case study of <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> the <b>E.</b> U...|$|R

40|$|The American Dwight L. Moody (1837 – 1899) was {{the most}} famous revivalist of the late 1800 s and {{exercised}} a wide and lasting influence on the Protestant world, reaching Swedes in <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> America. His influence was felt among Swedes {{despite the fact that}} he was of English heritage, never visited Sweden or any Scandinavian country, and never spoke a word of the Swedish language. Nevertheless, he became a “hero” revivalist among Swedish Mission Friends in <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> America. Moody’s early ministry was centered in Chicago, the largest urban population of Swedes in the United States. In 1867, he first came into contact with Swedish immigrants in Chicago known as Mission Friends. The church that he founded, Chicago Avenue Church, later organized a Swedish fellowship. Many Swedes who immigrated to America, a land of religious pluralism, were eager to adopt Moody’s beliefs and methods. Fredrik Franson who joined Moody’s church became a proponent of the American revivalist’s beliefs and methods, spreading them in America, <b>Sweden</b> <b>and</b> other countries. <b>E.</b> A. Skogsbergh, a pioneer of the Mission Covenant in America, adopted Moody’s preaching style so much that he became known as “the Swedish Moody. ” News of Moody’s large revival campaigns in Great Britain from 1873 – 1875 traveled quickly to Sweden, making “Mr. Moody” a household name in homes of many Mission Friends. Moody’s sermons published in Sweden were distributed in books, newspapers, and colporteur tracts, and led to the spread of Sweden’s “Moody fever” from 1875 – 1880. P. P. Waldenström cited Moody as an example of evangelical cooperation in events leading to the founding of Svenska Missionsförbundet (Swedish Mission Covenant). Songs of Moody’s musical partner, Ira D. Sankey, were translated into Swedish by Theodor Truvé and Erik Nyström and sung in homes and mission houses. Moody’s influence extended even to Sweden’s Archbishop Nathan Söderblom who during his college years attended Moody’s student conference at Northfield, Massachusetts. As Mission Friends adopted Moody’s alliance ideal, beliefs, and methods, their religious identity shifted in the direction of Moody’s new American evangelicalism...|$|R
