500|$|Arnold was {{initially}} sceptical when approached about directing [...] "EastEnders Live", but agreed {{once it was}} explained that {{the impetus for the}} episode was motivated by the [...] "whodunnit" [...] storyline. He explained: [...] "We pre-record TV drama for lots of very good reasons and doing a live episode can sometimes come across a little gimmicky, <b>so</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> story is the one and only reason a drama should go live." [...] Direction of the episode differed from typical episodes of EastEnders, whereby actors briefly run through their lines, block the scene to be filmed, then begin shooting with the director on the studio floor. For [...] "EastEnders Live", cast and crew had two weeks to work on the episode, rehearsing, blocking scenes and discussing the characters' journeys at length.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] <b>So</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E
500|$|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo {{were formed}} in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, as a musical theatre troupe. As Richard's {{interest}} shifted to filmmaking, he passed {{leadership of the}} band to younger brother Danny Elfman, who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre, and had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska, and had become [...] "sick of lugging around so much stuff with the theatre troupe. Towards the end", Elfman remembers, [...] "it was a big production... there was, like a semi full of stuff. And that was becoming burdensome. <b>So,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{the idea of being}} a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club, and an hour later be playing, became a goal." ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{no other}} way, and it was <b>so</b> {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to warn you. I brought Tommy and Linda along to chaperon me.|$|R
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and <b>so</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, Laucke {{moved to}} New York City to further his career. He {{was asked by}} Valdès-Blain if he would mind sharing his one-room {{apartment}} with flamenco guitarist Paco deLucía. Laucke taught deLucía music by Bach and Villa-Lobos. In return, deLucía showed Laucke some of the secrets of his art of flamenco, an oral tradition handed down through generations, [...] "their secrets and knowledge jealously guarded". Although Laucke had played flamenco for his own pleasure {{since he was a}} child, he had never felt comfortable playing it in public. De Lucía's influence helped change this: [...] "This meeting changed my life," [...] Laucke [...] declared, [...] "he taught me flamenco works which were not written anywhere and to which no other guitarist had access. <b>So</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to be taught all these techniques by a guitarist of Paco's caliber was an incredible stroke of luck". (English translation) ...|$|E
500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. <b>So</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E

500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. <b>So</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, <b>so</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Pinto's {{modelling}} agency selected her and {{six other}} models to audition for the female lead in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire (2008) after a request by its casting director. After undergoing six months of extensive auditions, Pinto won the role of Latika, the love interest of the main character Jamal, played by Dev Patel. During the post-production phase, she attended an acting course at the Barry John Acting Studio in Mumbai. Although the course taught her about the [...] "technical aspects" [...] of acting, she stated that [...] "in terms of the actual experience, there's nothing like {{going out there and}} actually playing the part... <b>So</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> my favorite acting school was the six months of auditioning with Danny Boyle". Acclaimed particularly for its plot and soundtrack, Slumdog Millionaire emerged as a sleeper hit; made on a budget of $15 million, the film grossed [...] worldwide. It was the most successful film at the 81st Academy Awards: it was nominated for ten awards, of which it won eight, including the award for Best Picture. Pinto won the Breakthrough Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, along with other cast members from the film.|$|E

500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. <b>So,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, <b>so</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of What to Do When You Are Dead, the band performed {{a series of}} shows in September, October and December 2015, during which they performed the album in its entirety.

Calling it [...] "impressive at the time, this band from the suburbs [...] a power pop-punk record with a linear, intricate narrative". AXS contributor Tarynn Law wrote that [...] "the instantly relateable tracks that filled What To Do When You Are Dead soundtracked the teenage angst of kids {{all around the country}} for years to come". Brian Aberback of NorthJersey.com noted that the album [...] "put Armor for Sleep on the indie-rock map and continues to resonate heavily with fans 10 years later". Jorgensen later called the album a [...] "diary entry.

2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time to sit around. You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. <b>So,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference.
