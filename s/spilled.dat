40|$|Contingency planners, {{response}} officials, government agencies, and oil transporters share a {{keen interest}} in being able to anticipate oil <b>spill</b> response costs for planning purposes. Oil <b>spill</b> cleanup response costs depend on a variety of factors, most notably, location, oil type, <b>spill</b> size, and cleanup strategy, making it difficult to develop a universal per-unit cost factor. This study analyzes marine oil <b>spill</b> cleanup costs on the basis of country, proximity to shoreline, <b>spill</b> size, oil type, degree of shoreline oiling, and cleanup methodology to determine how each of these factors impacts per-unit cleanup costs. The results show that oil <b>spill</b> responses in different countries and regions of the world vary considerably in their costs most likely due to differences in cultural values, socio-economic factors, and labor costs. Location, oil type, and <b>spill</b> size also factor heavily in determining cleanup costs. Nearshore <b>spills</b> and in-port <b>spills</b> are 4 - 5 times as expensive to clean up as offshore <b>spills.</b> Responses to <b>spills</b> of heavy fuels are more than ten times as expensive as <b>spill</b> responses for lighter crudes and diesel fuels. <b>Spill</b> responses for <b>spills</b> under 30 tonnes are more than ten times as expensive...|$|R

A review of the existing results is provided and the determinants of <b>spill</b> size using a sample selection model are estimated.

One important nding is that groundings and collisions result in larger <b>spills</b> if there is a <b>spill,</b> but the likelihood {{that there will be a}} <b>spill</b> due to a grounding or collision is very low. Tanker size is found to have only a marginal e ect on the probability of a <b>spill</b> and a dubious e ect on <b>spill</b> size.

40|$|<b>Spill</b> {{prevention}} is prudent both economically and environmentally, because <b>spills</b> increase operating costs and lower productivity. An important tool in preventing <b>spills</b> is a <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan. A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan specifies materials handling procedures and storage requirements and identifies <b>spill</b> cleanup procedures for areas and processes in which <b>spills</b> may potentially occur. The plan standardizes process operating procedures and employee training {{in an effort}} to minimize accidental pollutant releases that could contaminate storm water runoff. <b>Spill</b> prevention should be part of a comprehensive Best Management Practice program to prevent runoff contamination. This program should also include storm water contamination assessment, flow diversion, record keeping, internal reporting, employee training, and preventive maintenance. Typically, most businesses and public agencies that generate hazardous waste and/or produce, transport, or store petroleum products are required by State and federal law to prepare <b>spill</b> control and cleanup plans. Therefore, a <b>Spill</b> Prevention and Response Plan may have already been developed as a result of other environmental regulatory requirements. Existing plans should be re-evaluated and revised to address storm water management issues. APPLICABILITY A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is applicable to facilities that transport, transfer, and/or store hazardous materials, petroleum products, or fertilizers that can contaminate storm water runoff. An important part of an effective <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is establishing a method for quick notification of the appropriate emergency response teams {{in the event of a}} <b>spill.</b> In some plants, each area or process may have a separate team leader and/or response team. Figure 1 illustrates a sample <b>spill</b> prevention team roster that can help in quick identification of <b>Spill</b> Prevention team leaders and their responsibilities. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES The advantages of an effective <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan include reducing storm water contamination and maintaining the water quality of the receiving water. <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plans are often good ways of standardizing procedures and employee training to decrease the likelihood of <b>spills.</b> <b>Spill</b> Prevention Planning can be limited by the following...|$|R
