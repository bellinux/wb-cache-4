It was recently found [21] that FSCs like ISCs, lack stable stromal cell contact and FSC daughter cells displace other FSCs within the same germarium indicating that the microenvironment of each FSC might be a niche and the intrinsic factors expressed by the FSCs regulate their asymmetric division and extracellular environment. In further studies [22] it has been stated that a number of signaling pathways may be involved in controlling FSC <b>self</b> – <b>renewal</b> and maintenance, however these signaling molecules are produced by distant cells which are also associated with regulating the fGSC niche, suggesting that specialized support cells don’t necessarily have to be in contact with their target stem cells to regulate the nice and its activity [20].|$|R

In this study, we examined the clinical significance of Skp 2, with a particular emphasis on overall survival (OS) and disease 鄄 free survival (DFS), in NPC cases in South China, where NPC is an epidemic. Additionally, we explored the function of Skp 2 in maintaining a cancer stem cell 鄄 like phenotype in NPC cell lines.

Skp 2 expression was detectable, or positive, in 75. 6 % of patients. Although there was no correlation between Skp 2 and any clinicopathologic factor, Skp 2 expression significantly portended inferior OS (P = 0. 013) and DFS (P = 0. 012).

The theory encompasses the trajectory of CFS from onset to chronicity, and in exceptional instances, recovery. Illness narratives were derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 19 adults, including 16 people affected with, and 3 people recovered from, CFS. Data was coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Analysis generated two parallel narratives that defined the illness experience of CFS: the narrative of the illness biographies and the narrative of self, specifically the struggling and diminished <b>self</b> seeking <b>renewal.</b> The illness biographies encompassed the stories of symptoms and their explanations, the encounters that ensued and their contentious milieu.

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Self</b> <b>renewal</b> in the {{hematopoietic system}} {{is thought to}} be {{restricted}} to a class of pluripotent stem cells. The capacity of cells with the properties of committed progenitors to self renew in many leukemias {{is thought to be}} an abnormal property resulting from the mutations responsible for leukemic transformation. It is not known how cells that can self-renew differ from cells that cannot. The notion that only pluripotent stem cells self renew has recently been challenged: normal committed erythroid progenitors capable of sustained <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> have been described. These cells, called SCF/TGFα progenitors, co-express the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase and c-ErbB, the avian receptor for epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor (TGF) α, and they undergo continuous <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> in response to TGFα and estradiol. In contrast, common erythroid progenitors (termed SCF progenitors) express only c-Kit and undergo a limited number of cell divisions in response to the c-Kit ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). Both types of progenitor faithfully reproduce terminal erythroid differentiation in vitro when exposed to differentiation factors. Here, we have investigated the developmental origin of these two classes of self-renewing erythroid progenitors. Results We show that SCF progenitors can develop into SCF/TGFα progenitors. This developmental conversion requires 10 – 14 days and is accompanied by a gradual up-regulation of bioactive TGFα receptor. Using sera depleted of endogenous growth factors, we demonstrate that the development of SCF progenitors into SCF/TGFα progenitors absolutely requires the simultaneous presence of SCF, TGFα and estradiol, and is strongly enhanced by an unknown activity in chicken serum. Conclusion SCF progenitors can be induced to develop into self-renewing SCF/TGFα progenitors. The development of <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> is triggered by specific combinations of growth factors and hormones. This has important implications for understanding leukemogenesis, as the <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> of leukemic cells may reflect the normal potential of certain committed progenitor cells and not, as has been thought, a unique abnormal property of leukemic cells...|$|E

40|$|The homeostatic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{compartment}} is comprised of quiescent long term self renewing stem cells and cycling short term stem cells with finite renewal potential. To study the molecular mechanisms governing <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> of hematopoietic cells we must force them to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. One approach to accomplish this goal is to damage the hematopoietic compartment with ionizing radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Such injuries ablate mature blood cells and drive the primitive stem cells into cycle. I have elected to use a simple model of hematopoietic damage and regeneration to study the molecular mechanisms controlling <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> in {{hematopoietic stem cell}}s. At {{the beginning of this}} project it was unclear whether the signaling pathways which homeostatically control <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> are utilized during injury repair. In particular, there is very little understanding of the signals required for regeneration after radiation damage. We hypothesized extracellular signal transduction pathways provided by the microenvironment are critical mediators of the stem cell repair process. To address these topics and extend the previous work generated in our laboratory, I chose to pursue a candidate approach focusing on the Wnt and Notch developmental signaling pathways. In order to examine the activation and requirement for each signaling cascade after radiation and chemotherapy damage we used a combination of loss of function and reporter mouse models. To this end, we have conducted the majority of experiments for the Wnt project in animals deficient in beta-catenin, the key transcription factor required in the pathway. Our investigations revealed the Wnt pathway is turned on within regenerating stem cells and loss of beta-catenin impairs regeneration of the stem cell compartment after both radiation and chemotherapy injury. Using a Transgenic Notch Reporter mouse to investigate the role of Notch signaling following hematopoietic damage we determined the Notch pathway is also activated during regeneration. Furthermore, using a live imaging approach we discovered Notch activated cells change their fate choice during regeneration. To determine if Notch gain of function provides radio-protection we infected stem cells with an active form of Notch prior to radiation and then scored <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> potential in vitro. This led us to the conclusion that Notch gain of function can provide a <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> benefit to irradiated hematopoietic stem cells. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Self</b> <b>renewal</b> {{of normal}} erythroid {{progenitors}} is {{induced by the}} receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB, whereas other receptors (c-Kit/Epo-R) regulate erythroid differentiation. To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of c-ErbB, we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family. Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA-binding, and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5 b in erythroblasts. In contrast, ligand activation of c-Kit was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells. Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5 b, but failed to induce reporter gene transcription. These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c-ErbB to cause sustained <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> in erythroid progenitors...|$|E
40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} (HSC) {{homeostasis}} {{depends on the}} balance between <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and lineage commitment, but what regulates this decision is not well understood. Using loss-of-function approaches in mice, we found that glycogen synthase kinase– 3 (Gsk 3) plays {{a pivotal role in}} controlling the decision between <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and differentiation of HSCs. Disruption of Gsk 3 in BM transiently expanded phenotypic HSCs in a β-catenin–dependent manner, consistent with a role for Wnt signaling in HSC homeostasis. However, in assays of long-term HSC function, disruption of Gsk 3 progressively depleted HSCs through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This long-term HSC depletion was prevented by mTOR inhibition and exacerbated by β-catenin knockout. Thus, GSK- 3 regulated both Wnt and mTOR signaling in mouse HSCs, with these pathways promoting HSC <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and lineage commitment, respectively, such that inhibition of Gsk 3 in the presence of rapamycin expanded the HSC pool in vivo. These findings identify unexpected functions for GSK- 3 in mouse HSC homeostasis, suggest a therapeutic approach to expand HSCs in vivo using currently available medications that target GSK- 3 and mTOR, and provide a compelling explanation for the clinically prevalent hematopoietic effects observed in individuals prescribed the GSK- 3 inhibitor lithium...|$|E

40|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{unprogrammed}} cells which possess plasticity and <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> capability. The term {{of stem cell}} was first used to describe cells committed to give rise to germline cells, and to describe proposed progenitor cells of the blood system [1]. A unique feature of stem cell is to remain quiescent in vivo in an uncommitted state. They serve as reservoir or natural support system to replenish cells lost due to disease, injury or aging. When triggered by appropriate signals these cells divide and may become specialized, committed cells; however being able to control this differentiation process still {{remains one of the}} biggest challenge in stem cell research [2]. The cell division of stem cells is a distinct aspect of their biology, since this division may be either symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric division takes place when the stem cells divides and forms two new daughter cells. Asymmetric division is thought to take place only under certain conditions where stem cells divides and gives rise to a daughter cell which remains primitive and does not proliferate, and one committed progenitor cell, which heads down a path of differentiation. Asymmetric division of stem cells helps reparative process, and also ensures that the stem cells pool does not decrease, whereas symmetric division is responsible for stem cells undergoing <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and proliferation.

Methods: miRCURY ™LNA microRNA inhibitor (anti-miR- 145 and anti-let 7 g) are a sequence-specific and chem-ically modified oligonucleotide that specifically target and knockdown miR- 145 and let 7 g miRNA molecules. Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) were isolated from umbilical cord blood and treated with LNAs. The effect of anti-miRNA transfection was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Real-time PCR showed that LNA was efficiently introduced into the cells and reduced miR 145 and Let 7 g expression levels to 40 % and 10 % in relation to corresponding scramble control, respectively. Gene ex-pression analysis as to <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and expansion showed more than 3. 5 fold up regulation in Oct 4 in cells treated with mir 145 inhibition. Similarly a significant up to 2. 5 fold up-regulation in Oct 4 and cMyc expression was observed in samples treated with anti-let 7 g. Conclusion: Suppression in differentiation inducing microRNAs (miR- 145 and let 7 g) can enhance the self re-newal and stemness status of USSCs at transcriptional level...|$|E
30|$|In {{the general}} sense, stem cells need {{to fulfill the}} {{following}} four criteria to be classed as stem cells; a. {{in order to maintain}} the stem cell population, stem cells should be capable of continuous <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> b. stem cell should have the ability to differentiate into a variety of mature cells c. stem cells should be able to integrate and differentiate into its source damaged site d. lastly, stem cells should have the ability to differentiate into mature cells of a tissue even if the tissue doesn’t suffer [2].|$|E
30|$|Management therapies {{attributed}} to tetraplegia and paraplegia involve {{the use of}} steroids, pain medications, surgery, bed rest, etc. [7, 8]. Stem cell therapy using neural stem cells (NSCs), adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), etc. has been investigated as a promising tool {{for the treatment of}} SCI [9]. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have a huge potential of <b>self</b> <b>renewal,</b> pluripotency and unlimited propagation [1, 10, 11]. In previous studies, the beneficial effects of hESC therapy have been reported in patients with chronic SCI [12].|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this mini-review, {{we focus}} on {{regulatory}} loops between nuclear receptors and microRNAs, an emerging class of small RNA regulators of gene expression. Evidence supporting interactions between microRNAs and nuclear receptors in the regulation of gene expression networks is discussed in relation to its possible role in neural stem cell <b>self</b> <b>renewal</b> and differentiation. Furthermore, we discuss possible disturbances of the regulatory loops between microRNAs and nuclear receptors in human neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we discuss the possible use of nuclear receptors as pharmacological entry points to regulate neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation...|$|E
