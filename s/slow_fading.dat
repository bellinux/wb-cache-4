60|$|He did not utter a cry or sound; he did {{not even}} tremble. He {{remained}} so rigid and motionless, clutching the banisters with his stiffened fingers, that when he did attempt to move, all life, as well as all that had made life possible to him, seemed to have died from him for ever. There was no nervous illusion, no dimming of his senses; he saw everything with a hideous clarity of perception. By some diabolical instantaneous photography of the brain, little actions, peculiarities, touches of gesture, expression and attitude never before noted by him in his wife, were clearly fixed and bitten in his consciousness. He saw the color of his friend's overcoat, the reddish tinge of his wife's brown hair, till then unnoticed; in that supreme moment he was aware of a sudden likeness to her mother; but more terrible than all, {{there seemed to be a}} nameless sympathetic resemblance that the guilty pair had to each other in gesture and movement as of some unhallowed relationship beyond his ken. He knew not how long he stood there without breath, without reflection, without one connected thought. He saw her suddenly put her hand on the handle of the door. He knew that in another moment they would pass almost before him. He made a convulsive effort to move, with an inward cry to God for support, and succeeded in staggering with outstretched palms against the wall, down the staircase, and blindly forward through the hall to the front door. As yet he had been able to formulate only one idea--to escape before them, for it seemed to him that their contact meant the ruin of them both, of that house, of all that was near to him--a catastrophe that struck blindly at his whole visible world. He had reached the door and opened it at the moment that the handle of the kitchen-door was turned. He mechanically fell back behind the open door that hid him, while it let the cruel light glimmer for a moment on their clasped figures. The door slipped from his nerveless fingers and swung to with a dull sound. Crouching still in the corner, he heard the quick rush of hurrying feet in the darkness, saw the door open and Demorest glide out--saw her glance hurriedly after him, close the door, and involve herself and him in the blackness of the hall. Her dress almost touched him in his corner; he could feel the near scent of her clothes, and the air stirred by her figure retreating towards the stairs; could hear the unlocking of a door above and the voice of her mother from the landing, his wife's reply, the <b>slow</b> <b>fading</b> of her footsteps on the stairs and overhead, the closing of a door, and all was quiet again. Still stooping, he groped for the handle of the door, opened it, and the next moment reeled like a drunken man down the steps into the street.|$|E

50|$|Phenolphthalein adopts four {{different}} states in aqueous solution: Under very strongly acidic conditions, {{it exists in}} protonated form, providing an orange coloration. Between strongly acidic and slightly basic conditions, the lactone form is colorless. The singly deprotonated phenolate form (the anion form of phenol) gives the familiar pink color. In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein's pink color undergoes a rather <b>slow</b> <b>fading</b> reaction and becomes completely colorless above 13.0 pH.

50|$|For example, {{the channel}} {{capacity}} for slow-fading channel is C = log2(1 + h2 SNR), where h is the fading coefficient and SNR is {{a signal to}} noise ratio without fading. As C is random, no constant rate is available. There may be a chance that information rate may go below to required threshold level.

50|$|A {{mobile handset}} which {{is moving in}} a cell will record a signal {{strength}} that varies. Signal strength is subject to <b>slow</b> <b>fading,</b> fast fading and interference from other signals, resulting in degradation of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I). A high C/I ratio yields quality communication. A good C/I ratio is achieved in cellular systems by using optimum power levels through the power control of most links. When carrier power is too high, excessive interference is created, degrading the C/I ratio for other traffic and reducing the traffic capacity of the radio subsystem. When carrier power is too low, C/I is too low and QoS targets are not met.|$|E

50|$|The {{documentary}} {{consists of}} current and historical shots alike and is being complimented by sketches and drawings of Swiss artist Agnes Barmettler. Explanatory commentary is being omitted deliberately, instead the shots are being strung together to a whole by the narration of eldest of Hótevilla, a village in Arizona. The eldest of the village pass {{on the history of}} their peoples, talking about the nonviolent resistance against the land expropriation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century and about the American authorities’ paternalism, due to which the natives’ traditions and way of life are being suppressed. The images refer to the present day and put the narrative not only into the North American but the global context.

5000|$|In 1922, A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young, {{then with}} the U.S. Navy Aircraft Radio Laboratory, noticed that a ship {{crossing}} the transmission path of a radio link produced a <b>slow</b> <b>fading</b> {{in and out of}} the signal. They reported this as a Doppler-beat interference with potential for detecting the passing of a vessel, but it was not pursued. In 1930, Lawrence A. Hyland. working for Taylor at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) noted the same effect from a passing airplane. This was officially reported by Taylor. Hyland, Taylor, and Young were granted a patent (U.S. No. 1981884, 1934) for a [...] "System for detecting objects by radio". It was recognized that detection also needed range measurement, and funding was provided for a pulsed transmitter. This was assigned to a team led by Robert M. Page, and in December 1934, a breadboard apparatus successfully detected an aircraft at a range of one mile.|$|E

50|$|Wurlitzer's {{first novel}} was the highly {{experimental}} and psychedelic Nog (1969) which {{was compared to}} the work of Thomas Pynchon. It was followed by the minimalist and Beckett influenced Flats in 1970. Quake, published in 1974, takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where mankind’s worst impulses are acted out in one long, unbroken narrative. 1984's <b>Slow</b> <b>Fade,</b> also dealing with Hollywood, is a portrait of an aging, once-brilliant film director attempting to make peace with his demons and his past. It has been suggested that <b>Slow</b> <b>Fade</b> was influenced by Wurlitzer's time with director Sam Peckinpah on the set of Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid, for which he wrote the screenplay. His most recent novel is The Drop Edge Of Yonder, which had its origins in a screenplay called Zebulon that had existed in various versions over the years. Directors Peckinpah, Hal Ashby, and Jim Jarmusch were all attached to the project at some point, but the film was never made. Jarmusch's film Dead Man is highly indebted to Wurlitzer's script, as several important themes were, in effect, lifted from Zebulon.|$|R
