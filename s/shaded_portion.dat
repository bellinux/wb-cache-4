40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Tree {{seedling}} {{establishment and}} growth were studied in experimental canopy gaps {{to determine the}} effect of structural and environmental heterogeneity on species dynamics within mature and old-growth Douglas-fir forests in the Cascades of central Oregon and southern Washington. Factors examined included forest age, gap size, within-gap position. substrate, year of germination, density of understory vegetation, shading by woody debris, light, moisture, and surface temperature. Four gap sizes, with gap diameter to tree height ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 0, were created in the fall of 1990. Seeds of Abies amabilis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga heterophylla were sown in controlled microsites and germination, survival, and growth were monitored for two growing seasons. Seedlings established from natural seed rain were also monitored in natural microsites. Seedling establishment was greater in gaps than in closed-canopy areas. but was relatively low in portions of large gaps exposed to direct solar radiation, particularly for Tsuga. Shade from woody debris facilitated establishment in exposed areas, while shade from understory vegetation aided establishment of Pseudotsuga but not of Tsuga. Establishment in <b>shaded</b> <b>portions</b> of gaps declined with vegetation cover, with a greater effect from herbs than from shrubs. Seedling establishment was greatest on decayed wood in closed-canopy areas and small gaps, was similar on mineral soil, litter, and wood in <b>shaded</b> <b>portions</b> of largest gaps, and was lowest on litter in exposed portions of large gaps. Species establishment patterns differed between years, apparently due to differences in weather. Seedling growth increased with gap size, and was greatest in gap centers. The growth response to increasing light was greatest for Tsuga. Some evidence for gap partitioning by seedlings was found, although all species were most abundant in similarly <b>shaded</b> <b>portions</b> of gaps. Establishment and growth of the different species was related to seed size and interacting gradients of above- and below-ground resource levels. Heterogeneity at the seedling scale often over-rode environmental gradients associated with gap size and within-gap position. While gaps may accelerate development of old-growth characteristics in these forests, establishment of Tsuga heterophylla is particularly sensitive to microsite quality...|$|R

50|$|Photovoltaic cell {{electrical}} output is extremely sensitive to shading. The {{effects of this}} shading are well known. When even {{a small portion of}} a cell, module, or array is shaded, while the remainder is in sunlight, the output falls dramatically due to internal 'short-circuiting' (the electrons reversing course through the <b>shaded</b> <b>portion</b> of the p-n junction). If the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell, the current (and so power) developed by the string is limited. If enough voltage is available {{from the rest of the}} cells in a string, current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the <b>shaded</b> <b>portion.</b> This breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts. Instead of adding to the power produced by the panel, the shaded cell absorbs power, turning it into heat. Since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell, one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string, disproportionately affecting panel output. For example, a shaded cell may drop 8 volts, instead of adding 0.5 volts, at a particular current level, thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells. It is, thus important that a PV installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions.|$|E

40|$|The Thermal Energy Storage (TES) {{experiments}} {{are designed to}} provide data to help researchers understand the long-duration microgravity behavior of thermal energy storage fluoride salts that undergo repeated melting and freezing. Such data, which have never been obtained before, have direct application to space-based solar dynamic power systems. These power systems will store solar energy in a thermal energy salt, such as lithium fluoride (LiF) or a eutectic of lithium fluoride/calcium difluoride (LiF-CaF 2) (which melts at a lower temperature). The energy will be stored as the {{latent heat of fusion}} when the salt is melted by absorbing solar thermal energy.

Four TES flight experiments will be used to obtain the needed experimental data.

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{heat pipe}} receiver {{designed for a}} solar dynamic space power system is described. The power system consists of a solar concentrator, solar heat receiver, Stirling heat engine, linear alternator and waste heat radiator. The solar concentrator focuses the sun's energy into a heat receiver. The engine and alternator convert a portion of this energy to electric power and the remaining heat is rejected by a waste heat radiator. Primary liquid metal heat pipes transport heat energy to the Stirling engine. Thermal energy storage allows this power system to operate during the <b>shade</b> <b>portion</b> of an orbit. Lithium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic is the thermal energy storage material. Thermal energy storage canisters {{are attached to the}} midsection of each heat pipe. The primary heat pipes pass through a secondary vapor cavity heat pipe near the engine and receiver interface. The secondary vapor cavity heat pipe serves three important functions. First, it smooths out hot spots in the solar cavity and provides even distribution of heat to the engine. Second, the event of a heat pipe failure, the secondary heat pipe cavity can efficiently transfer heat from other operating primary heat pipes to the engine heat exchanger of the defunct heat pipe. Third, the secondary heat pipe vapor cavity reduces temperature drops caused by heat flow into the engine. This unique design provides a high level of reliability and performance...|$|R

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to determine shading losses from trees to PV systems over both large regions using LiDAR, but also at an individual system level using sketchup.Most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the <b>shaded</b> <b>portion</b> of the array. The main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array, and cause fires.

In general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in Canada. Maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance {{over the life of the}} module.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of artificial satellite equipment, essentially, {{depends on its}} temperature condition, which {{in the case of}} low-Earth orbit varies quite widely.

The level of possible values of satellite temperature at different portions of low earth orbit can be estimated by the equilibrium temperature determined from the balance equation of heat flows, perceived and radiated by its surface. The analysis of heat flows, which act on the surface of an artificial satellite of conditional spherical shape, allows us to obtain the dependences, in order to find a satellite equilibrium temperature at different heights of its position above Earth's surface and an angle between the directions from the center of the Earth towards the Sun, and the satellite as it moves out of the shadow of the Earth and at different height of its position at the <b>shaded</b> <b>portion</b> of the orbit as well. These dependencies are used for graphing to show the changes of the equilibrium temperature of the low-Earth orbiting satellite.

Our model includes appropriate insolation cy-cles, realistic crater shapes, multiple scattering of sunlight and in-frared radiation, and depth- and temperature-dependent regolith thermophysical properties. Unshaded water ice deposits on the sur-face of either body are rapidly lost to thermal sublimation. A subsur-face water ice deposit is stable within 2 – latitude of the Moon’s poles.

40|$|The {{response}} of xylem pressure potential of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Engelm.) to environmental factors was {{studied in the}} natural subalpine environment. Data were analyzed {{in the context of}} a leaf water potential model based upon the van den Honert model for water transport through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. At soil temperatures of 10 to 15 C, xylem pressure potential decreased to about − 10 bars as the ratio of leaf to air absolute humidity difference to leaf diffusion resistance (an estimate of transpiration) increased. The potentials were slightly lower at all flux rates above zero when the soil temperature was 5 to 10 C, and at temperatures of 0 to 5 C the potentials decreased sharply to as low as − 20. 4 bars, even though the soil water supply was adequate. The relative viscosity of water and soil to leaf resistances for flow were compared for Engelmann spruce and citrus at low soil temperatures. These comparisons indicated that decreased root permeability was probably not an important factor causing higher stresses in spruce at 5 to 10 C, but for citrus, root permeability became limiting at soil temperatures as high as 13. 5 C. Xylem pressure potential was correlated with net radiation during the daytime when soil temperature was above 7 C. Under other conditions, however, xylem potential and net radiation apparently had a different relationship.

40|$|Leaf {{temperature}} is a physiological trait {{that can be}} used for monitoring plant water status. Nowadays, by means of thermography, canopy temperature can be remotely determined. In this sense, it is crucial to automatically process the images. In the present work, a methodology for the automatic analysis of frontal images taken on individual trees was developed. The procedure can be used when cameras take at the same time thermal and visible scenes, so it is not necessary to reference the images. In this way, during the processing in batch, no operator participated. The procedure was developed by means of a non supervised classification of the visible image from which the presence of sky and soil could be detected. In case of existence, a mask was performed for the extraction of intermediate pixels to calculate canopy temperature by means of the thermal image. At the same time, sunlit and shady leaves could be detected and isolated. Thus, the procedure allowed to separately determine canopy temperature either of the more exposed part of the canopy or of the <b>shaded</b> <b>portion.</b> The methodology developed was validated using images taken in several regulated deficit irrigation trials in Persimmon and two citrus cultivars (Clementina de Nules and Navel Lane-Late). Overall, results indicated that similar canopy temperatures were calculated either by means of the automatic process or the manual procedure. The procedure developed allows to drastically reduce the time needed for image analysis also considering that no operator participation was required. This tool will facilitate further investigations in course for assessing the feasibility of thermography for detecting plant water status in woody perennial crops with discontinuous canopies. Preliminary results reported indicate that the type of crop evaluated has an important influence in the results obtained from thermographic imagery. Thus, in Persimmon trees there were good correlations between canopy temperature and plant water status while, in Clementina de Nules and Navel Lane-Late citrus cultivars canopy temperature differences among trees could not be related with tree-to-tree variations in plant water status.

40|$|The {{importance}} of photosynthetic {{characteristics such as}} quantum efficiency or carboxylation efficiency for carbon gain of plants competing for light in dense stands is dependent on several environmental factors and structural features of the canopy. A quantitative analysis of photosynthesis of competing plants in mixed stands of wheat and wild oat (Avena fatua L.), a common weed of wheat, involved measuring photosynthetic parameters of individual leaves at different heights in the canopy throughout the growing season. This information combined with detailed assessments of canopy structure was used with a multispecies canopy model to evaluate the {{importance of}} different photosynthetic characteristics for carbon gain in this canopy environment. Independent photosynthesis data sets were used to validate predictions of the model. Carboxylation efficiency (CE) and CO 2 -and light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (AML) were highly correlated and decreased with depth in the canopy for both species. Quantum efficiency (agr) did not tend to decrease with depth in the canopy. Sensitivity analyses with the model for whole-plant carbon gain of each species over entire day periods were conducted. These showed that changes in CE and AML had an influence {{similar to that of}} changes in agr on carbon gain for both species. This was not necessarily expected from single-leaf photosynthetic behavior in response to changes in CE, AML and agr. The influence of agr is more pronounced in the lower, more <b>shaded</b> <b>portions</b> of the canopy than are changes in CE and AML. Appreciable differences between the species were apparent for carbon gain under different weather conditions.

To date, the spectral properties of leaves and panicles in crop canopies and the shadow effects on their spectral variation remain poorly understood due to the insufficient spatial resolution of traditional spectroscopy data. To address this issue, we used a near-ground imaging spectroscopy system with high spatial and spectral resolutions to examine the spectral properties of rice leaves and panicles in sunlit and <b>shaded</b> <b>portions</b> of canopies and evaluate the effect of shadows on the relationships between spectral indices of leaves and foliar chlorophyll content. The results demonstrated that the shaded components exhibited lower reflectance amplitude but stronger absorption features than their sunlit counterparts. Specifically, the reflectance spectra of panicles had unique double-peak absorption features in the blue region. Among the examined vegetation indices (VIs), significant differences were found in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) between leaves and panicles and further differences in the transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI) between sunlit and shaded components. After an image-level separation of canopy components with these two indices, statistical analyses revealed much higher correlations between canopy chlorophyll content and both PRI and TCARI of shaded leaves than for those of sunlit leaves. In contrast, the red edge chlorophyll index (CIRed-edge) exhibited the strongest correlations with canopy chlorophyll content among all vegetation indices examined regardless of shadows on leaves. These findings represent significant advances in the understanding of rice leaf and panicle spectral properties under natural light conditions and demonstrate the significance of commonly overlooked shaded leaves in the canopy when correlated to canopy chlorophyll content...|$|R
40|$|Utah, {{located in}} the arid southwest, is a state that {{experience}} s chronic water shortages. The pattern of valleys and high mountain ranges {{that exists in the}} state produces sharply contrasting differences in climatic conditions. Desert valleys in the western portion may receive as few a s 4 inches of precipitation in a year while headwater areas in the Wasatch Mountains receive 60 inches or more. Wide cyclic as well a s geographical variations of precipitation added to uneven seasonal distribution makes development and efficient utilization of water resource s vital though difficult. In order to make the most effective distribution and use of this precious water resource, the State of Utah is engaged in the preparation of a State Water Plan. The Utah Division of Water Resources, designated by the Utah Legislature to accept prime responsibility in this task, is cooperating with universities and other government agencies in this effort. As a basis f or planning and further development, an assessment of available water resources and the current stage of development is essential. To facilitate this assessment the area of the state has been divided geographically into several hydrologic study areas and sub-areas, shown in Figure 1. The Division of Water Resources, the U. S. Geological Survey, the Utah Water Research Laboratory, and other organizations are cooperating in making hydrologic studies and reports for these areas. To provide for uniformity in this state -wide effort, the following general procedures have been established : 1. Review existing land use data for each hydrologic area and determine their adequacy for meeting the needs of the water planning program. 2. Conduct field land-us e surveys for those areas where inadequate information is available in order to delineate the various land use categories f or each hydrologic area and sub-area. Summarize the acreage data for use in the water budget studies. 3. For each sub-area, determine t he quantity and quality of runoff. Also, assemble and prepare for computer processing relevant available data regarding the hydrology and climate of each area, together with appropriate maps and charts. 4. Investigate relationships between precipitation and runoff with respect to both time and space. In this regard, factors influencing runoff, such as physiography, geology, vegetative cover, slope, elevation, and aspect are evaluated. 5. Estimate all major depletions from the flow system of the area. 6. Prepare water budgets which account for the time and spatial distribution of the total water.

These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white <b>shading</b> across <b>portions</b> of the image.|$|R
50|$|Duckweed is not {{toxic to}} fish, but some {{scientists}} {{are concerned that}} it could suck oxygen out of the lake as it decays, asphyxiating large numbers of fish. Though officials say the weed hasn't harmed fish yet, it is putting {{a dent in the}} local fishing industry. The plant clogs the motors of small boats, making it impossible for fishers to launch their vessels. Duckweed further threatens the local ecosystem by choking out other plants as it <b>shades</b> large <b>portions</b> of the lake. In certain conditions, the weed may concentrate heavy metals and bacteria such as Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. Despite these problems, the weed may yet have some positive use; duckweed can be treated to be fed to poultry or to make paper.|$|R
5000|$|At {{an unknown}} date after the 2013 suspension, {{refurbishment}} {{of some of}} the 15Tr trolleybuses began, with around 30 being refurbished by 2016, when the system reopened. The work included modernisation of their front and rear ends and the replacement of the side windows with bonded, tinted ones. They had also been repainted in a new livery of overall white, except black around the windows, with a [...] "yellow flash" [...] along the side and blue <b>shading</b> on some <b>portions.</b>|$|R
