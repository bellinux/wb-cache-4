His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and <b>surplus</b> <b>butter</b> from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E
500|$|Unrest grew among Polish workers {{over the}} government's decision, and Jagielski {{negotiated}} with Wałęsa {{for six hours}} {{in the building of}} the Council of Ministers regarding the Saturday issue. Other talking points included Solidarity's exemptions from standard state censorship. The negotiations did not end the unrest, and Jagielski offered a compromise in an appearance on the Polish national television network, stating that the government would grant workers every other Saturday off, or give them all Saturdays free but add half an hour to each working day. He warned that Poland's economic troubles would increase should all Polish workers gain all Saturdays off from work, and he appealed to [...] "the patriotism of the people". Many Polish workers, though, stayed off work the following Saturday. In April Jagielski, described as a [...] "veteran negotiator", met with France's President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{and he was able to}} gain a pledge of $800 million in aid from France. That month, he was received by the United States's Secretary of State Alexander Haig and Vice President George H.W.

50|$|During the war all <b>surplus</b> <b>butter</b> {{was bought}} by the Commonwealth Government, but the war-time {{shortage}} of refrigerated ships necessitated the construction of emergency cold stores throughout Australia, to store accumulated butter supplies. Gladstone was chosen by the Australian Dairy Produce Control Board as a centre for an emergency cold store for butter and meat, and in 1941-42 a timber cold store was erected there for this purpose In 1946 the PCD purchased the Emergency Stores {{for a fraction of}} its original cost, and leased it to Swifts Meatworks for storing meat.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1979 European Parliament elections, Hord was {{selected}} as Conservative Party candidate for London West. The constituency included Labour-voting areas but in the election Labour performed poorly and Hord was elected with a comfortable majority. In February 1980 he made a speech in the European Parliament calling for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the internal exile of Andrei Sakharov; he attacked the European Commission's policy as [...] "incredibly absurd, arrogant, insensitive and inept". He also opposed the sale of <b>surplus</b> EEC <b>butter</b> to the Soviets, criticising Commission President Roy Jenkins for allowing the sale to happen after announcing that it had ceased.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1880s, the Queensland {{government}} promoted {{the establishment of}} dairying in Queensland as a commercial, rather than subsistence, activity. The development of dairying as a staple industry was considered a means of relieving selector poverty and debt, and as encouragement to closer settlement of the land. The Meat and Dairy Produce Act 1893 was introduced to offer subsidies to dairy farmers and a tax on cattle, the latter funding the establishment of creameries, cheese and butter factories throughout Queensland. In 1895, Queensland produced its first <b>butter</b> <b>surplus.</b>|$|R
40|$|Note:Until {{the last}} few years, Canada has never devoted much {{attention}} to the development of markets for her <b>surplus</b> creamery <b>butter.</b> Although this product has been exported in varying quantities since the introduction of mechanical refrigeration on steamships in 1897, the period of rapid growth prior to the war steadily reduced the volume available for export, until in 1913 this country imported six times as much as she exported. More recently, there has been a decided increase in butter production, not only in Ontario and Quebec, but also in the three Prairie Provinces. In the latter, the phenomenal growth of the dairy industry can be attributed largely {{to the development of a}} system of mixed farming, as a result of the poor returns from grain-growing after 1920. Thus these provinces, which not long ago imported butter, now manufacture nearly as much as is made in Ontario. Unlike the latter province, these provinces have few industrial centres to provide a home market, and are forced to seek a market for any surplus farther afield. [ [...] . ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} said that <b>surplus</b> <b>butter</b> from those living on the Deep Creek towards Darraweit Guim was carted to meet the {{transport}} wagons (either bullock or horse wagons) at the Toll Bar Corner for transport either to Melbourne or to the Goldfields in Bendigo. The early potatoes grown here were taken to the goldfields, north, rather than to Melbourne as today. In those days it was on the goldfields that the heavy concentration of population was to be found. The Stockdale family who settled at [...] "Oakdale" [...] in the 1850s and are still there, tell of produce going to the goldfields. Mrs Stockdale, snr was a Cummins of the Toll Bar, and the first of the family at [...] "Oakdale" [...] was born in 1858.|$|E
50|$|Butter-Powder Tilt is {{the price}} {{adjustment}} strategy in United States, which requires USDA to support the farm price of milk at $9.90 per cwt. by standing ready to purchase <b>surplus</b> <b>butter,</b> cheese and nonfat dry milk when wholesale prices for these commodities fall below administratively set levels. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1501) allows USDA to adjust the government purchase price of butter and nonfat dry milk twice annually {{in order to better}} manage its inventories of surplus milk products and minimize government costs. However, whenever the purchase price of one commodity is reduced by USDA, it must increase the purchase price of the other commodity so that the overall support price of milk remains at $9.90 per cwt. This price adjustment {{is referred to as the}} butter-powder tilt.|$|E

The decade began with a large milk surplus and low prices and ended with milk shortages and record high prices.

50|$|While Denmark, the 'Larder of Europe', {{produced}} massive {{quantities of}} bacon, eggs and dairy products, this was {{heavily dependent on}} imports of fertilizer from Britain. Before very long, livestock was being slaughtered {{because of a lack}} of fodder - the pigs so undernourished that they broke their legs walking to slaughter. Danish farmers paid large taxes, and merchant sailors were driven to work as labourers in Germany because of the blockade. Likewise the Netherlands, with its 2.7m cattle, 650,000 sheep, half a million pigs, and huge <b>surplus</b> of <b>butter,</b> cheese, meat, milk, margarine and vegetable oils, depended on Britain for its animal fodder. Much of the arable land had been ruined by opening the dikes during the Nazi invasion and many farmers refused to sell the Germans cattle, but soon there was such a meat shortage that the authorities had to confiscate bootlegged dog-meat sausages. Because the Germans forced Dutch fishermen to return to port before dark there was also a shortage of fish, and although Dutch overseas possessions were among the world's main providers of tobacco, it could not breach the blockade. Steel, iron and wood were so hard to obtain that the work of rebuilding Rotterdam came to a standstill.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} the demand for butter in Canada has {{decreased}} resulting in a <b>surplus</b> of <b>butter.</b> In 1965 the per capita consumption of butter in Canada was 8. 23 Kg which decreased by about 70 % to 2. 66 Kg in 1994. Previous research indicates that consumers are switching from butter to margarine due to concerns about heart disease and high cholesterol levels in butter. Therefore, a market {{study was conducted in}} Montreal to estimate the potential demand for a new product called "modified" butter which would create 50 % less cholesterol in the body than regular butter. When the concept of "modified" butter was introduced, out of 157 respondents about 80 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} they would buy "modified" butter. Also, the total quantity of margarine demanded in a month decreased by 47 % and the regular butter demand decreased by 85 %. The market share of "modified" butter comes to about 67 %. The average of the price that the consumers are willing to pay for a kilogram of "modified" butter is $ 7. 50. A detailed cost analysis shows that the production cost of ``modified'' butter at the experimental level is high, but the average costs show a decreasing trend when the scale of production is increased. If the economies of scale were to continue along the derived cost curves, 7 tons of "modified" butter would have to be produced to reach the break-even point of $ 7. 50 /Kg cost of production. This shows the industrial potential of producing large quantities of ``modified'' butter by taking advantage of the economies of scale. Furthermore, the overall sales of butter (regular butter plus ``modified'' butter) would increase by about 25 % which would boost the consumption of butter in Canada...|$|R
