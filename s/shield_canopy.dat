40|$|In {{conjunction}} with steady increases in production levels, longwall operators have applied greater quantities of ventilating air and spray water {{in an effort}} to control respirable dust and/or methane. Air velocities greater than 7. 6 mls (1500 fpm) have been measured on longwall faces. Operators have expressed concern over the potential entrainment of respirable dust at these high velocities. The greatest likelihood for entraining dust into the high velocity airstream may occur as shields are advanced allowing relatively dry particles to fall from the <b>shield</b> <b>canopy</b> directly into the airstream. Laboratory tests to simulate dust liberation during shield movement were conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH at velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 8. 2 m/s (400 to 1600 fpm). Airborne dust samples were obtained with personal impactors to quantify the size distribution and concentration of the dust entrained at the various air velocities. Statistically significant increases in both total and respirable dust concentrations were measured as test air velocities were increased...|$|E
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Bureau of Mines geomechanics research program {{is to develop a}} better understanding of support behavior and interaction of supports with the strata so that supports can be more closely engineered to the geological conditions in which they are employed. Four longwall shield supports were instrumented with an eight-transducer instrumentation array to measure leg, canopy capsule, and compression lemniscate link forces from which resultant shield loading was determined. The instrumented supports were monitored over a 4 -month period, producing over 75 shield cycles of resultant shield loading. Resultant loading is the true measure of support resistance, providing both roof-to-floor and face-to-waste support reactions as well as the location of the reaction on the <b>shield</b> <b>canopy.</b> Observed roof support reactions were analyzed, with particular emphasis on horizontal shield loading, since it is the least understood design parameter. Average, peak, and change in shield loading during the mining cycle are discussed. Correlations among data parameters are examined, as is the distribution of support loading at the headgate and midface. Conclusions are drawn as to the effectiveness of the shield support at this installation. Recommendations are made for further research needs...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} Bureau of Mines {{research to}} develop methods to evaluate loading on longwall roof supports to permit better design {{and more efficient}} utilization of these structures {{in compliance with the}} geological conditions in which they are employed. The resultant vertical and horizontal force acting on the canopy of a shield can be determined, either from a statically determinate solution assuming rigid-body mechanics and elimination of certain unknowns, or from an elastic solu-tion by analysis of the load-displacement relationship of the shield structure. A two-dimensional rigid-body model is presented that determines resultant shield forces by measurement of leg, canopy capsule, and lemniscate link forces. An elastic solution is presented, {{in the form of an}} elastic stiffness model with two degrees of freedom, which describes the load-displacement relationship from the stiffness of the shield structure as determined in the Bureau's Mine Roof Simulator (MRS). The ability of both models to determine resultant forces acting on the <b>shield</b> <b>canopy</b> are evaluated from full-scale tests in the MRS. More advanced numerical models are also discussed as part of the Bureau's continuing effort in the evaluation of roof support structures...|$|E

30|$|Almost 10  years {{after the}} first fatal burst, the seventh {{longwall}} panel was being retreated at Mine A under almost 840  m of cover (MSHA 2006). Bounces were common along the longwall face, ranging from thumps in the roof or floor to coal being blown from the face. These events occurred all along the longwall face, but were most common near the headgate and tailgate entries. “Bounce procedures” were in place to protect the workers by limiting access to the face when the shearer was near the gate entries and specifying that shearer operators should position themselves behind the 8  m long deflector shields mounted above the shearer. The deflector shields were hinged off the shearer frame to be lowered or raised to accommodate mining clearance. In addition, expanded metal guards were attached to the armored face conveyor periodically along the walkway, and sheets of conveyor belting were suspended {{from the bottom of}} <b>shield</b> <b>canopies</b> along the walkway.|$|R
40|$|The U. s. Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research {{to optimize the}} utilization and design of mine roof support systems. This report describes methods to evaluate resultant loading on longwall shields, defined as external resultant vertical and horizontal force acting on the canopy and base. Four models are considered: two rigid-body models, an elastic model, and a numerical model. The rigid-body models equate measured internal shield forces to unknown external resultant shield forces (loads) through rigid-body analysis of static equilibrium requirements. The elastic model develops a solution to shield mechanics by evaluation of the load-displacement relationship and stiffness characteristics of the support structure. The numerical model is a two-dimensional finite-element representation of a shield structure. Model determination of resultant shield loading is compared to controlled loading of a shield in the Bureau's mine roof simulator. Parameters investigated are <b>shield</b> height, <b>canopy</b> contact configuration, canopy and base horizontal constrainment, and boundary conditions imposed by vertical and horizontal shield displacements. It is concluded that rigid-body models are most applicable to in situ measurement of shield loading. Applications requirements and potential error sources are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the weight}} of {{overburden}} is sustained by both the backfill body and the unmined solid coal in coal mining with compacted backfilling (CMCB) panels, the stress and deformation characteristics of the surrounding rocks in coal mining are radically changed. The overburden movement control mechanism by coordinating with backfill body and shield in CMCB was studied systematically in this paper. Based on the analysis of deformational and structural characteristics of surrounding rock in CMCB panels, the methods of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and engineering test are employed. The {{results show that the}} fracture of the main roof is mainly controlled by the filling ratio φ and is non-correlated to the shield supporting pressure p. However, p has a significant control effect on the deflection of roof within the <b>shield</b> <b>canopy</b> length, and adversely affects the filling ratio. With the increase of the filling ratio of the gob, the maximum sagging of the immediate and the main roofs, the peak front and the influence range of the abutment pressures are gradually reduced. Correspondingly, the stable period of internal pressure of backfill body in the gob is shortened. Engineering practice shows that the sagging of the gob roof, the distribution of the abutment pressure, the distribution of the internal pressure in the backfill body, and the ground surface sagging results obtained by the in-situ measurement are approximately corresponding to the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the design of}} longwall shields, focusing on those geotechnical aspects that are critical to either their success or failure during longwall extraction. The driver for {{the paper is the}} recognition that in many instances, longwall shields are assessed and designed along similar lines to that of roadway ground support systems, namely according to typical or normal geotechnical conditions. However the paper will contend that for longwall shields, this is inappropriate as unlike roadway ground support systems, longwall shields cannot be supplemented with additional or secondary support in localised areas of adverse geotechnical conditions. In other words, the longwall shield needs to be designed according to what are judged to be worst case or adverse geotechnical conditions, the outcome being that a well-designed shield will be significantly over-rated for the majority of its working life. However it will be argued that the additional capital cost of such shield design can be readily justified as a prudent risk-based outcome that is essential to minimising future business risks due to strata instability on the longwall face. Shield geometry is discussed including such relevant factors as leg angle, inclination of the top caving <b>shield,</b> <b>canopy</b> ratio, operating height range and tip to face distance, these all being well established longwall shield design considerations and most importantly, areas whereby inadequate design can render a longwall shield highly ineffective. The issue of tip to face distance is considered in detail, in particular the extent by which it is an important geotechnical design consideration. The critical importance of maximising set to yield ratio within practical operating limits is discussed. Overall the aim of the paper is to provide industry with a set of suggested guidelines for future use when designing longwall shields and hopefully to initiate discussion on a subject that unlike roadway ground support design is not well covered in its entirety in the published technical literature...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a historic {{overview of the}} role of mobile roof support (MRS) technologies in improving stability and worker safety and presents the results of recent field evaluations of the MRS load rate monitoring device and other remote deformation-monitoring techniques. Field studies were implemented at two sites in cooperation among researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Maleki Technologies, Inc., and J. H. Fletcher & Co. The objective of the field programs were to (1) study the interaction between MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s and coal mine strata and (2) develop and test suitable monitoring systems for assessing roof and pillar stability. An MRS consists of a roof canopy, four hydraulic cylinders, a caving <b>shield</b> <b>canopy,</b> and associated electromechanical systems mounted on crawler tracks. The machines are controlled by radio from a remote location and operate on self-contained power units. Typically, MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have capacities of 5, 340 and 7, 120 kN (600 and 800 tons). In comparison to posts, an MRS is capable of maintaining the yield load after significant amounts of roof-floor deformation. Because the mining cycle is accelerated, MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s help reduce the potential for time-dependent roof falls. MRS performance has been monitored in the laboratory under controlled static loading conditions and in the field under deep, two-seam mining conditions. Laboratory studies have quantified support capacity and system stiffness as a function of machine height. Field investigations have focused on determination of optimum operating conditions and development of warning systems that indicate excessive load on the machine and/or impending roof-pillar stability problems. Analyses of field data show that roof instabilities are influenced by (1) pillar failure, (2) pillar yielding, (3) mine seismicity, (4) geologic structures, and (5) panel layout designs and mining practice. Pillar yielding and failure (unloading) and seismicity can be conveniently monitored by the load rate monitoring device, but for consistent detection of roof falls, additional deformation measurements directly within the cuts are needed...|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} raptor reproduction in response to land-use change in sub-Saharan Africa, hampering conservation efforts to address regional declines. To further our understanding of mechanisms underlying the dramatic declines of West African raptors, we {{examined the relationship between}} environmental conditions, nest density, and measures of reproduction in the Grasshopper Buzzard (Butastur rufipennis). Analyses were based on 244 nest sites divided between transformed and natural habitat in northern Cameroon. At the landscape scale, nest density increased with the density of preferred nest trees. Nests were more widely spaced in transformed than in natural habitat. Dispersion was adjusted to differences in availability of small mammals, which was negatively associated with distance to nearest neighbor, and in the area under cultivation, which was positively associated with distance to nearest neighbor. Productivity was positively associated with rainfall, <b>canopy</b> <b>shielding</b> the nest, availability of grasshoppers, and the nest's visibility from ground level; <b>canopy</b> <b>shielding,</b> grass cover, rainfall, and distance to nearest neighbor were positively associated with nest success. In natural habitat, losses of eggs and nestlings to natural predators were greater than in transformed habitats, while losses through human predation were small. Productivity and nest success were unaffected by land use because of the opposing effects of greater predation pressure, closer spacing of nests, and more food in natural habitat than in transformed habitat. Thus transformed habitat may provide adequate breeding habitat for the Grasshopper Buzzard, but declining rainfall and intensifying anthropogenic land use are likely to affect future reproductive outpu...|$|R

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report investigates shield {{mechanics}} and component stress {{development in a}} two-legged longwall <b>shield</b> for unsymmetric <b>canopy</b> and base contact configurations. Previous studies analyzed shield behavior for symmetric contact configurations. The goals of these efforts are to improve longwall support selection and design. This study provides vital information that will help develop improved procedures for performance testing of longwall supports and will benefit future research to improve support design through stress optimization and evaluation of failure mechanisms. Combinations of six canopy (three symmetric and three unsymmetric) and six base (four symmetric and two unsymmetric) contacts provided a total of 36 configurations for evaluation. Of these 36 configurations, 10 were eliminated because of fixture limitations or shield instability. Controlled vertical and horizontal displacements were applied by the Bureau's mine roof simulator to the remaining 26 configurations. Component responses were determined from pressure transducer and strain gage instrumentation {{in order to identify}} contact configurations and boundary displacements that produced maximum loading in each of the support components. This report describes these test results and provides conclusions relevant to critical contact configurations for performance testing of longwall supports...|$|R
30|$|Sphagna {{are crucial}} in forming and {{sustaining}} peatlands—specific ecosystems that maintain a unique diversity of habitats and species (Clymo and Hayward 1982; Vitt 2000; Rydin et al. 2006; Rydin and Jeglum 2006) and {{function as a}} large store of organic carbon, particularly in boreal and subarctic areas (Gorham 1991; Limpens et al. 2008). As {{a key component of}} the ecosystem, they affect many processes within it; therefore, the changes triggered in Sphagna by a changing environment may be reflected in the entire ecosystem. This is important, as they are also susceptible to changes in the environment, including shifts in UVB and temperature regime (e.g. Dorrepaal et al. 2003; Huttunen et al. 2005; Wiedermann et al. 2007; Gignac 2011), principally due to their specific structure (leaves of one cell layer, absence of waxes or any other protective surface structures). In open peatlands, Sphagnum mosses are not <b>shielded</b> by tree <b>canopies</b> and can be exposed to high levels of UVB irradiance. Given the importance of Sphagna for the sustainability of peatlands, considering recent increased solar UVB irradiance (Weatherhead et al. 2005) and elevated temperatures at high latitudes (Jylhä et al. 2004; McBean 2005), it is essential that we understand how both these factors affect peat mosses.|$|R
