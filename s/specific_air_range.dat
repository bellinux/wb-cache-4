5000|$|The P180 {{is said to}} {{have good}} fuel {{efficiency}} relative to small turbojets flying in the same speed and altitude range. Flight International stated: [...] "The Avanti has no direct turboprop competitors, its closest jet rivals are the Raytheon Premier I and the Cessna Citation CJ2+ ... Piaggio says low-drag laminar flow is maintained to around 50% of the wing chord, compared with around 20-25% for conventional tractor turboprops where propeller wash disturbs the airflow over the wing... <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> <b>range</b> at high altitude is 3.4km/kg (0.84nm/lb) compared with around 2km/kg (0.49nm/lb) for current jets or 2.7km/kg (0.67nm/lb) for other turboprops." [...] By this estimate, mileage is 70% better per fuel unit than comparable jet aircraft, although this greater efficiency is achieved only at a relatively slow 315 KTAS and FL410. P180 Avanti II Specifications now show slightly lower numbers for specific range of 3.1 km/kg (0.76 nm/lb).|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} using multidisciplinary design optimization on the retrofitting of an outboard morphing-wing system to an existing conventionally designed commercial passenger jet. Initial studies focusing on the single objective of <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> <b>range</b> improvement {{for a number of}} flight phases revealed increases of approximately 4 – 5 % over the baseline aircraft with wing fences across each case. This validated the advantage of reoptimizing the geometric schedules for off-design conditions in comparison with fixed winglets, for which negative effects were observed. Because of the high number of design sensitivities of the outboard wing geometry, it has now become necessary to conduct refined studies to analyze the effects of the wing system on additional operational performance metrics, such as takeoff, initial climb, approach climb, and landing performance parameters, to ascertain a truly holistic representation of the benefits of morphing-wing technology. In addition, further effort has been expended to couple the effects of each phase within a multi-objective framework. Thus, refined {{studies have been}} performed, incorporating a number of multi-objective optimization methods into a high-end, low-fidelity aerostructural-control analysis together with a full engine model and integrated operational performance algorithm. Furthermore, updated aeroelastic functionality and improved aerostructural wing sizing allows for investigation of C-wing configurations. Results reveal the potential for significant field-length reductions and climb-performance enhancements while maintaining improvements in cruise performance throughout the entire flight envelope and across multiple stage lengths...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{concern over}} the {{potential}} harmful effects of green house gas emissions from various sources has motivated the consideration of an aircraft certification standard as one way to reduce aircraft C 02 emissions and mitigate aviation impacts on the climate. In order to develop a commercial aircraft certification standard, a fuel efficiency performance metric and the condition at which it is evaluated must be determined. The fuel efficiency metric form of interest to this research is fuel/range, where fuel and range can either be evaluated {{over the course of}} a reference mission or at a single, instantaneous point. A mission-based metric encompasses all phases of flight and is robust to changes in technology; however, definition of the reference mission requires many assumptions and is cumbersome for both manufacturers and regulators. An instantaneous metric based on fundamental aircraft parameters measures the fuel efficiency performance of the aircraft at a single point, greatly reducing the complexity of the standard and certification process; however, a single point might not be robust to future changes in aircraft technology. In this thesis, typical aircraft operations are assessed in order to develop evaluation assumptions for a mission-based metric, Block Fuel divided by Range (BF/R), and an instantaneous metric, incremental fuel burn per incremental distance (inverse <b>Specific</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Range</b> (1 /SAR)). Operating patterns and fuel burn maps are used to demonstrate the importance of mission range on fleet fuel burn, and thus the importance of a properly defined range evaluation condition for BF/R. An evaluation condition of 40 % of the range at Maximum Structural Payload (MSP) limited by Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) is determined to be representative for the mission-based metric. A potential evaluation condition for 1 /SAR is determined to be optimal speed and altitude for a representative mid-cruise weight defined by half of the difference between MTOW and Maximum Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW). To demonstrate suitability as a potential surrogate for BF/R, correlation of 1 /SAR with BF/R is shown for the current fleet, and a case study of potential future aircraft technologies is presented to show the correlation of improvements in the 1 /SAR metric with improvements in BF/R. by Brian M.

40|$|Purpose: Regional lung volume {{change as}} a {{function}} of lung inflation serves as an index of parenchymal and airway status as well as an index of regional ventilation and can be used to detect pathologic changes over time. In this article, we propose a new regional measure of lung mechanics [...] - the <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> volume change by corrected Jacobian. Methods: 4 DCT and Xe-CT data sets from four adult sheep are used in this study. Nonlinear, 3 D image registration is applied to register an image acquired near end inspiration to an image acquired near end expiration. Approximately 200 annotated anatomical points are used as landmarks to evaluate registration accuracy. Three different registration-based measures of regional lung mechanics are derived and compared: the <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> volume change calculated from the Jacobian (SAJ); the <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> volume change calculated by the corrected Jacobian (SACJ); and the <b>specific</b> <b>air</b> volume change by intensity change (SAI). Results: After registration, the mean registration error is on the order of 1 mm. For cubical ROIs in cubes with size 20 mm × 20 mm × 20 mm, the SAJ and SACJ measures show significantly higher correlation (linear regression, average r^ 2 = 0. 75 and r^ 2 = 0. 82) with the Xe-CT based measure of specific ventilation (sV) than the SAI measure. For ROIs in slabs along the ventral-dorsal vertical direction with size of 150 mm × 8 mm × 40 mm, the SAJ, SACJ, and SAI all show high correlation (linear regression, average r^ 2 = 0. 88, r^ 2 = 0. 92 and r^ 2 = 0. 87) with the Xe-CT based sV without significant differences when comparing between the three methods. Conclusion: Given a deformation field by an image registration algorithm, significant differences between the SAJ, SACJ, and SAI measures were found at a regional level compared to the Xe-CT sV in four sheep that were studied...|$|R

40|$|Pouco se sabe sobre as necessidades de potência do ventilador, com o tempo, na na compostagem do {{material}} em leiras estáticas aeradas. Objetivou-se, com a realização deste trabalho, ajustar curvas de variação na pressão estática do ar, quando forçado em pilhasde material orgânico em diferentes estádios de degradação bioquímica. Para a condução do mesmo, montou-se uma pilha de compostagem com bagaço de cana-de-açúcar (BC) e cama de frango (CF), preparando-se a mistura de forma a se obter uma relação C/N inicial de 30 / 1. O material foi revolvido a cada três dias, durante o primeiro mês e a cada cinco dias, nos dois meses posteriores. No BC, nas condições tal como foi utilizado na mistura, e {{no material}} da mistura BC + CF, nas condições em que se encontravam após 30, 60 e 90 dias de compostagem, foi medida a perda de carga, em 1 m de altura de coluna. Quanto maior a vazão específica de ar e o tempo de degradação bioquímica do material, maior foi o decréscimo na pressão estática do ar nele insuflado. O modelo de Shedd se ajustou bem aos dados experimentais, na faixa de vazão específica de ar investigada, podendo ser usado parapredizer os gradientes de pressão estática no composto orgânico. Little {{is known about}} the power requirements of the exhaust fan throughout the composting period of a forced aeration systems. This study was conducted in order to adjust the variation curves for static air pressure, when forced into piles of organic material atdifferent biochemical degradation stages. To that end, a composting pile with both sugarcane bagasse (BC) and poultry litter (CF) was stacked, by preparing the mixture {{in such a way as}} to obtain an initial C/N ratio of 30 / 1. The material was revolved every threedays during the first month, followed by revolutions at regular 5 -day intervals for two more months. Load loss was measured at 1 m column height for the BC under the same conditions used in the mixture, as well as in the BC + CF mixture under the conditions at 30, 60 and 90 days of composting.
