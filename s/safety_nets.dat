5|$|The lower tier of the Southern Stand is {{reserved}} for away supporters, {{with most of the}} stand being seated. The western part of the stand, however, is converted into terracing for domestic league games. The area reserved for away supporters varies from game to game depending on how many away fans are expecting: the allocation's size is altered by restricting access to and from the area with large <b>safety</b> <b>nets,</b> which are laid across the seating and supervised by stewards. The away section is small for most Allsvenskan matches, with the most notable exceptions being matches against Helsingborgs IF, AIK, Djurgårdens IF, and IFK Göteborg. These matches tend to draw larger away attendances, and the away area is therefore accordingly expanded across the entire lower tier of the Southern Stand.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{illness is}} common in childhood, and it is {{difficult}} for healthcare professionals to distinguish seriously ill children from the vast majority with minor or self-limiting illnesses. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> provides parents with advice on when and where to return if their child deteriorates, and it is widely recommended that parents of acutely sick young children should be given <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice. Yet little is known about how and when this is given. We aimed to understand what <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice first contact clinicians give parents of acutely sick young children, how, when, and why. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. Interviews and focus groups were held with doctors and nurses in a general practice surgery, a District General Hospital emergency department, a paediatric emergency department, and an out-of-hours service. Data were analysed using the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: Sixteen clinicians participated. They described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice includes advising parents what to look for, when and where to seek help. How <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was delivered and whether it was verbal or written was inconsistent, and no participants described being trained in this area. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> appeared to be rarely documented, and was left to individual preference. Limitations of written materials, and structural barriers to the provision of <b>safety</b> <b>netting,</b> were perceived. Participants described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was influenced by clinicians' experience, confidence, time and knowledge; and perceived parental anxiety, experience, and competence. Participants noted several limitations to <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> including not knowing if it has been understood by parents or been effective; parental difficulty interpreting information and desire for face-to-face reassurance; and potential over-reassurance. CONCLUSION: First contact clinicians employ a range of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> techniques, with inconsistencies within and between organisations. Structural changes, clinician training, and documentation in patient notes may improve <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> provision. Research is needed into the optimal components of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice so that clinicians can consistently deliver the most effective advice for parents.

As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles.
