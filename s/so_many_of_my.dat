500|$|Described as Andrew Schwab's opus {{the record}} {{promises}} to be a fresh take on the P86 sound. Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really able to take the reins of the creative process in a direction I was passionate about. I was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what its about. I am really looking forward to people hearing this album." [...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Quezón {{returned}} to the Philippines she was voted a pension of 1,000 pesos a month by the Philippine Congress. She returned the check, explaining: [...] "I feel that on account of ... countless war widows and orphans ... I should waive collection of a pension [...] [...] [...] I cannot, in good conscience, receive ... Government assistance when <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> less fortunate sisters and their children are not yet taken care of[...] [...] I know [...] I would not be keeping faith with the memory of my beloved husband[...] [...] [...]" [...] This act, it was said, [...] "demonstrated why thousands of Filipinos regard her as a combination queen-mother and patron saint". Quezón was offered a slot in the Liberal Party senatorial slate for the 1946 elections, which she declined. She however endorsed the presidential candidacy of Manuel Roxas, who defeated her husband's vice-president and successor, Sergio Osmeña, to win the presidency.|$|E

Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, [...] "She [...] {{has been a}} big influence on me." [...] She later told USA Today that [...] "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [...] Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with Good Morning America on February 13, 2012, saying [...] "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her." [...] Beyoncé told the Globe and Mail that Houston [...] "inspired [...] to get up there and do what [...] did". She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, [...] "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [...] Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." ...|$|E

5000|$|In March 2016, a Human Rights Now! report {{highlighted}} the {{negative aspects of}} Japan's pornographic industry. This caused a backlash among several Japanese pornographic performers, among them Hatsumi, who said: [...] "At least in my own eyes, the current industry is very clean.

We have survived wounds, starvation, shell-shock, poison gas and fire, the diseases of war, the awful toil of the trenches. And {{each and every one}} of us who has served long bears in his mind the particular horror that haunts him. I have known veterans to go mad at the screaming of shells. I have seen good soldiers stand upon a trench, inviting the fire that would end suspense. For a man who hopes to escape alive this war is indeed the ninth circle of hell.|$|R

6000|$|The celebrity which Goldsmith had {{acquired}} by his poem of The Traveler, occasioned a resuscitation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his miscellaneous and anonymous tales and essays {{from the various}} newspapers and other transient publications in which they lay dormant.

But God hath not created all alike; neither hath he afforded equal chances for knowledge to the peasant and the noble. I have vexed my spirit too often, with arguments on this very subject, with the great and learned, not to bear a little with the ignorance of the vulgar.

6000|$|I find, on examination, that my [...] "David Copperfield" [...] is more {{dilapidated}} {{than any}} other novel upon my shelves.

"He is," [...] said Etherington, [...] "or, at least, has the {{reputation}} of being, I am sorry to say, a near--a very near relation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own--in fact, a brother by the father's side, but illegitimate.--My father was fond of him--I loved him also, for he has uncommonly fine parts, and is accounted highly accomplished.

He is a man extremely plausible, both in speech and manners; so much <b>so,</b> that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends think there is more vice than insanity in the irregularities which he commits; but I may, I hope, be forgiven, if I have formed a milder judgment of one supposed to be my father's son.

I first saw London when I was between eight and nine years old, and then lived in or near it for the whole of the next ten, and more there than anywhere else for seven years longer. Since then I have hardly ever been a year without seeing the place, and have often lived in it for a considerable time. There I grew from childhood to be a man. My little Brothers and Sisters, and since, my Mother, died and are buried there. There I first saw your Mamma, and was there married. It seems as if, in some strange way, London were a part of Me or I of London. I think of it often, not as full of noise and dust and confusion, but as something silent, grand and everlasting.|$|R
