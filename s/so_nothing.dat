5|$|The major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 concentrated on the building and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it.

25|$|In December 1981, Guth read a {{paper from}} Moscow {{physicist}} Andrei Linde {{saying that the}} whole universe is within just one bubble, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with Linde, who had independently been working on bubble inflation, but without considering the flatness problem. Linde and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of {{preparing}} his case, Aguirre began monitoring Manville in October 1981, when the company undertook a reorganization that moved 75% of its assets to four of five new companies it created. The {{board of directors and}} officers remained in the same positions, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> essential changed; except the assets were diverted. Aguirre became convinced Manville was trying to put its assets beyond the reach of unsecured creditors and when he went to trial, he accurately predicted the company would file between 45 and 60 days.|$|E

25|$|During the {{majority}} of 2004, the band {{spent most of their}} time recording their debut album. During the first part of 2005, the band toured extensively with New Found Glory. In June 2005, Eisley embarked on their first headlining tour, The Summer Scenic Tour, to support their debut album Room Noises with Lovedrug and Pilotdrift as opening acts. On June 10, they performed a sold out show at The Troubadour in California. The recording of The Troubadour show was to be released as a live DVD; however, the band was not pleased with the footage or audio <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> ever came of it.|$|E
25|$|Adaptational comics {{are still}} the source of controversies and debates. Although {{in most cases the}} art was beautiful, the panels were heavily packed with {{narrative}} texts – a trademark of Tibor Cs. Horváth. By the early sixties this comics type fell into a trap from which it could not escape until recent times. On one hand intellectuals criticized these works for the lack of originality, novelty and artistry, while another major accusation was that comics in general restrict reading habits. However, adaptational comics provided a safe relationship with the cultural-political leadership, and were still popular, comic book import was close to zero, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> forced comic artists to move on further.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{activities}} of Carthage between 405 and 397 BC, during which time Dionysius had muscled his way through Sicily and had already broken an existing treaty by making war on the Sicels. Carthage may have been weakened by the plague brought over from Sicily in 405. When Motya was put under siege and most cities in Sicily broke free of Carthaginian control, Carthage sent the aforementioned naval force under Himilco, which achieved nothing. Carthage {{did not have a}} standing army, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> else could be done before enough mercenaries had been hired and marshalled. Carthage had begun to recruit an army and man a fleet to send to Sicily. The final army may have included 50,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, 400 chariots, while the fleet included 400 Triremes and 600 transports.|$|E

25|$|Greece appealed in 1954 to the United Nations {{to demand}} {{self-determination}} for Cyprus. Britain had the ruling mandate over the mostly ethnic Greek island, and wanted the Cyprus dispute {{to be resolved}} without being taken to the United Nations Security Council, where it could be problematically framed as an anti-colonialist struggle. To this end, Britain diplomatically encouraged Turkey to agitate Greece. The British ambassador to Greece also incited, saying in an August 1954 speech that Greco-Turkish ties were superficial, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> would be lost if, for example, something were to happen to Atatürk's house in Thessaloniki. More bluntly, {{an official of the}} Foreign Office said that some agitation would be much to Turkey's benefit. In any case, said parliamentarian John Strachey, Turkey had a large ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul as a card to play against Greece if it considered annexing an independent Cyprus to Greece.|$|E

500|$|Only limited {{modifications}} {{were possible}} due to technical constraints {{imposed by the}} need to keep displacement low and insufficient funds to effect a major reconstruction to free up tonnage for other uses. The Navy considered proposals to modernize the three battleships in the early 1920s, but the Spanish military budget was being consumed by the costs of the Rif War in North Africa and <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> came of the proposed modernization. These plans called for installing [...] new fire control equipment with more effective rangefinders, along with additional, newer anti-aircraft guns, and building anti-torpedo bulges into the hull to improve underwater protection for a loss of one knot of speed. Deck armor was also to be strengthened.|$|E

500|$|Reproduction of V. salvadorii {{has only}} been {{observed}} in captivity, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> is known about its reproduction in the wild.

Hatchlings are about [...] long and weigh around [...] Like those of many other monitors, the hatchlings of V. salvadorii are more colorful than adults, and feed primarily on insects and small reptiles.|$|E
500|$|The {{outer wall}} {{encloses}} {{a space of}} 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, {{to the north of}} the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets. Most of the area is now covered by forest. A [...] causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.|$|E
500|$|Stalingrads hull was towed from Nikolayev on 19 May 1955 {{by three}} tugs, but was driven ashore by high winds on 23 May at the {{southern}} entrance to Sevastopol Bay. She grounded on a very rocky bottom in very shallow water only about [...] from shore. A number of the ordinary methods to refloat a ship couldn't be used because she was very nearly empty and <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> could be off-loaded and the rocky bottom meant that it couldn't be excavated out from underneath her. The first attempt used brute force provided by the cruisers [...] and Kerch to unsuccessfully tow her off. Several other attempts were made using explosive charges to create shock waves that would pivot her stern into deeper water in combination with tugs attempting to pull her around, but these were counterproductive in that several holes were blown in her sides which flooded several compartments and grounded her that much more firmly. At this time a more detailed assessment {{was made of the}} situation and 259 steel projections were discovered on the underside of her hull, left over from her launching cradles. These ranged in length from [...] and totally invalidated all calculations about the amount of force required to free her.|$|E

60|$|Particularly {{after her}} death; for then, {{as anyone can}} foresee, Eddy-worship will be taught in the Sunday-schools and pulpits of the cult. Already {{whatever}} she puts her trade-mark on, thought it be only a memorial spoon, is holy and is eagerly and passionately and gratefully bought by the disciple, and becomes a fetish in his house. I say bought, for the Boston Christian-Science Trust gives nothing away; everything it has for sale. And the terms are cash; and not cash only but cash in advance. Its god is Mrs. Eddy first, then the Dollar. Not a spiritual Dollar, but a real one. From end to end of the Christian-Science literature not a single (material) {{thing in the world}} is conceded to be real, except the Dollar. But all through and through its advertisements that reality is eagerly and persistently recognised. The hunger of the Trust for the Dollar, its adoration of the Dollar, its lust after the Dollar, its ecstasy in the mere thought of the Dollar--there has been nothing like it in the world in any age or country, <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> coarse, <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> lubricous, <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> bestial, except a French novel's attitude towards adultery.|$|R

500|$|Patton's {{conduct in}} this {{campaign}} met with several controversies. When Alexander sent a transmission on July 19 limiting Patton's attack on Messina, his chief of staff, Brigadier General Hobart R. Gay, claimed the message was [...] "lost in transmission" [...] until Messina had fallen. On July 22 he shot and killed a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge. The cart was blocking {{the way of a}} U.S. armored column which was under attack from German aircraft. When their Sicilian owner protested, Patton attacked him with a walking stick and pushed the two mules off of the bridge. When informed of the massacre of Italian prisoners at Biscari by troops under his command, Patton wrote in his diary, [...] "I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, <b>so</b> <b>nothing</b> can be done about it." [...] Bradley refused Patton's suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division's Inspector General found [...] "no provocation {{on the part of the}} prisoners... They had been slaughtered" [...] Patton is reported to have said: [...] "Try the bastards." [...] Patton also came into frequent disagreements with Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and acquiesced to their relief by Bradley.|$|E
