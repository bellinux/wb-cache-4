5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Recreational shore angling in the Atlantic Ocean between Moledo and Aveiro (Portugal) was {{examined}} using roving creel surveys (March/September 2001). Cooperation was high (90 % of 2310 anglers approached). At least 39 {{species of fish}} were caught {{at a rate of}} approximately 0. 5 fish angler h(- 1).

Microbiological stability of specimens reared in the semiintensive plant was higher than that found in specimens reared in the intensive plant. The concentration limit of Shelf life fixed by several authors (10 7 c. f. u. /g for Pseudomonas spp. and 10 6 c. f. u. /g for S. putrefaciens) occurred earlier in the specimens of Sparus auratacoming from the intensive plant.

40|$|A {{longline}} 'metier' using small hooks for 'red' <b>sea</b> <b>breams</b> (Pagellus acarne and Pagellus erythrinus) in the Algarve (south of Portugal) was studied. Experimental longlining {{was carried}} out with three sizes of "Mustad" round bend, flatted, spade end Quality 2316 DT hooks (numbers 11, 13 and 15) and two types of bait: razor shell (Ensis siliqua) and mud shrimp (Upogebia pusilla). A total of 3 328 fish and at least 36 species were caught with 33 600 hooks fished in 28 longline sets. Five species of <b>sea</b> <b>breams</b> (Sparidae) accounted for 79 % of the catch: Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Diplodus vulgaris, Spondyliosoma cantharus, and Boops boops. High catch rates of 20 - 30 fish per 100 hooks were made {{in a number of}} 1 200 hook longline sets, with total catch weights of 40 to more than 60 kg per set. In general, the smallest hook (number 15) had the highest catch rate. Bait type did not significantly affect the catch size distributions. Although more fish were caught with the razor shell bait, higher catch rates of 'red' <b>sea</b> <b>breams</b> were obtained with mud shrimp. Catch rates were also affected by the location of the fishing grounds and the time of the set, with the highest catch rates obtained when the longline was set within two hours before sunrise. A wide size range was caught for each species, with highly overlapped catch size frequency distributions for the three hook sizes used. Except for Spondyliosoma cantharus, few illegal-sized fish were caught, even with the smallest hook. The logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was used to describe hook selectivity for Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, and Spondyliosoma cantharus.
