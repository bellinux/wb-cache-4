500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to <b>say,</b> <b>Well,</b> didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would <b>say,</b> <b>well,</b> what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{contended that}} the failure to even allow himself and his partner to argue before the jury for a lesser charge left them prejudiced against his client. [...] "I mention in my brief the comment that the government's {{attorney}} made in his rebuttal argument about how if you do any type of crime, you should pay for it. It was [...] clear invitation to <b>say,</b> <b>well,</b> he's certainly guilty of something, and we can't let him go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between the 1990 U.S. Census and the 2000 U.S. Census, as Spring Branch gained many Hispanic and Korean {{residents}}, {{many white}} residents left. Nestor Rodriguez, an immigration expert from the University of Houston, {{said that the}} white population of Spring Branch implied that many were leaving not because of racial differences but because the new residents were not middle class. Rodriguez said, [...] "They don't say they're not middle-class, but they <b>say,</b> <b>well,</b> look at them, they're {{out on the street}} corners looking for work; we're not used to that. But those are characteristics of working-class or lower working-class people." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....anything {{that shows}} {{documentation}} {{of the brain and}} vagina connection is going to alarm some feminists.....also feminism has kind of retreated into the academy and sort of embraced the idea that all gender is socially constructed and so here is a book that is actually looking at science..... though there has been some criticisms of the book from some feminists ... who <b>say,</b> <b>well</b> you can’t look at the science because that means we have to grapple with the science..... to me the feminist task of creating a just world isn’t changed at all by this fascinating neuroscience that shows some differences between men and women.|$|E

We'd sit around and listen to what we did the night before. Someone might <b>say,</b> <b>well,</b> that's pretty good but we can do that better... We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us." [...] This process proved to be the most exacting work the group had undertaken yet. During recording, Mike Love often called Brian [...] "dog ears", a nickname referencing a canine's ability to detect sounds far beyond the limits of human hearing. Love later summarized: ...|$|E
