5000|$|The Ripper came {{equipped}} with two humbucking pickups designed {{especially for the}} Ripper by Bill Lawrence which were called [...] "Super Humbuckers", and a four way pickup <b>selector</b> <b>control,</b> a familiar Gibson feature from the older Gibson EB-3 bass.|$|E
5000|$|... (TMS) which {{contains}} two ECU's the {{transmission control unit}} (TECU) and the gear <b>selector</b> <b>control</b> unit (GECU). I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to double declutching.|$|E
50|$|Stag Arms is a {{firearms}} manufacturer {{founded in}} May 2003 and located in New Britain, Connecticut. Stag Arms is {{a manufacturer of}} the AR-15 type rifle, marketed as Stag-15 rifles. Stag advertises that all their weapons and accessories {{are made in the}} United States. They are perhaps best known for their left-handed AR-15 rifles, which use a mirror imaged upper receiver and have the ejection port reversed for left-handed shooters and the safety <b>selector</b> <b>control</b> {{on the right side of}} the lower receiver.|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} of the HTD, Soundstream {{installed}} Track Selector hardware. The left side selector allowed the operator to choose which audio channel pair (1,2; 3,4) was assigned to which tape track pair (1,2; 3,4; 5,6; or 7,8). The right-side <b>selector</b> <b>controlled</b> the application of record circuitry power for each of the eight tracks.|$|R

5000|$|The 4C is {{equipped}} with a six speed Alfa TCT Dual Dry Clutch Transmission, and can be operated via gearshift paddles on the steering wheel. It also has an Alfa 'DNA' dynamic <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> which <b>controls</b> the behavior of engine, brakes, throttle response, suspension and gearbox. In addition to the modes already seen in Giulietta, the 4C has a new [...] "Race" [...] mode.|$|R
5000|$|Most basses have {{a volume}} {{potentiometer}} ("pot" [...] or [...] "knob"), {{which can be}} turned up or down, and a tone potentiometer, which rolls off the high frequencies when it is turned to the player's right. Some basses may also have a pickup <b>selector</b> <b>control</b> or switch, to select single-coil or humbucking pickups. Since the 1980s, basses are often available with battery-powered [...] "active" [...] electronics that boost the signal with a preamplifier and provide equalization controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies, or both. Some expensive basses have even more equalization options, such as bass, middle and treble.|$|E
5000|$|Each neck had two single-coil pickups. These {{could be}} blended {{by a small}} wheel {{attached}} to a pot that sat just behind the bridge, introduced in 1954. The bridge pick-up was always on, and the neck pickup could be fed in to taste using the blend pot. Because the pickups were wired with reversed polarities, blending in the neck pickup caused the pickups to be [...] "hum-bucking". A neck <b>selector</b> switch <b>controlled</b> which neck's pickups were 'live'. On earlier 1950s models, the neck <b>selector</b> was <b>controlled</b> by push-buttons. A single tone and a single volume control served the entire instrument.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, Paisley and Wampler Pedals {{released}} the Brad Paisley signature Paisley Drive, a guitar overdrive pedal designed to his specifications. Paisley has also used Audiotech Guitar Products ABY <b>Selector's</b> for <b>controlling</b> his wireless receiver units.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot <b>selector</b> <b>controls</b> the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|R
50|$|Galaxy used RCS <b>Selector</b> and Master <b>Control</b> as {{its music}} playout system. According to RAJAR figures, Galaxy was the 7th most listened to {{radio station in}} the UK.|$|R
50|$|The MP5SD is {{produced}} exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a receiver end cap {{instead of a}} buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group—a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous <b>selector</b> <b>controls</b> (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy - designated the MP5SD-N, which is {{a version of the}} MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.|$|R
5000|$|The PRS Santana III was a {{model of}} {{electric}} guitar made by PRS Guitars.

50|$|Investigators {{with the}} Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB) {{determined}} that the double engine failure had been caused by fuel starvation, due to a previously unrecognised flaw in the model's fuel system. The Argonaut had eight fuel tanks, divided in pairs. Each pair fed one engine, {{but there was also}} a cross-feed system that allowed fuel from a pair of tanks to be fed to other engines, if necessary. It was found that the <b>selectors</b> <b>controlling</b> the cross-feed valves were poorly placed in the cockpit, and difficult to operate, giving also an unclear indication of what was actually selected. This could cause the inadvertent selection of cross-feed from some pairs of tanks, leading to the exhaustion of fuel in those tanks and the failure of the associated engine. These problems had been noticed by pilots of other Argonauts before, but neither British Midland nor the other airlines using the Argonaut (Trans-Canada Airlines and Canadian Pacific Airlines) had reported it to the manufacturer or to British Midland. Without this information, the AIB believed that it would have been extremely difficult for the pilots of G-ALHG to determine the exact nature of the emergency.|$|R

5000|$|For example, the {{handwheel}} of {{a typical}} CNC control will move any of the slides of the machine by one minimum increment, such as 1 micrometre or 1 ten-thousandth of an inch, for each pulse, and the handwheel will give one ratchet-like click or other haptic click to confirm to the user that a single increment occurred. Several <b>selector</b> switches <b>control</b> the handwheel's output: one allows each of the machine's axes (X, Y, Z, and so on) to be selected in turn; another shifts through several ranges of output, so that one click of the wheel is either one minimum increment, 10 times that, or 100 times that.|$|R
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, {{corrosion-resistant}} synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP (known commercially as the M95) is a 7.62×39mm Finnish {{assault rifle}} adopted in {{relatively}} small numbers by the Finnish Defence Forces in the 1990s. The RK95 TP originally featured many improvements including a fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> and a muzzle device that enabled {{the firing of}} rifle grenades, the attachment of a silencer, or bayonet. A civilian 7.62mm-caliber semi-automatic variant was manufactured and marketed as the M92S.|$|R
50|$|The firing {{mechanism}} {{features a}} two-stage progressive trigger that provides two modes of operation: semi-automatic fire, when the trigger is squeezed momentarily, and fully automatic fire—produced when the trigger is pulled {{all the way}} through and held back. No fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> is provided. The Jatimatic features a striker firing mechanism with a fixed firing pin installed inside the bolt (the dual-purpose return spring also serves as the firing pin spring).|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a trigger {{assembly}} {{equipped with a}} manual fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> (the fire selector lever {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (selector switch in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire selector lever also operates the external safety mechanism (lever in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|R
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire <b>control</b> <b>selector,</b> {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|R

40|$|The stereotyped {{outgrowth}} of tubular {{branches of the}} Drosophila tracheal system is orchestrated by the local and highly dynamic expression profile of branchless (bnl), which encodes a secreted fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -like molecule. Despite {{the importance of the}} spatial and temporal bnl regulation, {{little is known about the}} upstream mechanisms that establish its complex expression pattern. Here, we show that the Extradenticle and Homothorax <b>selector</b> proteins <b>control</b> bnl transcription in a single cell per segment, the mesodermal bridge-cell. In addition, we observed that a key determinant of bridge-cell specification, the transcription factor Hunchback, is also required for bnl expression. Therefore, we propose that one of the functions of the bridge-cell is to synthesize and secrete the chemoattractant Bnl. These findings provide a hitherto unknown and interesting link between combinatorial inputs of transcription factors, cell-specific ligand expression and organ morphogenesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{transcription}} {{factors that}} are coded for by segmentation genes regulate yet another family of developmental control genes, the homeotic selector genes. These genes exist in two ordered groups on Drosophila chromosome 3. The order of the genes on the chromosome reflects the order that they are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo. The Antennapedia group of homeotic selector genes includes labial, antennapedia, sex combs reduced, deformed, and proboscipedia. Labial and Deformed proteins are expressed in head segments where they activate the genes that define head features. Sex-combs-reduced and Antennapedia specify the properties of thoracic segments. The bithorax group of homeotic <b>selector</b> genes <b>control</b> the specializations of the third thoracic segment and the abdominal segments. Mutations in some homeotic genes can often be lethal and the cycle of life will end at embryogenesis.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} and identity of organs and appendages are regulated by specific selector genes that encode transcription factors that regulate potentially large sets of target genes. The DNA-binding domains of selector proteins often exhibit relatively low DNA-binding specificity in vitro. It is not understood how the target selectivity of most selector proteins is determined in vivo. The Scalloped <b>selector</b> protein <b>controls</b> wing development in Drosophila by regulating {{the expression of}} numerous target genes and forming a complex with the Vestigial protein. We show that binding of Vestigial to Scalloped switches the DNA-binding selectivity of Scalloped.
