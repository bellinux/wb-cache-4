5|$|Ike {{began to}} fear that word of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1989, the Phillies {{faced the}} Mets {{in their home}} finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season. The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. McDowell was closing out a 5–3 win for the Phillies when, with two outs in the ninth, he induced former {{teammate}} Gregg Jeffries to ground out to second to end the game. As Jeffries was running out the play, McDowell <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground. The benches cleared and punches were exchanged before the umpires could separate the teams. Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2–1 Phillies victory on September 25.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

25|$|Liverpool did {{the double}} over Everton in 2007–08. However, the meeting at Goodison Park was {{shrouded}} in controversy when after a coming together between Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Everton's Tony Hibbert, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded Liverpool a penalty {{and seemed to}} change his mind in favour of a red card for Hibbert after Gerrard appeared to have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him, when most pundits felt a caution would have been sufficient. Everton dominated the game after going behind, but were denied what seemed to be two clear penalties in the closing stages of the game when Joleon Lescott was twice wrestled to the ground by Jamie Carragher at Everton corners. The victory helped secure a top-four finish and Champions League qualification for Liverpool, leaving Everton to settle for a UEFA Cup place. Referee Clattenburg was not chosen to officiate again at Goodison Park after that match until December 2013, six years later, and in that period only officiated one Everton game, away at Aston Villa.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spinner, Wang's {{civilian}} attorney, {{argued that}} USAF Chief of Staff General Merrill McPeak, a career fighter pilot, had {{made clear that}} he did not want Wickson and May punished for their actions in the shootdown. Cited as evidence for this was a Los Angeles Times report, published also in the European Stars and Stripes newspaper on 18 June 1994 that stated that McPeak [...] "strongly opposed" [...] court-martial action for Wickson or May. Pilkington stated that he had heard rumors that McPeak had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> that effect, but could not confirm if they were true or not.|$|E

500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the effect of [...] "What am I doing here?

In the episode [...] "The Whale", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his best friend and ensures that she and Jim get a nice severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.|$|E

2500|$|Messages that convey {{negative}} feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages {{are associated with}} less satisfying relationships. [...] Intentionally hurtful messages {{are among the most}} serious, as perceived by a partner. [...] Unlike physical pain that usually subsides over time, hurtful messages and hurt feelings often persist {{for a long period of}} time and be recalled even years after the event. [...] The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent. [...] People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> deliberately hurt him or her. [...] Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley came up {{with the}} name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City.

[...] Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the [...] "SS" [...] look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over [...] "Wicked Lester" [...] on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the [...] "S" [...] in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it [...] "by eye."

2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the effect of {{we were at a}} point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E
2500|$|Disneyland was {{dedicated}} at an [...] "International Press Preview" [...] event held on Sunday, July 17, 1955, {{which was only}} open to invited guests and the media. Although 28,000 people attended the event, {{only about half of}} those were actual invitees, the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets, or even sneaked into the park by climbing over the fence. The following day, it opened to the public, featuring twenty attractions. The Special Sunday events, including the dedication, were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney's friends from Hollywood: Art Linkletter, Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan. ABC broadcast the event live, during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables. In Frontierland, a camera caught Cummings kissing a dancer. When Disney started to read the plaque for Tomorrowland, he read partway then stopped when a technician off-camera <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him, and after realizing he was on-air, said, [...] "I thought I got a signal", and began the dedication from the start. At one point, while in Fantasyland, Linkletter tried to give coverage to Cummings, who was on the pirate ship. He was not ready, and tried to give the coverage back to Linkletter, who had lost his microphone. Cummings then did a play-by-play of him trying to find it in front of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
