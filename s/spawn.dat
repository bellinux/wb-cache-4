40|$|The catch, distribution, {{and biology}} were studied in Norwegian spring <b>spawning</b> herring during the <b>spawning</b> season in 1995. Both the <b>spawning</b> time and choice of <b>spawning</b> grounds were {{influenced}} by the size and condition of the fish. The stock wintered in Vestfjorden, northern Norway, and <b>spawning</b> grounds were utilized southwards along the coast within a range of 1500 km. The herring arrived the <b>spawning</b> grounds in a decreasing order of length and condition. This was mainly due to size specific swimming speed and not size specific maturation. Delayed maturation with fish length was only found within the recruits, which <b>spawned</b> in a second wave. In addition, the size and condition of the fish in a <b>spawning</b> area increased southwards, {{and there was a}} delayed <b>spawning</b> and prolonged <b>spawning</b> period at the northernmost <b>spawning</b> grounds. We suggest that life-history theory explains the observed <b>spawning</b> distribution. Individuals must consider trade off between migration distance, reproductive output, own survival and larval survival based on their body size and condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in farm conditions in order to reveal the distribution of <b>spawning</b> time and <b>spawning</b> time repeatability in rainbow trout. The <b>spawning</b> times of 48 farms in Eastern Blacksea Region of Turkey were analysed. Separately, the broodstocks of two farms, selected from these farms, were <b>spawned</b> individually and marked group by group according to <b>spawning</b> time/party. Therefore, one year later, when these fish <b>spawned,</b> their <b>spawning</b> cha-racteristics were determined. It was determined that <b>spawning</b> time of rainbow trout showed a distribution between September and May in the region, and in (70 %) of these farms <b>spawning</b> continued between December and March when egg strip was performed. Furthermore, it was found out that the rate of repeatability of <b>spawning</b> time was high in one year later (incoming year).

5|$|Teleosts may <b>spawn</b> in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to <b>spawn</b> in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E

40|$|While fishery {{closures}} {{during the}} <b>spawning</b> season are commonplace, direct evidence for their benefit is mainly restricted to species forming large <b>spawning</b> aggregations. This paper analyses {{the conditions under}} which <b>spawning</b> closures could contribute to sustainable fisheries management by reviewing how fishing during <b>spawning</b> may affect the physiology, behaviour and ecology of individuals and how this may influence the dynamics and the genetics of the population. We distinguish between the effects of fishing activities in relation to mortality, disturbance of <b>spawning</b> activity, and impact on <b>spawning</b> habitat. <b>Spawning</b> closures may be of benefit it they: (1) reduce the fishing mortality of the large and older spawners; (2) avoid negative effects on <b>spawning</b> habitats; (3) reduce the risk of over-exploitation in species which form large <b>spawning</b> aggregations; (4) reduce the evolutionary effects on maturation and reproductive investment; and (5) reduce the risk of over-exploitation of specific <b>spawning</b> components. The contribution of <b>spawning</b> closures to sustainable fisheries will differ among species and depends on the complexity of the <b>spawning</b> system, the level of aggregation during <b>spawning</b> and the vulnerability of the <b>spawning</b> habitat. The importance of these closures depends on the degree of population depletion but does not cease when populations are ‘healthy’ (i. e. no sign that recruitment is impaired) ...|$|R

Spent Penaeus monodon {{females were}} tagged around one eyestalk with {{numbered}} brass tags, stocked {{in a concrete}} tank with males, and periodically examined for ovarian rematuration over a six-month period (February to August, 1977). The females were either artificially-induced (ablated spawners from concrete tanks and marine pens) or wild spawners. Most of the wild spawners were ablated after spawning; some remained unablated to serve as controls. Out {{of a total of}} 349 experimental females, 35 or 10 1 % had a second <b>spawning</b> and 5 or 1 4 % a third spawning; none of the 74 controls <b>spawned</b> subsequently.

5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to <b>spawn,</b> salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults <b>spawn</b> here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E

40|$|A set of {{eggs from}} first time <b>spawning</b> Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L) was {{investigated}} for {{the understanding of}} variations in egg sizes, e. g. with time in the <b>spawning</b> season, daily inter and intra variations, daily distributions and <b>spawning</b> time (early, mid, and late <b>spawning</b> season). Furthermore, the egg sizes were characterized for the estimation of <b>spawning</b> time {{and the proportion of}} <b>spawning</b> females in tanks. The egg sizes indicated a decreasing trend between batches <b>spawned</b> early, mid and late in the <b>spawning</b> season. Daily inter and intra variations indicated a decreasing trend towards late the <b>spawning</b> season. The daily egg size distributions indicated high variability during the early <b>spawning</b> season and this variability tended to decrease in batches <b>spawned</b> late in the <b>spawning</b> season. Early, mid, and late phases of the <b>spawning</b> season were categorised through time elapsed since the beginning of <b>spawning</b> and by total daily production of eggs. This study also reviewed whether the size of a fish egg is an indicator of quality and also whether cod production of eggs of high variability in size, amount and quality over the whole <b>spawning</b> season is a reproductive strategy. It has been observed that among many other determinants of egg quality, size is an important indicator as the size of an egg determines the amount of yolk and the size of larvae at hatching. Cod produces eggs of high variability in the season as a strategy of maximizing production efficiency and assuring survival of its offspring...|$|R

Using standard equations, we {{have concluded that the}} light intensities which have been used by investigators attempting to induce maturation and <b>spawning</b> are up to 4000 times higher than would occur over the <b>spawning</b> grounds of Penaeus setiferus, a species for which successful controlled <b>spawning</b> has yet to be achieved.

40|$|International audienceMany large {{groupers}} form <b>spawning</b> aggregations, {{returning to}} the same <b>spawning</b> sites in consecutive <b>spawning</b> seasons. Connectivity between <b>spawning</b> aggregations is thus assured by larval dispersal. This study looks into the genetic structure and gene flow among <b>spawning</b> aggregations of a large grouper, the gulf coney Hyporthodus acanthistius, in the northern Gulf of California. First, using the mitochondrial control region and 11 microsatellites, we calculated FST metrics and conducted a Bayesian clustering analysis to determine structure among 5 <b>spawning</b> aggregations. Shallow genetic structure was found, separating the southernmost <b>spawning</b> aggregate from the remainder. Second, we used {{the results from the}} structure analysis and local water circulation patterns to delineate 3 distinct models of gene flow. The best-supported model, in which the southernmost <b>spawning</b> aggregate formed one group and all other <b>spawning</b> aggregates were nested into a second group, was the one that was consistent with water circulation during the species’ <b>spawning</b> season. Larval retention within a seasonal anticyclonic gyre that formed during the gulf coney’s <b>spawning</b> season may be responsible for the patterns found. This study highlights the importance of local oceanographic conditions in dictating the structure among <b>spawning</b> aggregations even at small geographic scales and contributes to informed management plans for this overexploited grouper...|$|R

5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to <b>spawn</b> may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to <b>spawn.</b> Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E
