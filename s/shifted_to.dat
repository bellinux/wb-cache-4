30|$|Constructing {{low-carbon}} parks {{is the key}} {{to promoting}} low-carbon technology and industrializing low-carbon products. The establishment of low-carbon parks can provide a positive development environment for low-carbon industry and a platform for research, development, and incubation of technology. Building low-carbon parks requires building a good investment environment, actively attracting low-carbon companies and technicians that understand key technologies and providing preferential fiscal and tax policies to encourage the entrance of private capital. Meanwhile, actively follow up with the construction of related policies, laws, and service systems. Actively push forward the construction of low-carbon communities and <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> low-carbon lifestyles and consumption models by constructing low-carbon communities. Specific measures include the following: (1) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> low-carbon planning and design, (2) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> low-carbon building materials, (3) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> a low-carbon community environment, (4) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> a low-carbon energy system, (5) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> low-carbon resource use, and (6) <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> low-carbon lifestyles.|$|R

40|$|Crop {{production}} is <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> much larger farms. Since government commodity payments reflect production volumes for program commodities, payments are also <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> larger farms. In turn, the operators of very large farms have substantially higher household incomes than other farm households, {{and as a}} result government commodity payments are also <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> much higher-income households. Since the changes in farm structure appear to be ongoing, commodity payments will likely, under current policies, continue <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> higher income households.

40|$|We {{quantify}} {{dynamic effect}} of shifts of exchange rate {{system from the}} dollar-peg to the basket- peg or floating and obtain transition paths for the shifts, based on a dynamic small open-economy model. We find that a small open country {{will be better off}} <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> the basket-peg or floating regime than maintaining the dollar-peg regime with capital control, in the long-run. Furthermore, because of welfare costs associated with volatility in nominal interest rates, the longer the transition period, the more benefits a country gains from <b>shifting</b> suddenly <b>to</b> the basket-peg from the dollar- peg regime rather than proceeding gradually. Thidly, focusing on sudden <b>shifts</b> <b>to</b> desired regimes, welfare gain of the country is higher under a <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> the basket-peg if the exchagne rate fluctuates remarkably. Lastly, concerning with <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> the managed floating, it is less attractive to adopt compared with <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> the basket-peg as intervening to maintain the exchange rate for certain periods leads to higher losses as the authority lacks monetary policy autonomy [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{category}} learning experiment involving human participants {{compared the}} dif ® culties of {{four types of}} shift learning. Initial learning was of an exclusive-or (XOR) structure on two of three stimulus dimensions. One shift type was a reversal, a second <b>shift</b> was <b>to</b> a single previously relevant dimension, a third <b>shift</b> was <b>to</b> a single previously irrelevant dimension, and a fourth <b>shift</b> was <b>to</b> an XOR on one previously relevant dimension and one previously irrelevant dimension. Results showed that reversal shift was easiest, followed, in order, by <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a single previously relevant dimension, <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a single previously irrelevant dimension, and a <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a new XOR. An extended version of the ALCOVE model, called AMBRY, qualitatively ® ts the data. The model incorporates two essential principles. First, internal category representations that can be quickly remapped to overt responses are important for accounting for the ease of reversal shift. Second, perseverating dimensional attention is important for accounting for the ease of <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> a previously relevant dimension {{as opposed to a}} previously irrelevant dimension. It is suggested that any model of these effects will need to implement both of these principles...|$|R
