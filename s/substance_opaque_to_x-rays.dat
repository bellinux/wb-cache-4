40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray radiographs of box cores {{of shelf}} sand {{off the coast}} of California and Oregon show linear {{concentrations}} of grains <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays.</b> A number of the lines cross one another, suggesting that they are of biogenic origin. Experimental studies how that infaunal polychaetes such as Nephtys produce similar concentrations of heavy minerals as they move through sand. A similar origin is postulated for the observed concentrations in the shelf-sand box cores. Howard and Reineck, in their analysis of the depositional facies off the Southern Cal-ifornia coast, found one sedimentary struc-ture particularly difficult to explain (1981, p. 818). Well expressed in X-ray radiographs of sandy cores taken in water depths between 15 and 33 m, the structure appears as linear concentrations of grains, presumably heavy minerals, that are <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays.</b> Howard and Reineck state that the most plausible x-planation of the structure, based on an ex-periment hat I conducted, is that it repre-sents the traces of a burrowing polychaete that concentrates heavy minerals along the bottom of its burrow. This note describes the experiment. The structure in question appears on pos-itive radiograph prints as primarily subhor-izontal, slightly sinuous lines a fraction of a millimeter thick and up to 8 cm long. The structure somewhat resembles ripple lami-nation; the lines intersect in places, however, and therefore cannot be bedding structures. Details of the structure suggest hat it is biogenic. Some lines occur in pairs, forming roughly parallel lines about a millimeter apart that locally converge to a single line. Above the lines are subtle, lighter-toned halos about 3 mm thick that indicate greater penetration of the X-rays. The radiographs also show dark, concave-up, aired arcuate lines about 3 mm long and about 2 mrn apart. Above the pair of arcs is an elliptical lighter-colored hal...|$|R

50|$|Because an {{enormous}} amount of energy is released {{in a short period of}} time, much of the energy is released as high energy photons in accordance with the theory of black body radiation, in this case X-rays. This release of energy may be observed as in increase in the star's luminosity with a space telescope, and is called an X-ray burst. These bursts cannot be observed on Earth's surface because our atmosphere is <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays.</b> Most X-ray bursting stars exhibit recurrent bursts because the bursts are not powerful enough to disrupt the stability or orbit of either star, and the whole process may begin again. Most X-ray bursters have irregular periods, which can be on the order of a few hours to many months, depending on factors such as the masses of the stars, the distance between the two stars, the rate of accretion, and the exact composition of the accreted material. Observationally, X-ray bursts are put into two distinct categories, labeled Type I and Type II. A Type I X-ray burst has a sharp rise followed by a slow and gradual decline of the luminosity profile. A Type II X-ray burst exhibits a quick pulse shape and may have many fast bursts separated by minutes. However, only from two sources have Type II X-ray bursts been observed, and most X-ray bursts are of Type I.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of horizontally placed internals {{on the physical}} behaviour of a dense fluidized bed has been observed using an X-ray technique. The internals were sieve-like baffles with an aperture size two orders of magnitude larger than {{the diameter of the}} bed particles.

For the latter, the bubbles were made to emerge from a layer more <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays</b> into one more transparent. In this way, the flow pattern around the bubble and the wake could be observed. The results show that the baffles do not influence the mean bubble size or velocity significantly, confirming earlier indirect observations.

Results are given as statistics for bubble size and rise velocity {{as a function of the}} fluidization velocity with and without baffles present, and sequences of X-ray images showing the effect of the baffles.

5000|$|Bismuth oxide is {{occasionally}} used in dental {{materials to}} make them more <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays</b> than the surrounding tooth structure. In particular, bismuth (III) oxide has been used in hydraulic silicate cements (HSC), originally in [...] "MTA" [...] (a trade name, standing for the chemically-meaningless [...] "mineral trioxide aggregate") from 10 to 20% by mass with a mixture of mainly di- and tri-calcium silicate powders. Such HSC is used for dental treatments such as: apicoectomy, apexification, pulp capping, pulpotomy, pulp regeneration, internal repair of iatrogenic perforations, repair of resorption perforations, root canal sealing and obturation. MTA sets into a hard filling material when mixed with water. Some resin-based materials also include an HSC with bismuth oxide. Problems have allegedly arisen with bismuth oxide because it is claimed not to be inert at high pH, specifically that it slows the setting of the HSC, but also over time can lose color by exposure to light or reaction with other materials that may have been used in the tooth treatment, such as sodium hypochlorite.|$|R
50|$|After UV come X-rays, which, {{like the}} upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, {{due to their}} higher energies, X-rays can also {{interact}} with matter {{by means of the}} Compton effect. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption, they can be used to 'see through' objects with 'thicknesses' less than that equivalent to a few meters of water. One notable use is diagnostic X-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as radiography). X-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics. In astronomy, the accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes emit X-rays, enabling studies of these phenomena. X-rays are also emitted by the coronas of stars and are strongly emitted by some types of nebulae. However, X-ray telescopes must be placed outside the Earth's atmosphere <b>to</b> see astronomical <b>X-rays,</b> since the great depth of the atmosphere of Earth is <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays</b> (with areal density of 1000 grams per cm2), equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water.

40|$|Abridged) Propagation of {{ionizing}} radiation, as from parent star flares, supernovae, or gamma-ray bursts, is {{studied for}} {{a suite of}} simple model atmospheres of terrestrial-like exoplanets covering a large range of column densities and incident photon energies. We developed a Monte Carlo code to treat the Compton scattering and photoabsorption. Atmospheres thinner than about 100 g cm^- 2 transmit a significant fraction of incident gamma-rays, but even the thinnest atmospheres are essentially <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays</b> below about 30 keV. For thicker atmospheres, the incident ionizing radiation is efficiently blocked, {{but most of the}} incident energy is redistributed via secondary electron excitation into diffuse UV and visible aurora-like emission, increasing the atmospheric transmission by many orders of magnitude; in some cases the transmission can be up to 10 %, depending on the intervening UV opacity. For Earth, between 2 x 10 ^- 3 and 4 x 10 ^- 2 of the incident flux reaches the ground in the 200 - 320 nm range, depending on the presence of the current ozone shield. We discuss effects of angle of incidence, quenching of reemission by collisional deexcitation, and the creation of transient secondary ionospheres. Comparison with flare statistics suggests that frequent fluctuations in the UV flux received at the surface can be produced by stellar flares, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, especially for planets whose parent stars are less massive and/or younger than the Sun...|$|R

We report a detection of the planetary transit in soft X-rays with a significantly larger transit depth than observed in the optical. The X-ray data favor a transit depth of 6 - 8 %, versus a broadband optical transit depth of 2. 41 %. While {{we are able to}} exclude several possible stellar origins for this deep transit, additional observations will be necessary to fully exclude the possibility that coronal inhomogeneities influence the result.

40|$|Dark energy models, {{such as the}} chameleon, {{where the}} {{acceleration}} of {{the expansion of the}} universe results from the dynamics of a scalar field coupled to matter, suffer from the potential existence of a fifth force. Three known mechanisms have been proposed to restore General Relativity in the solar system and the laboratory, which are the symmetron/Damour-Polyakov effect, the Vainshtein property and the chameleon screening. Here, we propose to probe the existence of chameleons in the laboratory, considering their particle physics consequences. We envisage the resonant and non-resonant production of chameleons in the sun and their back-conversion into X-ray photons in a solar helioscope pipe such as the one used by CAST. A detection of these X-rays would indicate the existence of chameleons. We focus on a template model for the solar magnetic field: a constant magnetic field in a narrow shell surrounding the tachocline. The X-ray photons in a helioscope pipe obtained from back-conversion of the chameleons created inside the sun have a spectrum which is peaked in the sub-keV region, just below the actual sensitivity range of the present axion helioscopes. Nevertheless they are detectable by present day magnetic helioscopes like CAST and Sumico, which were built originally for solar axions. We also propose a chameleon-through-a-wall experiment whereby X-ray photons from a synchroton radiation source could be converted into chameleons inside a dipole magnet, then pass a wall which is <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> <b>X-rays</b> before being back-converted into X-ray photons in a second magnet downstream. We show that this could provide a direct signature for the existence of chameleon particles. Comment: new title, matches published version, 22 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and removal of an inhaled foreign body may save a patient from chronic ill health or possibly death. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to discuss the radiological findings in 40 children who attended hospital with respiratory symptoms caused by the presence of an inhaled solid object lodged in the trachea or a major bronchus. 2 of these objects were coughed up while the patients were in hospital, 37 were removed at bronchoscopy, and in one child bronchotomy was necessary. All attended since the beginning of 1956 over a period of almost 10 years. Just over half the children were under 3 years of age (Fig. 1). Of the 11 children aged under 2 years, 10 were accompanied by responsible adults who had witnessed the acute choking episode when 'some-thing went the wrong way', and realized its signifi-cance in relation to the subsequent onset ofsymptoms. Of the 9 children aged more than 8 years, 8 volun-teered such information for themselves; the ninth was a boy who had undergone dental extractions under general anaesthesia, and a few days later developed pneumonia caused by an inhaled tooth. Of the 20 patients aged between 2 and 8 years a relevant history was given by only 8, while 12 attended with respiratory symptoms without any indication of their cause. In this age range children are not constantly under adult supervision and an acute choking episode may pass unobserved. Moreover, they may not have sufficient experience to understand the significance of such an episode or, in the case of the younger ones, language to describe it.

Space telescopes {{can be used to}} observe astronomical objects at wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and are thus impossible to observe using ground-based telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere is <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> ultraviolet radiation, <b>X-rays,</b> and gamma rays and is partially <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> infrared radiation so observations in these portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are best carried out from a location above the atmosphere of our planet. Another advantage of space-based telescopes is that, because of their location above the Earth's atmosphere, their images are free from the effects of atmospheric turbulence that plague ground-based observations. As a result, the angular resolution of space telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope is often much smaller than a ground-based telescope with a similar aperture. However, all these advantages do come with a price. Space telescopes are much more expensive to build than ground-based telescopes. Due to their location, space telescopes are also extremely difficult to maintain. The Hubble Space Telescope was serviced by the Space Shuttle while many other space telescopes cannot be serviced at all.|$|R

The processing equipment, in this case furnaces, and the scintillator materials are <b>opaque</b> <b>to</b> conventional <b>X-ray</b> interrogation techniques. The distribution of the europium activator within a BaBrCl:Eu scintillator (0. 1 and 0. 5 % nominal doping concentrations per mole) is studied in situ during the melting and solidification processes with a temporal resolution of 5 - 7 s. The strong tendency of the Eu dopant to segregate during the solidification process is observed in repeated cycles, with Eu forming clusters on multiple length scales (only for clusters larger than ∼ 50 μm, as limited by the resolution of the present experiments). It is also demonstrated that the dopant concentration can be quantified even for very low concentration levels (∼ 0. 1 %) in 10 mm thick samples. The interface between the solid and liquid phases can also be imaged, provided there is a sufficient change in concentration of one of the elements with a sufficient neutron attenuation cross section. Tomographic imaging of the BaBrCl: 0. 1 %Eu sample reveals a strong correlation between crystal fractures and Eu-deficient clusters.

Seven patients diagnosed with late-onset CBS were retrospectively analyzed.

Results. Patients who had undergone surgical treatment showed a significant BCVA and spherical equivalent refractive error improvement (P= 0. 002, P= 0. 021, resp.).
