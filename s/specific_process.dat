5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a <b>specific</b> <b>process.</b> Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} written {{records indicate}} the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations {{as early as}} 2000BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the <b>specific</b> <b>process</b> used for solving problems, but {{the characteristics of the}} particular numeral system strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for Egyptian numerals, like the later Roman numerals, descended from tally marks used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a decimal base but did not include positional notation. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a counting board or the Roman abacus to obtain the results.|$|E

The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP. However, due to shortage of nurses and NMC striving for gold standards in nursing they have now updated their new process to a two part test of competence. The first part is called CBT and Part 2 (objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).|$|E

The front guards received fake 'vents' just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other performance parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. These GTs are generally referred to as RPO83s after the option code covering the additional parts, although what parts any given RPO83 received seem to have been governed by the luck of the draw rather than any <b>specific</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Allochthonous {{energy sources}} are those derived {{from outside the}} lotic system, that is, from the {{terrestrial}} environment. [...] Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litterfall or lateral leaf blow. [...] In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that {{have been added to}} the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM. [...] The CPOM undergoes a <b>specific</b> <b>process</b> of degradation. [...] Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream. [...] First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and leached from the leaf upon its saturation with water. [...] This adds to the DOM load in the system. [...] Next, microbes such as bacteria and fungi colonize the leaf, softening it as the mycelium of the fungus grows into it. [...] The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004). [...] This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for shredding invertebrates, [...] which leave only FPOM after consumption. [...] These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM. [...] Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, surface runoff, bank erosion, or groundwater. [...] Similarly, DOM can be introduced through canopy drip from rain or from surface flows.|$|E
