25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. <b>Sulfatide</b> has anticoagulation activity when it binds to fibrinogen, which prevents fibrinogen from converting to fibrin. <b>Sulfatide</b> {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, <b>sulfatide</b> also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, <b>sulfatide</b> is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with coagulation factor XII; second, <b>sulfatide</b> binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, <b>sulfatide</b> and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of <b>sulfatide.</b> Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous <b>sulfatide</b> is necessary to fully understand the role of <b>sulfatide</b> in coagulation and thrombosis. <b>Sulfatide</b> is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|In Alzheimer's disease, <b>sulfatide</b> in {{the brain}} tissue {{decreases}} tremendously, starting {{in the early stages}} of the disease. In the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease, the loss of <b>sulfatide</b> can be up to 50% in the white matter and up to 90% in the gray matter {{in the brain}}. <b>Sulfatide</b> concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is also lower in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The characteristic loss of neuronal function associated with Alzheimer's disease occurs via the loss of neurons and synapses, and the deficit is lipid class specific to sulfatides. When comparing <b>sulfatide</b> depletion to other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the only case in which <b>sulfatide</b> is so dramatically depleted; in dementia no marked <b>sulfatide</b> depletion is observed, while in Parkinson's disease, <b>sulfatide</b> levels are dramatically elevated, and multiple sclerosis patients only have a moderate <b>sulfatide</b> depletion. Additionally, the loss of <b>sulfatide</b> has been observed to only occur at the very beginning of the disease while at more severe stages, minimal additional <b>sulfatide</b> loss occurs.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin K {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with <b>sulfatide.</b> Not only in animals, but also in bacteria, vitamin K has been observed to influence <b>sulfatide</b> concentrations in the brain. Vitamin K in the nervous system is responsible for the activation of enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids, such as <b>sulfatide.</b> When warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is added to an animal model system, <b>sulfatide</b> synthesis is impaired. However, when vitamin K is added back into the system, <b>sulfatide</b> synthesis proceeds normally, suggesting that Vitamin K is necessary for <b>sulfatide</b> synthesis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} whether <b>sulfatides</b> {{are able}} to trigger transmembrane signals and activation of selective cell functions in human monocytes. <b>Sulfatides</b> stimulated an increase in cytosolic free-calcium in monocytes, and this depended on the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Non-sulfated galactocerebrosides {{had no effect on}} monocyte cytosolic free calcium. <b>Sulfatides</b> enhanced expression of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 8, and interleukin- 1 β, but not interleukin- 12 /natural killer cell stimulating factor mRNAs. <b>Sulfatides</b> also triggered secretion of cytokines into the extracellular medium, although they were much less effective than lypopolysaccharide. Both enhanced expression of cytokine mRNAs and secretion by <b>sulfatides</b> required sulfation of the galactose ring of the glycolipid as non-sulfated galactocerebrosides had no effect. These findings suggest that <b>sulfatides</b> that are released at sites of inflammation can amplify the inflammatory reaction triggering cytokine expression in, and release by, monocytes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sulfated form of galactocerebrosides (<b>sulfatides)</b> have {{recently}} been established as ligands for L-selectin. In this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to <b>sulfatides</b> induces a transient generation of oxygen radicals, revealed by the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) technique. The CL response was mainly located intracellularly, and was dependent on sulfation of the galactose ring, since non-sulfated galactocerebrosides had no effect. <b>Sulfatides</b> also dramatically amplified the CL response triggered by the chemotactic peptide formylmeethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). This effect was primarily due to an increased (up to 10 -fold) intracellular generation of oxygen metabolites. Removal or blocking of L-selectin with chymotrypsin and monoclonal antibodies, respectively, markedly reduced the effects of <b>sulfatides.</b> Furthermore, <b>sulfatides</b> amplified the CL response triggered by ionomycin, whereas the response induced by phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate was slightly reduced. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, markedly inhibited the oxygen radical production induced by <b>sulfatides,</b> and totally abolished the potentiating effects of <b>sulfatides</b> in fMLP- and ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils. <b>Sulfatides</b> also triggered a transient rise in the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca 2 +]i. Consequently, L-selectin activation through <b>sulfatides</b> appear to affect oxidase activity through a Ca 2 +-dependent pathway involving tyrosine phosphorylation. Adenosine is an anti-inflammatory agent predominately released from the vascular endothelium which might suppress an inappropriate activation of the oxidase during L-selectin-mediated rolling of neutrophils. Indeed, we found that adenosine inhibited the oxidative burst induced by <b>sulfatides,</b> mainly by attenuating the intracellular generation of oxygen radicals. However, 10 – 100 times higher concentration of exogenous adenosine was required to inhibit the CL response induced by <b>sulfatides</b> {{to the same extent}} as the adenosine-mediated inhibition of the fMLP-induced response. This difference in sensitivity to adenosine could be explained by various expression of extracellular adenosine deaminase (ADA), since we found that the ADA-inhibitor erythro- 9 -(2 -hydroxy- 3 nonyl) -adenine (EHNA) markedly reduced the oxygen radical production caused by <b>sulfatides</b> and almost totally abolished the potentiating effects of <b>sulfatides</b> on the fMLP-induced respiratory burst. In contrary, EHNA only slightly reduced the fMLP-triggered CL response. We suggest that the initial activation of L-selectin prepare the neutrophil for an effective microbicidal activity in the extravascular space. This process might be dependent on a L-selectin-mediated increase in the expression and activity of ADA, which locally reduces the extracellular level of adenosine...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of gel permeation chromatography and freeze fracture electron microscopy {{it was found that}} the ability of <b>sulfatides</b> to promote contact activation in human plasma is associated with the ability of <b>sulfatides</b> to form bilayer structures. When <b>sulfatides</b> were dispersed in buffer at 70 °C by vortexing, large liposomes were found ranging in size between 2 – 5 μm diameter. Contact activation promoting activity was associated with these particles. Sonication resulted in the formation of small vesicles and stacked vesicles of 400 – 2000 A diameter and biological activity was associated with these vesicles. Homogeneous preparations of small unilamellar vesicles (500 A diameter) can be obtained by chromatography over Sepharose 2 B...|$|R
25|$|Autoimmunity {{also affects}} <b>sulfatide</b> levels. When an {{enhanced}} antibody response against myelin lipids occurs, including <b>sulfatide</b> {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis, the demyelination process is increased significantly. When <b>sulfatide</b> and gangliosides are present, the proliferation or production of Natural Killer-T cells that produce cytokines are activated. However, when CD1d deficient-mice are tested for their response to <b>sulfatide,</b> the same response is not seen, which indicates that in myelin, <b>sulfatide</b> is a glycolipid that possesses immunodominance.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of <b>sulfatide</b> {{is linked to}} several neurological disorders. As stated before, {{one of the major}} neurological disorders is Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, which is caused by elevated levels of <b>sulfatide,</b> leading to the progressive loss of myelin as a result of <b>sulfatide</b> accumulation. High levels of <b>sulfatide</b> in the gray matter in the cerebellum and in the superior frontal lobe have been associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, accumulation of <b>sulfatide</b> in neurons causes audiogenic seizures, which {{have been shown to be}} lethal in mouse models. On the other hand, reduced levels of <b>sulfatide</b> in the cerebral gray and white matter have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|This path {{results in}} the {{accumulation}} of <b>sulfatide</b> in renal cancer cell lines. Additionally, <b>sulfatide</b> can accumulate {{on the surface of}} cancer cells. This indicates that <b>sulfatide</b> may serve as a specific ligand for P-selectin. This would contribute to increased metastasis of the cancer. However, {{more research is needed to}} elucidate the relationship between the elevated levels of <b>sulfatide</b> expression and the initiation and metastasis mechanisms of cancer, but <b>sulfatide</b> may be a useful serum biomarker for early tumor detection.|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori preferentially bind to <b>sulfatides</b> (I 3 SO 3 -GalCer) and GM 3 gangliosides (II 3 NeuAcLacCer), two predominant acidic glycosphingolipids in the human gastric mucosa, on thin-layer chromatography plates. However, {{it has not yet}} been clarified that these glycospingolipids truly serve as adhesion receptors for H. pylori in live cells. In this study, we used a gastric cancer cell line, KATO III, as a cellular model of H. pylori adhesion and examined the role of <b>sulfatides</b> in attachment. The adhesion of H. pylori (i. e., a standard strain of H. pylori, NCTC 11637) to KATO III cells and the effects of various substances on this adhesion were monitored and semiquantitated by flow cytometric analysis. Sulfated glycoconjugates, such as heparin and gastric mucin, significantly inhibited H. pylori adhesion to KATO III cells. Membrane preparations from KATO III cells strongly inhibited this adhesion. In the membrane preparations, <b>sulfatides</b> were present as a major acidic glycosphinoglipid. With the exception of <b>sulfatides,</b> no distinct adhesion of H. pylori to glycospingolipids from KATO III cells were observed. Moreover, H. pylori did not bind to any membrane proteins of KATO III cells. Finally, a monoclonal anti-sulfatide antibody markedly reduced H. pylori adhesion to KATO III cells. These results suggest that <b>sulfatides,</b> and possibly related sulfated compounds, serve as a major receptor for cell adhesion by H. pylori...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the mechanism of interferon (IFN) induction in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} by HIV- 1 (IIIB) -infected H 9 cells or by recombinant gp 120. A monoclonal antibody specific for the galactosylsphingosinyl moiety in galactocerebrosides and <b>sulfatides</b> inhibited IFN induction in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, exogenous <b>sulfatides</b> inhibited with an ID 50 of approximately 1 μM,whereas galactocerebrosides were not inhibitory at 40 times higher concentrations. These studies suggest that sulfate containing galactolipids such as <b>sulfatides</b> on responder cells may be part of the gp 120 –membrane complex that initiates the induction of IFN. A partial homology of an epitope on the V 3 loop of gp 120 with a previously suggested binding domain for sulfated glycoconjugates supports this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Lactosylceramide sulfate and galactosylceramide sulfate {{were found}} to {{increase}} markedly in human renal cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) as compared to uninvolved tissue. Activities of two sulfotransferases toward galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide as substrates were significantly elevated in the carcinoma compared to the uninvolved tissue resulting in enhanced synthesis of the two <b>sulfatides</b> in the carcinoma. The elevation of the two sulfotransferases was parallel in most tumors, suggesting that the same enzyme {{is responsible for the}} enhanced synthesis of two <b>sulfatides.</b> No consistent difference in the activity of arylsulfatase A, which desulfates the two <b>sulfatides,</b> was observed between the carcinoma and uninvolved tissue. Both the present and previous results show that the increased synthesis of the siilfutidc(s) due to elevated Sulfotransferase activity could be a biochemical characteristic common to adenocarcinomas derived from different tissues...|$|R
25|$|Possessing the apoE ε4 allele {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is a protein that is involved in the transport of many lipids, including cholesterol, and thus, regulates how much <b>sulfatide</b> is in the central nervous system and mediates the homeostasis of the system. It has been found that higher levels of apoE are positively correlated with greater <b>sulfatide</b> depletion. ApoE-associated proteins take <b>sulfatide</b> from the myelin sheath and then degrade <b>sulfatide</b> into various compounds, such as sulfate. When apoE is increased, the amount of <b>sulfatide</b> that is taken from the myelin sheath is also increased; hence, there is more <b>sulfatide</b> depletion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} in the nervous system and is found in high levels in the myelin sheath in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Myelin is typically composed of about 70 -75% lipids, and <b>sulfatide</b> comprises 4-7% of this 70-75%. When lacking <b>sulfatide,</b> myelin sheath is still produced around the axons; however, when lacking <b>sulfatide</b> the lateral loops {{and part of the}} nodes of Ranvier are disorganized, so the myelin sheath does not function properly. Thus, lacking <b>sulfatide</b> can lead to muscle weakness, tremors, and ataxia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> {{may also}} be {{involved}} in not just type I diabetes, but also type II diabetes. Specifically, <b>sulfatide</b> is capable of inhibiting TNF-α secretion. When there are low serum levels of <b>sulfatide,</b> as well as elevated production of TNF-α in patients that have type II diabetes, it is commonly associated with insulin resistance. However, <b>sulfatide</b> may mediate suppression of type II diabetes through the activation of potassium protein channels.|$|E

40|$|Neutrophils die by {{apoptosis}} following activation and uptake of microbes or enter apoptosis spontaneously {{at the end}} {{of their}} lifespan if they do not encounter a pathogen. Here we report that <b>sulfatides</b> or sulfatides-treated Salmonella Typhimurium bacteria accelerated human neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophil apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. <b>Sulfatides</b> caused prominent increase in percentage of apoptotic cells after 2. 5 [*]hrs of incubation. Salmonella Typhimurium bacteria by themselves did not affect the basal level of apoptosis in neutrophil population. When neutrophils were added to S. Typhimurium “opsonized” by <b>sulfatides,</b> apoptotic index significantly increased, whereas the number of phagocyting cells was not influenced. Sulfatides’ proapoptotic effect was strongly dependent on the activity of β-galactosidase; inhibition of this enzyme impaired its potency to accelerate apoptosis. These data support the mechanism of neutrophil apoptosis triggering based on sulfatides’ ability to accumulate in intracellular compartments and mediate successive increase in ceramide content resulting from β-galactosidase activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Platelets contact {{each other}} at the site of {{vascular}} injury to stop bleeding. One negative regulator of platelet aggregation is Disabled- 2 (Dab 2), which is released to the extracellular surface upon platelet activation. Dab 2 inhibits platelet aggregation through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain by competing with fibrinogen for aIIbb 3 integrin receptor binding by an unknown mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using protein-lipid overlay and liposome-binding assays, we identified that the N-terminal region of Dab 2, including its PTB domain (N-PTB), specifically interacts with <b>sulfatides.</b> Moreover, we determined that such interaction is mediated by two conserved basic motifs with a dissociation constant (K d) of 0. 6 mM as estimated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. In addition, liposome-binding assays combined with mass spectroscopy studies revealed that thrombin, a strong platelet agonist, cleaved N-PTB at a site located between the basic motifs, a region that becomes protected from thrombin cleavage when bound to <b>sulfatides.</b> <b>Sulfatides</b> on the platelet surface interact with coagulation proteins, playing a major role in haemostasis. Our results show that <b>sulfatides</b> recruit N-PTB to the platelet surface, sequestering it from integrin receptor binding during platelet activation. This is a transient recruitment that follows N-PTB internalization by an actin-dependent process. Conclusions/Significance: Our experimental data support a model where two pools of Dab 2 co-exist at the platelet surface...|$|R
25|$|<b>Sulfatide,</b> {{also known}} as 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide, SM4, or sulfated galactocerebroside, is a class of sulfolipids, {{specifically}} a class of sulfoglycolipids, which are glycolipids that contain a sulfate group. <b>Sulfatide</b> is synthesized primarily starting in the endoplasmic reticulum and ending in the Golgi apparatus where ceramide is converted to galactocerebroside and later sulfated to make <b>sulfatide.</b> Of all of the galactolipids that {{are found in the}} myelin sheath, one fifth of them are <b>sulfatide.</b> <b>Sulfatide</b> is primarily found on the extracellular leaflet of the myelin plasma membrane produced by the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and in the Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. However, <b>sulfatide</b> is also present on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of many cells in eukaryotic organisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> also {{acts as an}} L-{{selectin}} and P-selectin ligand, but it {{does not}} act as an E- selectin ligand.

Accordingly, <b>sulfatide</b> may function as a ligand for P-selectin, which facilitates cancer metastasis. Additionally, when L-selectin and <b>sulfatide</b> bind, upregulation of the chemokine co-receptor’s (CXCR4) expression is observed, specifically on the surfaced of leukocytes.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experimentation}} {{has demonstrated}} that <b>sulfatide</b> enriched cells, in which <b>sulfatide</b> binds to hemagglutinin, enhances IAV replication by increasing the progeny virus particle formation; this is done through the promotion of nuclear export of IAV formed viral ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Experimentation has also demonstrated that if binding is inhibited between <b>sulfatide</b> and hemagglutinin that viral particle formation and replication would be inhibited, again suggesting that the binding between <b>sulfatide</b> and hemagglutinin facilitates IAV replication.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> {{can also}} be found in the kidney. Although <b>sulfatide</b> is not {{necessary}} for the kidneys to maintain their function and structure, it does play an active role in different aspects of the kidney. For example, <b>sulfatide</b> is a ligand for L-selectin, which is a receptor that {{can be found in the}} kidneys. Specifically, L-selectin is a lymphoid receptor, and the binding between L-selectin and <b>sulfatide</b> in the kidney’s interstitium plays a major role in monocyte permeation and infiltration into the kidney. Additionally, <b>sulfatide</b> is also found in the glandular stomach epithelium and in the apical membranes of the distal kidney tubuli where Myelin and lymphocyte protein(MAL) is expressed. MAL forms complexes with <b>sulfatide</b> and other glycosphingolipids, and these complexes have been shown to play a role in apical sorting and stabilization of sphingoglycolipid enriched areas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group.

Accumulation of <b>sulfatide</b> can cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade <b>sulfatide.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Sulfatide</b> shows {{involvement}} in HIV-1 infection. gp120-gp41 are {{specific types of}} envelope glycoprotein complexes that are found on HIV-1.

This change in conformation allows the gp120 complex to interact with the chemokine co-receptor and the insertion of the fusion peptide, gp41, into the membrane of the host cell. This allows the HIV-1 virus to enter into the cell. Gp120 can also bind to glycolipids like <b>sulfatide</b> and galactocerebroside (GalCer). <b>Sulfatide</b> binds strongly to the V3 loop of gp120, which does not interact with CD4.
