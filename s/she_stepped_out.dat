2500|$|Dennett {{also has}} a {{response}} to the [...] "Mary the color scientist" [...] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, learn something new if <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> of her black and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew [...] "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the [...] "quale" [...] of color. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.|$|E
