5000|$|The tension [...] in {{the rope}} {{in the final}} {{situation}} is increased {{with respect to the}} initial state. Therefore, the rope is elongated a bit. This means that not all surface particles of the rope can have held their initial position on the bollard surface. During the loading process, the rope slipped a little bit along the bollard surface in the slip area [...] This slip is precisely large enough to get to the elongation that occurs in the final state. Note that there is no slipping going on in the final state; the term slip area refers to the slippage that occurred during the loading process. Note further that the location of the slip area depends on the initial state and the loading process. If the initial tension is [...] and the tension is reduced to [...] at the <b>slack</b> <b>side,</b> then the slip area occurs at the <b>slack</b> <b>side</b> of the contact area. For initial tensions between [...] and , there can be slip areas on both sides with a stick area in between.|$|E

David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the <b>slack,</b> greedy <b>side</b> of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|R

Mathematical models are built using the response surface method based on simulation results whereby good fitness is achieved. The singular and cross interactive effect of each predictor on the neck moment are analyzed. The number of significant parameters affecting the neck moment is shown {{to be the largest}} for wide impact angles (ϕ≥ 60 °) and the impact angle parameter is largely revealed to be the most sensitive. An ideal safe range for low neck moment has been established to be within ϕ angles 45 ° and 65 °. It is further shown that the nature of all parameters effect on the neck moment is highly dependent on the impact angle range...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which the oscillations, and the forces thus produced, in a chain drive, working at moderate and high speed, can be calculated. Since the outer system affects the result it has been necessary to include this in the model. The mass of the chain {{is included in the}} model and both the gravitational forces and the inertia forces in the chain are taken into account. The elasticity in the links is included. The sprockets are connected by two spans, both of which have {{to be included in the}} model to fulfill the equilibrium equations for the rollers in contact with the sprockets. The position of the chain is given by the geometric conditions as well as the equilibrium condition. On the <b>slack</b> <b>side</b> a chain tensioner is used to reduce the tansverse oscillation, which occur at higher speeds...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods are}} {{presented}} {{to calculate the}} load distribution in a chain drive containing two sprockets and one chain. The rollers, which are {{in contact with the}} sprockets, can move along the tooth flanks and their positions are given by force equilibrium. Since the positions of the rollers, and thereby also the load distribution, depend on the two connecting spans, it has been necessary to include these in all three models. Firstly, the position of the chain in the spans and the rollers in contact with the sprockets are calculated using static condition. The compatibility for the different parts is discussed and a solution procedure is presented in which the boundary conditions are given for when a roller enters or leaves a sprocket. A few special cases are also studied. It is shown that the rollers are in contact with the sprockets at different radii depending on the load, the undeformed pitch of the chain, and the position along the sprocket. The difference in polygon action according to previous model is also studied. This difference is big enough to suspect a significant influence on a dynamic model. The theory is also verified in experiments. Secondly, a chain drive working at higher speed is studied, which means the chain drive must be studied under dynamic oscillations. Therefore the equations of motion are used instead of the static equilibrium for the global system. Since the outer system affects the results, a simplified model of the outer geometry has been used. The moments of inertia in both the sprockets and the surrounding are included in the model but not the inertia forces in the chain. All friction is neglected even if a viscous damping is introduced to get a stabile solution. The response frequencies were shown to coincide with the parametric resonance frequencies, which are multiples of the natural vibration frequency for the chain. It is also shown that the amplitude of the stretching force for other speeds, not equal to a multiple of natural response speed, also increases with higher speeds. Contrary to the amplitude of the stretching force in the span, which increases very much with higher speeds, the error in gear ratio will not increase much with higher speed except for the natural response speeds. Finally, the inertia forces in the chain are taken into account which includes the oscillation in transverse direction as well as in longitudinal direction. The model of the chain part which contacts the sprockets, take care of both the inertias in tangential direction and the centrifugal forces. A chain tensioner has been used to reduce the oscillation on the <b>slack</b> <b>side.</b> The influence of the approximation made is also discussed. The results show that there is a great influence from the mass of the chain on the stretching force in the two spans and most of the transverse vibration comes from the impact force when a new roller comes into contact with a sprocket...|$|E
50|$|Formed in 1989 {{by college}} {{and high school}} friends Zabrecky, Celso Chavez, and Bryan Kovacs (drums and percussion) the group took their name from a {{suspected}} murderer mentioned on television show America's Most Wanted. Initially performing as a trio, they mixed haphazard punk-folk compositions with store-front theatre to some measurable success, primarily performing at LA art/coffeehouses (Bebop Records & Fine Art, Jabberjaw, Pik-Me-Up). The following year, longtime friends and former schoolmates Robert O’Sullivan (guitar/organ/keyboards) and Rich Truel (drums) were enlisted and together a fuller musical range was explored. Chronicling their hometown's east <b>side</b> <b>slacker</b> life with a pop-rock sensibility, the band incorporated influences from the Talking Heads, Human Hands, Wall of Voodoo, Dream Syndicate and Camper Van Beethoven.|$|R
