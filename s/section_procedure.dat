5000|$|The frozen <b>section</b> <b>procedure</b> {{as practiced}} today in medical {{laboratories}} {{is based on}} the description by Dr Louis B. Wilson in 1905. Wilson developed the technique from earlier reports at the request of Dr William Mayo, surgeon and {{one of the founders of}} the Mayo Clinic [...] Earlier reports by Dr Thomas S. Cullen at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore also involved frozen section, but only after formalin fixation, and pathologist Dr William Welch, also at Hopkins, experimented with Cullen's procedure but without clinical consequences. Hence, Wilson is generally credited with truly pioneering the procedure (Gal & Cagle, 2005).|$|E

5000|$|As Nicholas Athanasou he {{has written}} widely on bone, joint and soft tissue {{pathology}} and on the pathobiology of osteoarticular cells and tissues. With TJ Chambers he developed the osteoclast lacunar bone resorption assay system. His work {{was the first to}} show that the human osteoclast shares specific surface antigens with macrophages and that the mononuclear human osteoclast precursor circulates in the (CD14+) monocyte fraction. This led to the discovery of cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathological bone resorption associated with primary and secondary bone tumours, particularly breast cancer metastasis, Ewing sarcoma [...] and giant cell-rich lesions such as giant cell tumour of bone and pigmented villonodular synovitis. In addition, his work has studied synovial and inflammatory macrophages and their role in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infection and Paget disease. His work on hip and knee implants focused on the importance of biomaterial wear particles on promoting osteoclast formation, osteolysis and implant loosening. He also characterised inflammatory criteria for the histological diagnosis of infection using frozen <b>section</b> <b>procedure</b> [...] and was the first to provide a pathological description of pseudotumors associated with metal on metal hip implants.|$|E
5000|$|Cryostat {{are used}} in {{medicine}} to cut histological slides. They are usually used in a process called frozen section histology (see Frozen <b>section</b> <b>procedure).</b> The cryostat is essentially an ultrafine [...] "deli-slicer", called a microtome, placed in a freezer. The cryostat is usually a stationary upright freezer, with an external wheel for rotating the microtome. The temperature can be varied, depending on the tissue being cut - usually from minus 20 to minus 30 degree Celsius. The freezer is either powered by electricity, or by a refrigerant like liquid nitrogen. Small portable cryostats are available and can run off generators or vehicle inverters. To minimize unnecessary warming all necessary mechanical movements of the microtome {{can be achieved by}} hand via a wheel mounted outside the chamber. Newer microtomes have electric push button advancement of the tissue. The precision of the cutting is in micrometres. Tissue are sectioned as thin as 1 micrometre. Usual histology slides are mounted with a thickness of about 7 micrometres. Specimens that are soft at room temperature are mounted on a cutting medium (often made of egg white) on a metal [...] "chuck", and frozen to cutting temperature (for example at -20 degrees C). Once frozen, the specimen on the chuck is mounted on the microtome. The crank is rotated and the specimen advances toward the cutting blade. Once the specimen is cut to a satisfactory quality, it is mounted on a warm (room temperature) clear glass slide, where it will instantaneously melt and adhere. The glass slide and specimen is dried with a dryer or air dried, and stained. The entire process from mounting to reading the slide takes from 10 to 20 minutes, allowing rapid diagnosis in the operating room, for the surgical excision of cancer. The cryostat can be used to cut histology and tissue slide (e.g., for enzyme localization) outside of medicine, but the quality of the section is poor compared to standard fixed section wax mounted histology.|$|E

40|$|Surveillance of {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) {{is an important}} infection control activity. The Caesarean <b>section</b> <b>procedure</b> was selected, {{as part of the}} Scottish Surveillance of Healthcare Associated Infection Programme, to monitor and report upon the incidence of SSI. Data were collected prospectively for 715 patients undergoing a Caesarean <b>section</b> <b>procedure</b> for 35 weeks during the latter months of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003. Of these, 80 (11. 2 %) patients developed an SSI, 57 (71 %) of which were detected by postdischarge surveillance. Risk factors associated with infection were analysed. The choice of subcuticular suture rather than staples to close the surgical site was associated with a significantly lower incidence of infection (P = 0. 021). Obese women experienced significantly more infections than women with a normal body mass index (P = 0. 028). Dissemination of the surveillance results has made clinicians aware of the influence of body mass index and choice of skin closure in relation to SSI in this patient population. Analysis of these data has led to a review of local practice. The results also indicate the importance of postdischarge surveillance if SSIs are to be detected in this patient group. Continuous data collection and timely dissemination of the results are important factors acting as the catalyst for a review of practice...|$|E

Recently proposed novel boundary integral equation formulations of these problems are discussed. It is usual in practical computations to truncate the infinite rough surface, solving a boundary integral equation on a finite section of the boundary, of length 2 A, say. In the case of surfaces of small amplitude and slope we prove the stability and convergence as A→∞ of this approximation procedure. For surfaces of arbitrarily large amplitude and/or surface slope we prove stability and convergence of a modified finite <b>section</b> <b>procedure</b> in which the truncated boundary is ‘flattened’ in finite neighbourhoods of its two endpoints.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} intelligent memory, a new memory architecture {{capable of}} providing efficient lock-free synchronization. In the intelligent memory, a sequence of operations on a shared object associated with that memory module can be processed without any intervention so that an environment for the synchronization can be provided by executing a critical section itself in that memory module. For this, we present a memory architecture for intelligent memory having minimal instruction set and develop a programming model, called Critical <b>Section</b> <b>Procedure</b> (CSP), which consists of a shared data structure and operations on it. Intelligent memory is intended to eliminate waste of processing time such as busy waiting in spin lock and retry due to process contention in existing lock-free synchronization schemes.

40|$|The monodermal {{teratoma}} struma ovarii {{is a rare}} ovarian tumour; however, struma ovarii presenting with pseudo-Meigs’ {{syndrome and}} raised cancer antigen (CA) - 125 levels is even rarer. In elderly patients, this presentation can potentially lead to a misdiagnosis of a malignant ovarian carcinoma, resulting in unnecessary extensive surgery. We report a 55 -year-old female who presented to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, New Delhi, India, in 2016 with progressive abdominal discomfort, fatigue and abdominal distention. Clinical and radiological features were indicative of a malignant ovarian tumour and ascites. Serum CA- 125 levels were elevated at 258 U/mL.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the multi-objective {{optimization}} of an industrial Isoprene production unit by using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The chemical process consists basically of a dimerization reactor and a separation column train.

Then, {{the aim of this}} paper is to present and discuss the applicability of a GA as an alternative procedure for a multi-objective optimization of an industrial process that may be difficult to handle by classical methods. In this case the optimization of the entire plant involves 21 variables to be optimized.
