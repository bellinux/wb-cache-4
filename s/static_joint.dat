40|$|Leaking, {{friction}} and wear of seals are concerns for machine designers and users everywhere. Although perfect sealing {{may be the}} general aim, in practice, considering apparently identical seals in the same application, some may seal while some may not. This is due, at least in part, to surface-related random phenomena. Therefore, the importance of considering the reliability of sealed joints cannot be overemphasized. Up to now, there is no paper in the published literature about the reliability analysis of <b>static</b> sealed <b>joints.</b> All of these facts provide the motivation for the current research work. A computer simulation model for the leakage analysis of <b>static</b> sealed <b>joints</b> has been developed based on the percolation theory. The features of the leakage simulation model can be concluded as follows: (1) It reveals the effect of random properties of rough surfaces on the sealing performance and {{makes it possible to}} apply the statistical concepts in discussing the sealing reliability of static sealed joints; (2) It provides much simpler and more economic tool for the statistical analysis of leakage by computer simulation than by experiments; (3) It makes it possible to describe the leakage phenomenon more accurately using the leakage path model instead of the clearance between surface centre-lines; (4) It eliminates the need for individual asperity model of rough surfaces, because the actual digitized surface is used directly. The relationship between the leakage probability and the applied load, which is of great general interest to the designers of <b>static</b> sealed <b>joints,</b> has been predicted by the leakage simulation model. The simulated results show that for a given leakage probability, the required load will increase as the value of RMS o height a increases or the value of correlation length decreases. It is confirmed that a certain value of contact ratio can be used as the criterion for identifying the reliability of <b>static</b> sealed <b>joints</b> with a certain confidence level. The contact ratio criterion provides a simple, inexpensive and useful tool to evaluate the effects of rough surfaces, material properties and applied load on the sealing reliability of <b>static</b> sealed <b>joints.</b> However, in order to be of practical use, experimental work is required to evaluate its validity...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{assessment}} of the joint space thickness is an important clinical parameter for diagnosing osteoarthritis. The accuracy of joint space thickness evaluation from radiographs is limited due to anatomical complexity of the wrist. We propose using distance maps estimated from 3 -dimensional and 4 -dimensional images reflecting joint space thickness distribution over the relevant part of the articular surface. Methods In this paper we investigate the difference between joint space thicknesses acquired from dynamic distance maps to static distance maps. A dynamic distance map gives for every point on a subchondral bone surface the shortest distance to the opposing subchondral bone surface during wrist motion. We hypothesize that the joint space thickness calculated from dynamic distance maps provide a better reflection of the functional joint space thickness. The diagnostic potential of the dynamic joint space thickness measurement is illustrated by comparing data from distance maps of osteoarthritic wrists with normal wrists. Findings In 10 healthy wrists which are examined, dynamic joint space thickness is smaller than static acquired joint space thickness suggesting that dynamic distance maps provide a better estimate of the measured joint space thickness than joint space thickness based on a <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> space thickness. In 3 examined osteoarthritic wrists the joint space thickness is smaller than in healthy individuals. Moreover, the difference between dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> space thickness is smaller in pathological joint parts.

40|$|Joint lubrication, {{synovial}} fluid conservation and many pathophysiological processes depend on hyaluronan (HA). Intra-articular HA injection and exercise, which stimulates articular HA production, ameliorate osteoarthritis. We therefore investigated the pathways regulating movement-stimulated articular HA secretion rate () in vivo. Endogenous HA {{was removed from}} the knee joint cavity of anaesthetised rabbits by washout. Joints were then cycled passively or remained static for 5 h, with/without intra-articular agonist/inhibitor, after which newly secreted HA was harvested for analysis. Movement almost doubled. Similar or larger increases were elicited in <b>static</b> <b>joints</b> by the intra-articular Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin, prostaglandin E 2, cAMP-raising agents, serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC-stimulated secretion was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and inhibitors of the downstream kinases MEK-ERK (U 0126, PD 98059). These agents inhibited movement-stimulated secretion of HA (MSHA) only when the parallel p 38 kinase path was simultaneously inhibited by SB 203580 (ineffective alone). The phospholipase C inhibitor U 73122 almost fully blocked MSHA (P= 0. 001, n= 10), without affecting static. The ENaC channel blocker amiloride inhibited MSHA, whereas other inhibitors of stretch-activated channels (Gd 3 +, ruthenium red, SKF 96365) did not. It is proposed that MSHA may be mediated by PLC activation, leading to activation of parallel PKC–MEK–ERK and p 38 kinase pathways...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{hypothesis}} that the secretion of the joint lubricant hyaluronan (HA) is coupled to movement has implications for normal function and osteoarthritis, and was tested in the knee joints of anaesthetized rabbits. After washing out the endogenous synovial fluid HA (miscibility coefficient 0. 4), secretion into the joint cavity was measured over 5 h in <b>static</b> <b>joints</b> and in passively cycled <b>joints.</b> The net <b>static</b> secretion rate (11. 2 ± 0. 7 μg h− 1, mean ± s. e. m., n = 90) correlated with the variable endogenous HA mass (mean 367 ± 8 μg), with a normalized value of 3. 4 ± 0. 2 μg h− 1 (100 μg) − 1. Cyclic joint movement approximately doubled the net HA secretion rate to 22. 6 ± 1. 2 μg h− 1 (n = 77) and raised the normalized percentage to 5. 9 ± 0. 3 μg h− 1 (100 μg) − 1. Secretion was inhibited by 2 -deoxyglucose and iodoacetate, confirming active secretion. The net accumulation rate underestimated true secretion rate due to some trans-synovial loss. HA turnover time (endogenous mass/secretion rate) was 17 – 30 h (static) to 8 – 15 h (moved) The results demonstrate {{for the first time}} that the active secretion of HA is coupled to joint usage. Movement–secretion coupling may protect joints against the damaging effects of repetitive joint use, replace HA lost during periods of immobility (overnight), and contribute to the clinical benefit of exercise therapy in moderate osteoarthritis...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical systems present several contact {{surfaces}} between deformable bodies. The contact interface can {{be either}} <b>static</b> (<b>joints)</b> or in sliding (active interfaces). The sliding interfaces can have several roles and according to their application they can be developed either for maximizing the friction coefficient and the energy dissipation (e. g. brakes) or rather to allow the relative displacement at joints with a maximum efficiency. In both cases the coupling between system and local contact dynamics can bring to system dynamics instabilities (e. g. brake squeal or squeaking of hip prostheses). This results in unstable vibrations of the system, induced by the oscillation of the contact forces. In the literature, {{a large number of}} works deal with such kind of instabilities and are mainly focused on applied problems such as brake squeal noise. This paper shows a more general numerical analysis of a simple system constituted by two bodies in sliding contact: a rigid cylinder rotating inside a deformable one. The parametrical Complex Eigenvalue Analysis and the transient numerical simulations show how the friction forces can give rise to in-plane dynamic instabilities due to the interaction between two system modes, even for such a simple system characterized by one deformable body. Results from transient simulations highlight the key role of realistic values of the material damping to have convergence of the model and, consequently, reliable physical results. To this aim an experimental estimation of the material damping has been carried out. Moreover, the simplicity of the system allows for a deeper analysis of the contact instability and a balance of the energy flux among friction, system vibrations and damping. The numerical results have been validated by comparison with experimental ones, obtained by a specific test bench developed to reproduce and analyze the contact friction instabilities.

40|$|Joint {{replenishment}} {{problems are}} commonly encountered in purchasing, manufacturing, and transportation planning. Literature evaluates various algorithmic approaches for solving the joint replenishment {{problem in a}} static environment, but their relative performance in a dynamic rolling horizon system is unknown. This research experimentally evaluates nine joint replenishment lot-sizing heuristics and policy design variables when implemented in a dynamic rolling schedule environment. The findings indicate that a single algorithm does excel on both dimensions of schedule cost and stability. Hence, management must trade off these two performance metrics when choosing the best approach for their specific problem. Generally, metaheuristics provide the best cost replenishment schedule, but forward pass based heuristics yield the most stable schedules. The results also indicate that the choice of lot-sizing heuristic is the major cost performance driver in rolling planning systems, with policy design variables (frozen interval and planning horizon length) having little impact.

40|$|The {{roles of}} surface {{roughness}} and of surface flatness {{in determining the}} properties of structural joints are discussed. A method of measuring the effects of errors of form on joint stiffness is given. Measurements of the dynamic stiffness of annular bolted joints were taken for varying preloads and on joints with different surface finishes. Results obtained were of a form not previously seen. It was determined that the joint motion was {{the combination of a}} normal joint motion, which was uniform across the joint, and a dynamic deformation of the joint planforms resulting from the superimposition of a uniform dynamic load on to the non-uniform <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> preload provided by the bolts. This dynamic deformation varied as a function of position within the joint and in consequence the dynamic motion of the joint was not uniform with position. It was found that the phase relationship between the applied dynamic force and the resultant joint motion varied markedly with both bolt load and excitation frequency. A two degree of freedom mathematical model was developed to account for the unusual changes in the phase and magnitude of the dynamic joint stiffness, with these parameters. This model includes a negative stiffness. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the existence of this negative stiffness and a method was then developed for determining the static motion of a rectangular joint subjected to nonuniform loading...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of a relatively low intracellular Na+:K+ ratio {{is essential for the}} functioning {{of a wide range of}} cellular processes, and is achieved principally by the activity of the membrane-bound Na+, K(+) -ATPase. Chondrocytes, the cells of articular cartilage, exist in an ionic environment where the free extracellular [Na+] is higher (250 - 400 mM) than that of most other tissues (approximately 140 mM) owing to the fixed negative charges on glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix. This can increase further during <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> loading when fluid expression occurs. To determine aspects of how chondrocytes regulate their ionic composition, in this study, the in situ distribution, pattern of isoform expression and density of the Na+, K(+) -ATPase within cartilage has been investigated. The density of the Na+, K(+) -ATPase was found to be high in the mid-zone, but lower in the surface and deep zones. Immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies to the catalytic alpha subunits of the Na+, K(+) -ATPase revealed the expression of isoforms alpha 1 and alpha 3. Alterations to the extracellular [Na+] (from 80 - 220 mM, or 120 - 220 mM) significantly elevated Na+, K(+) -ATPase density of in situ chondrocytes. The results indicate that the Na+, K(+) -ATPase is abundantly expressed in articular chondrocytes and its density is sensitive to the extracellular [Na+]. The expression of the alpha 3 isoform is surprising for a non-neuronal cell, and may indicate a physiological adaptation to the unusually high extracellular [Na+] to which chondrocytes are exposed in the extracellular matrix of cartilage...|$|E

40|$|A joint's normal {{mechanical}} history {{contributes to}} the maintenance of articular cartilage and underlying bone. Loading facilitates the flow of nutrients into cartilage and waste products away, and additionally provides the mechanical signals essential for normal cell and tissue maintenance. Deleteriously low or high contact stresses have been presumed to result in joint deterioration, and particular aspects of the mechanical environment may facilitate repair of damaged cartilage. For decades, investigators have explored <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> contact stresses (under some more or less arbitrary condition) as a surrogate of the relevant mechanical history. Contact stresses have been estimated in vitro in many joints and in a number of species, although only rarely in vivo. Despite a number of widely varying techniques (and spatial resolutions) to measure these contact stresses, reported ranges of static peak normal stresses are relatively similar from joint to joint across species, and in the range of 0. 5 to 5. 0 MPa. This suggests vertebrate diarthrodial joints have evolved to achieve similar mechanical design criteria. Available evidence also suggests some disorders of cartilage deterioration are associated with somewhat higher peak pressures ranging from 1 - 20 MPa, but overlapping the range of normal pressures. Some evidence and considerable logic suggests static contact stresses per se do not predict cartilage responses, but rather temporal aspects of the contact stress history. Static contact stresses may therefore not be a reasonable surrogate for biomechanical studies. Rather, temporal and spatial aspects of the loading history undoubtedly induce beneficial and deleterious biological responses. Finally, since all articular cartilage experiences similar stresses, the concept of a "weight-bearing" versus a "non-weight-bearing" joint seems flawed, and should be abandoned...|$|E

Forty-six joints (using 23 specimens) were subjected to either static or combined static/cyclic loading at ambient room temperature. Ten specimens (five batches of two) had bolted connections without injected resin and were included to provide baseline <b>static</b> <b>joint</b> strengths. Sikadur®- 30 and RenGel®-SW 404 were the two cold-curing epoxy based resins used to fabricate the 13 RIBJ specimens. Testing was conducted with double lap-shear joints in accordance with modified guidance from Annex G and Annex K in standard BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008. The specimen’s geometry was established using this British Standard and an American Society of Civil Engineers pre-standard for pultruded thin-walled structures. Rectangular plates for the lap joints were cut from either a wide flange section of size 254 × 254 × 9. 53 mm or a flat sheet of 6. 35 mm thickness.

In each trial, six sequential ramp-and-hold movements (2 - 6 °, 2 °/s, total 24 °) flexed the relaxed wrist, beginning from the angle at which the afferent was just recruited. Joint position was represented by three specific features of afferent firing patterns: the steady-state firing rate during the 4 -s hold period between ramps, the initial burst {{at the beginning of}} each ramp, and the ramp increase in firing rate later in the movement. The position sensitivity of the initial burst (1. 27 ± 0. 90 pps/°, mean ± SD) was several times higher than that of the hold period (0. 40 ± 0. 30 pps/°) and not different from that of the ramp increase in firing rate (1. 36 ± 0. 68 pps/°).

We propose a method that combines two basic techniques for motion generation: planning and optimization. The planning part is guided by a potential field function that grows a tree whose nodes are sets of possible contacts; the optimization part consists in a posture generator that checks the feasibility of contactsset candidates under constraints such as <b>static</b> stability, <b>joint</b> limits, non-desirable collisions, etc. The difference between successive nodes in the tree is exactly one contact (creation or removal). Our planner allows motion-supporting contacts to be made with any parts of each robot's links on {{any part of the}} environment: it {{can be seen as the}} generalization of motion in which walking is a particular case. Therefore, the meaning of obstacles is different from the classical usage in planning: any part of the environment is at the same time a potential support (for some parts of the robot) and an obstacle (for the remaining parts). We demonstrated our planner in various scenarios involving the HRP- 2 humanoid robot and conducted several experiments...|$|R

This document is intended to give guidance on the selection and use of test methods and environmental conditioning procedures (including accelerated testing) for generating design data and for quality assurance purposes. The document is primarily concerned with structural applications. Guidance is provided on specimen preparation, hot/wet conditioning and testing of bulk adhesives and adhesive <b>joints.</b> <b>Static,</b> cyclic fatigue and creep rupture testing are covered. Consideration {{is given to the}} effect of material and geometric factors on <b>joint</b> performance under <b>static,</b> cyclic and creep loading, and hostile environments.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a general analysis of the evolution of the funding models of the Spanish Autonomous Communities (regional level) during the last decade and explore the main achievements of the new model (2001). In particular, the funding models that have been applied during these years are assessed comparing their results with the proponsed objectives that they tried to meet. Finally, special attention is paid to the developments achieved by the new model with respect to the previous one in terms of economic sufficiency (<b>static</b> and dynamic), <b>joint</b> responsibility for taxation and interregional solidarity measures. Key words: Federalismo Fiscal, Spanish Autonomous Communities, Economic Sufficiency, Fiscal Corresponsability, Interregional Solidarity. JEL classification: H 7, H 72, H 7...|$|R
