5|$|A <b>soup</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{was built}} in 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Olga was {{genuinely}} popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage {{founded by the}} previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support {{and the support of}} wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a <b>soup</b> <b>kitchen</b> in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.|$|E

40|$|Thousands of loosely {{connected}} {{organizations such}} as food pantries and <b>soup</b> <b>kitchens</b> constitute the emergency food network. Organizations in this network provide a critical source of food to millions of households each year. This dissertation examines how organizations in one city-level emergency food network acquire, manage, and use resources. It pays {{particular attention to the}} relationships that develop between organizations and funding sources. Utilizing institutional ethnography, this dissertation explicates the ways that everyday food provision in food pantries and <b>soup</b> <b>kitchens</b> is connected to a broader picture of changing modes of governance in the public and nonprofit sectors.

50|$|While {{societies}} {{have been using}} various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first <b>soup</b> <b>kitchens</b> in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century.

In the United States and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century during the Great Depression. With the improved economic conditions that followed World War II, <b>soup</b> <b>kitchens</b> became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States there was a resurgence in the use of <b>soup</b> <b>kitchens</b> following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.|$|R
