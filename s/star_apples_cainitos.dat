40|$|AbstractKenitu or <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> (Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> L.) {{is widely}} used as {{traditional}} remedy for inflammation, cancer, and diabetes mellitus. Leaves of four type of kenitu were extracted with different solvents, i. e., 96 % of ethanol, 70 % of ethanol, 50 % of ethanol, 96 % of acetonee, 70 % of acetone, and 50 % of acetone. The extracts have been screened for antioxidant activities using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content. The study showed that 70 % of ethanol extracts exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. The type 2 samples exhibited the highest total phenolic content, while type 1 samples had the highest total flavonoid content...|$|R
40|$|<b>Star</b> <b>apple</b> or Chrysophyllum <b>cainito</b> L., family Sapotaceae; {{which is}} {{indigenous}} in Central America has been grown locally arround Jember, East Java. Ethnobotanical data exhibits its medicinal properties such as: soothing inflammation in laringitis and pneumonia, treatment for diabetes mellitus and cancer remedy which {{are related to}} free radical mechanism. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} determine its free radical scavenger activity. There are three types of Jemberâ€™s <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> fruit (local name: kenitu) : big size, green color with round shape (kenitu hijau bulat); medium size, green color with oval shape (kenitu hijau lonjong); and small size, red purplish color with round shape (kenitu merah bulat). Previous research shown that both water and methanol extracts of kenitu hijau lonjong has DPPH free radical scavenger activity as its antioxidant capacity. In recent research the DPPH free radical scavenger activity was performed on both water and methanol extract of these three types of kenitu. The results showed that kenitu merah bulat exhibits the highest antioxidant activity of these three types with IC 50 = 426. 118 and 169. 094 ppm for methanol and water extracts sequentially in 60 th minutes. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to study the effect of storage environment and packaging media on the disease incidence and weight loss of stored African <b>Star</b> <b>Apple</b> (Chrysophyllum albidum). Three storage environments were identified in this study namely- evaporative cooling basket, refrigerator and ambient storage and freshly harvested ripe African <b>star</b> <b>apples</b> were wrapped in perforated polythene, moist jute material and without packaging and stored under these three storage environment. The apples were observed for deteriorations mediated by microbial infection and insect infestation. Manifestation of infestation which affected the shelf-life of African <b>Star</b> <b>Apple</b> was delayed most in the refrigerator. The level of infestation of the apples stored in evaporative cooling basket was next to the refrigerator in the decreasing order. Weight losses were lower in apples wrapped with moist jute sack (0. 48 % ± 1. 6) stored in refrigerator than those wrapped with perforated polythene (0. 79 % ± 1. 2) and unwrapped (1. 45 % ± 1. 4). Similar wrapping effects were obtained in the evaporative cooling basket and ambient. Weight losses were lower in apples stored in refrigerator (0. 91 %) than in the evaporative cooling basket (2. 84 %) and ambient shade (7. 41 %) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding graded levels (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 %) of {{untreated}} African <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> kernel meal (ASAKM) {{on the performance}} and blood profile of broilers was investigated in an 8 -week trial. Two hundred and ten oneweek-old Cobb strain broiler chicks were randomly allotted to 7 diets with 3 replicates of 10 chicks per replicate in a completely randomized design. Data on minerals, vitamins, amino acids and quantification of some anti-nutrients were assayed. The {{results showed that the}} kernel was high in nutrients, especially carbohydrate as a source of energy but contains high levels of anti-nutritional or toxic factors. Performance traits (p 0. 05). Increasing levels of ASAKM in diets caused elevation of AST, ALT, ALP and a significant increase in blood urea levels in the raw kernel meal based diets relative to the control diet (p< 0. 05). Based on the performance of the birds fed the raw ASAKM, it may be concluded that broilers could barely tolerate 5 % raw ASAKM in their diets with minimum adverse effects. However, the values of the blood parameters particularly the red blood cells favoured erythropoiesis, suggesting that the African <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> kernel meal had no detrimental effect on the health status of the birds. Subsequent research should process the raw <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> seed meal before dietary inclusion for optimum results...|$|R
