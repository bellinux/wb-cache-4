30|$|The {{main idea}} is to {{calculate}} the <b>suspension</b> <b>clearance</b> h and the change rate of floating gap at the current time based on the previous maglev vehicle and bridge response. It can be substituted into the suspension controller equation for the current control voltage u and solved for the time-varying current i according to the solenoid system loop equation. The electromagnetic force f at the current moment can be calculated. Finally, the current maglev vehicle and bridge response {{can be obtained by}} solving the vibration equation. Repeating the above process, the entire maglev vehicle bridge vibration response of the whole process can be solved.|$|E
30|$|The in-train {{stability}} {{problems have}} been reported in the area of long freight cars and locomotives. The signal synchronization, in-train forces and rotational angles of couplers are the main indicators to train derailment accident. A large number of scholars has focused on the theoretical and testing studies of longitudinal train dynamics. In Australia, Cole [3, 4] studied the in-train stability problems of freight cars. It was indicated that the lateral and vertical rotational behavior of coupler occurred during compressed in-train forces, which further arose train derailment accidents. Similar safety issues due to coupler jackknifing behavior had also been reported in Canada [5]. In China, the investigation of derailment accident in Da-Qin heavy haul railway showed that the coupler lateral rotations occurred under compressed forces. The lateral force components lead to a dramatic increase in wheel axle lateral forces which even causes the rail shift and rollover phenomenon [6, 7, 8]. The Association of American Railroads stipulates that the freight car should be able to pass the curve with a radius of 175  m under the buffer force of 890  kN [9]. According to UIC 530 - 2 [10], the allowable coupler force of freight cars is determined on the S-shaped curve with a radius of 150  m. Normally, the longitudinal impacts of EMUs in normal operations are not noticeable. However, according to previous studies, the in-train stability problem for train to train rescue scenarios cannot be neglected. Significant in-train force occurs due to the braking applied by the assisting train. The combination of coupler force and pitch motion leads to a vertical force component, which further causes the destruction to coupler yoke and the interference of in-train equipment. Based on theoretical and dynamic calculations, the coupler length, free rotational angle, braking level, train configuration as well as <b>suspension</b> <b>clearance</b> will affect the longitudinal train dynamic performance [11, 12].|$|E

50|$|Tax {{clearance}} is {{the largest}} source of Palestinian public income. In 2014, it accounted for 75% of the total revenue. Israel collects taxes on Palestinian imports, and national insurance and income taxes from labor {{on behalf of the}} PA and transfers the results on monthly basis. This makes the PA vulnerable to unilateral <b>suspension</b> of <b>clearance</b> revenue transfers by Israel. In 2014-2015, the revenue was about $160 million per month.|$|R

50|$|The large {{proportion}} of Israeli-collected taxes in the PA's budget makes the PA vulnerable to unilateral <b>suspension</b> of <b>clearance</b> revenue transfers by Israel. As early as 1997, Israel began to abuse the clearance system for political reasons and to unilaterally settle bills unpaid by Palestinians. Israel has frequently suspended {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for accumulated periods of some 4 years. While the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation unilaterally issues excessive late payment penalties and interest charges, Israel did not pay interest on money it did not transfer to the PA.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} feasibility of implementing electronic transmission of driver convictions, license <b>suspensions,</b> court <b>clearances</b> and vacate data from Oregon courts to the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV). Presently nearly 810, 000 transactions are sent annually from the Oregon court system (which includes all municipal, justice, and circuit courts) to the DMV using a nearly entirely paper-based process. This research documented the current business processes and workflows used to exchange driver information for both the DMV and Oregon courts, identified risks and limitations associated with the current processes, assessed current information technology capabilities and infrastructure of Oregon courts and DMV, and determined high-level benefits. The research included interviews with key agencies, {{a state of the}} practice review, and a survey of all municipal and justice courts in Oregon. The response rate for this survey was approximately 90 %. The research found that electronic data transmission can have a number of benefits for both DMV and the Oregon court system.

5000|$|CRI in {{particular}} offers especially broad protection to service members and {{employees of the}} Defense Intelligence Community through the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Program because CRI is the lead federal investigative entity reviewing security clearance decision-making as a pretext for reprisal. This is done under the Inspector General’s authority, and not through an application of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Section 2302 of title 5 lists twelve distinct prohibited personnel practices that, when following a disclosure of wrongdoing, may constitute a whistleblower reprisal. Severe actions such as termination, reassignment, or demotion are included among these title 5-defined adverse actions; however, security clearance decision-making and other adverse personnel security decisions {{are not covered by}} the Whistleblower Protection Act. Since intelligence and counterintelligence employment is absolutely contingent upon gaining and maintaining a security clearance, review of security clearance decision-making used as a pretext for reprisal is necessary in the protection of Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers. For this reason, CRI investigates reprisal allegations regarding security determinations through the IG Act, which is not limited by [...] exemptions for intelligence and counterintelligence agencies. Accordingly, a revocation of a security clearance is reviewable as a pretext for reprisal. In its reports of investigation reviewing security clearance decisions, CRI classifies a negative action taken by a responsible management official as a “unfavorable personnel security determination” (USPD) and then applies title 5 standards to its review. In addition to the actions included under the definition of a UPSD, CRI also investigates <b>suspension</b> of security <b>clearances</b> as well as recommendations to an agency’s central adjudication facility to revoke, deny, or suspend security clearances as possible unfavorable personnel security determinations. While not actionable in and of themselves, suspensions and recommendations to a CAF are examined by CRI because they may constitute contributing pretexts to reprisal through security determination. By identifying these measures as actionable unfavorable personnel security determinations, CRI is able to provide broad protection to whistleblowers within the DoD intelligence community.|$|R
40|$|Neutral red is a weakly {{cationic}} dye that is soluble in water, {{has a low}} toxicity for almost all classes of organisms, and {{has been used as}} a histological and vital stain since the early twentieth century. Estimating the volume of water cleared of indicator material by <b>suspension</b> feeding bivalves (<b>clearance</b> or filtration rate) was one of the earliest applications of neutral red; however, less than thirty studies have applied this methodology since it was first described in 1954. The feeding/clearance rate is used as a sensitive indicator of physiological stress and is therefore an early-warning tool that is suitable for monitoring the ecological status of water bodies. The aim of our study was to optimise a clearance index based on neutral red solution by addressing the effect of i) the acidifying pH; ii) the holding temperature before spectrophotometric reading; and the time iii) before and iv) after the acidification of solutions of neutral red used to carry out clearance assays. Furthermore, as a case study we fine-tuned the clearance assay for the edible estuarine bivalve, Cerastoderma edule. The results showed that there were no statistical differences as regards the absorbance of neutral red solutions holding at 4 or 20  °C or a solution acidified between the ranges of pH 4 – 5. However, the absorbance significantly decreased as the pH increased to pH 6. The time before acidification had no significant effect on absorbance. Once the neutral red solution is acidified, the absorbance decreases over time, signifying that the absorbance should be read in the first 24  h. The concentration of neutral red used in the experiences should be sufficient to allow final concentrations of over 0. 5  mg/L after the clearance period, since we observed that the sensitivity of this protocol decreased at low concentrations. In the case of C. edule, the optimum clearance conditions per individual were found to be 100  ml of 4  mg/L of neutral red dye during a 30  min period in dark conditions. A bioassay using a clearance index of C. edule based on this simple colorimetric technique would appear to be a potential tool for implementation in environmental monitoring programmes for water quality assessment in accordance with European directives. We trust that the new harmonised protocol will become a widely used and cost-effective means to monitor the clearance index as an indicator of physiological stress for bivalves.

40|$|Antiviral therapy (AVT) with {{interferon}} +/– ribavirin can induce neoplastic regression without chemotherapy (CT) in low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (in particular, immunocytomas and nodal/extranodal marginal lymphomas) with associated HCV infection (HCV+). High grade, diffuse large B-cell non- Hodgkin’s lymphomas (DLBCL) are HCV+ {{in about}} 12 % {{of cases in}} Italian population. These patients show peculiar clinical characteristics, such as older age, liver damage, presence of monoclonal gammopathy (often with no clinically relevant cryoglobulinemic and/or rheumatoid activity), increased rate of autoimmune disorders and extranodal localizations. Their clinical outcome, however, is generally considered not significantly different, in terms of response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), from that of subjects with HCV negative (HCV–) DLBCL when treated with standard or even high dose CT and if significant signs of liver dysfunction are absent. In the present study we aimed to determine the possible role of AVT, performed after a standard CT treatment, in HCV+ DLBCL. We evaluated 40 HCV+ DLBCL patients (male/female ratio 25 / 15; median age 63 years, range 39 – 71) who received AVT after first complete (27 patients) or partial (13 patients) remission was achieved by frontline standard CT. Classic or modified CHOP+/– rituximab regimens were generally employed. Twenty-two patients (55 %) showed a higher (3 – 4) IPI score and twenty patients (50 %) evidenced increased ALT/AST values. A favourable HCV genotype (type 2 – 3) and a low viral load (70 /kg. A small number of patients received interferon-alpha with or without ribavirin. The planned duration of AVT ranged from 3 to 12 months and was modulated according to viral genotype and molecular response (genotype 2 : 3 months, if viral clearance obtained after 1 month, otherwise continued for 6 months; other genotypes: 3 months of treatment with following <b>suspension</b> if viral <b>clearance</b> not obtained, otherwise continued for 12 months). Sequential treatment (CT followed by AVT) was generally well tolerated. Six patients, however, interrupted AVT before three months, mainly because of general malaise or myelotoxicity. HCV clearance was obtained in 22 patients (55 %). A case-control comparison was made with a similar cohort of 40 HCV+ DBLCL patients, who did not receive AVT, matched for age, sex, IPI score, liver function, type of prior CT and response, viral load and HCV genotype. Three-year PFS was not statistically different {{between the two groups}} (52. 5 % vs 57. 5 %, p n. s.), while a trend in favour of AVT treated patients was observed in terms of three-year OS (67. 5 %% vs 57. 5 %, p= 0. 055). A weak correlation between viral clearance and longer OS duration was also observed (p= 0. 048). Interestingly, during the follow up period, severe hepatic failure developed in 5 (12. 5 %) out of patients who had not received AVT and in only one (2. 5 %) of those treated with AVT. Seventy-nine percent of relapsed patients not treated with AVT received salvage CT, compared to 100 % of AVT treated patients. Our currently available data indicate that a sequential treatment with CT followed by AVT is feasible in HCV+ DLBCL and may induce complete virus clearance in more than half of these patients. We hypothesize that a better control of the viral infection, rather than a direct or indirect antineoplastic activity of AVT, could have positive effects on the clinical outcome of patients with HCV+ DLBCL and, possibly, on their survival, i. e. by allowing the possibility of further salvage therapies and reducing that of hepatic failure...|$|R
