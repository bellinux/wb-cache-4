40|$|IntroductionOn {{behalf of}} a {{consortium}} of state and territory libraries, the Australia Library and Information Association (ALIA) commissioned SGS Economics and Planning Pty Ltd (SGS) to generate estimates of the contributions that public libraries make to Australian community welfare and Australian economic activity. To do this, SGS applied the same methodological principles that were adopted in recent Victorian and Queensland studies, which were based on two separate measurement frameworks:The net contribution public libraries make to community welfare. This contribution i <b>smeasured</b> by subtracting the costs of library service provision from the community benefits provided; with the community benefits assessed using three separate measurement techniques (i. e. financial savings, travel costs and contingent valuation methods). The economic activity induced in the economy by public library operations. This {{is a process of}} isolating the economic stimuli that public libraries introduce into the economy, and tracing how these stimuli culminate in economic activity in buyer and supplier industries through successive rounds of economic transactions. It {{is important to note that}} the results generated by these assessment frameworks are not cumulative, i. e. they cannot be added together. They answer two different questions, with the first telling us if libraries are good value investments, and the second telling us how much economic activity libraries generate through operations.  ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{establish}} tight bounds on {{the intrinsic}} cost (eitherminimizing delay d for fixed server and receiver band-widths, or minimizing server bandwidth for fixed delay and receiver bandwidth) of broadcasting a movie oflength m over a channel of bandwidth S {{in such a}} waythat a receiver (with bandwidth R), starting at an ar-bitrary time t, can download the movie so that it canbegin playback after a delay of at most d time units. Our bounds are realized by a simple abstract protocol that partitions the movie into a fixed numberof segments, partitions the server bandwidth into an equivalent number of equal bandwidth subchannels, andbroadcasts each segment repeatedly on its own subchannel. This protocol can be implemented as a concrete dis-crete protocol in which movie information is packaged into discrete fixed length packets using only a modestoverhead (measured in terms of increased delay or server bandwidth). Our primary contribution is a lower bound on the required delay that applies in a very general modelof communication. This lower bound matches the behaviour of our abstract protocol in the limit as thenumber of segments approaches infinity. We are also able to relate its behaviour to arbitrary protocols thathave a fixed number of segments. 1 Introduction Suppose we broadcast a movie using bandwidth <b>S(measured</b> in units of movie bandwidth). A person may tune their television, which can receive any R/S fractionof the bandwidth, to this channel {{at any time in}} order to watch the movie. We would like to minimize the delaybetween when they tune to the channel and when they can start watching the movie. Let m be the length of themovie (in minutes). We can certainly guarantee a delay of at most m minutes simply by repeatedly broadcastingthe movie back-to-back (as long a...|$|E
40|$|It is {{presented}} {{an approach to}} decision theory based upon nonprobabilistic uncertainty. There is an axiomatization of the hybrid probabilistic possibilistic mixtures based {{on a pair of}} triangular conorm and triangular norm satisfying restricted distributivity law, and the corresponding non-additive <b>Smeasure.</b> This is characterized by the families of operations involved in generalized mixtures, based upon a previous result on the characterization of the pair of continuous t-norm and t-conorm such that the former is restrictedly distributive over the latter. The obtained family of mixtures combines probabilistic and idempotent (possibilistic) mixtures via a threshold...|$|R
