5000|$|The first {{discussion}} of the RVB state on square lattice using the RVB picture only consider nearest neighbour bonds that connect different sub-lattices.The constructed RVB state is an equal amplitude superposition of all the nearest-neighbour bond configurations. Such a RVB state is believed to contain emergent gapless [...] gauge field which may confine the spinons etc. So the equal-amplitude nearest-neighbour RVB state on square lattice is unstable and does not corresponds to a quantum <b>spin</b> <b>phase.</b> It may describe a critical phase transition point between two stable phases. A version of RVB state which is stable and contains deconfined spinons is the chiral spin state. Later, another version of stable RVB state with deconfined spinons, the Z2 spin liquid, is proposed, which realizes the simplest topological order - Z2 topological order. Both chiral spin state and Z2 spin liquid state have long RVB bonds that connect the same sub-lattice. In chiral spin state, different bond configurations can have complex amplitudes, whilein Z2 spin liquid state, different bond configurations only have real amplitudes.The RVB state on triangle lattice also realizes the Z2 spin liquid, wheredifferent bond configurations only have real amplitudes. The toric code model is yet another realization of Z2 spin liquid (and Z2 topological order) that explicitly breaks the spin rotation symmetry and is exactly soluble.|$|E
