5|$|Low-calorie sugars and {{artificial}} sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and {{is made by}} the partial hydrolysis of starch. The added sweeteners are often aspartame, saccharin, stevia, or <b>sucralose.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucralose</b> is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a granulated form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of granulated <b>sucralose</b> includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the granulated <b>sucralose</b> provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. <b>Sucralose</b> is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, <b>sucralose</b> maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, <b>sucralose</b> begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting <b>sucralose</b> will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E
25|$|Pure <b>sucralose</b> {{is sold in}} bulk, but not in {{quantities}} {{suitable for}} individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part <b>sucralose</b> for each two parts water. A quarter teaspoon of concentrate substitutes for one cup of sugar. Pure, dry <b>sucralose</b> undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing <b>sucralose</b> add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>sucralose,</b> unlike aspartame, {{retains its}} {{sweetness}} after being heated, and {{has at least}} twice the shelf life of aspartame, {{it has become more}} popular as an ingredient. This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to <b>sucralose.</b> In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30/kg and <b>sucralose,</b> which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.|$|E
25|$|In a {{small-scale}} {{study of}} 17 obese test subjects, <b>sucralose</b> {{was found to}} affect glycemic and insulin responses, leading {{to an increase in}} peak plasma glucose concentration and insulin secretion rate. In a 2014 study, <b>sucralose</b> limited the growth of Bacteroides bacteria in vitro.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucralose</b> is {{manufactured}} by the selective chlorination of sucrose in a multistep synthesis, which substitutes {{three of the}} hydroxyl groups of sucrose with chlorine atoms. This chlorination is achieved by selective protection of a primary alcohol group, followed by chlorination of the partially acetylated sugar with excess chlorinating agent, and then by removal of the acetyl groups to give the desired <b>sucralose</b> product. A company realignment announced April 21, 2015 moved <b>sucralose</b> production from Tate & Lyle's plant on Jurong Island, Singapore to the recently reopened plant in McIntosh, Alabama.|$|E
25|$|Aspartame is {{currently}} the most popular artificial sweetener in the U.S. food industry, as the price has dropped significantly since its patent registered by Monsanto Company expired in 1992. However, <b>sucralose</b> may soon replace it, as alternative processes to Tate & Lyle's patent seem to be emerging. According to Morgan Stanley, this can mean {{that the price of}} <b>sucralose</b> will drop by thirty percent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucralose</b> {{has been}} {{accepted}} as safe by several national and international food safety regulatory bodies, including the FDA, The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives, the European Union's Scientific Committee on Food, Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare Canada, and Food Standards Australia New Zealand. According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of <b>sucralose</b> that can be consumed over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 9mg per kg of body weight per day.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sucralose</b> {{has been}} {{detected}} in natural waters. Studies {{indicate that this}} has virtually {{no impact on the}} early life development of certain animal species.|$|E
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet as}} aspartame, about two thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one third as sweet as <b>sucralose.</b> Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or <b>sucralose),</b> which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{generally}} recognized as safe by regulatory agencies {{based on information}} from a multitude of large-scale and clinical studies, <b>sucralose</b> {{has been the subject of}} a few small-scale or animal studies attempting to determine yet-unknown effects on illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015 PepsiCo {{announced}} that it would be moving from aspartame to <b>sucralose</b> for most of its diet drinks in the US, due to sales of Diet Pepsi falling by more than 5% in the US. PepsiCo says its decision is a commercial one - responding to consumer preferences.|$|E
25|$|Unlike aspartame, {{acesulfame}} potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, {{allowing it to}} be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or <b>sucralose.</b> It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.|$|E
25|$|Sweet taste {{signals the}} {{presence}} of carbohydrates in solution. Since carbohydrates {{have a very high}} calorie count (saccharides have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy (sugars) and storage of energy (glycogen). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, <b>sucralose,</b> and aspartame. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, <b>sucralose,</b> and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with {{less than half of the}} food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.|$|E
500|$|Sugar is {{the generic}} name for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, {{many of which}} are used in food. There are various types of sugar derived from {{different}} sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The [...] "table sugar" [...] or [...] "granulated sugar" [...] most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Sugar is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes) and it is added to some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into the simple sugars fructose and glucose. Other disaccharides include maltose from malted grain, and lactose from milk. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol [...] may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Diet food substitutes for sugar, include aspartame and <b>sucralose,</b> a chlorinated derivative of sucrose.|$|E
2500|$|There are few safety {{concerns}} pertaining to <b>sucralose</b> {{and the way}} <b>sucralose</b> is metabolized suggests a reduced risk of toxicity. For example, <b>sucralose</b> is extremely insoluble in fat and, thus, does not accumulate in fatty tissues; <b>sucralose</b> also does not break down and will dechlorinate only under conditions that are not found during regular digestion (i.e., high heat applied to the powder form of the molecule). [...] Only about 15% of <b>sucralose</b> is absorbed by the body {{and most of it}} passes out of the body unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|A {{research}} {{study on the}} bacteriostatic effects on six isolates introduced to <b>sucralose</b> and <b>sucralose</b> as a potential wastewater contaminant: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a {{consumer}} advocacy group for food products, downgraded <b>sucralose</b> from [...] "Safe" [...] to [...] "Caution" [...] in June 2013, citing an unpublished study linking <b>sucralose</b> consumption with leukemia risk in rats. The {{study has been}} criticized as being poorly executed and reported. The study was finally published on January 29 in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. One study linked large doses of <b>sucralose,</b> equivalent to 11,450 packets (136g) per day in a person (i.e., ~360 times the ADI of 5mg/kg BW/day), to DNA damage in mice. <b>Sucralose</b> has not shown any DNA-damaging properties in DNA repair assays at normal consumption levels, and no evidence of carcinogenicity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sucralose</b> is an {{artificial}} sweetener and sugar substitute. The majority of ingested <b>sucralose</b> is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. <b>Sucralose</b> is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times as sweet as both aspartame and [...] acesulfame potassium, and twice as sweet as sodium saccharin. [...] Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term weight loss with some data supporting weight gain and heart disease risks.|$|E
2500|$|Results {{from over}} a hundred animal and {{clinical}} studies in the FDA approval process unanimously indicated a lack of risk associated with <b>sucralose</b> consumption. When the estimated daily intake (EDI) is compared to the intake at which adverse effects are seen (known as the highest no adverse effects limit, or HNEL) at 1500mg/kg BW/day, a large margin of safety exists. [...] The bulk of <b>sucralose</b> ingested is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is directly excreted in the feces, while 11–27% of it is absorbed. The amount absorbed from the GI tract is largely removed from the blood stream by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine, with 20–30% of the absorbed <b>sucralose</b> being metabolized. This means that only between 2–8% of <b>sucralose</b> consumed is metabolized, on average.|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{determining}} {{the safety of}} <b>sucralose,</b> the FDA reviewed data from more than 110 studies in humans and animals. Many of the studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, including carcinogenic, reproductive, and neurological effects. No such effects were found, and FDA's approval {{is based on the}} finding that <b>sucralose</b> is safe for human consumption." [...] For example, McNeil Nutritional LLC studies submitted as part of its U.S. FDA Food Additive Petition 7A3987 indicated that [...] "in the 2-year rodent bioassays... {{there was no evidence of}} carcinogenic activity for either <b>sucralose</b> or its hydrolysis products..." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sucralose</b> {{is found}} in many food and {{beverage}} products, used {{because it is a}} no-calorie sweetener, does not promote dental cavities, is as safe for consumption by diabetics and nondiabetics, and does not affect insulin levels, although the sucralose-based sweetener product Splenda contains 95% (by volume) bulking agents dextrose and maltodextrin that do affect insulin levels. <b>Sucralose</b> is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium or high-fructose corn syrup. <b>Sucralose</b> is used in products such as candy, breakfast bars and soft drinks. [...] It is also used in canned fruits wherein water and <b>sucralose</b> take the place of much higher calorie corn syrup-based additives. <b>Sucralose</b> mixed with maltodextrin or dextrose (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by McNeil Nutritionals under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing saccharin sweeteners; in Canada, though, yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of cyclamate sweetener.|$|E
2500|$|According to one study, <b>sucralose</b> is {{digestible}} by {{a number}} of microorganisms and is broken down once released into the environment. However, measurements by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute have shown sewage treatment has little effect on <b>sucralose,</b> which is present in wastewater effluents at levels of several μg/l (ppb). No ecotoxicological effects are known at such levels, but the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency warns [...] a continuous increase in levels may occur if the compound is only slowly degraded in nature. [...] When heated to very high temperatures (over 350°C or 662°F) in metal containers, <b>sucralose</b> can produce in the resulting smoke polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sucralose</b> is a {{chlorinated}} sugar that {{is about}} 600 times as sweet as sugar. It is produced from sucrose when three chlorine atoms replace three hydroxyl groups. It is used in beverages, frozen desserts, chewing gum, baked goods, and other foods. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it is stable when heated and can therefore be used in baked and fried goods. [...] The FDA approved <b>sucralose</b> in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{controversy}} surrounding Splenda, a <b>sucralose</b> sweetener, is focused not on safety but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, [...] "Splenda is made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar." [...] <b>Sucralose</b> is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or raffinose. With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extensive}} {{account of}} the history of the discovery of <b>sucralose,</b> and its patent issues, by a professor of chemistry: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sucralose</b> {{was first}} {{approved}} {{for use in}} Canada in 1991. Subsequent approvals came in Australia in 1993, in New Zealand in 1996, in the United States in 1998, and in the European Union in 2004. By 2008, it had been approved in over 80 countries, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Japan. |publisher=McNeil Nutritionals, LLC |accessdate=2015-08-29 }} [...] In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration amended the regulations for foods to include <b>sucralose</b> as a [...] "non-nutritive sweetener" [...] in food. In May 2008, Fusion Nutraceuticals launched a generic product to the market, using Tate & Lyle patents.|$|E
2500|$|A Duke University animal study {{funded by}} the Sugar Association found {{evidence}} that doses of Splenda (containing ~1% <b>sucralose</b> and ~99% maltodextrin by weight) between 100 and 1000mg/kg BW/day, containing <b>sucralose</b> at 1.1 to 11mg/kg BW/day, fed to rats reduced fecal microflora, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and increased levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These effects have not been reported in humans. An expert panel, including scientists from Duke University, Rutgers University, New York Medical College, Harvard School of Public Health, and Columbia University reported in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology that the Duke study was [...] "not scientifically rigorous and is deficient in several critical areas that preclude reliable interpretation of the study results".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{doubt as}} to whether <b>sucralose</b> can help achieve weight loss. According to research, {{artificial}} sweeteners do not fully activate the brain's [...] "food reward pathways" [...] as sugar does. Because sweetener does not provide full satisfaction, the user may search for, and then ingest, additional high-calorie sweets, leading to weight gain.|$|E
2500|$|Though <b>sucralose</b> {{contains}} no calories, products that contain fillers, such as maltodextrin and/or dextrose, add about 2–4 calories per teaspoon or individual packet, {{depending on the}} product, the fillers used, brand, and the intended use of the product. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows for any product containing fewer than five calories per serving to be labeled as [...] "zero calories".|$|E
2500|$|When {{sweeteners}} {{are provided}} for restaurant customers {{to add to}} beverages such as tea and coffee themselves, they are often available in paper packets which can be torn and emptied. [...] In North America, the colors are typically white for sucrose, blue for aspartame, pink for saccharin, yellow for <b>sucralose</b> (United States) or cyclamate (Canada), tan for turbinado, orange for monk fruit extract, and green for stevia.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sucralose</b> was {{discovered}} in 1976 by scientists from Tate & Lyle, working with researchers Leslie Hough and Shashikant Phadnis at Queen Elizabeth College (now part of King's College London). While researching ways to use sucrose and its synthetic derivatives for industrial use, Phadnis was told to [...] "test" [...] a chlorinated sugar compound. Phadnis thought Hough asked him to [...] "taste" [...] it, so he did. [...] He found the compound to be exceptionally sweet.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is stable}} under heat {{and over a}} broad range of pH conditions. [...] Therefore, it can be used in baking or in {{products}} that require a longer shelf life. [...] The commercial success of sucralose-based products stems from its favorable comparison to other low-calorie sweeteners in terms of taste, stability, and safety. Common brand names of sucralose-based sweeteners are Splenda, Zerocal, Sukrana, [...] SucraPlus, Candys, Cukren, and Nevella. Canderel Yellow also contains <b>sucralose,</b> but the original Canderel and Green Canderel do not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and <b>sucralose</b> (e.g., Splenda, Altern). Maltitol and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. Erythritol is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, xylitol, cyclamate, and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Truth About Splenda" [...] website {{was created}} in 2005 by The Sugar Association, an {{organization}} representing sugar beet and sugar cane farmers in the United States, to provide its view of <b>sucralose.</b> In December 2004, five separate false-advertising claims were filed by the Sugar Association against Splenda manufacturers Merisant and McNeil Nutritionals for claims made about Splenda related to the slogan, [...] "Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar". French courts ordered the slogan to no longer be used in France, while in the U.S. the case came to an undisclosed settlement during the trial.|$|E
