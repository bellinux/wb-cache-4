A recurrence zero-bracketing (RZB) technique is proposed {{in which the}} zeros of the dispersion function at one recurrence <b>step</b> <b>bracket</b> those of the next recurrence step. Numerical examples verify {{the utility of the}} RZB technique in computing the roots of the dispersion equation of the TE and TM modes of both uniform and non-uniform arrays. 1...|$|E

Approach: Five different types of maxillary canine brackets (Damon 3 MX, Step, Quick, Sprint, Mini Mono) with a slot size 0. 022 inch were coupled with 0. 016 ” and 0. 019 ”× 0. 025 ” stainless steel and with 0. 016 ” and 0. 018 ”× 0. 025 ” NiTi archwires. Step, Sprint and Mini Mono were used both with traditional ligatures and with Slide ligatures. A total of 320 archwires and brackets were used; ten tests were carried out for each group of bracket-wire combination at physiological temperature and in dry state. Frictional forces were measured by Instron Universal Testing Machine. The statistical significance level was established at P< 0. 05. Results: Damon 3 MX and <b>Step</b> <b>brackets</b> with Slide ligatures produced statistically lower friction than Quick and conventional brackets with elastomeric ligature. Frictional force increased proportionally to the wire size; NiTi archwires presented higher frictional resistance than stainless steel archwires. Slide ligatures showed lower fictional values in comparison with elastic ligatures. Conclusion: Stainless steel brackets with new Slide ligature show frictional forces similar to self-ligating brackets with passive clip...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFreeform {{deformation}} {{techniques are}} powerful and flexible tools for interactive 3 D shape editing. However, while interactivity {{is the key}} constraint for the usability of such tools, it cannot be maintained when the complexity of either the 3 D model or the applied deformation exceeds a given workstation-dependent threshold. In this system paper, we solve this scalability problem by introducing a streaming system based on a sampling-reconstruction approach. First an efficient out-of-core adaptive simplification algorithm is performed in a pre-processing step, to quickly generate a simplified version of the model. The resulting model can then be submitted to arbitrary FFD tools, as its reduced size ensures interactive response. Second, a post-processing step performs a feature-preserving reconstruction of the deformation undergone by the simplified version, onto the original model. Both <b>bracketing</b> <b>steps</b> share streaming and point-based basis, making them fully scalable and compatible with point-clouds, non-manifold polygon soups and meshes. Our system also offers a generic out-of-core multi-scale layer to arbitrary FFD tools, since the two <b>bracketing</b> <b>steps</b> remain available for partial upsampling during the interactive session. As a result, arbitrarily large 3 D models can be interactively edited with most FFD tools, opening the use and combination of advanced deformation metaphors to models ranging from million to billion samples. Our system also offers to work on models that fit in memory but exceed the capabilities of a given FFD tool...|$|R

30|$|The modulus of {{elasticity}} of a wire describes {{the resistance of the}} material to flexion. It is considered the most important clinical parameter because it closely affects the biological nature of dental movement [11]. Various studies [2 – 4, 11, 12] have evaluated orthodontic wires in laboratorial in vitro tests during deflection tests, in order to assess their load/deflection behavior and their elasticity module. All these studies used a set up where the brackets where dimensionally leveled and aligned. In an attempt to better simulate a different clinical situation, a 2 -mm horizontal <b>step</b> between the <b>brackets</b> will be tested to evaluate if the load/deflection behavior changes. The objective of the study was therefore to evaluate the behavior of the deflection force, {{modulus of elasticity}}, and plastic deformation of five commercially available beta-titanium alloy wires between two leveled and unleveled bracket alignment scenarios using the three-point bending test.|$|R
40|$|Within North America, more {{children}} are being classified as overweight and obese than ever before. Despite this alarming finding, limited {{research has been conducted}} on parents’ views of their children’s health in addition to their role in providing their children with a healthy lifestyle The purpose of this qualitative investigation was to explore parents’ perceptions of their daughters’ healthy lifestyle, including their perceptions of their roles and responsibilities as parents. Participants were recruited from three Girl Guides of Canada Brownie Units in South-Western Ontario. Ten semi-structured, audio-taped interviews were conducted. All of the parents who volunteered to participate were middle class, well-educated, heterosexual, married and/ or common-law and had two to three children. Among those who were interviewed, one married couple took part together, and the remaining eight mothers and one father took part in individual interviews. Many of the participants had experienced problems with maintaining a healthy weight themselves and/or healthy lifestyle in the past. A phenomenological approach was taken by following Hychner’s (1985) <b>steps,</b> including; <b>bracketing</b> my assumptions, listening for a sense of the ‘whole’, delineating units of general meaning, eliminating redundancies and outlining themes that captured the essence of lives experience for parents. Similar to Mannell and Kleiber’s (1997) findings, participants in this study played an influential role in helping their children develop healthy behaviours that would carry on throughout their lives. All of the mothers and fathers interviewed were involved parents and were very committed to instilling healthy behaviors in their daughters. In line with Hays (1996) and Warner (2005), mothers in this study adopted ‘intensive mothering roles’ and fathers’ behaviors reflected ‘involved parenting’ roles. Participants in this study deemed physical, mental and psychological health as important factors which contribute to a healthy lifestyle, but focused most of their discussions on their roles and responsibilities in their daughters’ physical health. A strong emphasis on their daughters’ weight management was conveyed throughout interviews, as many participants, especially mothers, were concerned with their daughter’s perception of body image and self-esteem. As they embraced their parental duties, they acted as role models to their children and spent time during family leisure activities and family meals teaching their daughters about the importance of physical activity and nutrition. Similar to Shaw and Dawson’s (2001) study, family leisure was seen as purposive, with a strong focus placed on health. Parents in this study made their daughters’ health a top priority by investing their time and finances for this goal, while remaining firm and consistent in encouraging healthy behaviours in their children. Despite the time and effort devoted to providing healthy lifestyles, many participants felt insecure and questioned {{whether or not they were}} doing enough. These characteristics displayed by participants were similar to Warner’s (2005) concept of ‘professionalization of parenthood’. This study has provided valuable insight to the fields of Recreation and Leisure Studies, Family Studies, and Obesity Prevention literature...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{takes its}} {{starting}} point {{from one of}} the most essential parts of organization theory, namely coordination. It joins a new and emerging approach within which coordination is not only treated as a function but as a dynamic process. The thesis reflects everyday practice during a major construction project and focuses on how coordination is undertaken, and how it develops over time. The aim is to create an understanding of the dynamics of coordination. This refers both to the interaction between different types of coordination that continuously take place in the process of carrying out collective performances, and to how the coordination changes over time. The case study, that is the basis of this thesis, was carried out from 2006 - 2010 in a large construction project with Skanska and Jämtkraft as contractual partners. The project – called Destination 2011 – corresponds to an investment of € 100 - 110 million and aims at securing Jämtkraft’s power distribution from severe weather conditions in order to minimize the risk of power blackouts. The theory chapter of the thesis has an integrative approach and is based on theories of coordination. On the basis of this a conceptual framework was developed that focuses on how coordination takes place and how it can change in relation to its context. This was done in three steps. First, coordination was defined, positioned and set in relation to the organizational context in terms of uncertainty and complexity. Second, five broad categories were derived which indicate how different organizational arrangements create coordination. Third, the integrating conditions which evolve from the organizational arrangements were presented. These integrating conditions are essential for the individuals to coordinate their activities. Based on the case study, and supported by the theoretical framework, a process-oriented analysis was conducted in four steps. The first step was a narrative case description which focuses {{on the development of the}} project and the activities that make up the project process. The second step consisted of a thematic theory driven analysis that explains how the project members use a combination of different organizational arrangements to create the integrating conditions required for the coordination to occur. The third step of the analysis was based on a process analysis combined with temporal <b>bracketing.</b> This <b>step</b> focuses on how the coordination is structured and enables the understanding of how the coordination changes over time. In this <b>step</b> two temporal <b>brackets</b> (or micro-processes) were created, the first of which represents a sub-project under the first half of the project, and the second a sub-project during the second half. For each micro-process an analysis was carried out which identified a number of coordination processes. These coordination processes link the implementation phase together and explain how, and why, the coordination is built up as it is during a sub-project. In the fourth and final step a comparative analysis was conducted with illustrative narrative sequences. This analysis puts the two micro-processes in relation to each other, illustrates how the coordination changes over time, and exposes the underlying forces that explain the identified change. These analyses, brought together, show the interaction between different types of coordination, how the coordination is built-up, and how it changes over time, thereby providing an understanding of the dynamics of coordination...|$|R
