40|$|This report {{assesses the}} {{challenges}} regarding fatigue calculations {{on the inside}} of a single <b>sided</b> <b>weld</b> on the Oseberg UWP. SN – fatigue and FM – fatigue calculations are performed on two different models to establish a foundation/basis for evaluation of the inside. Model one is a beam model used to identify the most critical joint on the Oseberg UWP. Model two is a FE – model of the critical joint identified. A comparison of the fatigue results from the two models provided a good foundation/basis for evaluating the inside of the single <b>sided</b> <b>weld.</b> The calculated fatigue life {{on the outside of the}} single <b>sided</b> <b>weld</b> is 447 years using FE - fatigue. With a DFF of 3, 0 this correspond to a design life of 149 years. For the inside of the single <b>sided</b> <b>weld</b> with a DFF of 10, 0 to have the same safety level as the outside, the inside fatigue life is calculated to be 1490 years which correspond to a design life of 149 years. For a fatigue life of 1490 years the critical initial crack size on the inside is calculated to be: ai = 6, 35 mm ci = 63, 5 mm This crack size is larger than the smallest detectable crack size of 5, 0 mm according to DNVGL – RP – C 203 [4].   Following the procedure described in standard DNVGL – RP – C 203 using a W 3 – curve the calculated fatigue life is only 263 years, which differ significant from the FM – fatigue results. Therefore there is a belief that the procedure is too conservative and a parameter study based on the approach in this report is recommended for further work...|$|R

40|$|This valve is {{designed}} to create a zero-leak seal in a liquid propulsion system that is a functional replacement for the normally closed pyrovalve. Unlike pyrovalves, Nitinol is actuated by simply heating the material to a certain temperature, called the transition temperature. Like a pyrovalve, before actuation, the upstream and downstream sections are separated from one another and from the external environment by closed <b>welded</b> <b>seals.</b> Also like pyrovalves, after actuation, the propellant or pressurant gas can flow without a significant pressure drop but are still separated from the external environment by a closed <b>welded</b> <b>seal.</b> During manufacture, a Nitinol bar is compressed to 93 percent of its original length and fitted tightly into the valve. During operation, the valve is heated until the Nitinol reaches the transition temperature of 95 C; the Nitinol "remembers" its previous longer shape with a very large recovery force causing it to expand and break the titanium parent metal seal to allow flow. Once open, the valve forever remains open. The first prototype valve was designed for high pressure [5, 000 psi (= 34. 5 MPa) ] and low flow, typical requirements for pressurant gas valves in liquid propulsion systems. It is possible to modify the dimensions to make low-pressure models or high-flow models, for use downstream of the propellant tanks. This design is simpler, lower risk, and less expensive than the pyrovalve. Although the valve must be in a thermally controlled state (kept below 80 C) to prevent premature actuation, the pyrovalves and electrically actuated initiators have far more taxing handling requirements...|$|R

50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via <b>welding.</b> <b>Seals</b> come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping.
