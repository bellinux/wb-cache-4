40|$|The main {{intention}} of writing {{this paper is}} to enable the students, computer users and novice researchers about <b>spoofing</b> attacks. <b>Spoofing</b> means impersonating another person or computer, usually by providing false information (E-mail name, URL or IP address). <b>Spoofing</b> can take on many forms in the computer world, all of which involve some type false representation of information.

30|$|The last type {{is closely}} related to a <b>spoofing</b> signal; these {{parameters}} include the frequency difference between a <b>spoofing</b> signal and a local replicate carrier (fe'), the phase difference between a <b>spoofing</b> signal and local replicate code (τS), the phase difference between an authentic signal carrier and a <b>spoofing</b> signal carrier (ϕ[*]−[*]ϕ'), and the ratio of the <b>spoofing</b> signal amplitude versus the authentic signal amplitude (η). The <b>spoofing</b> device always prefers that the first three parameters are close to 0, which is very difficult to achieve due to various reasons such as measurement error and device cost. Only η is a controllable parameter for the <b>spoofing</b> device. Therefore, η is the most important parameter for generating a <b>spoofing</b> signal and is the focus of numerous anti-spoofing attack studies. The spoofing-signal ratio (η) is defined as the ratio of the <b>spoofing</b> signal amplitude to the authentic signal amplitude. Based on the above assumption and the parameter analysis method, the lower limit of η required for successful <b>spoofing</b> in various conditions is deduced in the following sections.|$|R

50|$|IP <b>spoofing</b> is most {{frequently}} used in denial-of-service attacks, where {{the objective is to}} flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with <b>spoofed</b> IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each <b>spoofed</b> packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use <b>spoofing</b> typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated <b>spoofing</b> mechanisms might avoid unroutable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large botnets makes <b>spoofing</b> less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have <b>spoofing</b> available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with <b>spoofed</b> packets. Backscatter, a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers' use of IP <b>spoofing</b> for its effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{countermeasures}} to mitigate {{damage caused by}} <b>spoofing</b> attacks in Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In our model, an attacker <b>spoofs</b> someone else’s address (the victim’s) to absorb packets from the network intended for that victim. Address <b>spoofing</b> is arguably a very severe attack in DTNs, compared to other known attacks, such as dropping packets. Without a Public Key Infrastructure in DTNs, providing protection against this attack is challenging. We propose SPREAD (countermeasure against <b>SPoofing</b> by REplica ADjustment), a solution that assesses evidence of <b>spoofing</b> and offers countermeasures designed for quota-based multi-copy routing protocols. Our solution relies on reducing the weight of packet copies, charged to the routing quota, when these packets are given to a node suspected of <b>spoofing.</b> The weight reduction increases as <b>spoofing</b> evidence mounts against a node. The approach is designed to probabilistically maintain {{the same number of}} packet copies in the network as would be the case in the absence of attacks, despite the actual occurrence of <b>spoofing.</b> We show that SPREAD makes DTNs robust against <b>spoofing</b> attacks, does not overburden the network, and limits the overall overhead within a certain bound.
