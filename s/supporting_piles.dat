5|$|The Liffey River—then called Pennyroyal Creek—was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with {{a simple}} log structure. This was {{replaced}} in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge, though still wooden. As of 1834 the areas' roads were poor and vehicles frequently became bogged {{on the road to}} Westbury. A bridge over the South Esk, at what is now Hadspen, was built in 1843. It replaced a frequently impassable ford and more reliably connected Carrick to Launceston. Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid-1860s, keeping the original foundations. In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge's collapse, when one of the two <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> (logs) gave way. All of the Liffey bridges, and the connecting parts of the road, were subject to inundation when the river flooded; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away. In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced. To reduce the incidence and impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the mill's ground floor far below the road level.|$|E

Half-way down the hill the cathedral is built, a {{singularly}} gloomy edifice,--Romanesque, as it is called, in its style, but extremely similar in its mode of architecture to what we know of Byzantine structures. But there has been no surface on the rock side large enough to form a resting- place for the church, which has therefore been built out on huge <b>supporting</b> <b>piles,</b> which form a porch below the west front; so that the approach is by numerous steps laid {{along the side of the}} wall below the church, forming a wondrous flight of stairs.

40|$|Incremental {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} steel bridge assembly methods used nowadays, its practical application consists in passing the bridge assembly through the launching shoes as well as over each <b>support</b> <b>pile.</b> In some cases, when plate girders are used, it is usual to find longitudinal stiffeners reinforcement in order to prevent web local buckling produced by the vertical reaction acting in the <b>support</b> <b>pile.</b> A considerable number of studies have focused on evaluating the impact of a single stiffener on the resistance of plate girder subjected to patch loading. However, the effect of multiple longitudinal stiffened plate girders subjected to lengthy compressive load has received little attention. Therefore, this paper aims at studying the influence of load bearing length on the ultimate strength of multiple longitudinally stiffened webs subjected to compressive loads. Patch loading resistance is numerically calculated using a previously validated nonlinear finite element analysis. Subsequently, a parametrical study is conducted to investigate the effect of the aforementioned load length and the relative position and size of the stiffeners on the ultimate strengthPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{significant}} alterations {{to the building}} occurred {{in reaction to the}} flooding of Canvey Island in 1953 which claimed 58 lives. The flood prompted a succession of improvements to the sea defences {{around the perimeter of the}} island. The path of the new [...] "second" [...] seawall in 1953 followed the line of the promenade on the south side (beach side) of the cafe, but the larger replacement - completed in 1983 - was built around the cafe's north side (inland). The construction necessarily raised the ground on the north side to an equal level with the promenade on the south side (beach side) subsequently burying the cafe's <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> and essentially reducing the building's height to two storeys. The placement of the wall, its proximity and large scale also obscured the effect of the first floor over-hang, and the view of the central ground floor when seen from the north. However, the general appearance remained intact when viewed from the south until the building's second major alteration with the addition of the new cafe in 2001. The two arms that extend from the circular drum of the first floor originally enclosed two shelters on the ground floor but were transformed into an indoor serving and seating area.|$|E

5000|$|Construction on the dam's support {{facilities}} {{began in}} 1959 {{and the river}} diversion tunnels and foundation preparation commenced in 1960. To divert the Manicouagan River, workers blasted and dug two 2000 ft long and 45 ft diameter tunnels through the gorge's solid granite west wall. Workers used [...] "jumbo" [...] drilling platforms and the tunnels progressed 14 ft each shift. [...] To facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were built. The first was a concrete arch upstream from the dam site which would block the river, forcing it into the diversion tunnels. The second cofferdam was downstream and prevented water from flowing back into the construction site. Each cofferdam was built on alluvial deposits (loose soil), so {{they needed to be}} watertight, which was accomplished with either a grout curtain or deep <b>supporting</b> <b>piles.</b> Once the river was diverted, workers pumped the remaining water out between the two cofferdams in order to prepare the site for construction. Once drained, workers excavated the alluvial deposits between the cofferdams, creating a long pit that was 150 ft deep at the center. This pit was then filled with concrete in the summer of 1962. To prevent seepage in the dam's foundation, a grout curtain was injected in the bedrock and a drainage network with 2400 ft of tunnels was constructed just downstream of the dam to collect water that might seep through.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> of deep {{foundation}} pits are usually made in reinforced concrete materials and rarely in prestressed concrete materials. But prestressed concrete materials have higher stiffness and less deformation and {{are suitable for}} controlling displacements or settlements. So, in this paper a practical engineering project as an example, the prestressed concrete <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> of the {{deep foundation}} pit are calculated and designed. Then, the settlement and inclination of the building adjacent the foundation pit with the prestressed concrete piles are calculated in the numerical software, FLAC. The results calculated in FLAC are compared with the actual settlement and inclination of the adjacent building during the foundation pit is excavated. The comparison confirms the feasibility of the supporting structure. This is a useful trial {{on the design of}} the prestressed concrete <b>supporting</b> <b>piles...</b>|$|E

This paper carries out construction monitoring and numerical simulation analysis and gives a detailed study on the influenced factors of support structure deformation. Calculation results show that subgrade unsymmetrical load has a great influence on deep horizontal deformation of <b>supporting</b> <b>piles.</b> The maximum horizontal displacement at the bias side is about three times more than non-bias side’s; when the distance of subgrade to foundation pit {{is the same as}} the depth of excavation, the influence of subgrade on pit can be ignored; as the cohesion and internal friction angle increases, the horizontal displacement of fender piles decreases. However, enlarging the embedded depth of <b>supporting</b> <b>piles</b> has no significant influence on the stability of foundation pit...|$|E
