500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, a new feature film {{based on the}} Diabolik comics to be {{directed}} by Christophe Gans and starring Mark Dacascos and Monica Bellucci was in the planning stages. Gans opined that: [...] "The Bava film is unique and I'd never, ever want to copy it. But let's <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can take Diabolik today for a totally new and different Pop art experience." [...] The film has not gone into production. In 2002, screenwriter Mario Gomboli announced a French production of Diabolik was to be made with a contemporary setting and a script written by Carlo Lucarelli and Giampiero Rigosi. A script was completed in April 2007, with filming set to begin in January 2008, but the production stalled.|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

2500|$|As {{the third}} season was {{wrapping}} production in May 2007, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with ABC {{for the show}} to end in three years. [...] The remaining three seasons were to each be a third shorter, containing just sixteen episodes each that would air consecutively week after week from early February through mid-May. [...] The fourth season premiered {{on the last day}} of January in 2008, but was soon interrupted and truncated by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, adding an episode apiece onto the remaining seasons. [...] Then-co-executive producer Edward Kitsis speculated that these would translate into more two-part episodes. [...] The fifth season premiered two weeks early to allow for two breaks in the season for a rerun and a clip-show respectively. [...] In June 2009, the producers ordered an additional hour for the show's final season. [...] Cuse explained that [...] "For us, [...] is just about right. [...] I mean, we aren't sitting here feeling like, 'Oh my God, we need a ton more hours to tell the rest of our story.' [...] It feels like it's going to work out just fine. [...] It will have been the right length." [...] In September, ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson advertised that the final season would be the first Lost season to run uninterrupted and entirely repeat-free; however, Cuse said in October that Lost would premiere in January in order to take a two-week break in February to avoid competing with NBC's coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games.s Final Season Breakup: Winter Olympics to Ruin Everything]", IGN.

[...] With ABC's new Wednesday sitcom block performing well, ABC ultimately ruled in November that Lost would move to Tuesdays at 9:00/8 central for the first time, premiering in February and running straight through with original episode broadcasts into mid-May, not taking a break for the Olympic Games.|$|E
