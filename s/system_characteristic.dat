40|$|We {{compare and}} explain {{effectiveness}} assessments of two HR stakeholders, i. e. line managers and trade union representatives. We examine whether both stakeholders {{have the same}} preferences regarding the role the HR department has to fulfill (Ulrich, 1997). Next, we test which strong HRM <b>system</b> <b>characteristics</b> (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004) are decisive in determining the perceived effectiveness of the HR department in the preferential roles. With these analyses we examine whether the HR roles and strong HRM <b>system</b> <b>characteristics</b> are equally important to different stakeholders. Results show that the perceived effectiveness of the HR department in its operational roles is decisive in trade union representatives’ effectiveness assessment. For line managers, process oriented roles are crucial. Next, if the HR department scores high on strong HRM <b>system</b> <b>characteristics,</b> it is perceived as more effective in its HR roles.

50|$|The {{evidence}} linking Dogon to the Niger-Congo family is weak, and their {{place within the}} family, assuming they do belong, is not clear. Various theories have been proposed, placing them in Gur, Mande, or as an independent branch, the last now being the preferred approach. The Dogon languages show no remnants of the noun class <b>system</b> <b>characteristic</b> of much of Niger-Congo, leading linguists to conclude that they likely diverged from Niger-Congo very early.|$|E

50|$|Hemolymph, or haemolymph, is a fluid, {{analogous}} to the blood in vertebrates, that circulates {{in the interior of}} the arthropod body remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues.

It is the major tissue type of the open circulatory <b>system</b> <b>characteristic</b> of arthropods (e.g. arachnids, crustaceans and insects). In addition, some non-arthropods such as molluscs possess a hemolymphatic circulatory system.|$|E

5000|$|This [...] "Coman plus Gumuz" [...] is what Greenberg (1963) had subsumed under Koman {{and what}} Bender (1989) had called Komuz, a broader family {{consisting}} of Gumuz and the Koman languages. However, Bender (2000) separated Gumuz {{as at least}} a distinct branch of Nilo-Saharan, and suggested that {{it might even be}} a language isolate. Dimmendaal (2000), who tentatively included Koman within Nilo-Saharan, excluded Gumuz as an isolate, as it did not share the tripartite singulative-collective-plurative number <b>system</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of the rest of the}} Nilo-Saharan language families. Ahland (2010, 2012), however, reports that with better attestation, Gumuz does indeed appear to be Nilo-Saharan, and perhaps closest to Koman. It has grammatical forms that resemble what might be expected from an ancestral proto-Nilo-Saharan language. Gumuz may thus help elucidate the family, which is extremely diverse and has been difficult to substantiate.|$|E
50|$|The Windmill {{was built}} in 1860 and is {{constructed}} of red bricks. The mill has a White boat shaped cap sails and a fantail. The windpump once ran two scoop wheels. The tower had four patent sails. The mill is approximately 12 m high, and has been visually retained in its original historic condition, even though internal works to the mill in the 1960s have removed all mill equipment previously installed in the brick structure. The mill {{is part of the}} large historic pumping mill <b>system</b> <b>characteristic</b> to the Broads, and is Grade II listed. (List of drainage windmills in Norfolk)The house adjacent to the mill has originally been built around {{the same time as the}} mill, but to less good standards than the mill itself. The house was built on a little raised earth mount to prevent flooding, and consisted of two spaces for the Millkeeper, a ground floor room and an upper floor room connected by a staircase. Due to its original limitations and due to repeated flooding, the Mill Keepers house has been remodelled and extended extensively, in the 1910s, 1940s, 1950s, 1970s and in 2008. Hunsett Mill is probably the most photographed windmill on the Broads appearing as it does on most postcards. This is due to its chocolate box picture setting. The Mill is quite hard to get to, being at the Northern end of the Norfolk Broads network and it has no road access. Hunsett Mill is privately owned.|$|E

The α-cut approach is used to transform a fuzzy queue into a family of conventional crisp queues in this context. By means of the membership functions of the <b>system</b> <b>characteristics,</b> a set of parametric nonlinear programs is developed to describe the family of crisp queues with server setup. Two numerical examples are solved suc-cessfully to illustrate {{the validity of the}} proposed approach. Because the <b>system</b> <b>characteristics</b> are expressed and governed by the membership functions, the fuzzy queues with server setup are represented more accurately and the analytic results are more useful for system designers and practitioners...|$|R
