However Lewis also allows for the possibility that these innovations should be credited to Daniel Hoechstetter. Richard Carew, on the other hand, mentions the 'rubble of certain mines and remains of a fining house' which demonstrate Kranich's 'vain endeavour in seeking of silver ore' in Cornwall. After Kranich had left Cornwall, a 16-page memorandum was prepared by William Carnsew 'relating to silver and lead mines in Cornwall and activities of Dr Burchard Kranich' in response to a request for information about the potential profitability of the mines from Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele. Among the matters covered in the memorandum were 'the many disputes and arguments Kranich had with his sponsors'. According to Wallis, Kranich's mining enterprises in the West Country were ultimately a failure, and he moved to London.|$|E

2500|$|The Quincy Mining Company Stamp Mills Historic District is a {{historic}} <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> (used to crush copper-bearing rock, separating the copper ore from surrounding rock) located on M-26 near Torch Lake, just east of Mason in Osceola Township. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Dunn did the amalgamating in the <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> {{mentioned}} for {{the ensuing}} seven months, and he then engaged in prospecting and in speculating in mining properties, while {{for a time}} he ran the Standby mill, at Rochford, and was also identified with the operation of several other mills, at varying intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{began on}} the new <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> in 1888. The first {{building}} constructed was a boarding house, followed by a dock, cistern, and foundations for other buildings. [...] In 1889, six substantial frame buildings were constructed on site, {{as well as a}} railway connecting the <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> to the mine, and stamping equipment was installed. [...] Mill number one was a wooden structure measuring 198 feet by 120 feet. The pump and boiler house were located {{on the south side of}} the roadway that is now M-26. [...] It was a stone structure measuring 154 feet by 56 feet. [...] An elevated conduit carried water and steam over the road to the mill, and handling facilities were built at the dock. [...] The facility was completed and opened for milling in 1890. The site originally had two stamps; a third was added immediately after opening, and two more were added in 1892.|$|E

2500|$|This mill {{was started}} in {{operation}} {{the last day of}} December 1876, and though there has been no little dispute as to the matter of the first mill to be put in operation, Mr. Dunn gives the assurance that this one is unmistakably entitled to the distinction. The Bald pulverizer had been started previously and run a short time, but was not a <b>stamp</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Quincy <b>Stamp</b> <b>Mill</b> {{was built}} in 1860 on Portage Lake in Hancock, close to the Quincy Mine. [...] This facility, however, dumped {{an enormous amount of}} sand tailings into the lake, and the sand soon threatened to encroach on the navigable channel of the lake. [...] In the mid-1880s, the federal government set minimum harbor lines and stiff penalties for breaching them, and eventually filed suit against the Quincy Mine for dumping in Portage Lake. In addition, Quincy {{was in the process of}} acquiring the nearby Pewabic Mine, and management knew they would need to increase the company's stamping capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the copper}} mining was still done in open pit mining, but two shafts, one over 300 feet, were also sunk at the mine. [...] In 1875, more than 50 people were {{working at the}} Minong Mine and living in the nearby {{settlement}} of Cove, {{at the end of}} McCargoe Cove. Later, {{at the height of the}} Minong operation, some 150 miners were employed at the mine. A railroad ran between the mine proper and Cove, and the mining settlement had a post office, a dam, a <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> (built in 1876), a dock, and a blacksmith's shop.|$|E
50|$|Stamp mills: these feature {{mainly in}} {{combination}} with watermills. As a rule, they constitute {{a small group of}} buildings, one of which is invariably the <b>stamping</b> <b>mill</b> office where deals were struck. Another is the <b>stamping</b> <b>mill</b> itself, with the upper floor used for drying laundry in winter and used for other purposes in summer. These plain, unadorned buildings are purely of a utilitarian nature.|$|R

2500|$|The second <b>stamp</b> <b>mill</b> {{was built}} {{just north of}} the first; this mill was an iron-framed {{structure}} measuring 132 feet by 216 feet. [...] It was constructed in 1899 by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company at a cost of $22,450. [...] The second mill opened in late 1900 with three mills. [...] To service the additional capacity, new boiler and pump house buildings were also constructed. [...] Over the next two decades, minor alterations were made to the structures of the complex (including the erection of a new 175-foot smokestack for the boilerhouse in 1916) while the milling process and machinery were continuously refined.|$|E
2500|$|As {{it became}} {{necessary}} to regularly process pieces of ore-bearing rock {{that were too}} large to be directly ground in a crazing mill, stamping was introduced. This involved vertical hammers [...] powered by a waterwheel in a <b>Stamp</b> <b>mill,</b> of which at least 60 {{are known to have}} existed on Dartmoor. The first documentary evidence for a stamping mill on Dartmoor is dated 1504, though they would almost certainly have been in use earlier than this (the first reference for Cornwall is from 1400, for instance). Stamping mills were also known as [...] "knacking" [...] or [...] "knocking" [...] mills; Knacking Mill Gulf, a shallow side valley in {{the upper reaches of the}} River Erme, attests to the existence of such a mill there at one time.|$|E

The mill served the Randolph Mine, a small gold mine run by the Davis family, from 1915 to 1940. It included the standard machinery of an early 20th century <b>stamp</b> <b>mill,</b> which consisted of a stamp battery, a rock crusher, an ore bin, an amalgamation table, concentrators, and a retort room.
