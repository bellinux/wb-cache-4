According to Billboard, Lorde said she'd be writing new material in December 2013. While responding to a fan on her Instagram account in August 2016, {{she said that the}} record is written and they're in production stages now. In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: [...] "Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record— well, this one is about what comes next. ...The party is about to start.

500|$|The {{complexity}} of [...] "the common man" [...] is also explored through the oft-mentioned [...] "life of the mind". While expounding on his {{duty as a}} writer, Barton drones: [...] "I gotta tell you, {{the life of the}} mind... There's no road map for that territory... and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know anything about." [...] Barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative considerations while Charlie is not. This delusion shares the film's climax, as Charlie runs through the hallway of the Earle, shooting the detectives with a shotgun and screaming: [...] "LOOK UPON ME! I'LL <b>SHOW</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>THE</b> LIFE OF THE MIND!!" [...] Charlie's [...] "life of the mind" [...] is no less complex than Barton's; in fact, some critics consider it more so.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid I’m going to have to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> real thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Empire Kim Newman {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. He said Saw is styled like early David Fincher films and [...] "boasts an {{intricate}} structure - complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have come to this crisis - and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia." [...] He ended his review saying, [...] "As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we've had lately." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, calling it [...] "derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good." [...] He described Jigsaw's intent as [...] "to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> serial killer lurking inside yourself." [...] Gleiberman criticized Elwes' performance by saying, [...] " [...] ought to be featured in a seminar on the perils of overacting." [...] Daniel M. Kimmel of the Telegram & Gazette called it [...] "one of the most loathsome films this critic has seen in more than 20 years on the job." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{different}} client, Jantzen swimwear, {{asks for}} help to maintain a family-friendly image in a field where bikinis are becoming more common and more revealing. They insist they do not sell bikinis, which they call underwear you wear to the beach; they sell two-piece bathing suits. Don Draper tries to sell a pitch wherein the model's breasts are obscured by the slogan, [...] "So well built, we can't <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> second floor". The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risqué, and Draper - exasperated by the clients' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room. As they leave, he finally agrees to do the interview with The Wall Street Journal. As the episode ends, Don is seen telling the journalist the swashbuckling story of how he instigated the formation of SCDP by having Lane Pryce fire them.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, Barton is {{visited by}} two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's {{real name is}} Karl [...] "Madman" [...] Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after {{shooting}} his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns {{to his room and}} examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming [...] "I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

2500|$|Many reviewers {{felt the}} album sounded {{similar to the}} work of Pink Floyd. The album has also been praised for being more {{accessible}} than most progressive rock, with Bill Kopp of Musoscribe stating [...] "Lightbulb Sun is, like all (Porcupine Tree), really, very accessible stuff. In many ways, Porcupine Tree can serve as a listener's entree into a heretofore unexplored genre: if you're a rock fan but not so into prog, (it) can ease you in gently.

[...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "According to {{all that}} I <b>show</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> pattern of the Tabernacle [...] [...] [...] even so shall you make it," [...] Rav Shimi bar Hiyya deduced that just as the Tabernacle {{required}} the consent of Moses, so additions to the Temple or the City of Jerusalem required {{the consent of the}} Sanhedrin (the heir to the authority of Moses). (The phrase, [...] "so shall you make it," [...] is superfluous, because [...] already said, [...] "Let them make Me a sanctuary." [...] So Rav Shimi read the superfluous phrase to imply that whatever was done for the Tabernacle in the wilderness should be done for any future Temple or Temple city, as well.).

Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. [...] "Strike me instead", he demands, [...] "so that only I alone will die", but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: Già mi pasco ne' tuoi sguardi / [...] "Already I take {{pleasure}} in the look you give me, your grief and in her death; at last I can make you as miserable as I".) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces {{that it would be}} better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione demands that she keep silent, but Norma then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim because she is the guilty one, a high Priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: Qual cor tradisti / [...] "May this awful moment now <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> heart you betrayed and lost"; Duet: Norma and Pollione; Ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, Druids, Priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.) ...|$|E
