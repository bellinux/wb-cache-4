40|$|The {{application}} of cold-formed steel channel sections for <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> becomes more popular for industrial and residential purposes. Experimental {{tests showed that}} such structures with long-span up to 20 m can be achieved when knee brace joints are included. In this paper, the influence of knee brace configuration on the optimum design of long-span cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> is investigated. The cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> are designed using Eurocode 3 under ultimate limit states. A novel method in handling design constraints integrated with genetic algorithm is proposed for searching the optimum design of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frames.</b> The result showed that the proposed routine for design optimization effectively searched the near global optimum solution with the computational time is approximate 50 % faster than methods being popularly used in literature. The optimum configuration for knee brace joint can reduce the section size of rafter and so the lighter frame could be obtained especially for long-span <b>portal</b> <b>frame.</b> The minimum weight of main frame obtained from optimization process is approximate 19. 72 % lighter than a Benchmark Frame used in the full-scale experimental test...|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of using}} a {{concrete}} sub-structure, a lightweight steel frame was used, with cladding. This meant the building (frame and cladding) was constructed in six weeks. The venue, a 30-metre-high rectangular volume (the equivalent of a seven-storey building) was made out of a <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> and wrapped in 20,000 square metres of lightweight phthalate-free and recyclable PVC plastic. This translucent bespoke cladding was then stretched across the steel framing modules that pushed the fabric out and created the three-dimensional undulating pattern along the sides. An interwoven blackout layer {{was used in the}} roof fabric, this reduced most of the daylight during game sessions and maintained a fully controllable artificial lighting for use by the media and game spectators. The external fabric walls were translucent, allowing daylight to pass through during the day and artificial lighting to be visible during the evening.|$|E

This paper investigates the influence of two joint configurations having full rigidity and semirigidity, respectively, on the optimum design of cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frames.</b> A real-coded genetic algorithm is used to search for the most cost-effective design. It is shown that through incorporating joint effects explicitly into the design process, a more appropriate balance between the joints and the member properties can be obtained, thus optimizing material use. The study then investigates the effect of secondary members on the optimum design. It is shown that incorporating the secondary members is important for <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> having spans less than 12 m.

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of industrial buildings in China are <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> constructions. An increasingly {{large number of}} industrial buildings are being built in coastal areas subject to Typhoon. The high strength bolted end-plate connection is main type of the connections used widely in industrial construction. There {{are two kinds of}} end-plate connections in steel portal frames: flush and extend end-plate connections. The main initial imperfection of bolted end-plate connection lies in which the thickness of end-plate and column flange can’t meet the code provisions based on a field investigation. Considering the effect of initial imperfection, the actual behavior of end-plate connections in steel portal frames is seldom fully rigid. The true behavior of the connections is usually semi-rigid. Neglecting the real behavior of connections in the analysis may lead to unrealistic predictions of the response and reliability of steel portal frames. This paper considers the effects of semi-rigid behavior of the connections in the finite element analysis and reliability analysis of steel portal frames. Assuming that the loads and the resistance of members are random variables, then the Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to estimate the failure probability of <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> system. The results confirm that the thickness of end-plate has a significant effect on safety of <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} in industrial sector in Sri Lanka, {{there is a}} high demand for clear span buildings to cater for the factories with advance technology production lines {{as well as for the}} warehouses. Structural steel buildings are the best economical solution among different types of construction materials for such buildings. Portal frame is the best solution for large clear spans and is the most popular structural form used in the construction industry. It offers an economical solution to medium to large spans and the most important feature is the saving on construction time which is a main concerns of most the clients. However, to get the optimum solution in steel portal frames there are several key factors to consider during the design stage. Main frame spacing, roof slope and type of roof covering material are some of the key parameters which will have an effect on the optimum frame design.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} cold-formed steel top-hat sections for purlins {{as an alternative to}} conventional zed-sections. The use of such top-hat sections may be viable for use in cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>framing</b> systems, where both the frame spacing and purlin span may be smaller than in conventional hot-rolled <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frames.</b> Furthermore, such sections are torsionally stiffer than zed-sections, and so have a greater resistance to lateral-torsional buckling. They also do not require the installation of anti-sag rods. The paper describes non-linear elasto-plastic finite element analyses conducted on top-hat sections. The results of twenty-seven tests on four different top-hat sections are presented. Good agreement between experimental and finite element results is shown. The finite element model is then used for a parametric study to investigate the effect of different thicknesses and steel grades. Design recommendations are provided in the form of charts {{that can be used to}} assist designers when deciding which geometry of top-hat section to consider for further development. The use of the finite element method in this way exploits modern computational techniques for an otherwise difficult structural design problem and reduces the need for an expensive and time consuming full laboratory study, whilst maintaining realistic and safe coverage of the important structural design issues...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years various {{investigations}} related to the development of finite element formulations for semi-rigid <b>steel</b> <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> design including the geometric non-linear response have been produced. On the other hand, it is suggested that, for a more precise semi-rigid connection modelling, the axial and shear force effects should be incorporated to the usual bending deformations. These facts motivated the conception and development of a joint finite element that could accurately represent these effects as well as contemplated a possible interaction amongst these stiffness components. This element also enables joint elasto-plastic analysis to be performed based on their associated moment versus rotation curves. Consequently, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} describe in detail the proposed joint finite element and also its linear and non-linear formulations that incorporated the transversal deformations due to shear stresses.

In this paper, the effect of stressed-skin action on the optimum design of CFS <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> is investigated by conducting a minimum cost design optimisation on a building of span of 6 m, height-to-eaves of 3 m and frame spacing of 3 m; the effect of different number of bays are considered. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that gables are rigid. The effect of stressed-skin action is larger for“square-shaped” buildings (i. e. when the span and length are the same on plan) and decreases as more bays are added(i. e. as the building becomes more “rectangular-shaped” on plan). The results of the minimum cost optimisation indicate that if stressed-skin action is taken into account, the cost of the internal frame can be reduced by around half for “square-shaped” buildings. It should be noted that this is a minimum cost optimisation, which {{is not the same as}} a minimum weight optimisation. It is also shown that a safe design of internal frames could be obtained by ignoring wind loads (i. e. designing the frame only for gravity loads),but this is limited to buildings having a “square-shape”...|$|R
