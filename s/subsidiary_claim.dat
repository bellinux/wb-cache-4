40|$|Innovation {{heterogeneity}} {{refers to}} two empirical facts: economic sectors {{vary according to}} sources and rates of innovation, and innovations vary {{in terms of the}} magnitude of their economic impact. The central focus of this paper is the problem of scale effects in the Schumpeterian growth models. Although these models make endogenous the production of innovations, they assume not only an oversimplified pattern of sectoral innovation but also that major innovations are virtually indistinguishable from minor innovations. The main claim of the a er is that without a theoretical framework revolving around both the existence of realistic sectoral patterns of innovation and the explicit incorporation of major and minor innovations it is extremely difficult to resolve the scale effects problem in a satisfactory fashion. We disaggregate the 2 ̆ 7 ideas production function 2 ̆ 7 in a way that may be useful to guiding future research aimed at ameliorating the intensity of the scale effects and introduce the concepts of 2 ̆ 7 awkward fact 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 innovation regime 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|The key step in {{understanding}} economie growth {{is to think}} carefully about ideas. This requires careful attention {{to the meaning of}} the words that we use and to the metaphors that we invoke when we construct mathematical models of growth. After addressing these issues, this paper describes two different ways in which ideas can contribute to economic development. The history of Mauritius shows how a poor economy can benefit by using ideas from industrial countries within its borders. The history of Taiwan (Chinza) shows how a developing economy can be pushed forward into the ranks of those that produce ideasfor sale on world markets. The central claim of this paper is that the difference between the economics of ideas and the economics of objects is important for our understanding of growth and development. A <b>subsidiary</b> <b>claim</b> is that academic and policy discussions in these areas might be more fruitful if we spent less time working out solutions to systems of equations and more time defining precisely what the words we use mean. The notion that ideas are different from oblects is both familiar and obvious. In the economic analysis of patents, for example, there is a long tradi...|$|E

It treated dividends received by UK resident companies from non-resident subsidiaries differently to dividends paid and received within wholly UK groups. This was contrary to EU law, specifically TEC art 43 on freedom of establishment and TEC art 56 on free movement of capital, and the ECJ said {{there had to be}} an effective remedy. Woolwich v IRC had established that recovery of unlawfully exacted tax could be made. The test claimant argued that section 32(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1980 allowed extended periods for bringing actions based on mistake, starting from the date of the discovery, and the only point for discovery was the ECJ judgment on 8 March 2001. They started proceedings on 8 September 2003, and the same day the Revenue announced legislation to disapply section 32(1)(c), which came in as the Finance Act 2004, section 320. Also, when the House of Lords judgment of 2006 confirmed a right to claim tax paid under a mistake, Parliament passed the Finance Act 2007 section 107, which disapplied section 32(1)(c) for proceedings brought before 8 September 2003. They used tax relief to reduce liability to pay tax. The tax was unlawful under EU law. The FII Group claimed the money back. It said it would have used the tax relief to reduce other lawful tax liabilities, if it had not already been used to pay the unlawful tax.|$|R

We develop a picture of bank claims on 13 CESE countries by combining credit statistics from several sources. Our constructed data suggest that some of these host countries have become more at risk from a sudden withdrawal of short-term external funding, while home countries have significant aggregate exposures to the region. Overall, we find that data on banking activity remain largely inadequate for surveillance and policymaking purposes, and that a concerted effort to improve data collection is needed at the international level.

40|$|This paper assesses G. A. Cohen’s {{critique}} of Rawlsian special incentives. Two arguments are identified and criticized: {{an argument that}} the difference principle does not justify incentives because of a limitation on an agent’s prerogative to depart from a direct promotion {{of the interests of}} the worst off, and an argument that justice is limited in its scope. The first argument is evaluated and defended from the criticism that once Cohen has conceded some ethically grounded special incentives he cannot sustain his {{critique of}} special incentives. But it is finally re-jected as a subtle form of an unreasonably demanding moral rigorism. The second argument is interpreted as the more plausible of Cohen’s claims. It has, however, to be defended via two <b>subsidiary</b> theses: the <b>claim</b> that Rawls endorses a moral division of labour and that this in turn grounds a further commitment to moral dualism as opposed to moral monism. This argument is assessed and rejected. Neither the moral division of labour nor moral monism supports the claim that in applying the principles of justice to a basic structure one does not thereby apply them to the individuals constrained to act within that structure in the marketing o...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported that examined consumers' perceptions of food package labels where health and nutrition claims were present {{and where they}} had been removed. Unlike previous studies examining the influence of information on perception, realistic materials were used. This was accomplished by presenting information on a computer as photo-realistic images of packages where claims had been removed by editing to give a without-claims condition. Automatic presentation of materials and data collection meant participants proceeded through the computer questionnaire without the presence of an experimenter. The experiment was conducted with both British and French consumers. No significant difference on purchase intention or attitude to purchase was found between conditions with either population sample. The British group showed a significant trend to rate products as likely to be approved by those whose opinion they regarded as important in the claims condition. French participants showed a similar effect whereby packages without claims were always perceived as significantly beneficial with a low subjective norm effect and a mixture of both factors with claims present. In both population samples, label information provision was evaluated more highly than a collection of single sensory and nutritional attributes. Multiple regressions against attitude to purchase showed that sensory attributes were given higher weighting than nutritional or direct label attitude measures with both groups. Argument that health and nutrition claims are likely to have very large effects on consumers' buying patterns thus may be treated with caution. These results suggest that from a marketing perspective where claims are relevant they should be given a <b>subsidiary</b> position to <b>claims</b> about sensory qualities...|$|R
40|$|We {{can learn}} from Europe 2 ̆ 7 s {{broadband}} success stories, writes TREVOR BARR We {{can learn from}} Europe 2 ̆ 7 s broadband success stories, writes Trevor Barr DR SAM PALTRIDGE of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development asked me in his Paris office, ?Guess what you get for A 50 a month from a broadband operator in Paris?? The answer: internet download speeds of up to 24 megabits a second and unlimited downloads, at least 100 television channels in the basic package (and the offer of another 100 channels if you pay extra), unlimited voice-over-internet protocol calls within France, and phone calls to other countries that save heaps ? all offered with no maximum contract periods for customers. Paltridge, an expatriate Australian {{who has worked for}} the OECD in Paris for the past decade providing research for their much-quoted index of comparative broadband take-up in 30 OECD countries, added: ?How does that speed compare with what?s on offer at home?? A bird?s-eye view of new Western European broadband systems shows just how far Australia is lagging behind, and just how much we are missing out on. Europe is undergoing considerable infrastructure experimentation and some old utilities are now using networks in new ways. In Norway a power company, Lyse Energi, used the power distribution networks to create a subsidiary broadband company Lyse Tele in 2002. Lyse Tele lays fibre through Lyse Energi?s electricity, gas and direct heating ducts to provide broadband connections to subscribers? homes. And typical of this frontier country, those Norwegian customers who were prepared to do the digging and trenching themselves in their front yards were offered good installation discounts! Lyse Tele boasts that it was the first broadband service provider in Europe to build a broadband system that combines ?good speed? internet access, 2 Mbps to 10 Mbps, with digital television and telephone services over a single fibre-optic cable to homes. And it offered this ?triple play? at a cost to its Norwegian customers of 20 per cent less than they were previously paying for receiving comparable services separately. France is a broadband success story of a different kind. The state regulatory body recently removed some of the key network competition access bottlenecks, enabling new players to emerge. The result is that not only does France Telecom itself now have among the highest number of broadband subscribers in Europe, but energetic new broadband providers have emerged as a result of gaining access to France Telecom?s old copper wires and applying their own DSL technologies. France?s big new broadband player, Free, an Iliard Group <b>subsidiary,</b> <b>claims</b> it was the first European company to offer comprehensive triple-play telecommunications services over copper through its Freebox modem. These triple services are internet access, IPTV and VoIP. Today more than 75 per cent of French internet users are triple-play subscribers. The transformation of French telecommunications {{over the past few years}} has been remarkable, and Parisians now have access to broadband services that are much faster and cheaper than almost anywhere in the US. But to find the most imaginative pioneers of broadband service innovation, one has to go to the Netherlands. In 2002 the Dutch government, in association with several private corporations, built an experimental communications model called Kenniswijk, which translates as somewhere between ?knowledge domain? and ?smart city. ? Tenders were called from municipalities wishing to participate in a broadband systems trial, and the first successful submission came from the market town of Nuenen, in the southern Netherlands. About 8000 Nuenen homes, housing about 15, 000 people, were connected free to a fibre-to-the-home network, representing a 96 per cent take-up. The government subsidised this experiment for a total cost of EUR 6. 4 million (A 10. 8 million). Each connection cost was subsidised by EUR 800. Unusually for a telecommunications company, the residents of Nuenen themselves, rather than an internet service provider, own the network. Their ownership is formalised within a cooperative society called Ons Net (Our Net). The fibre link provides 10 Mbps bandwidth in an open-access network, that is, it is open to many service providers. Residents were given the opportunity to donate their EUR 800 government subsidy to Ons Net in return for co-operative membership. These consumers also got a flag to put in their front garden to show that they were part of this experiment. So for those parents in homes who originally opted out of joining the experiment, their children asked why their neighbours were enjoying great new services as well as flying a lovely flag! Many services are offered that may seem ordinary but that are useful or important in people?s everyday lives. They include parents videotaping their children?s football matches to send them around the network to other team members, or the capability to view, swap or edit digital photos, and educational channels that give children access to experts for their projects. When the period of free ?test bed? access ended at the end of 2005, these services were offered at a cost of EUR 60 to EUR 75 a month, depending on bundling discounts. So how did the users respond when they no longer had free access to this system? Remarkably at the beginning of 2006, and largely maintained now, 80 per cent of Nuenen residents chose to continue their broadband subscriptions on a paying basis. Why can?t Australians too have attractively priced high-speed broadband systems that promote user-led program innovation? ?

40|$|Understanding how {{decisions}} for international investments {{are made and}} how this affects the overall pattern of investments and firm’s performance is of particular importance both in strategy and international business research. This dissertation introduced first home-host country relatedness (HHCR) as {{the degree to which}} countries are efficiently combined within the investment portfolios of firms. It theorized and demonstrated that HHCR will vary with the motivation for investments along at least two key dimensions: the nature of foreign investments and the connectedness of potential host countries {{to the rest of the}} world. ^ Drawing on cognitive psychology and decision-making research, it developed a theory of strategic decision making proposing that strategic solutions are chosen close to a convenient anchor. Building on research on memory imprinting, it also proposed that managers tend to rely on older knowledge representation. In the context of international investment decisions, managers use their home countries as an anchor and are more likely to choose as a site for foreign investments host countries that are ‘close’ to the home country. These decisions are also likely to rely more strongly on closeness to time invariant country factors of historic and geographic nature rather than time-variant institutions. Empirical tests using comprehensive investments data by all public multinational companies (MNC) worldwide, or over 15, 000 MNCs with over half a million <b>subsidiaries,</b> support the <b>claims.</b> ^ Finally, the dissertation introduced the concept of International Coherence (IC) defined as the degree to which an MNE’s network comprises countries that are related. It was hypothesized that maintaining a high level of coherence is important for firm performance and will enhance it. Also, the presence of international coherence mitigates some of the negative effects of unrelated product diversification. Empirical tests using data on foreign investments of over 20, 000 public firms, while also developing a home-host country relatedness index for up to 24, 300 home-host pairs, provided support for the theory advanced. ...|$|R
