5|$|In 2007, the <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> round {{became a}} full semifinal, {{taking place in}} a venue {{comparable}} in size to those hosting the others. The expanded <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed {{with the introduction of}} a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> round (Andra chansen) is {{the fifth}} heat in which the {{remaining}} four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> round in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Druckmann {{wrote the}} story {{in his spare time}} while working at the video game {{developer}} Naughty Dog. He considers A <b>Second</b> <b>Chance</b> at Sarah to be a personal story, focusing on the characters instead of the supernatural elements.

Wong's work on the book was extensive, as she refined and extended Druckmann's initial concepts and ideas. The two worked on the book for over a year. The book received generally positive reviews. Critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.|$|E
