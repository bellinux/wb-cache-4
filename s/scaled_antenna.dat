A directivity of 18 +/- 0. 5 dB is calculated from E- and H-plane measurements.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for deployable antenna systems on micro-satellites, {{specifically on the}} CubeSat platform, are ever changing. This thesis will address the possible antenna systems that would best be deployed on a CubeSat, with the major focus on the conical log-spiral antenna (CLSA) due to its frequency independent characteristics. The antenna design will then go beyond the published works of the CLSA to introduce a new feeding concept, a bottom fed CLSA. Necessity for this feeding rises out of limited deploying capabilities of the CubeSat platform, which is significantly smaller than the proposed antenna due to frequency constraints. A scaled prototype of the bottom fed CLSA is investigated and optimized. The <b>scaled</b> <b>antenna</b> system is constructed {{and the results are}} presented.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of installed performance of antennas on aircraft {{is a very}} difficult task. Experimentally, patterns can be measured by performing in-flight tests, which are very expensive and allow in general the determination of only few cuts. This costly method can be replaced by down scaling the dimensions of the aircraft and of the antenna, whilst scaling up the frequency during the measurements, so that all the electrical dimensions (in wavelengths) are kept the same. In such tests, a mock-up of the real aircraft and a <b>scaled</b> <b>antenna</b> model are necessary. The <b>scaled</b> <b>antenna</b> does not need to have exactly the same geometry as the full-scale one, but the radiation characteristics of the original antenna should be well represented. Alternatively to the aforementioned procedures, computer modelling can be used to assess installed performance of antennas. The main advantage of using simulations for this purpose is the reduction of time and costs. Moreover, some electromagnetic characteristics, such as surface current densities on the aircraft surface, can not be directly measured, but they can be accurately calculated using appropriate computer models. In order to validate numerical predictions of installed performance, simulated results are compared with measurements performed with a 1 / 15 th mock-up of a Fokker 100 aircraft. The simulations and measurements were done for two different 4 x 4 microstrip antenna arrays, which served as radiation models of a smart GALILEO digital-beamforming antenna under development at the Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Centre (DLR), in Oberpfaffenhofen. The chosen up-scaled frequency was 22 GHz, which corresponds to 1. 47 GHz if the full dimensions of aircraft and antenna are considered. Two different microstrip antenna arrays have been designed to assess installed performance of the full-scale smart antenna when mounted on a real Fokker 100 aircraft and operating under different beamforming conditions. The installed performance simulations have been performed using the FEKO electromagnetic simulator. Two numerical techniques have been used: physical optics (PO), which is an asymptotic technique suitable for scattering analyses at high frequencies, and the multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM). The latter is computationally more expensive than the former, but provides in general more accurate results. The computed surface currents will be shown in the symposium and the results obtained with both techniques will be compared. The measurements with the mock-up have been performed in DLR’s antenna testing range. The details concerning the measurement setup will also be discussed in the symposium. The comparison of computed and measured radiation patterns will be presented and discussed at the symposium. The numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measured data...|$|E

In order to validate numerical predictions of installed performance, simulated results are compared with measurements performed with different mock-ups of aircraft used in the civil aviation. The antennas used in the experiments are 4 x 4 microstrip planar arrays, which served as radiation models of a smart GALILEO digital-beamforming antenna under development at the Institute of Communications and Navigation. Two arrays have been used: one broadside and the other with the main lobe pointing to 40 ° from the boresight. During the measurements, these antennas simulated the real smart array operating under different beamforming conditions. The single elements are right-handed circularly polarized patches that are coupled to the feed lines by means of slots. The optimal axial ratio is obtained at 22 GHz. The top part (patches and slots) is the same for both arrays. For producing different beam directions, different feed networks have been designed. In both cases, all the 16 patches are fed with the same amplitude. For the broadside array, the elements are fed with the same phase, whereas a progressive phase shift of 140 ° has been applied along the horizontal direction. The installed performance simulations have been done using the FEKO electromagnetic simulator. Physical optics (PO) and the multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM) were the numerical techniques used in the analyses. Further information about the choice of the position to install the arrays on the mock-ups and details describing the simulations will be given at the conference. The measurements with the mock-up have been performed in DLR’s antenna test range. The details concerning the measurement setup will be discussed at the conference. A comparison of computed and measured radiation patterns will be presented. The numerical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data, especially in terms of co-polarization. ...|$|E

Both the subscale antenna, nominally 5 by 4 meters in dimensions, and the full <b>scale</b> <b>antenna,</b> taken as nominally 18 by 4 meters in size, were considered.

30|$|The {{aggregation}} of sub- 6 GHz {{bands and}} millimetre wave bands (E- and V-bands) for the backhaul networks is an appealing solution.

In this approach, small cells are classified according to whether {{they have access to}} fibre backhaul, and then, the wireless backhaul resources are shared among those with no fibre infrastructure for backhaul. Taking into account cost constraints, a technique that transits from the sub- 6 GHz band to millimetre wave band as the backhaul resource demands increase is proposed. Taking into account the very small wavelength at the millimetre wave band, the large <b>scale</b> <b>antenna</b> array systems (LSAS) technology, which will be discussed in Section 6.1, can also be incorporated to boost the performance of backhaul solutions.|$|R
