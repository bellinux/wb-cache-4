It is not known whether mossy fiber sprouting increases the number of synapses in the molecular layer or merely replaces lost contacts. Using the pilocarpine model of status epilepticus to induce mossy fiber sprouting, and cycloheximide to block this sprouting, we evaluated at the ultrastructural level the number and type of asymmetric <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. As expected, whereas pilocarpine-treated rats had dense silver grain deposits in the inner molecular layer (reflecting mossy fiber sprouting), pilocarpine+cycloheximide-treated animals {{did not differ from}} controls. Both groups of treated rats (Pilo group and CHX+Pilo group) had reduced density of asymmetric synaptic profiles (putative excitatory <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts),</b> which was greater for cycloheximide-treated animals. For both treated groups the loss of excitatory <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> was even greater in the outer molecular layer than in the best studied inner molecular layer (in which mossy fiber sprouting occurs).

For this purpose, the quantitative distribution of the overall and of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) population of <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> was investigated in each layer of the somatosensory barrel field cortex of rats which were sensory deprived from birth by continuously removing rows of whiskers. Whereas there were no statistically significant changes in the quantitative distribution of the overall synaptic population, the number and proportion of GABA-immunopositive <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> were profoundly altered in layer IV of the somatosensory cortex of sensory-deprived animals. These changes were attributable to a specific loss of as many as two-thirds of the GABA contacts targeting dendritic spines. Thus, <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> made by GABA terminals in cortical layer IV and, in particular, those targeting dendritic spines represent a structural substrate of experience-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, since in this model of cortical plasticity the neuronal receptive-field properties are known to be affected, we propose that the inhibitory control of dendritic spines is essential for the elaboration of these functional properties...|$|R

5000|$|Most axons carry {{signals in}} the form of action potentials, which are {{discrete}} electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact</b> with target cells. The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] — every action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size. There are, however, some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable amplitude.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{synaptic}} {{signals that}} are {{received by the}} dendrite are combined in the soma in order to generate an action potential that is then transmitted down the axon toward the next <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact.</b> Thus, the backpropagation of action potentials {{poses a threat to}} initiate an uncontrolled positive feedback loop between the soma and the dendrites. For example, as an action potential was triggered, its dendritic echo could enter the dendrite and potentially trigger a second action potential. If left unchecked, an endless cycle of action potentials triggered by their own echo would be created. In order to prevent such a cycle, most neurons have a relatively high density of A-type K+ channels.|$|E

Serial-section reconstruction was used to reveal the distribution of <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts</b> of different types on the afferent terminals. The majority of afferent boutons received axoaxonic and made axodendritic or axosomatic <b>synaptic</b> <b>contacts.</b> In the ventral horn, 91 % of boutons presynaptic to the afferent terminals were immunoreactive for GABA alone and 9 % were immunoreactive for both GABA and glycine.

A total of 440 synaptic terminals, identified {{by the presence of}} a population of vesicles, was studied, including those labeled by 5 -hydroxydopamine and all those unlabeled in the surrounding neuropil. Three categories of synaptic profiles innervating neostriatal dendrites could be discerned. One category contained small rounded or slightly pleomorphic vesicles and consisted of a sample of 375 endings, 53 of which exhibited light to heavy label inside the synaptic vesicles. All of these, labeled and unlabeled, showed evidence of membrane specializations and other conventional criteria of <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact,</b> mostly in the form of asymmetric synaptic contacts with the heads of dendritic spines. A second category of 40 terminals, 3 of which were lightly labeled, contained large rounded or slightly pleomorphic vesicles and made predominantly symmetric contacts with the shafts of dendritic spines or spine-free portions of dendritic membrane. None of these synaptic endings appeared to lack <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact</b> with postsynaptic targets in the neostriatum. A third category of 25 terminals, 3 of which were labeled, contained small flattened vesicles, and these endings also invariably made <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact,</b> mostly onto spine-free dendritic membrane, and were characterized by symmetric membrane thickenings at the point of apposition.

N-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule essential for <b>synaptic</b> <b>contact</b> and is involved in the intracellular signaling pathway at the synapse. Here we report that the functional disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell contact activated p 38 MAPK in murine primary neurons, followed by neuronal death. We further observed that treatment with Aβ 42 decreased cellular N-cadherin expression through NMDA receptors accompanied by increased phosphorylation of both p 38 MAPK and Tau in murine primary neurons. Moreover, expression levels of phosphorylated p 38 MAPK were negatively correlated with that of N-cadherin in human brains. Proteomic analysis of human brains identified a novel interaction between N-cadherin and JNK-associated leucine zipper protein (JLP), a scaffolding protein involved in the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway. We demonstrated that N-cadherin expression had an inhibitory effect on JLP-mediated p 38 MAPK signal activation by decreasing the interaction between JLP and p 38 MAPK in COS 7 cells.

We demonstrate that under specific culture conditions, primary vestibular neurons from young mice or rats exhibit robust ability to regenerate nervous processes.
