500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public {{recreation}} {{areas and}} drainage sites were {{set aside in}} western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time {{on the fringe of}} Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that [...] "work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that something is going on, or <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on, but this one is taking a very long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad and we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> in a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E
2500|$|As the Guardians summary shows, {{even after}} the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO {{continued}} to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: [...] "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO {{that they had been}} destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of'." [...] Elkins agreed that it was [...] "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> off." [...] Drayton also noted that the FCO [...] "refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled." [...] Drayton further mused that [...] "it was almost as if the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] {{she told}} him, quietly enough and yet very convincingly. [...] "If I {{did not care}} I <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> here.

60|$|Altogether that {{unnecessary}} uproar was distracting, {{but down}} there in my cabin I took it calmly.

60|$|At once, I am {{ashamed to}} say, Heaven lost its exalted {{position}} in my eyes.

"As the man {{remembered that}} we had made {{ourselves}} pleasant on board, he agreed at once to take me, next time the boat <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>going.</b> I laid out a pound in getting a coat more suitable for travelling in France than the peasant's smock.

5000|$|The {{extent of}} the Finance Minister's concern first {{publicly}} emerged the following morning when he was interviewed by RTÉ's economics editor George Lee.

60|$|It {{was not yet}} {{dark when}} we arrived at our {{destination}} without having seen man or woman on the road, all of which caused me yet more anxiety, for I failed to understand why it was that on this day when the curious people of Virginia <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> to and fro to see the king's soldiers, none save ourselves were abroad.|$|R
