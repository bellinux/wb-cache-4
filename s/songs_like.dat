5|$|Avril Lavigne is {{considered}} a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to {{paved the way for}} the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Hey Monday, among others as being a direct result. She was compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and earned a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and also as one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style. <b>Songs</b> <b>like</b> Sk8er Boi, He Wasn't and Girlfriend are frequently listed as one of the best pop-punk songs of all time, by different critics.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
25|$|Fahrenheit's songs mainly {{fall into}} the bubblegum pop and pop ballad category. However, <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> Teachable Child (孺子可教 Ru Zi Ke Jiao) and Love's Arrived (愛到 Ai Dao) are {{intended}} for a light R approach. Songs similar to The Secret of Immortality (不死之謎 Bu Si Zhi Mi) and Superb (出神入化 Chu Shen Ru Hua) are leaning toward the pop rock and rap genre, where they displayed their ability to rap and harmonize well.|$|E

25|$|After {{the album}} Heaven (Thiên đường), the albums My Love (Tình em), What if (Nếu như), and The best of Thu Minh were {{released}} in 2005, 2007 and 2008 respectively. Her next album {{in the same}} year 2008, I Do, differently covers the scope of ballad songs both in Vietnamese and English. This remarkably highlighted her coordination with newborn model-to-be-singer Nathan Lee, not with wide range of music types (a mix of pop-ballad, Dance-pop and folk <b>songs)</b> <b>like</b> previous albums.|$|E
25|$|Kaufman was program {{director}} and primetime evening DJ on the nation's first FM rock station WOR-FM, {{changing the way}} in which radio listeners heard rock music. During the short run of progressive rock programming – the station switched to an oldies format within the first year – listeners {{would have been able to}} hear the full, album versions of <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> Like A Rolling Stone and Society's Child which were either played in shorter versions on AM radio or not played at all.|$|E
25|$|French <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> La Zone by Fréhel (1933), Aux quatre coins de la banlieue by Damia (1936), Ma banlieue by Reda Caire (1937), or Banlieue by Robert Lamoureux (1953), {{evoke the}} suburbs of Paris {{explicitly}} since the 1930s. Those singers give a sunny festive, almost bucolic, image of the suburbs, yet still few urbanized. During the fifties and the sixties, French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré evokes in his songs popular and proletarian suburbs of Paris, to oppose them to the city, considered by comparison as a bourgeois and conservative place.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{also got}} 20 {{years of life}} {{experience}} on it - from many different angles. A <b>song</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Jilly's on Smack" [...] just wouldn't have been written in the early Nineties, because we hadn't lost a friend to heroin addiction. A <b>song</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Lee Van Cleef" [...] which is reflective of my youth just wouldn't have been written back then.|$|R

25|$|He is revered as a {{hero and}} martyr in Kabylie, the Berber World, and the world. Matoub was reviled {{by most of the}} Muslim {{population}} in Algeria for his Laïc political and religious views and the alleged blasphemy of some <b>songs</b> (<b>like</b> Allahu Akbar) along with his militant advocacy of Berber rights, so he was unpopular among both warring parties during the Algerian Civil War. His assassination, in circumstances which remain unclear, provoked violent riots in Kabylie. Berber Algerians still accuse the Algerian government of killing Matoub Lounès, but some of the Algerian government's figures accused the Islamist terrorists of this crime.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the topics}} {{explored}} {{by the new}} kantocu (singer or composer of kanto) perhaps the most frequent subjert of satire was the new role of women {{brought about by the}} formation of the Republic. <b>Songs</b> <b>like</b> Sarhoş Kızlar (Drunken Girls) or Şoför Kadınlar (Women Drivers) were sung seemingly in revenge for all the suffering they had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society. Songs such as Bereli Kız (The Girl with the Beret) and Kadın Asker Olursa (If Women Were Soldiers) were full of mockery and ridicule.|$|E
25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and {{people want to hear}} these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} one of her singing {{promotions}} for Where Love Has Gone that Vega was discovered by Bong Carreon, who then offered {{her to be a}} recording artist for the then newly formed Emerald Recording Company owned by Carreon and his then wife, the famous Filipina singer Imelda Papin. Her debut single Somewhere In My Past, composed by Mon Del Rosario, was a major hit which became a certified gold record in only its first few weeks of release and would prove to be her most enduring hit and the one song she would be most identified with. The single’s success prompted Bong Carreon and Imelda Papin to launch Vega as a full-time solo artist by coming up with the latter’s 1985 debut album First Love, which included Somewhere In My Past and produced her further hit <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> Someone Special, The Memory Will Remain, and the title track itself.|$|E
25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E

500|$|After {{studying}} {{the music of}} the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of Hair. [...] He listened to [...] "what [...] called quaylas... very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. [...] Much deeper though.... Hair is very African – a lot of [...] rhythms, not the tunes so much." [...] Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in <b>songs</b> <b>like</b> [...] "What a Piece of Work Is Man" [...] and [...] "Ain't Got No Grass". [...] MacDermot said, [...] "My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock & roll – but to me that translated to 'funk.'"
