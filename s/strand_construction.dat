50|$|Gibbs {{designed}} one {{church for}} the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, St Mary le <b>Strand.</b> <b>Construction</b> began in 1714 {{and it was}} complete by 1717. Between 1721 and 1726 Gibbs designed his most important and influential work, the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, located in Trafalgar Square, London. Gibbs' initial radical design for the commission was for a circular church, derived from a design by Andrea Pozzo; its illustration in Gibbs' book was to influence several adaptations by Neoclassical architects. This {{was rejected by the}} commission, and Gibbs developed the present rectangular design. The layout and detailing of the building owes much to Wren, in particular the church of St James', Piccadilly. However, Gibbs' innovation at St Martin's was to place the steeple centrally, behind the pediment. By contrast, Wren's steeples were usually adjacent to the church, rather than within the walls. This apparent incongruity was criticised at the time, but St Martin-in-the-Fields nevertheless became a model for church buildings, particularly for Anglican worship, across Britain and around the world.|$|E

40|$|Beam-like structures, {{constructed}} from many long strands that are constrained rather than bonded together, can provide appreciable levels of structural damping through friction between individual strands. This paper describes experimental and numerical studies, {{carried out on}} square-section metal beams, which are aimed at improving {{understanding of the relationship}} between construction and performance. A beam is formed from a pack of square-section strands that is held together at various compression loads with pre-calibrated clamps. Flexural deformation of the assembled beam is simulated using standard finite element analysis employing simple Coulomb friction at the interfaces. The validity of the assumptions used in the models is confirmed by comparison with three point bend tests on a regular nine <b>strand</b> <b>construction</b> at several different clamp loads. Dynamic loss factors for this beam are obtained by conducting forced vibration tests, which show that the damping is insensitive to frequency. Subsequent numerical studies are used to investigate the effects of increasing the number of strands whilst maintaining the overall cross-section geometry of the beam. It is found that the system stiffness drops and loss factor increases when more strands are used for a maintained beam cross-section. Interestingly, the energy dissipated by each beam construction is almost the same. These results provide a vital and necessary insight into the physics for stranded structures and materials that are largely prevalent in mechanical (e. g. cables) and electrical (e. g. wires) elements...|$|E
40|$|Spiral strands are {{lightweight}} and flexible structural elements, widely employed {{in many different}} applications, moreover, they are the basic components of stranded wire ropes. Bending behavior {{can play an important}} role in modeling slack cables and in "critical" regions of flexible ropes, such as in the neighborhood of clamping devices. When a strand is bent, wires tend to slip relatively one to each other. In the present work, the critical conditions for the onset of inter-layer sliding are investigated by defining the limit domain for wire slipping (the domain of "admissible values" for the axial force of a generic wire, accounting also for the contribution due to bending of the strand). The special case of uniform bending of the strand is considered and a closed form expression of the limit domain is presented. The non-holonomic nature of the strand mechanical model developed in this work leads to a lacking of symmetry for the tangent stiffness matrix. In the paper it is proved that this condition can be de facto relaxed in practical applications and that an elastic potential function, relating the generalized stress and strain variables of the strand in bending, can be defined only under the limit kinematic hypotheses of "full stick-state" or of "full slip-state". The aforementioned results are used as the starting block from which the strand full mechanical behavior for coupled axial force and bending is derived. Knowledge in closed form of how the limit domain depends upon the <b>strand</b> <b>construction</b> parameters and current stress conditions paves the way to design optimization of the strand...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Çelik halatlar; her önemli icat gibi bir ihtiyaçtan yola çıkılarak ortaya çıkmış parçalardır ilk örnekleri milattan önce(MÖ) 12000 - 9000 yılları arasında Mısır medeniyetinde rastlanmıştır ayrıca Finlandiya’da bulunan halatların Mezolitik dönemden (MÖ 9000 - 3000) kaldığı, Mısırda bulunan ve devetüyünden yapılan halatların ise 4000 yıldan daha eski olduğu varsayılıyor, orta cağda ise birçok binanın, heykelin ve şu an bildiğimiz tarihi simgelerin yapımında kullanılmıştır. Çelik halatların modern uygulamalarına en yakın örnek, madenlerden cevherleri yüzeye taşımak amacıyla Maden Mühendisi August Julius Albert tarafından 1834 yılında kendi ismi ile anılan (Albert Rope) halatı tasarlaması ile ortaya çıkmıştır, ilk üretilen halat madenlerden cevher taşımaya kullanılmıştır, halat üretilirken amaç sağlam olması ve tekrarlanabilir kuvvetler üzerinde dayanım göstermesidir. Deniz ortamındaki uygulamalar en eski ticaret sistemlerinden biri olan deniz yolunda, yükleri elleçlerken veya güvertede taşınan yüklerin güvenliğini sağlarken karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Çelik halatların tasarımı ve fiziksel modelleme çalışmaları 1800 ’lü yılların başlarından itibaren günümüze kadar birçok çalışmanın konusu olmuştur. Günümüzde çelik tel halatlar; gemilerin yükleme, tahliye ve güvenlik donanımlarının en önemli parçalarından biridirler. Tel halatlar deniz, hava, güneş etkileri altında bulunan ve çalışırken yıpratıcı kuvvetlere en fazla maruz kalan donanımlardır. Can ve mal güvenliğinin söz konusu olduğu şartlar altında çelik tel halatlar, planlı bakım-tutum sistemi içinde çeşitli şekillerde kullanılmakta ve gerektiğinde yenilenmektedirler. Ancak çelik tel halatlar için üretimden itibaren bir kullanım ömrü tanımlanmamış olup kullanılan yerlere göre ömürleri ve dayanıklılıkları tahmini olarak kabul edilmektedir. Bu çalışmada, deniz ortamında bulunan çelik halatlarda meydana gelen fiziki değişiklikler deneysel olarak incelenmiştir. Çeşitli ölçülerdeki çelik halatlar, deniz kıyısında kurulu bir düzenekle oluşturulan ortamda bekletilmiş ve tellerin; sıfır, üç, altı ve dokuz ay süre sonrasında ISO 6892 - 1 Standardına göre çekme testleri yapılmış ve sonuçlar karşılaştırılarak ortamın tel halatlar üzerindeki etkileri ölçülmüştür. Steel wire ropes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of loading, discharging and safety equipments of a ship. Wire ropes are the most effected equipments from the sea, air, sun and are the most exposed equipment to damaging forces. Steel wire ropes are used for planned maintanence system in different types, when safety of life and property are in question, and renewed when necessary. However, expiring date for steel wire rope is not defined, so that their validity and strengths are predicted depent on their using purposes.   Most wire ropes are constructed from either a single strand, or from several strands that are wound around a core. This core may either be a strand in itself or it may be a fibrous or deformable element. The strand is constructed of wires that are wound around a central wire. In single, straight strands, all wound wires are each configured as a single-helix. However, in a wound strand each wire (except for the central wire of the strand) is configured as a double-helix. The design of wire rope cross-sections dates back to the late 1800 _s (Sayenga, 1980), and has been continuously improved since. Many analytical studies of a multi-layer single <b>strand</b> <b>construction</b> have been proposed in literature (Cardou and Jolicoeur, 1997). Hruska (1952 a,b) and Lanteigne (1985), modeled the mechanical response of a multi-layer single <b>strand</b> <b>construction,</b> assuming a fiber response of each wire (i. e.,ignoring bending and torsion rigidity of the wires). Costello and Phillips (1976), Costello and Miller (1979), All the above studies were limited to a single, straight strand, in which all wound wires are single-helices. Jolicoeur and Cardou (1991) compared the mechanical response of a single strand rope as predicted by all the models mentioned above, and compared these models to experimental measurements of single strands. They showed that the simplifying assumption of fiber-like wires yields good results except for an inaccurate prediction of the torsion stiffness of the single straight strand. However, most cables in use have a more complex cross-section in which most wires are configured as double helices. In order to model the complex cross-section of multi-strand constructions, several modeling approaches (Costello, 1990) have been suggested. Velinsky (1981) and Velinsky et al. (1984) were the first to analyze the mechanical response of a multistrand construction. They extended the procedure developed by Costello and Phillips (1976) and Costello and Miller (1979) to treat a multi-strand construction of frictionless wires. Their modeling procedure is based on the nonlinear equations of equilibrium of a thin helical rod (Love, 1944) and considers the torsion and bending stiffness of the wires. Velinsky et al. computed the resultant tension and torque in a straight strand for uniform elongation and torsion of the straight strand. They then approximated the tension and torque of a wound strand that develop due to extension and twist of the wound strand by the same mechanical relation computed for the straight strand. To complete the model, they included the effect of changes in curvature of the wound strand by an approximation that considered planar bending of a straight strand around a cylinder. Phillips and Costello (1985) generalized Velinskys approach for any kind of wire rope with an Independent Wire Rope Core (IWRC). Their work considered the response of a rope bent over a sheave, and neglected friction forces between adjacent wires. This model was said to be applicable only to well-lubricate ropes or to ropes that are loaded exclusively in tension, without twisting or bending. The models of Velinski and of Philips and Costello give a good approximation of the mechanical response of the rope. However, to obtain complete description of the stress in individual wires there is need to develop a model that will explicitly take into account the double helix construction (e. g., the geometrical treatment of Wang and McKewan (2001)). This complete description will enable to estimate resultant ension, bending and torsion moments, relative displacements and contact forces, and the variations of all these along the individual double-helix wires. This information is essential for predicting fatigue life, wear,and overall mechanical response of the entire rope. It is difficult to conduct an analytical investigation of the mechanical response of wire rope because the kinematics of each wire is very complex. To facilitate an analytic study, it is therefore constructive to assume the kinematics of the wires, calculate the associated mechanical response of the whole construction, and examine the consequences of the assumptions by considering their affect on the validity of the equilibrium equations (Love, 1944). In this thesis, physical changes of steel wire ropes in marine enviroment conditions are investigated experimentally. Steel wire ropes in different sizes,are stored in a place which is built on the shore side and tensile tests of wires are done at the end of the zero, three, six and nine months period of time according to ISO 6892 - 1 standard, then the effects of environment on wire ropes are measured through comparison of result. Unloading of materials, its safety, installation and demounting of the components, and the status of the steel cables depending on time variations in marine environment are examined. Steel ropes are exposed to many corrosive effect during their use where the most important of these is corrosion and abrasion. Addition of these two effects, the metals are exposed to the fatigue. On the ship, the steel ropes are multi-purpose parts where they are either under constantly the load or no load of entire life and in generally unknown exact a lifetime. In our experiment, exposure of any load to the steel wire with the different diameters non artificial sea environment over a year and the particular regular tensile tests whether the results were evaluated.  Steel ropes exposed to a very corrosive effect as known; that is the reason that we have conducted the experiment in order to achieve results with minimal effects. In order to do that, we have tried the no load condition only overlapping consisting of various diameters to wire rope is waited in the platform we aimed to examine the changes. The use of steel cables in order to create a suitable environment ITU Maritime Faculty on the campus of the area close to the sea has been identified, we choose both the field of observation, we can close both experimental applications, and we can perform a location. Rope for the pin to be able to interact with each other and prevent them from a height of 10 cm from the soil to the wood plastic crates are secured with cable ties. Ropes are secured after the controlled and continuous contact with each other is prevented. Also it is not affected from weather conditions with constantly keeping under control. In the artificial platform, we have started from the day on steel ropes soaked in sea-water twice a day and at the end of the tenth month, sea water, rain, snow, wind, humidity, sun, and most importantly, the effects of the naturally exposed. The test can be done after determining the appropriate size, steel wire rope manufacturer or vendor of the company in ships with ropes which are used more idea you have been exchanged, as a result of our conversations in a bundle 19 of the wire and 6 bundles of hemp concise decision was made on the rope.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an exploratory study of longitudinal performance data of second language acquisition, augmented by sentences from a grammaticality judgement task. The {{focus is on}} preposition pied-piping and <b>stranding</b> <b>constructions</b> as documented in a generative framework. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate these data within in the context of markedness theory associated with Universal Grammar in order to determine whether or not the postulated developmental sequence was reflected in the data. Preposition pied-piping and stranding have been investigated recently within this framework in cross-sectional studies and have provided researchers with inconclusive results. For the purposes of this thesis it was hypothesized that longitudinal data would provide clarification of the development and use of these constructions in the acquisition of English as a second language by adult learners. It was further assumed that the longitudinal study would permit additional insight into the acquisition of the constructions concerned that would lead to the formulation of hypotheses for future research. In addition to the longitudinal data from the learners, data from native speaker control groups were collected in order to validate the authenticity of the constructions the learners provided and to ensure that preposition stranding is used as anticipated in informal interaction. The results provide support for the developmental sequence postulated by markedness theory. They show that the learners go through a brief stage during which they accept and produce preposition pied-piping, but explicitly reject stranding. The analysis of the data shows that the five learners use the constructions under investigation less frequently than might be expected. This seems to suggest that transfer from the native languages involved, which have the unmarked but not the marked construction, is not an important factor although it cannot be ruled out. Some learners produced stranded versions but rejected them on the grammaticality task. This combined with the low frequency and the limited syntactic and lexical range of the utterances suggests that the learners produced at least some of the early stranded versions as unanalyzed chunks. Evidence of avoidance of the pied-piping and <b>stranding</b> <b>constructions</b> was also found. The native speaker control groups, who were given pied-piped and stranded versions of each of the learner utterances in order to decide which one they would likely have chosen, strongly favoured <b>stranded</b> <b>constructions</b> over pied-piped ones in most instances. In conclusion, the data provide support for the developmental sequence postulated in a theory of markedness. They also suggest a number of potential hypotheses for future research...|$|R

40|$|Sports tourism has {{received}} growing attention in academic research {{over the past}} two decades but limited focus has been given to understanding the consumer and factors influencing decisions to include sport as part of the trip. This research provides, through a focus on the sport of golf, insight into the characteristics of the sports tourist, how participation is included in trips, how the emotional rewards gained from participation can influence sports tourist behaviours, and thus influence the selection of locations deemed suitable for sports participation. Specifically the aim of this thesis is to evaluate the relationships between golfer characteristics, golfer behaviours and destination choice. The research employs a grounded theory methodology, underpinned by a constructivist epistemology. This informed the process used to gather and analyse data as well as the presentation of this thesis. Three iterations of data (presented as discrete chapters) provide a robust analysis of literature and the twenty-seven interviews with UK-based golf tourists. Analysis elucidated the golfer characteristics, concluding with the development of a golf tourism participation spectrum. This understanding of the golf tourist informed the development of a substantive theory explaining the relationship between golf tourist behaviours and destination selection. A model detailing that the relationship is constructed through six conceptual <b>strands</b> (<b>construction</b> of the golf holiday, emotional rewards of participation, total trip spend, amenities and support facilities, course characteristics and influences of reputation). The first four of these strands directly influences golfer behaviour, with the latter two strands combining with behaviour to determine destination selection. Significant to the substantive theory is the identification of four spheres of influence (group dynamics, the role of competitions and ability, golfing capital and the role of intermediaries) which interact with the conceptual strands to govern destination selection.

Extensive parametric studies have been carried out, using the orthotropic sheet theoretical model of Hobbs and Raoof, {{on a wide range}} of spiral <b>strand</b> <b>constructions,</b> with outside diameters, d, and lay angles, a, in the practical ranges, 16. 4 mm ≤ d ≤ 184 mm, and 11 ≤ α ≤ 24, respectively. The effects of an external hydrostatic pressure on certain structural characteristics of sealed spiral strands, used in deep water applications, have also been studied in some detail, for water depths ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The results, based on such theoretical parametric studies, have, for example, been used to refute claims by Jolicoeur that, by a simple modification, a significant improvement to the original orthotropic sheet model of Hobbs and Raoof, had been found. In addition, using such studies, axial fatigue life design S-N curves have been developed, which cater for the effects of an externally applied hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands. Simple (hand-based) formulations have also been developed for estimating the maximum frictional axial and torsional hysteresis along with,the associated axial load range/mean axial load, and range of twist/ 2, respectively, at which they occur, relating to both, the in-air conditions and also when a sheathed spiral strand is subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure. The previously reported work of Raoof and his associates, in connection with the response of helical cables (spiral strands and/or wire ropes) to impact loading, has been extended to include the development of closed-form solutions for predicting the extensional-torsional wave speeds and displacements, in axially preloaded helical cables, experiencing a half-sine type of impact loading at one end, with the other end fixed. The influence of the lay angle on the response of a spiral strand to three different (i. e. unit-step, triangular and half-sine) forms of impact loading functions, has also been analysed, with much emphasis placed on the practical implications of the final results in connection with non-destructive methods of wire fracture detection under service conditions [...] . ...|$|R

5000|$|Cable is {{very strong}} in tensile strength, with a {{breaking}} strength in excess of 1000 lbs for these types of uses, and is a suitable in-fill material for a railing ("guard" [...] in ICC codes). Typical diameters are 1/8", 3/16" [...] for residential and 3/16" [...] and 1/4" [...] for commercial applications. [...] There are many different types cable and strand (also referred to as wire rope). Cable and strand is available in galvanized carbon steel, type 304 stainless steel, or the highly corrosion resistant, type 316 stainless steel (best for coastal areas). The most common cable construction is 1x19 type <b>construction</b> <b>strand,</b> which is 19 cables twisted in a single bundle, whereas for example, 7x7 would be 7 cable bundles of 7 cables twisted. This type of stainless strand is designed to have limited stretch, as compared to galvanized, making it a good long term cable railing solution. It has long been used for yacht stays and guy wires, proving its outdoor durability and strength.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of 0. 7 in. (17. 8 mm), Grade 270 (1860), low-relaxation prestressing <b>strands</b> in <b>construction</b> is slow {{regardless of its}} advantages {{over the use of}} 0. 6 in. (15. 2 mm) and 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) strands. The limited research data and unavailable design guidelines partially account for the slow utilization. This study measured transfer and development length, and evaluated applicable strand spacing of 0. 7 in. (17. 8 mm) prestressing strands for 24 pretensioned concrete beams. Each beam contained one prestressing strand or two prestressing strands placed at spacing of 2. 0 in. (51 mm). The beams were fabricated with high strength, conventional concrete or high strength, self-consolidating concrete. The concrete compressive strengths varied from 5. 9 ksi to 9. 8 ksi (40. 7 MPa to 67. 6 MPa) at 1 day, and from 9. 2 ksi to 13. 4 ksi (63. 4 MPa to 92. 4 MPa) at 28 days. Transfer lengths were determined using concrete surface strains along with the 95 % Average Maximum Strain method. Initial strand end-slips were also measured for predicting transfer length at release using an empirical formula. The development lengths were determined by conducting bending tests with different embedment lengths. Experimental results indicated ACI 318 and AASHTO specifications are applicable to predict transfer length of 0. 7 in. (17. 8 mm) strands at release and at 28 days. A coefficient of 2. 38 was the most appropriate value to estimate transfer length at release from initial strand end-slip. Concrete compressive strength had little effect on the measured development lengths. The ACI 318 and AASHTO equations significantly over-predicted the measured development lengths. The use of strand spacing of 2. 0 in. (51 mm) has no significant effect on the measured transfer end development lengths. Two simple equations were proposed to predict transfer length and development lengths of 0. 7 in. (17. 8 mm) prestressing strands...|$|R
5|$|After 1732, the King's Mews {{were divided}} into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is {{occupied}} by the National Gallery. In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy. The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the <b>Strand</b> and the <b>construction</b> of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after. Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for William IV commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830. Around 1835, {{it was decided that}} the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar as suggested by architect George Ledwell Taylor, commemorating Nelson's victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} evaluates La Blogothèque recreating {{notions of}} truth {{by using a}} hybridisation of two different <b>strands</b> of the <b>constructions</b> of authenticity in their Take Away Shows. The literature review examines the key debates which have emerged from the current body of popular literature and academic work, including those on music authenticity, the music video, the internet and authenticity, film authenticity and a press review of La Blogothèque “recreating” the music video (Goodman, 2011). The researcher conducted a Take Away Show video analysis, with three different performances dating from 2006, 2008 and 2014. A YouTube video comment analysis was also developed, using comments from nine different Take Away Shows. A framework of theories {{for the analysis of}} the authenticity in music videos was used to guide the data collection and dissertation discussion. The framework is constructed as: the music video as “original”, “fresh” (Lister et al., 2009; Gardner, 2005), “spontaneous” (Hassard, 1998), “truthful” and “real” (Arms, 1996), “discovered” (Lister et al., 2009), “participatory” (Burgess & Green, 2009), “Exciting” (Gardner, 2005) and “reinvented” (Goodman, 2011). Evidence was found that La Blogothèque successfully uses both the internet and film techniques as authenticity constructs to recreate notions of truth. There were no conflicting issues within the research, and the results were found to be in accordance with the theoretical suggestions from the literature review. Furthermore, new concepts arose from the analytical discussion, including the music video as discovered and “rediscovered”, and the authenticity of “visceral” experiences...|$|R
40|$|The load {{transfer}} mechanisms of cable bolts differ from normal rebar bolts. Cable bolts used in mines are basically steel <b>strands</b> with different <b>constructions</b> {{depending on the}} number of wires or elements and the way that these elements are laid. Tendon bolts (rebar and cable) are normally evaluated for strength and {{load transfer}} properties. The strength of tendon can be carried out by tensile failure tests, while the load transfer strength is evaluated by pull and shear strength tests. Short Encapsulation Pull Testing (SEPT) is used to study of the load transfer capacities of tendons, and can be undertaken both in the laboratory and in situ. A new apparatus known as Minova Axially Split Embedment Apparatus (MASEA) was used to study load-displacement characteristics of smooth versus spiral profile cable bolts. Minova Stratabinder grout was used for encapsulating 400 mm long 19 wire 22 mm diameter superstrand cable in the embedment units. The anchorage of the cable on two sides of the embedment apparatus were intentionally installed at different lengths, to allow the cable to be pulled out {{from one side of the}} anchorage. The spiral wire strand cable bolts achieved higher peak pull-out load at minimum displacement in comparison with smooth surface wire strand. The peak pull out force increased with the age of encapsulation grout. The MASEA was easier to assemble and test at a short period of time, thus allowing quick and repeated tests to be undertaken...|$|R
50|$|In 1899 the {{property}} and license were purchased by John Henry Tyack. He raised a £14,000 mortgage on {{the property}}, and called for competitive designs to replace the timber building with a substantial brick structure. The winning entry was submitted by architects Eaton, Bates & Polin, who had opened an office in Townsville c.1901. Eaton & Bates had trained in Sydney, but {{by the turn of}} the century their principal offices were in Brisbane, with branch offices in Rockhampton, Townsville and Toowoomba. Arthur Polin was managing partner of the Townsville office.The original design was more modest in size than the final structure, extending along the Strand only as far as the eastern tower, and around the corner of Wickham Street for eight bays. It was erected in stages, with trade continuing from the original hotel on the corner of Wickham Street and the Strand until 1925. In 1901, Tyack purchased an adjoining block (site of the former North Australian Hotel) along the <b>Strand,</b> which permitted <b>construction</b> of the first section of the new Queen's Hotel, comprising the eastern tower and four bays to its west, c.1902. This section was extant by March 1903. In May 1904, Tyack replaced the first mortgage with one for £20,000, which probably financed construction of the second section, completed by 1905. This involved demolition of part of the timber building along the Strand, and the extension of the brick building a further six bays toward the corner of Wickham Street. The contractor was a Mr Boyle, and work was underway in January 1904. For the next twenty years, Queen's Hotel consisted of a brick wing along the Strand, and a corner timber section which continued back along Wickham Street.|$|R
