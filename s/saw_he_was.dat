5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
25|$|The {{right of}} local unions to strike {{was the primary}} issue in the negotiations. During his {{re-election}} campaign, Miller {{had been forced to}} accept as a collective bargaining goal the right to strike over local issues. But the owners rejected Miller's demand because they <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to bring wildcat strikers back to the bargaining table.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we <b>saw,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Celia! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} distinguished-looking men I ever <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> remarkably like the {{portrait}} of Locke. He has the same deep eye-sockets." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{described}} it as [...] "It was a depressing tour streaked with black humour but Theroux seemed out of depth analysing what <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> at his best getting to know and under {{the skin of his}} subjects." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{worrying}} Crabtree, {{and resolved}} {{to keep it}} up.|$|R
2500|$|The ERU team {{moved in}} to disarm him and turning him onto his back <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{critically}} injured. [...] Medical help was summoned and they began immediate CPR. [...] Despite various attempts to revive him, Carthy died quickly.|$|E
2500|$|But Dalkowski {{also often}} had extreme {{difficulty}} controlling his pitches. He often walked more batters than he struck out, {{and many times}} his pitches would go wild — sometimes so wild that they {{ended up in the}} stands. Batters found the combination of extreme velocity and lack of control intimidating. Oriole Paul Blair stated that [...] "He threw the hardest I ever <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> the wildest I ever saw".|$|E
2500|$|Lee Smart had {{tossed the}} {{gasoline}} as Jerry Myles lit {{a match to}} a torch he had constructed from a mop. [...] He thrust the mop at the guard, who froze in fear. [...] Smart and Alton lit a broom and tossed it onto the catwalk behind Byars, who, with his vision blurred by the gasoline, <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> surrounded by fire. [...] He quickly surrendered his keys and rifle and {{allowed himself to be}} led to the hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "The mate didn’t answer. He looked round {{helpless}} like, and see {{the third}} officer swopping glances with the second, and all the men looking sly and amused, and I think if ever a man <b>saw</b> <b>’e</b> <b>was</b> done <b>’e</b> did at that moment.|$|R
60|$|Jack Snipper {{turned as}} pale as death when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trapped.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of the former West Australian {{champion}} rover Johnny Leonard, who had been the captain coach of South Melbourne in 1932 (he played 12 VFL games with South Melbourne in 1932), Pratt was a champion: [...] "I think Pratt was the most freakish footballer I ever <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> more freakish than Ted Flemming, and that's saying something. He had a heart as big as a grandstand and stood up to heavy punishment as well as risking a broken neck in his phenomenal leaps for the ball. He was a great footballer".|$|E
2500|$|Approximately {{two hours}} after daybreak on November 26, 1864, [...] Carson's cavalry {{attacked}} a Kiowa village of 150 lodges. [...] The Chief, Dohäsan, and his people fled, passing the alarm to allied Comanche villages nearby. Marching forward to Adobe Walls, Carson dug in there about 10 AM, using {{one corner of the}} ruins for a hospital. [...] Carson discovered to his dismay that there were numerous villages in the area, including one very large Comanche village. [...] The total number of Indians opposing Carson are often estimated at 3,000, but {{it is unlikely that the}} total manpower of the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa-Apache amounted to more than one-half that number. [...] Whatever their numbers, Carson <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> outnumbered by the warriors pouring forward to engage him in battle, a much greater force than he had expected.|$|E
60|$|Gerald, {{knowing his}} father's humor, <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting on {{dangerous}} ground.|$|E
50|$|A man {{who once}} foretold the coming {{destruction}} of the world; he had visions and was {{thought of as a}} prophet who recorded what <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> now presumed to have been dead for a long time. No current significance has been attached to his name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{two men and}} a boy, {{one of the men}} being skipper, and {{the nearest}} {{approach}} to a human machine you ever <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a Highlander, a thorough seaman, hard as mahogany and about as dark, stiff as a poker, self-contained, silent, except when spoken to, and absolutely obedient." ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{heaved a}} sigh. The clerk <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> greatly disappointed.|$|R
60|$|Millicent <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> troubled, {{though she}} could not imagine the reason.|$|E
60|$|She <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{flattered by}} her diary. It did not repay her entirely.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with amazement, and hesitated for a while. She <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> drunk.|$|E
60|$|It was semi-dark in the vat, but {{presently}} {{his eyes}} grew accustomed to this, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> where <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|Harper {{pulled at}} the wheel, and Appleby <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{addressing}} him.|$|R
60|$|Lydgate did not answer, and she <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> debating with himself.|$|R
60|$|Chisholm {{looked at}} her with knitted brows and she <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{suffering}} for her sake.|$|E
60|$|The Master {{had changed}} countenance, and I <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> struck {{in a joint}} of his harness.|$|E
60|$|Chisholm did {{not follow}} him and Wyndham <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> musing about the romance of the sea.|$|E
60|$|Millicent <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> troubled, {{though she}} could not imagine the reason.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} hand, and they <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> holding a small revolver.|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{looked hard}} at him, and then {{leaned back in}} his chair, and laughed when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{perfectly}} serious.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he looked}} ahead and <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rushing rapidly toward a dense mass of clouds to the southeast.|$|E
60|$|The sheik {{was lying}} {{with his eyes}} shut. As Edgar {{approached}} he opened them, and the lad <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> recognized.|$|E
60|$|He came in {{pale and}} tired. His mother looked at him. She <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rather pleased, and her anxiety all went.|$|E
60|$|I had {{to think}} for a moment before I <b>saw</b> what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{referring}} to.|$|R
60|$|I <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taking several bank-notes {{out of the}} pocket-book, {{and stopped}} him.|$|R
60|$|By {{the twist}} {{of his mouth}} I <b>saw</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> only deferring a smile.|$|R
