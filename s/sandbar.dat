5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a <b>sandbar,</b> impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the <b>sandbar</b> until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} <b>sandbar,</b> or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the <b>sandbar</b> by itself. Once the water level rises above the <b>sandbar,</b> rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the <b>sandbar</b> can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved {{that it was possible}} to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents and shifting <b>sandbar</b> make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

40|$|The National Park Service funded a {{study to}} {{determine}} the impact of water released from the Glen Canyon Dam on <b>sandbars</b> downriver through Grand Canyon National Park. The project involves considerable amounts of messy and missing data. Some of the challenges faced and lessons learned during this project are described. Keywords: Sampling interval, environmental monitoring. 1 Why <b>Sandbars?</b> In 1990 the National Park Service (NPS) funded a project to measure <b>sandbars</b> in the Colorado River. The goal {{was to investigate the}} impact of water released from the Glen Canyon Dam on <b>sandbars</b> downriver from the dam (Figure 1). When Glen Canyon Dam was opened in 1966, the annual flood cycle was eliminated as the dam controlled all water flow. Floods scour the river bottom, bringing up sediment deposited there. When flood waters recede, the sediment is left on the shore of the river in the form of <b>sandbars.</b> Surveys of the river show that <b>sandbars</b> have decreased in size and number since the dam opened [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{barrier to}} {{navigation}} {{on the upper}} Columbia was the numerous <b>sandbars</b> that were used by spawning salmon.

5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a <b>sandbar</b> in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kentucky, Bowie {{spent most}} of his life in Louisiana, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the <b>Sandbar</b> Fight. What began as a duel between two other men {{deteriorated}} into a melée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of Rapides Parish with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the Bowie knife.|$|E
5|$|The predators of the {{tilefish}} {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish. Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish, but no evidence is seen of free-swimming tilefish {{being attacked by}} dusky sharks or <b>sandbar</b> sharks. The one listed predator for the tilefish is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter.|$|E
40|$|The nearshore {{zone of the}} Dutch {{coast is}} characterised by the {{presence}} of 2 or 3 alongshore <b>sandbars,</b> typically located in waterdepths of 6 m or less. These <b>sandbars</b> form a natural defence line against coastal erosion. Near Noordwijk an American video system, called Argus, collected video images of the nearshore zone on an hourly basis for over three years. From the analysis of these images, it was concluded that the behaviour of <b>sandbars</b> results from the natural alternation of storm and non-storm (nice weather) periods. The effect of extreme storms, occuring once or twice a year, on the behaviour of <b>sandbars</b> appears to be limited, especially on the long term. This PhD thesis adds to the understanding to natural changes that take place in the nearshore zone...|$|R

5|$|The {{shifting}} Columbia Bar makes passage {{between the}} river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous, and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation. Pacific Graveyard, a 1964 book by James A. Gibbs, describes the many shipwrecks near the mouth of the Columbia. Jetties, first constructed in 1886, extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting <b>sandbar</b> remain a threat to ships entering {{the river and}} necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties.|$|E
5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a <b>sandbar.</b> Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few <b>sandbar</b> sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{about the}} influence of sinusoidal <b>sandbars</b> towards the amplitude of incident wave. sinusoidal <b>sandbars</b> may lead to Bragg resonance. Basically, when a wave meets a different depth, it will scatter into a transmitted wave and a reflected wave. Bragg resonance happens when the wavelength of incident wave is twice of the wavelength of the periodic bottom disturbance. We apply the multi-scale asymptotic expansion to obtain the results. Eventually we find that a larger amplitude disturbance leads to larger reflected wave amplitude. This result explains that the sinusoidal <b>sandbars</b> indeed can reduce the amplitude of incident wave and protect a beach from large amplitude incident waves.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Surveys on {{the natural}} plant {{communities}} on the <b>sandbars</b> along the eastern coast of the peninsular Thailand in three provinces, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Songkhla and Narathiwat, have been carried out. Most of the natural vegetation on these <b>sandbars</b> had been become extinct, except for some remnants, left as separated spots. Four sites of those remnants were explored in this preliminary study. The plant species composition investigation and the primary analysis on community type through the Braun-Blanquet method of the four remnants show some common characters. These characteristics suggest that, in the past, the same vegetation may have dominated the landscape along the <b>sandbars</b> lying parallel to the seashore of Peninsular Thailand...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the <b>sandbar</b> shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|Counting casualties, Parker {{reported}} 40 sailors {{killed and}} 71 wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than 70 times with much {{damage to the}} hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded. Active and Solebay reported 15 casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded Acteon off the <b>sandbar,</b> {{set fire to the}} ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Patriots in small boats sailed out to the burning ship, fired some of its cannons at the British ships, took what stores and loot they could, and retreated shortly before the ship's powder magazine exploded.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, after {{recovering}} from wounds {{suffered in the}} <b>Sandbar</b> Fight, Bowie {{decided to move to}} Coahuila y Texas, at that time a state in the Mexican federation. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico banned religions other than Roman Catholicism and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land. Bowie was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the alcalde (chief administrator) of the town, Juan Martín de Veramendi, and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro. For the next 18months, Bowie traveled through Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in Alexandria, on September 29, two weeks before they were to be married.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the <b>sandbar</b> shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes <b>sandbar</b> willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent.

5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty.

When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the <b>sandbar</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E

5|$|Rossia {{was built}} by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. Construction began in October 1893 {{although}} she was not formally laid down until 20 May 1895 and launched on 30 April 1896. After her launch, she was towed to Kronstadt for fitting-out, but she was pushed onto a <b>sandbar</b> by a storm and required a month to free her. Rossia entered service in late 1896 and participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review in June 1897 at Spithead. She returned to Kronstadt to finish her trials before sailing for the Far East in October.

5|$|The Doom Bar is a <b>sandbar</b> at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
