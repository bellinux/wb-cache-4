5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people <b>still</b> <b>living</b> who knew the story.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was <b>still</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E

5|$|Catholic {{communities}} were already established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also {{existed in the}} country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.|$|E
5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, <b>still</b> <b>living</b> in the prehistory.|$|E

Two of Parry's three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry's youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later.

5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August.

5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a former spouse was <b>still</b> <b>living.</b> The monarch {{was required to}} be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were <b>still</b> <b>living</b> mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.|$|E
