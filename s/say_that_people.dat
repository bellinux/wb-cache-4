25|$|During {{this time}} period, Jobs and Brennan both became {{practitioners}} of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs {{was living with}} his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag, mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow. Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US. He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen. Jobs would later <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking.|$|E
25|$|Fowler's {{scientific}} {{research has been}} criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of cognitive development. The tables and graphs in the book were presented {{in such a way that}} the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of statistical verification of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of academic religion, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies.|$|E
25|$|Levi's Stadium has {{received}} some backlash from season ticket holders, who are unhappy regarding rules that won’t {{allow them to}} print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making re-sale very difficult. In addition, older 49ers fans <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience. Levi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated {{on the east side}} of the stadium and during these afternoon games, they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.|$|E

500|$|The Neptunes told MTV News {{that the}} duo and Timberlake drove {{in a car}} {{listening}} to Earth, Wind & Fire albums for inspiration, with {{the background of the}} band's music what the production duo wanted to implement into Justified musical content. The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they also listened to both Off the Wall (1979) and Thriller (1982), albums by Michael Jackson. Their intentions were to create music that was similar to Jackson's work without [...] "recycling them". One of the two members of The Neptunes, Chad Hugo, commented that they just wanted to re-create [...] "that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R It has elements of the old and the new." [...] The producer further went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> wanted Timberlake to be conformed to being part of boy band NSYNC, with the former insisting that the singer is an immaculate vocalist. Hugo acknowledged Timberlake's break-up with singer Britney Spears, saying that some of the album's music could be directed towards it.|$|E
2500|$|Unconscious agency {{processing}} {{can even}} alter, in the moment, how we perceive {{the timing of}} sensations or actions. Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in [...] "successful decide" [...] RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials {{that should have been}} labelled [...] "failed to decide" [...] were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> [...] "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" [...] when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Spatial {{memory recall}} is built upon a {{hierarchical}} structure. That is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> remember the general layout {{of a particular}} space and then [...] "cue target locations" [...] located within that spatial set. This paradigm includes an ordinal scale of features that an individual must attend {{to in order to}} inform his or her cognitive map. Recollection of spatial details is a top-down procedure that requires an individual to recall the superordinate features of a cognitive map, followed by the ordinate and subordinate features. Thus, two spatial features are prominent in navigating a path: general layout and landmark orienting (Kahana et al., 2006).|$|E

2500|$|... "Ain't it Funny (Murder Remix)" [...] is {{a hip-hop}} song with a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-nine seconds (3:49). It is thematically dissimilar to the original track. While he was working towards the remix, Ja Rule boasted [...] "I'm about to f--- ya'll up," [...] stating that the song's sampling of Craig Mack's [...] "Flava In Ya Ear" [...] would be [...] "remixed" [...] and [...] "vamped up crazy". He said [...] "It's totally not J. Lo". Over the reworking of the [...] "Flava In Ya Ear" [...] beat, Lopez sings about [...] "a boyfriend who keeps messing up," [...] while Rule and Cadillac Tah [...] "drop rhymes" [...] on the track. Rule raps that he's [...] "Off the wall like MJ in his early days," [...] which is a reference to Michael Jackson's album Off the Wall (1979). The rapper also says [...] "Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha," [...] choca meaning pussy, the slang term for vagina.

2500|$|Discussing other {{specific}} {{songs on}} the album, Skiba mentioned that the title track uses heroin and methadone addiction {{as a metaphor for}} love, stating that [...] "It's a human condition that I think we all, in one way or another, fall victim to. It's not to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can't be happy or find bliss in a relationship. It's just amazing to me how unhappy most people are and they can't shake it and can't fix it, much like an addiction." [...] He also discussed the politically themed [...] "The American Scream", a song inspired by the suicide of a United States Army soldier after his return from the War in Afghanistan: [...] "For a long time we were afraid to write overtly political songs but I read this article about a US soldier that came back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan and blew his head off on his mother's grave and I wrote a song about that." [...] He has described the lyrical style of This Addiction as [...] "thinking-man's punk": [...] "We wanted to do something that's fun but also interesting and lyrically, something that will be fun for people to read along to and hopefully understand." ...|$|E
