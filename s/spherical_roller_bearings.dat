25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on coil springs, with a secondary cast bolster with spring plank, supported on swing links and coil springs. Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a maximum axle load of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|E

50|$|Since SKF {{introduced}} the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1919, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturers have purposefully been refined through the decades to improve carrying capacity {{and to reduce}} operational friction.

50|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{was invented}} by {{engineer}} Arvid Palmgren and was introduced on the market 1919 by SKF. The design of the bearing that Arvid Palmgren invented {{is similar to the}} design that is still in use in modern machines.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{an outer}} ring with an {{internal}} spherical shape. The rollers are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the ends. <b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, spherical rollers are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or tapered roller bearing since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and rings.|$|E
50|$|A {{spherical roller}} bearing is a rolling-element bearing that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the inner ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape {{of the outer ring}} and spherical rollers.Despite what their name may imply, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are not truly spherical in shape. The rolling elements of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are mainly cylindrical in shape, but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over-inflated.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use {{cylinders}} {{of slightly}} greater length than diameter. <b>Roller</b> <b>bearings</b> typically have higher radial load capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads. If {{the inner and}} outer races are misaligned, the bearing capacity often drops quickly compared to either a ball <b>bearing</b> or a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R

50|$|The wheel rotates {{on a pair}} of {{custom-designed}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> each weighing approximately 19400 lbs kg. Each bearing has {{an outer}} diameter of 7.55 ft, an inner bore of 5.25 ft, and a width of 2.07 ft.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{consist of}} an inner ring with two {{raceways}} inclined {{at an angle}} to the bearing axis, an outer ring with a common spherical raceway, spherical rollers, cages and, in certain designs, also internal guide rings or center rings. The bearings can also be sealed.|$|E
50|$|Spherical roller thrust {{bearings}} use asymmetrical rollers of spherical shape, rolling inside a house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape. They can accommodate combined radial and axial loads and also accommodate misalignment of the shafts. They {{are often used}} together with radial <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> Spherical roller {{thrust bearings}} offer the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings.|$|E

40|$|The CARB bearing is {{a single}} row bearing with long, {{slightly}} crowned symmetrical rollers. It combines the self-aligning capability of the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> with the unconstrained axial displacement ability of the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> The optimal combination of both raceway profiles provides a favorable load distribution in the bearing, as well as low frictional running. This paper emphasizes the functioning characteristics of the SKF CARB toroidal <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{by means of a}} multibody dynamics simulation. Different conditions like load direction, races relative position or angular misalignment, are taken into consideration...|$|R
50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|R
5000|$|Most <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{designed}} with two rows of rollers, allowing them to take very heavy radial loads and heavy axial loads. There are also designs with one row of rollers, suitable for lower radial loads and virtually no axial load. These are also called [...] "barrel roller bearings" [...] or [...] "Tonnenlager" [...] and are typically available in the 202- and 203-series.|$|E
50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller {{and ball}} bearings to the United States industrial, automotive and recreational clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement bearings, angular contact ball bearings, automotive bearings, ball and roller bearing mounted units, cylindrical roller bearings, electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature ball bearings, needle roller bearings, radial ball bearings, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> tapered roller bearings and ultra-class bearing units.|$|E
50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical roller bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> was {{introduced}} by SKF in 1939. The design of the early bearings {{is similar to the}} design that is still in use in modern machines.|$|R
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts. Common designs are Thrust ball <b>bearings,</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings,</b> tapered <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> or cylindrical <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings.</b> Also non-rolling-element bearings such as hydrostatic or magnetic bearings see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.|$|R
40|$|A {{test rig}} was {{designed}} to evaluate {{the performance of a}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> with a geared outer ring operating under conditions similar to those of a planet bearing in a helicopter transmission. The configuration is an extension of the widely accepted four-square gearbox arrangement. It provides for testing of two bearings simultaneously with outer ring rotation, misalignment, diametrically opposed loading through the gear teeth, and under race lubrication. Instrumentation permits the measurement of inner and outer ring temperature, bearing drag torque, degree of misalignment, outer ring speed, cage speed, and applied load...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{typically}} {{been used in}} applications with speeds limited to about 5000 rpm and loads limited for operation at less than about 0. 25 million DN. However, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are now being designed for high load and high speed applications including aerospace applications. A computer program, SASHBEAN, was developed to provide an analytical tool to design, analyze, and predict the performance of high speed, single row, angular contact (including zero contact angle), <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> The material presented is the mathematical formulation and analytical methods used to develop computer program SASHBEAN. For a given set of operating conditions, the program calculates the bearings ring deflections (axial and radial), roller deflections, contact areas stresses, depth and magnitude of maximum shear stresses, axial thrust, rolling element and cage rotational speeds, lubrication parameters, fatigue lives, and rates of heat generation. Centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments are fully considered. The program is also capable of performing steady-state and time-transient thermal analyses of the bearing system...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Combat" [...] {{engine was}} {{released}} in January 1972, with a twin <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> crank, 10:1 compression and developing [...] at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main <b>bearing</b> and one <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> main bearing but the Combat engine featured two <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> in a mistaken belief this would strengthen the bottom-end {{to cope with the}} higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to [...] "dig-in" [...] to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines. This problem was solved by specifying a heavier duty type of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> of 'superblend' fame, later in the 1972 production year.|$|R
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are essential}} components of rotating machinery. The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> (SRB) is one variant seeing increasing use, {{because it is}} self-aligning and can support high loads. It is becoming increasingly important {{to understand how the}} SRB responds dynamically under a variety of conditions. This doctoral dissertation introduces a computationally efficient, three-degree-of-freedom, SRB model that was developed to predict the transient dynamic behaviors of a rotor-SRB system. In the model, bearing forces and deflections were calculated as a function of contact deformation and bearing geometry parameters according to nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The results reveal how some of the more important parameters; such as diametral clearance, the number of rollers, and osculation number; influence ultimate bearing performance. Distributed defects, such as the waviness of the inner and outer ring, and localized defects, such as inner and outer ring defects, are taken into consideration in the proposed model. Simulation results were verified with results obtained by applying the formula for the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> radial deflection and the commercial bearing analysis software. Following model verification, a numerical simulation was carried out successfully for a full rotor-bearing system to demonstrate the application of this newly developed SRB model in a typical real world analysis. Accuracy of the model was verified by comparing measured to predicted behaviors for equivalent systems...|$|R

The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps which engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing. The roller-type suspension bearings required little attention other than the replenishment of the grease when the wheels were removed for tyre-turning.|$|R
