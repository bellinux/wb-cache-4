50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve,</b> mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|E

The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw coal powder conveyor in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve,</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> wearing by shield ring and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> By analyzing the wearing characters of each part, the renovation structure was designed.

40|$|Gland sealing {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of gland sealing and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump gland seal to cause wear of the sacrificial <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The wear of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.

The installation of these dry gas seals {{is one of}} the first applications to propylene refrigeration service in the United States. The new seal design eliminated seal oil contamination of the compressor and downstream heat exchangers which led to decreased efficiency, effectiveness, and subsequent loss of ethylene production. The seals also reduced the capital investment for a flare system upgrade project $ 1. 5 MM, by decreasing propylene losses during system shutdowns caused by existing seal system shortcomings. This retrofit was unique in several ways. The original compressor manufacturer had no experience with dry gas seals installed in their equipment. They were very willing to cooperate in this venture, but only to the point of providing dimensional data and engineering review. Due to the "sold-out" condition of the ethylene market, this installation had to be accomplished during a limited shutdown.

40|$|This account {{describes}} novel mushroom body {{organization in}} a coleopteran insect, the African fruit chafer Pachnoda marginata. Each of its prominent mushroom bodies possesses {{a pair of}} simple calyces comprising two populations of Kenyon cells, the dendrites of which are organized into a central and an annular zone. Kenyon cells of the central zone extend their dendrites downward and toward {{the perimeter of the}} calyx. Their axon-like processes in the pedunculus are densely packed to make up a distinctive shaft of neuropil. Toward the front of the brain, the shafts, one from each calyx, bifurcate to provide a pair of subdivisions in the medial and vertical lobes. Dendrites of Kenyon cells supplying the annular zone extend from the calyx perimeter toward its center. Axons from the annular zones of both calyces together provide a sleeve of axons that ensheaths the two <b>shafts.</b> <b>Sleeve</b> axons bifurcate to provide a second pair of divisions in each of the lobes. These arrangements provide each lobe with a discrete representation of the two Kenyon cell populations of the two calyces. Kenyon cells supplying the central zone have dendritic morphologies reminiscent of class II clawed Kenyon cells that supply the gamma lobes in other taxa. Kenyon cells supplying axons to the sleeve are suggestive of class III Kenyon cell morphologies described from cockroaches and termites. Elaborate intrinsic neurons, comparable to exotic intrinsic neurons in the honey bee gamma lobes, have processes that interact with shaft axons. The present observations suggest that mushroom bodies of Pachnoda represent either a basal organization entirely lacking class I Kenyon cells or an evolutionary modification {{in which there is no}} clear morphological distinction of class I and II Kenyon cells. In either case, cellular organization in Pachnoda's mushroom body is simple compared with that of other taxa. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Application of a novel method of depositing thin organic and inorganic layer (superficial layer) onto a metal substrate utilizing electro-spraying (electrostatic atomization) method. The new achievements {{presented in this paper}} are aimed at application of this technology to functional layer deposition in micro-bearings. Electro-spraying is a low-energy process of liquid atomisation by means of electrical forces. Electro-spraying device consists of a capillary nozzle connected to a high electric potential whereas the substrate is grounded. The liquid flowing out the nozzle is subjected to an electrical stress, and fine droplets are generated from the meniscus or the jet formed at the nozzle outlet. Depending on physical properties of the liquid to be sprayed and spraying conditions, the size of the droplets can be in the submicron size range. In the electro-spraying process, a solution or a suspension of a material to be deposited is atomised into droplets, which can be targeted onto a substrate to form a condensed product, for example a thin layer after solvent evaporation. The deposition efficiency of charged droplets on a target is much higher than for uncharged ones due to electric forces, which drive the droplets along the electric filed lines towards the substrate...|$|R
