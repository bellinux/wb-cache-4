40|$|The {{support scheme}} for farming in less-favoured areas, {{established}} by the European Union in 1975, marked {{a major change in}} the nature of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by introducing for the first time regional categories. It also represented the initiation of direct annual payments to farmers, an approach which was to expand greatly in the 1990 s and thereafter. Over a long period it had remained the only significant structural measure of agricultural policy with a territorial dimension. Only recent policy reforms changed this situation: commodity market support was gradually decreased and, on the other hand, the environmental implications of policy measures were increasingly emphasised. Discussions on the interrelations of the Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) scheme with Agri-Environmental Measures (AEM) and other elements of the Rural Development Programmes (RDP) have been intensified as the political and financial weight of the programmes gained in importance. This paper focuses on the objectives and relevance of the LFA support scheme, its application in the EU and the main elements of the debate for the redefinition of LFA support. From the very beginning, LFA policy was conceived as a structural policy aimed at the prevention of land abandonment, to preserve the farming population in these areas and maintain cultural landscapes. In this regard, the instrument was one of the first measures to address environmentally beneficial farming systems, and thus reveals high coincidence with High Nature Value (HNV) farming systems. The three types of LFA, mountain areas, other LFAs and areas affected by specific handicaps take account of the range of geographical differences in the production difficulties of EU agriculture. The increased focus on environmental aims resulted in a discussion of the ‘intermediate’ areas, the category of other LFAs. It has been proposed that the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>criterion</b> in determining these areas should be dropped, but the aim to maintain land management in marginal areas would be kept. Meanwhile, the decision on the redefinition of the LFAs has been postponed (to 2010). Nevertheless the issue will keep a central role in policy discussions of the future Rural Development Programmes. ...|$|R

40|$|Site {{selection}} for waste disposal {{is a complex}} task that should {{meet the requirements of}} communities and stakeholders. In this article, three decision support methods (Boolean logic, index overlay and fuzzy gamma) are used to perform land suitability analysis for landfill siting. The study was carried out in one of the biggest metropolitan regions of Italy, with the objective of locating suitable areas for waste disposal. Physical and <b>socio-economic</b> information <b>criteria</b> for site selection were decided by a multidisciplinary group of experts, according to state-of-the-art guidelines, national legislation and local normative on waste management. The geographic information systems (GIS) based models used in this study are easy to apply but require adequate selection of criteria and weights and a careful evaluation of the results. The methodology is arranged in three steps, reflecting the criteria defined by national legislation on waste management: definition of factors that exclude location of landfills or waste treatment plants; classification of the remaining areas in terms of suitability for landfilling; and evaluation of suitable sites in relation to preferential siting factors (such as the presence of quarries or dismissed plants). The results showed that more than 80 % of the provincial territory falls within constraint areas and the remaining territory is suitable for waste disposal for 0. 72 % or 1. 93 %, according to the model. The larger and most suitable sites are located in peripheral areas of the metropolitan system.

National gap analyses are an important step in describing and addressing this problem, so we sought to determine the representativeness of English PAs devoted to biodiversity conservation by using Natural Areas (NAs), elevation and PA boundary data. We found that National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs) cover only 6. 3 % of England and are generally small, with respective median areas of 1. 1 and 0. 2 km(2). The English PA system under-represents lowland areas and provides a median level of 2. 5 % protection for the NA types, with seventy nine per cent of NA types having less than 10 % protection. Therefore, we suggest that England's PA system needs to be expanded, although this would probably entail modification of existing legislation to increase involvement by landowners. We also compare our results with previous appraisals that used species distribution record data and suggest that landscape-level analyses may give a more accurate and less positive assessment.

The paper argues that a study of individuals as members of coalitions will help to overcome this limitation. While there are a large number of possible coalitions that can be formed on the basis of alternative <b>socio-economic</b> and cultural <b>criteria,</b> the resource community will ultimately be formed through the formation of a coalition that is stable against defection by any member. This coalition (corresponding to the core) maximizes net per capita benefits to its members. The arguments are supported by a field study of a water body in Bankura, India. Survey results show how the formation of caste-based coalitions within a pluralistic community had led to the exclusion of some villagers from resource benefits.
