25|$|At 1:57p.m. EST, while Ryan was speaking, NBC began {{broadcasting}} {{the report}} as their camera was ready and working. Three minutes later, at 2:00 EST, CBS' camera was finally ready and Cronkite {{appeared on the}} air after a brief <b>station</b> <b>break,</b> with ABC beginning its coverage at the same time. Radio coverage was reported by Don Gardiner (ABC), Alan Jackson (CBS), and (after a top-of-the-hour newscast) by Peter Hackes and Edwin Newman (NBC).|$|E
25|$|By summer 1975, CBS began {{considering}} expansions {{of two of}} the Procter & Gamble-owned {{soap operas}} Search for Tomorrow and As the World Turns) to forty-five minutes daily, in response to NBC's expansion of full-hour expansions of Another World and Days of Our Lives some months earlier. The network changed its mind, however, when it realized that to do so would force them to take the thirty minute <b>station</b> <b>break</b> slot at 1:00 p.m. Eastern that affiliates used to air other programming. CBS then decided to simply expand As the World Turns, which was still the top rated soap opera on television, to sixty minutes. Since CBS decided against taking the 1:00 p.m. slot from the affiliates, and the network did not intend to move As the World Turns from its 1:30 p.m. slot, this made the low-rated Edge of Night expendable and CBS told Procter & Gamble it would not be renewing the series.|$|E
25|$|The cast had {{continued}} to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break {{would be the last}} anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy {{had been shot in the}} head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with the top of the hour <b>station</b> <b>break</b> looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.|$|E

50|$|Radio {{coverage}} {{is provided by}} CBS Radio-owned WINS (1010 AM) in New York City. It {{is one of the}} few times throughout the year in which that <b>station</b> <b>breaks</b> away from its all-news radio format.|$|R
500|$|On {{realizing that}} NBC was {{switching}} {{away from the}} game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, [...] "Where the hell has our football game gone?" [...] During the <b>station</b> <b>break</b> which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it." [...] Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.|$|E
2500|$|The Global {{network has}} long been much more {{decentralized}} than either CBC or CTV. For most programs, there is no [...] "network" [...] feed per se, and in effect every commercial break is a <b>station</b> <b>break.</b> National advertising is certainly available, but such ads are seamlessly integrated into local ad blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Somers apologised to Connick on air {{after a brief}} <b>station</b> <b>break.</b> He {{said that}} nobody had {{intended}} to deliberately offend the viewers, the guests, or the audience, and he described the sketch as a [...] "bit retro". The incident drew some negative response within Australia, but drew heavy negative reaction from commentators around the world, including in the US and the UK, and very prominently highlighted {{significant differences between the}} cultural acceptability of blackface in Australian culture compared with American culture.|$|E
50|$|Under Severinsen's direction, The Tonight Show NBC Orchestra {{became a}} {{well-known}} big band in America. The band played incidental music for sketch comedy, guest introductions, and intermission music during <b>station</b> <b>breaks.</b> Severinsen covered many swing music and jazz standards, including classics by Cole Porter, Dizzy Gillespie, and others.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Clark {{began his}} career working in the {{mailroom}} at WRUN, an AM radio station in Rome, New York, that was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. Almost immediately, {{he was asked to}} fill in for the vacationing weatherman, and within a few months he was announcing <b>station</b> <b>breaks.</b>|$|R

Devices for manual fire alarm activation are installed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated. They are usually actuated by means of physical interaction, such as pulling a lever or breaking glass.|$|R
2500|$|... 1985 saw {{the end of}} the {{synthesizer}} era at NBC as composer John Williams wrote {{a series}} of themes for all NBC News programs, with a cut entitled [...] "The Mission", serving as the principal theme for NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw. Williams also composed two themes for Today: an opening fanfare for the program that was derived from the opening of [...] "The Mission"; and a two-minute closing theme for the show entitled [...] "Scherzo for Today", a dramatic arrangement that made heavy use of strings and flutes. In the late 1980s, [...] "Scherzo" [...] was played in its entirety multiple times daily during the weather scrolls that ran during local commercial breaks; however, most NBC affiliates preempted these segments with locally slotted advertising. The new Today themes – used in tandem with the show's new opening sequence featuring the Statue of Liberty and a new living room studio set – gave the program a distinctly modern look and sound beginning in September 1985. A series of Williams-penned bumpers featuring the [...] "Mission" [...] signature were also used to open and close segments. [...] "Scherzo for Today" [...] was used as the program's closing theme until 1990, and the [...] "Mission" [...] bumpers were used until 1993 (one of them could be heard as a <b>station</b> <b>break</b> lead-in on NBC's Meet The Press until 2004).|$|E

This is depicted by the KROD banners in the movie Glory Road.|$|R
5000|$|Nebel's {{approach}} was unique: talk radio per se {{did not yet}} exist as it would in later decades, and Nebel was navigating largely uncharted territory. Sometimes, Nebel entered the discussions, other times he {{described himself as a}} [...] "moderator" [...] and allowed his guests to have spirited debates, commenting only occasionally to guide the debate, or to announce <b>station</b> <b>breaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ray Forrest - Wearing {{a tuxedo}} to intone the formal sign-on when NBC {{went on the}} air each evening, Forrest {{announced}} every <b>station</b> <b>break</b> and every program. He covered wrestling, boxing, hockey, horse racing and movie premieres.|$|E

50|$|Diesendorf {{goes on to}} {{say that}} every {{conventional}} power <b>station</b> <b>breaks</b> down unexpectedly from time to time, causing an immediate loss of all its power. That is true intermittency, according to Diesendorf, and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power. Once a conventional power station has broken down, it may be offline for weeks, much longer than windless periods.|$|R

50|$|Following another thirty-second music break, Day to Day entered Segment D (duration 8:59). There {{was little}} {{specificity}} {{to the content}} of Segment D; stories ranged from international and domestic issues to long-term reports on a variety of topics. Segment D ran from forty minutes to forty-nine minutes past the hour, and another two-minute <b>station</b> <b>break</b> ensued.|$|E
50|$|Segment A (duration 12:29) {{contained}} {{the top story}} of the day, and usually synopses of longer-term issues viewed {{through the lens of}} current events. Segment topics ranged from the American judicial system to economics to geopolitics to conversations with notable newsmakers, and more. Segment A closed at nineteen minutes past the hour and leads into a two-minute <b>station</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E

Joe Slattery handled <b>station</b> <b>breaks</b> and some commercials, often appearing during Jubilee USA with Massey Ferguson farm tractors and accessories in film clips or on stage.|$|R
50|$|As {{a method}} of in-band signaling, DTMF tones were also used by cable {{television}} broadcasters to indicate the start and stop times of local insertion points during <b>station</b> <b>breaks</b> {{for the benefit of}} cable companies. Until better, out-of-band signaling equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged, and loud DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere.|$|R

Ryan dispatches all police to climb up in the scaffolding to catch Jimmy, but they cannot reach him because Jimmy greased all the bridge's lower girders.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast {{automation}} {{relies on}} computers to store and retrieve video, largely eliminating {{the use of}} individual videotapes and allowing switching and retrieval of stored programming, advertising and titles to take place automatically. The server would operate from stored playlists, in which each programme, each commercial advertisement, each live or network feed and each <b>station</b> <b>break</b> had been configured in advance.|$|E
5000|$|The first, or [...] "A" [...] segment, {{begins at}} :06:30 after the hour. It {{features}} important news stories, although {{not necessarily the}} most important news stories of the day.

Segment A runs 11:29 in duration, and closes out at :18 after with a two-minute <b>station</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
50|$|The show {{originally}} only remodeled residential houses, but in {{the third}} season, expanded to public buildings such as a teachers' lounge of a school, a fire station kitchen, and a police <b>station</b> <b>break</b> room.
