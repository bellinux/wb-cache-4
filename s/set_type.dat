5|$|Marquis was the {{youngest}} of four children. His mother died before he was one year old. Although his father remarried soon after, Marquis was cared for by his maternal grandmother until he was four. He then joined his father and stepmother at their home in Roscoe, Missouri. Adonijah bought a half-share in the newspaper Osceola so that his son, Birney, Marquis' elder brother, could learn the printing trade. When he was old enough, Marquis did the same and could <b>set</b> <b>type</b> {{by the time he was}} thirteen. After leaving school in 1885, Marquis was sent, along with his sister Mollie, to the Weaubleau Christian Institute in Weaubleau, Missouri. He graduated in 1887.|$|E

The two styles of yogurt {{commonly found in}} the grocery store are <b>set</b> <b>type</b> yogurt and Swiss style yogurt. <b>Set</b> <b>type</b> yogurt is when the yogurt is packaged with the fruit {{on the bottom of the}} cup and the yogurt on top. Swiss style yogurt is when the fruit is blended into the yogurt prior to packaging.|$|E

50|$|<b>Setting</b> <b>type</b> joint {{compounds}} come in {{powder form}} and are mixed with water immediately before use. This type contains plaster of paris and sets through a chemical hardening process rather than evaporation which gives it an advantage in filling holes and gaps which would take many days to dry out and have shrinkage cracks using the drying compound. <b>Setting</b> <b>type</b> compounds are available in different setting times from 5 to 210 minutes and types which bond extremely well and are very hard and types which are soft and easy to sand. Once mixed with water the <b>setting</b> <b>type</b> must be used before it sets, any left over is wasted and if not enough is mixed another batch is needed to finish making, and all tools must be very clean or the compound may set up prematurely. This makes the <b>setting</b> <b>type</b> harder and more time consuming to prepare but they <b>set</b> quickly. <b>Setting</b> <b>type</b> compounds can be used down to 45 F. Some drywall professionals use <b>setting</b> <b>type</b> mud for the first coat and a drying type for the finish coat. <b>Setting</b> <b>type</b> compounds do not soften when they get wet thus are better for moist environments such as bathrooms.|$|R

Landing in Boston on September 19, 1845, Folds sought to make his living in America as an actor.|$|E

Overall, it appears that child care providers had developmentally sensitive guidelines for fostering computer use in both child care settings...|$|R
500|$|The {{new century}} saw the Echo falling {{behind the times}} in its {{production}} methods. Established as a [...] "leading daily newspaper", {{it was one of}} the last to still be setting type by hand in 1900. This changed in 1902, when Linotype lead-setting machines were brought in to <b>set</b> <b>type</b> mechanically. A landslide victory for the Liberal Party followed at the 1906 General Election, which heralded a new era for the Echo. The paper's old rival, the Sunderland Daily Post, was discontinued six months later, and the Football Echo was launched on 7 September 1907.|$|E

In March 1862, Joseph Addison Turner, owner of Turnwold Plantation nine {{miles east of}} Eatonton, hired the 16-year-old {{to work as a}} printer's devil for his {{newspaper}} The Countryman. Harris worked for clothing, room, and board. The newspaper reached subscribers throughout the Confederacy during the American Civil War; it was considered one of the larger newspapers in the South, with a circulation of about 2,000. [...] Harris learned to <b>set</b> <b>type</b> for the paper, and Turner allowed him to publish his own poems, book reviews, and humorous paragraphs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{linotype}} machine ( [...] ) is a [...] "line casting" [...] machine used in printing {{sold by the}} Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype {{became one of the}} mainstay methods to <b>set</b> <b>type,</b> especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19thcentury to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting, offset lithography printing and computer typesetting. The name of the machine {{comes from the fact that}} it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e.,manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and drawers of letters.|$|E
40|$|In this note, in an {{independent}} private values auction framework, I discuss {{the relationship between the}} <b>set</b> of <b>types</b> and the distribution of types. I show that any <b>set</b> of <b>types,</b> finite dimensional or not, can be extended to a larger <b>set</b> of <b>types</b> preserving incentive compatibility constraints, expected revenue and bidder’s expected utilities. Thus for example we may convexify a <b>set</b> of <b>types</b> making our model amenable to the large body of theory in economics and mathematics that relies on convexity assumptions. An interesting application of this extension procedure is to show that although revenue equivalence is not valid in general if the <b>set</b> of <b>types</b> is not convex these mechanism have underlying distinct allocation mechanism in the extension. Thus we recover in these situations the revenue equivalence...|$|R

These transforms convert constructible -valued functions to continuous -valued functions over a vector space. Core contributions include: {{the definition of}} the topological Bessel transform; a relationship in terms of the logarithmic blowup of the topological Fourier transform; and a novel Morse index formula for the transforms. We then apply the theory to problems of target reconstruction from enumerative sensor data, including localization and shape discrimination. This last application utilizes an extension of spatially variant apodization (SVA) to mitigate sidelobe phenomena...|$|R
2500|$|To {{keep the}} {{matrices}} circulating smoothly throughout the machine, {{it is necessary}} that oil not be allowed anywhere near the matrix path. If oil is found in the matrix's path (due to careless maintenance or over-lubrication of nearby parts), it combines with dust, forming a gummy substance that is eventually deposited in the magazine by the matrices. The most common result is that the matrix will not be released from the magazine at its usual speed, and almost always results in a letter or two arriving out of sequence in the assembler — a [...] "matrix transposition". When these machines were in heavy use, it was not uncommon for an operator to <b>set</b> <b>type</b> at the rate of over 4,000ems per hour, with the fastest operators being able to exceed 10,000ems per hour (approximately 10 to 30 Words Per Minute in today's units) so careful lubrication and regular cleaning were essential to keep these machines operating at their full potential.|$|E

Additionally, we give an example to illustrate the application of DHFSs in group forecasting...|$|R

In everyday life, all <b>setting</b> <b>types</b> have alternatives and each individual make preferences within those alternatives.

The second category is leisure settings and involves all the settings that people use for leisure activities.

He learned to <b>set</b> <b>type</b> readily and neatly, his wonderful skill in manipulation aiding him in the mere mechanical act, and his ignorance of the language confining him simply to the mechanical effort, confirming the printer's axiom, that the printer who considers or follows the ideas of his copy makes a poor compositor. He would set up deliberately long diatribes against himself, composed by his fellow-printers, and hung on his hook as copy, and even such short sentences as [...] "Wan Lee is the devil's own imp," [...] "Wan Lee is a Mongolian rascal," [...] and bring the proof to me with happiness beaming from every tooth, and satisfaction shining in his huckleberry eyes.|$|E
