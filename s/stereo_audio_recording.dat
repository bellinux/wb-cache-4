50|$|Balance {{can mean}} the amount of signal from each channel {{reproduced}} in a <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recording.</b> Typically, a balance control in its center position will have 0 dB of gain for both channels and will attenuate one channel as the control is turned, leaving the other channel at 0 dB.|$|E
50|$|Crossfeed is {{the process}} of {{blending}} the left and right channels of a <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recording.</b> It is generally used to reduce the extreme channel separation often featured in early stereo recordings (e.g., where instruments are panned entirely on one side or the other), or to make audio played through headphones sound more natural, as when listening to a pair of external speakers.|$|E

5000|$|The camera {{enters the}} market with its own tier entry into the range, boasting {{features}} such as a 24.3Mpx APS-C HD CMOS sensor using a single-lens translucent mirror and features full HD 1080p recording capabilities using H.264 compression. It hosts a variable burst-shooting mode up to 10fps, <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> capabilities and like others in the Sony Alpha range it has high sensitivity with ISO 100 to 16000, several noise reduction features, 8 white balance presets including custom balance and exposure control systems. The battery capacity is rated for 510 shots using the electronic viewfinder or 560 shots using the LCD. The capture format for images in RAW format uses the [...]ARW extension, Sony's extension for RAWs.|$|E
50|$|More {{expensive}} decks offered <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> and playback. Linear stereo, {{as it was}} called, fit {{two independent}} channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal's SNR {{to the point that}} audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied Dolby B noise reduction for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape's background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs.|$|E
50|$|VHS and Betamax home {{videocassette}} recorders ("VCR"s) initially only {{recorded the}} audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head, which was inadequate for recording NICAM audio; this significantly limited their sound quality. Many VCRs later included high quality <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> {{as an additional}} feature, in which the incoming high quality stereo audio source (typically FM radio or NICAM TV) was frequency modulated and then recorded {{in addition to the}} usual audio and video VCR tracks, using the same high-bandwidth helical scanning technique used for the video signal. Full size VCRs already made full use of the tape, so the high quality audio signal was recorded diagonally under the video signal, using additional helical scan heads and depth multiplexing. The mono audio track (and on some machines, a non-NICAM, non-Hi-Fi stereo track) was also recorded on the linear track, as before, to ensure backwards-compatibility of recordings made on Hi-Fi machines when played on non-Hi-Fi VCRs.|$|E
5000|$|The 840AV and its relative, the Centris/Quadra 660AV, {{marked a}} number of firsts for the Macintosh family. They were the first Macintoshes to include {{on-board}} 16-bit 48 kHz <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> playback and <b>recording</b> capability, as well as S-Video and composite video input and output. To improve video playback, two separate frame buffers were used: one for standard graphics, and one specifically for video. This enabled the live video input to be displayed as a scalable [...] "window" [...] within the Macintosh user interface. They were also the first personal computers that supported speech recognition (PlainTalk) out-of-the-box. The Apple GeoPort Telecom Adapter Kit introduced with the AV Macs added many DSP-based telecommunication functions, such as modem, fax, and telephony.|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{grouping of}} the <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values in scale factor bands, before coding via an intensity-stereo method, {{so that one}} channel carries the intensity-stereo coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values and the other channel carries <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values equal to zero. The intensity-stereo coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> coded values are decoded for each scale factor band and a prediction method is used to provide the coded <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> spectral values for the other channel. ADVANTAGE - Reduced bit rate for increased data transmission rate without impaired quality...|$|R
50|$|Both S-VHS and Hi8 {{retain the}} <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> systems of their base formats; VHS HiFi Stereo outperforms Video8/Hi8 AFM, but remains {{restricted}} to high-end machines. In the late 1980s, digital (PCM) audio was introduced into some higher-grade models of Hi8 (but never S-VHS) recorders. Hi8 PCM audio operates at a sampling rate of 32 kHz with 8-bit samples—higher fidelity than the monaural linear dubbing offered by VHS/S-VHS, but vastly inferior to VHS HiFi. PCM-capable Hi8 recorders can simultaneously record PCM stereo {{in addition to}} the legacy (analog AFM) <b>stereo</b> <b>audio</b> tracks.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1980s, most {{recording}} studios used analog multitrack recorders, typically {{based on}} reel-to-reel tape. The first commercial recording system was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50 kHz digital recording {{option for the}} New England Digital Synclavier II in 1982. The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large professional <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as film post-production. <b>Stereo</b> <b>audio</b> was not immediately available due to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time.|$|R

40|$|Vocalizations {{serving a}} variety of social {{functions}} have been reported in many bat species (Order Chiroptera). While echolocation by big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) {{has been the subject of}} extensive study, calls used by this species for communication have received comparatively little research attention. Here, we report on a rich repertoire of vocalizations produced by big brown bats in a large flight room equipped with synchronized high speed <b>stereo</b> video and <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> equipment. Bats were studied individually and in pairs, while sex, age, and experience with a novel foraging task were varied. We used discriminant function analysis (DFA) to classify six different vocalizations that were recorded when two bats were present. Contingency table analyses revealed a higher prevalence of social calls when males were present, and some call types varied in frequency of emission based on trial type or bat age. Bats flew closer together around the time some social calls were emitted, indicating that communicative calls may be selectively produced when conspecifics fly near one another. These findings are the first reports of social calls from flying big brown bats and provide insight into the function of communicative vocalizations emitted by this species...|$|R
