During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's semen to make herself pregnant. Mac then {{comes out of his}} coma, but is suffering from memory loss and cannot remember his new-found love for Caroline.

5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
25|$|Several wine faults {{can occur}} in {{sparkling}} wine production. Some that were present in early production methods include yeux de crapauds (toad's eyes) which was a condition of big, viscous bubbles that resulted from the wine <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> in wooden casks. Another fault could occur when the wine is exposed to bacteria or direct sunlight, leaving the wine with murky colouring and an oily texture.|$|E

According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E

After living at various addresses in London, the Crippens finally moved in 1905 to 39 Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Road, Holloway, London, where they took in lodgers to augment Crippen's meagre income. Cora cuckolded Crippen {{with one of these}} lodgers, and in turn Crippen took Le Neve as his mistress in 1908.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test against South Africa in Perth, {{starting}} in December, Ponting again had {{to reduce his}} reliance on his preferred pace bowlers, and rely more on spinners due to a slow over rate. His persistent problems with the over rate prompted some commentators to criticise him for <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> during the match conferring with bowlers. In the first innings he scored a duck, and managed 32 in Australia's second innings. Ponting's inexperienced attack had trouble dismissing the opposition batsmen, and South Africa made 4/414, the second highest successful runchase in history to win by six wickets on the final day.|$|E

500|$|With around 1600 {{pages in}} {{manuscript}} length, A Dance with Dragons was eventually published in July 2011 {{after six years}} of writing, longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels. The story of A Dance with Dragons catches up and goes beyond A Feast for Crows around two-thirds into the book, but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers. Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling [...] "the Meereenese knot", which the interviewer understood as [...] "making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [...] ". Martin also acknowledged <b>spending</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.|$|E
