5|$|The River Rother {{rises from}} several springs near Empshott in Hampshire. The main one {{supplies}} watercress beds, before passing under Mill Lane, {{to the south}} of the village. It continues eastwards, to reach Greatham Mill. The mill, together with the mill house and an attached barn, date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and are built of brick. Now Grade II listed. All of the original machinery of the mill is still in situ, but is not operational, as the water supply has been diverted. The stream turns to the south-east, and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass, and Greatham Bridge, on the old route. It is joined by other streams, and turns south to reach Liss railway station. The railway and the river follow the same general route, and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet. At the northern edge of the village, the river is joined by the Ashford Stream, and there is another mill. After passing under the A272 road, to the east of the village, it reaches <b>Sheet</b> <b>Mill.</b>|$|E

After eighteen months, he became the assistant of the <b>sheet</b> <b>mill</b> superintendent, Charlie Hook. During this time and afterwards, Tytus continued to research and think about improving steel rolling. In 1906 he was promoted to superintendent of the new mill in Zanesville, Ohio.

The steel works consisted of three 225-tonne tilting open hearth furnaces, soaking pits, a 40” blooming mill of one million tonne capacity, a 34” heavy structural mill and a 18” light structural mill. A <b>sheet</b> <b>mill</b> was added in 1940. The first heat of steel was tapped on 10 November 1939 and rolled subsequently. A duplex plant initially with two Bessemer converters (and subsequently another) was added. The first blow of the Bessemer converter was made on 6 February 1946.

40|$|The {{development}} of a possible slip line field (slf) for theoretical calculations of the deforming pressure (load) in a second pass of a lubricated cold rolling <b>sheet</b> <b>mill</b> and validation using values from an aluminium sheet rolling mill was done in this work. This will be relevant in the manufacturing industries providing an easy method for determining necessary applied rolling load. Experimental rolling was carried out to observe the shear lines in the deformation field. Construction of possible slip line field model was developed adhering strictly to assumptions of rigid plastic model. Calculation of the deforming force/load was achieved using Hencky’s equation. Results showed that the load calculations for constructed slip line field using aluminium sheet rolling as an example tallied with values obtained from Tower Aluminium rolling mill. Slip line fields constructed for the second pass described adequately the rolling pressure in the cold rolling process, giving a valid solution of the exact load estimates on comparison with the industrial load values. Roll pressure along the arc of contact rose fairly linearly from {{the entrance to a}} maximum at the exit point. This work showed that slf for the first pass in a cold rolling mill cannot be used for subsequent passes; it requires construction of slfs for each pass in the cold rolling process...|$|E
