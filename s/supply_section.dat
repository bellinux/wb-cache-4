During {{this time he}} published two articles in the United States Naval Institute magazine Proceedings. The first, on the [...] "Probability and Accuracy of Gun Fire", was a technical article arguing for more rather than bigger guns on battleships and cruisers. The Washington Naval Conference would prevent these ideas from being put into practice, by restricting the number and size of warships and their guns. The second, entitled [...] "Naval Corps, Specialization and Efficiency", argued for increasing the specializations of line officers rather than creating separate corps of specialists, a more controversial topic {{at a time when}} naval aviators were agitating {{for the creation of a}} new specialist branch of their own.|$|E

[...] Similar to a standard infantry division, an [...] "A.S.42" [...] type division still had two infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, a mixed engineer battalion, a medical section, and a <b>supply</b> <b>section.</b> [...] But the infantry regiments could vary greatly because the basic units making up the regiment were now an expandable company. [...] The artillery regiment sometimes included a battery of German 88mm guns.

CrvDtosDoridium shares some of the same characteristics a Giardia, but inactivation and removal appear to be much more difficult to achieve for CrvDtosaoridium...|$|R
