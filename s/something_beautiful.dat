5|$|May is 13, but {{she knows}} nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for <b>something</b> <b>beautiful.</b>|$|E

500|$|Gojira were {{acquired}} by Roadrunner Records and released L'Enfant Sauvage on 26 June 2012 on that label. The title translates to [...] "The Wild Child". Joe Duplantier explained that titling the album in English inadequately encapsulated {{the meaning of}} the French term: [...] "'Sauvage' is something that is not educated or something that is like free and completely free in nature. A wild flower that goes wherever she wants and becomes <b>something</b> <b>beautiful.</b> The idea with [...] "L'Enfant Sauvage" [...] is like with a human that would grow up in nature, raised by wolves, for example, without the influence from others and the influence from institutions or society in general." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Hakim {{starred in}} another Karya-directed film, Kawin Lari (Elope). The experience {{gave her a}} greater understanding of acting, causing her to [...] "see life from a different perspective in studying [...] character."

[...] The next year, she starred in Badai Pasti Berlalu, appearing on the poster and the cover of the soundtrack album.|$|E

500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed <b>something</b> <b>beautiful</b> in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E

Speaking {{of his relationship with}} Amira, Lapinskas told Digital Spy, [...] "From the very first time Anthony saw Amira at the pub, he said she was a goddess. Since then, he's been helping her out a bit, and she's warming to him. You never know what could happen– watch this space. It could turn into <b>something</b> <b>beautiful!</b> He added, [...] "I think at first she might have wanted to use him to make Syed (Marc Elliot) jealous, but over a period of time, she might start warming to him. He is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming, so she could fall for him".|$|E
500|$|The cast {{included}} some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing. [...] However, Moore said that this was acceptable, as [...] "We don't shame the body, we encourage the body as <b>something</b> <b>beautiful</b> and natural, and my children bathe with me, and I walk around naked." ...|$|E

500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating <b>something</b> <b>beautiful.</b> But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E
500|$|... "Original Song" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reception from critics upon its initial airing. James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode and wrote that [...] "it did well {{by a couple of}} ongoing relationship stories." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times opined that it delivered several [...] "long-anticipated moments [...] and several more we only wish we'd thought to anticipate." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald deemed it a [...] "great" [...] episode, [...] "filled with many great moments." [...] Robert Canning of IGN rated it 8/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised the development of [...] "Original Song", and wrote: [...] "One great thing about the episode was that after last week's plot-bomb-filled episode, the show didn't completely abandon what we'd learned that week." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded it [...] "B−"; he noted that he enjoyed the scenes, but criticized the show for its inconsistency. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised the episode for [...] "not only [...] retreating into the series’s standard, flailing, everybody-in-the-pool narrative template, or filling this metaphorical slough with more leaden tropes than Richard Serra circa 1968, but by having the results be precisely the inevitabilities we all knew would occur." [...] Akash Nikolas at Zap2It praised the new song and its performance {{as a metaphor for the}} show: [...] "New Directions flashed Glee’s trademark “L” sign, which the show has renamed as something cool. And instead of cups full of slush that's usually thrown at the Glee Club, the cups were filled with red confetti and thrown at the audience. This neat moment captured the show’s conceit: taking something ugly and oppressive and turning it into <b>something</b> <b>beautiful</b> and celebratory." ...|$|E
