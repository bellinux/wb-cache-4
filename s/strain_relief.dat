5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E
25|$|One {{apparent}} {{disadvantage of}} twist-lock connectors {{is that in}} the event that the cable is accidentally pulled too hard, rather than the plug falling out of the receptacle, exposed conductors may come out of the plug, causing dangerous shorts or shock hazards if the circuit is live. This is resolved in most cases by the connector having a robust integral <b>strain</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E

25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

2500|$|Plaster of Paris {{bandages}} {{were introduced}} in different forms by 2 army surgeons, one at a peacetime home station and another on active service at the front. [...] Antonius Mathijsen (1805–1878) was born in Budel, the Netherlands, where his father was the village doctor. He was educated in Brussels, Maastricht and Utrecht obtaining the degree of doctor of medicine at Gissen in 1837. He spent his entire career as a medical officer in the Dutch Army. [...] While he was stationed at Haarlem in 1851, he developed a method of applying plaster of Paris bandages. A brief note describing his method was published on January 30, 1852; it was followed shortly by more complete accounts. In these accounts Mathijsen emphasised that only simple materials were required and the bandage could be quickly applied without assistance. The bandages hardened rapidly, provided an exact fit and could be windowed or bivalved (cut to provide <b>strain</b> <b>relief)</b> easily. Mathijsen used coarsely woven materials, usually linen, into which dry plaster of Paris had been rubbed thoroughly. The bandages were then moistened with a wet sponge or brush as they were applied and rubbed by hand until they hardened.|$|E

40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} (TiAl) is {{a lightweight}} intermetallic compound {{with a range}} of exceptional mid-to-high temperature mechanical properties. These characteristics have the potential to deliver significant weight savings in aero engine components. However, the relatively low ductility of TiAl requires improved understanding of the relationship between manufacturing processes and residual stresses in order to expand the use of such components in service. Previous studies have suggested that stress determination at high spatial resolution is necessary to achieve better insight. The present paper reports progress beyond the current state-of-the-art towards the identification of the near-surface intragranular residual stress state in cast and ground TiAl at a resolution better than 5 μm. The semi-destructive ring-core drilling method using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used for in-plane residual stress estimation in ten grains at the sample surface. The nature of the locally observed <b>strain</b> <b>reliefs</b> suggests that tensile residual stresses may have been induced in some grains by the unidirectional grinding process applied to the surface. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R

5000|$|The {{process was}} {{initially}} invented by Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, Germany [...] in Europe in the 1970s where experiments with hot-melts {{were used to}} seal connectors and create <b>strain</b> <b>reliefs</b> for wires. The first commercial use of the Low Pressure Molding process was in the automotive industry. The driving force was to replace toxic and cumbersome potting processes, faster cycle times, lighter parts and environmentally safe components. Since then Low Pressure Molding has spread out to other areas such as industrial products, medical, consumer products, military, wire harness and any unique product {{that needs to be}} sealed and protected against the environment. Basically, where {{there is a need to}} seal and protect an electronic device there may be an opportunity to use Low Pressure molding as the solution. Automotive sensors in-cabin and even under hood, USB thumb drives, RF ID tags, moisture sensors, motor control boards, consumer products. In essence the process acts as a middle ground between plastic injection molding which subjects components to high pressure and temperatures that can often damage them and potting with resin a process that involves waste and lengthy curing times.|$|R
