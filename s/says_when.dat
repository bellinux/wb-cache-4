500|$|According to this theory—one of many—for {{as long as}} Prospero {{is battling}} with these qualities and lost in books, he is banished from Milan. As the play finds its conclusion, he is both able to accept his base, brutal nature ("this thing of {{darkness}} I acknowledge mine" [...] he <b>says</b> <b>when</b> taking responsibility for Caliban) while letting go of his connection with higher, powerful forces ("then to the elements be free, and fare thou well" [...] he says, setting Ariel free). Abandoning magic and acknowledging the brutal potential of his nature, he is {{allowed to return to}} his rightful place as Duke, subject to agreement from the audience: [...] "as you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me free." ...|$|E
500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin <b>says</b> <b>when</b> he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing really {{made sense to me}} until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E
500|$|Stewie and Bertram, Stewie says [...] "On my signal, unleash hell." [...] This is a {{reference}} to the opening scene of Gladiator. An Ice Age reference is made when Scrat, a character from the films, attempts to steal Peter's nuts. When Stewie invades Bertram's camp {{at the end of the}} episode Bertram quotes , repeating the line Darth Vader <b>says</b> <b>when</b> he senses Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star. [...] When Peter names his kids, Peter mentions the kids from various shows that are currently airing at Nick at Nite. [...] When Brian mentions this, Peter begins naming Street Fighter characters. [...] Brian again points out this fact, after which Peter names various colors. [...] Sauron, the villain from The Lord of the Rings is shown as the Eye of Sauron in a scene where he is trying to find his lost contact lens. [...] A cutaway scene features Peter in a jail surrounded by inmates who force him to strip, squeeze his boobs together, and sing the chorus from Kelis's 2003 hit “Milkshake.” This is possibly an homage to the scene after the credits in the movie [...] in which Ben Stiller does the same thing in his fatsuit.|$|E

500|$|Before Pepper, it was {{impossible}} to use Parliamentary discussions as evidence in court cases; William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that to allow judicial review of [...] "unreasonable" [...] legislation was to [...] "set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Historically, the courts had been more lenient; while this suggestion first appears in the 14th century, with the intention that legislation was best interpreted by those who had written it, the principle was not strongly followed. In the 1678 case of Ash v Abdy, Lord Nottingham chose to refer to the parliamentary history of the Statute of Frauds, and in Millar v Taylor, in 1769, the first case to explicitly state this principle (as [...] "The sense and meaning of an Act of Parliament must be collected from what it <b>says</b> <b>when</b> passed into law, and not from the history of changes it underwent in the House where it took its rise"), the court chose to depart from it. The principle was most used during the 19th and 20th centuries, with a noted example being Beswick v Beswick, where Lord Reid maintained that it would be inconvenient and expensive for lawyers to have to refer to Hansard when preparing cases. Both the English and Scottish Law Commissions agreed with the rule in their 1969 Report on the Interpretation of Statutes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance <b>says</b> <b>when</b> asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

These knights were made on 22 August, about the time of the surrender of Berwick Castle, and so Richard seems to have travelled back from Newcastle. The Earl of Northumberland is said to have knighted 18 men at the [...] "mayne of Sefford,"Cessford in the Scottish Middle-march, during a previous campaign, on 22 August 1480, or at the same time. A grand total of 70 knights and bannerets including Molyneux and Edward Stanley were made on 24 August which seems to mark the end of hostilities. The occasion on the 22 August may have prompted Edward's letter to the Pope.|$|E
2500|$|The New Yorker and Politico placed Think Big and Kick Ass {{within the}} genre of {{self-help}} books.

The Economics noted that during successful periods of the stock market more finance books were published. Author and academic John Lubans wrote about the business genre, [...] "And there’s a subset of the business fad industry: books. Not about a system of work, but titles written by celebrity leaders like Donald Trump, Jack Welch, and others bent on explaining how they got to be as good as they decidedly are and how you too, if you follow their advice, can make it to the top. Mr. Trump’s latest, Think Big and Kick Ass, probably defines the genre." [...] Jeffrey L. Buller wrote in Change Leadership in Higher Education that the book was part of [...] "a school of thought that <b>says</b> <b>when</b> it comes to success in life or at work, leadership requires people to become aggressive, assertive, and at times even abusive in order to achieve their goals.

2500|$|The letters y and i {{are mostly}} equivalent, {{and there is no}} {{concrete}} rule that <b>says</b> <b>when</b> to use one or the other, except in sequences like ay and uy (i.e. tay ("arm, hand") is read [...] while tai ("ear") is read [...] ). There have been attempts since the late 20th century to standardize the orthography by replacing all the vowel uses of y with i, the latest being a decision from the Vietnamese Ministry of Education in 1984. [...] These efforts seem to have had limited effect, in part because some people bristled at the thought of names such as Nguyễn becoming Nguiễn and Thúy (a common female name) becoming Thúi (stinky), even though the standardization does not apply to diphthongs and triphthongs and allowed exceptions to proper names. In textbooks published by Nhà Xuất bản Giáo dục ("Publishing House of Education"), y is used to represent [...] only in Sino-Vietnamese words that are written with one letter y alone (diacritics can still be added, as in ý, ỷ), {{at the beginning of a}} syllable when followed by ê (as in yếm, yết), and after u; therefore such forms as *lý and *kỹ are not [...] "standard", though they are much preferred elsewhere.
