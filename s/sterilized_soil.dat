Most conidial spores do not {{germinate}}, and the few that do germinate in soil only have short germ tubes. [...] In <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil</b> and peat, however, spores readily germinate, and after 7 days, extensive mycelium and sporulation is visible. The phenomenon that germination and growth of fungal propagules is inhibited by active soil microorganisms is typical for most soils and is known as soil fungistasis. Germination of L. fungicola spores requires an external nutrient source. Even though spores of the pathogen can germinate in sterile water, germination and germ tube growth are greatly stimulated by the addition of nutrients. It was proposed that carbon is the stimulating factor. [...] Fungistasis is not only caused by nutrient depletion, the production of inhibiting compounds also contributes to inhibition of spore germination. The earliest infestation by the L. fungicola spores can happen as early as casing time, but not before. Usually the spores that land on the deposited compost will not cause disease. It has been observed that even spores that are on the compost before casing do not cause disease development. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that very high populations of spores applied to the compost before casing can induce disease development. [...] Once the casing is applied and rhizomorphs start to mature, then it seems Verticillium spores can become viable and spore source. These asymptomatic mushrooms can carry conidial spores and sclerotia that can be spread by growers, harvesters and other personnel.|$|E

Increased attention has been given to the mechanisms that drive successful invasions, including those influencing belowground interactions between invasive and native plant species. To determine how the prominent invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder affects a co-occurring native plant, we examined how a root/rhizosphere extract from L. maackii affected growth and mycorrhizal infection of Impatiens capensis Meerb. using epifluorescence microscopy of live roots. We also examined how the presence of a live soil microbial community influenced growth and mycorrhizal infection of I. capensis and how it the altered the effect of L. maackii extracts on these variables. In live soils, exposure to L. maackii extracts reduced mycorrhizal infection, reduced height, and slightly reduced shoot mass. In <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils,</b> exposure to L. maackii extracts slightly increased mycorrhizal infection, reduced height, and generally increased shoot, root, and total biomass.

The overall effect of the root/rhizosphere extractwas dependent on the presence of a live microbial community in the soil, having generally positive effects on biomass in <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils</b> but negative effects in live soils.

To make this approach a successful restoration tool, C addition must induce the resident soil bacteria and fungi to immobilize plant available soil nutrients. In this study, both the efficacy of sucrose applications as a restoration aid and their dependence on soil microbial activity were examined in field and greenhouse trials. Carbon as sucrose (200 gm− 2) was added to normal and <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils</b> containing various combinations of native perennial and annual species. Their effects on soil N levels, {{as well as on}} the photosynthetic efficiency, growth and N uptake of the introduced native species, were measured. Diminished foliar chlorophyll contents, effective quantum yields (ΔF/Fm′) of Photosystem II (PSII) and dry mass accumulation in response to sucrose applications were observed in both the annual and perennial introduced species, but were not reflected in corresponding reductions in soil N levels. These sucrose-induced inhibitory effects, as well as diminished plant N uptake, were more pronounced in normal than <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils.</b> This implied a bacterial component immobilizing soil N essential for plant photosynthesis and growth. However, this premise was partly contradicted by the unaltered total bacterial numbers following sucrose application in the normal soils, although coliform numbers did increase with sucrose application in these soils.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cell surface properties on attachment to soil particles and on population dynamics of introduced bacteria was studied in sterilized and nonsterilized loamy {{sand and silt}} loam. Rhizobium leguminosarum RBL 5523 and three Tn 5 mutants (RBL 5762, RBL 5810, and RBL 5811) with altered cell surface properties were used. Cellulose fibrils were not produced by RBL 5762. Both RBL 5810 and RBL 5811 produced 80 to 90 % less soluble exopolysaccharides and RBL 5811 had, in addition, an altered lipopolysaccharide composition. In <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil</b> {{the total number of}} cells as well as the number of particle-associated cells of RBL 5523 and RBL 5810 were, in general, higher as compared with cell numbers of RBL 5762 and RBL 5811. Differences between strains in percentage of particle-associated cells in <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil</b> were only found at high inoculum densities, when populations increased little. In the nonsterilized silt loam, final population sizes, as well as numbers of particle-associated cells, of the parental strain (RBL 5523) were higher than those of strains with altered cell surface properties after 56 and 112 days of incubation. But in general, differences in survival among the strains were not very marked. The importance of association with soil particles or aggregates for the survival of introduced cells was affirmed by the pronounced increase of the percentage of particle-associated cells during incubation in nonsterilized as well as <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil.</b> However, no clear relation among altered cell surface properties, particle association, and survival was found...|$|E
40|$|Off-season {{survival}} of Bipolaris sorokiniana (Sacc.) Shoemaker in sterilized and unsterilized soils, and in residues of wheat spread on soil surface were determined. Population of viable propagules of the fungus per gram of soil or residue was determined at monthly interval using dilution plate technique. It {{was found that}} the population of B. sorokiniana increased initially for two months in both soils and residues and declined thereafter. The decline was very sharp up to four months of survival and then onwards a gradual decline was observed. In case of free residue, a gradual decline in population was observed {{from the beginning of the}} pathogen survival. The pathogen could be recovered up to eight and ten months from the unsterilized and <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil,</b> respectively. It was not possible to recover the pathogen from the residues in unsterilized and <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil</b> after seven and eight months. The pathogen could survive for 12 months in free residue stored at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: H,S was {{evolved from}} soil treated with CCl, when {{moistened}} with sucrose and (NH,),SO, solution and incubated aerobically. H 2 S formation took place when the soil moisture {{was less than}} field capacity, and over a range of pH values from 5 to 8. The organism responsible was isolated and identified as Bacillus rnega-terium. Several strains of this organism reduced sulphate in well-aerated <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil</b> and liquid media but not in soil or liquid incubated anaerobically. The action of CCl, in fresh soil is to check or destroy certain fungi and bacteria which normally inhibit sulphate reduction by B. megaterium. Some of these organisms were isolated and shown {{to be sensitive to}} CCl, and to inhibit sulphate reduction by B. megaterium in <b>sterilized</b> <b>soil.</b> The isolates did not exhibit antibiotic action when grown in certain defined media. The reduction of sulphate in soil is known to be achieved by Desulphovibrio species, and although there have been reports of other micro-organisms abl...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of carbon (C) {{to the soil}} as sucrose has been suggested as a countermeasure to reduce plant available nitrogen (N) and increase the competitive advantage of slower growing native perennial species over faster growing annual species. To make this approach a successful restoration tool, C addition must induce the resident soil bacteria and fungi to immobilize plant available soil nutrients. In this study, both the efficacy of sucrose applications as a restoration aid and their dependence on soil microbial activity were examined in field and greenhouse trials. Carbon as sucrose (200 gm - 2) was added to normal and <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils</b> containing various combinations of native perennial and annual species. Their effects on soil N levels, {{as well as on}} the photosynthetic efficiency, growth and N uptake of the introduced native species, were measured. Diminished foliar chlorophyll contents, effective quantum yields (δF/Fm') of Photosystem II (PSII) and dry mass accumulation in response to sucrose applications were observed in both the annual and perennial introduced species, but were not reflected in corresponding reductions in soil N levels. These sucrose-induced inhibitory effects, as well as diminished plant N uptake, were more pronounced in normal than <b>sterilized</b> <b>soils.</b> This implied a bacterial component immobilizing soil N essential for plant photosynthesis and growth. However, this premise was partly contradicted by the unaltered total bacterial numbers following sucrose application in the normal soils, although coliform numbers did increase with sucrose application in these soils. These findings point to a likely abiotic mechanism of sucrose-induced inhibition of photosynthesis and growth in introduced native plants, which renders sucrose application ineffectual as a restoration aid in transformed lowland fynbos ecosystems. © 2012 South African Association of Botanists...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{consciousness}} of health hazards in using and handling chemical substances for commercial horticulture {{has created a}} need for non-chemical methods {{as a means of}} control and disinfestation. This report is a review of the use and experience of different non-chemical methods. Some new methods which are being developed are microwaves, gamma radiation and ionization. Old methods like the use of steam for disinfection have been improved. They are more energy-efficient and less time-consuming. The possibility of using microwave energy to disinfest growing substrate, both soil and artificial material, is being researched. It is a low-energy and less time-consuming method when it comes to <b>sterilizing</b> <b>soil.</b> Satisfactory results have been documented. The technology has yet to be developed to fit the needs of commercial horticulture. When artificial substrate, rockwool, was treated in a microwave oven it resulted in an unequal distribution of heat in the rockwool and there was a limited temperature range in moistened rockwool. Rockwoll treated with RF-waves was however sufficiently disinfected. The use of steam for <b>sterilizing</b> <b>soil</b> is a well-known method. A new system with negative pressure is beeing developed. This system is more efficient than drain-steaming and steam applied under a plastic cover. Recycled rockwool is satisfactorily sterilized in containers heated by steam in many countries including Holland. The advantage of preventing problems by maintaining highly hygienic standards must not be underestimated. Different methods of cleaning the equipment are available, e. g. steam chambers for cleaning equipment, pot trays, recycled pots etc as well as hot water baths for disinfection of pot trays. Continuous cleaning of greenhouse buildings, coverings and fixtures with high-pressure and hot water is another way to forestall problems. Even the tables should be cleaned with high-pressure when possible. Recirculated drain water and nutrients are a main source of infection. There are different methods to sterilizing the solution, e. g. UV-light, ultra filtration, heating or biological filters...|$|R
