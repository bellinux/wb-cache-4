25|$|In the Letter, Rousseau {{rejected}} the traditional notion of male politicians {{being responsible for}} moral reform, {{and thought it was}} women's responsibility. He considered women, by virtue of their nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, {{goes hand in hand with}} patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task is to make <b>sure</b> <b>a</b> society's women are in order.|$|E
25|$|A November 2011 Public Policy Polling {{survey found}} that 44% of Arizona voters {{supported}} the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not <b>sure.</b> <b>A</b> separate question on the same {{survey found that}} 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56.2%–43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.|$|E

25|$|Barillas {{was unique}} among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his {{successor}} peacefully. When election time approached, he sent {{for the three}} Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made <b>sure</b> <b>a</b> huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people {{came down from the}} mountains to vote for the general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday's Task: When Eric was {{nominated}} for Thursday's eviction, his Tuesday night task was to flatter and {{do whatever it takes}} to make <b>sure</b> <b>a</b> specific person did not vote to evict him, and he completed this task if that person voted to evict the other nominee. When Eric was not nominated, then his Tuesday night task was to target one of the two nominees for eviction. Eric automatically voted for the winner of the AP poll, and he completed the task if the majority of HouseGuests voted to evict the same player he had been instructed to target. Eric successfully completed five of the eight tasks involving persuading the house to evict a nominee. The one time Eric was on the block and had to flatter Dick to secure their vote, he chose not to.|$|E

25|$|Why {{is it that}} we are <b>sure</b> <b>a</b> {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic {{target shooting}} — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has {{set out to do}} when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although he comes from a typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite <b>sure.</b> <b>A</b> small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French.

In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, {{one of whom was}} chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition.

In response, legal scholars such as Professor Edward Samuel Corwin of Princeton University said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties—"under the authority of the United States"—was misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the 1783 peace treaty with Britain; this became [...] "in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation". Professor Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School wrote, [...] "the Framers never talked about having treaties on the same level as the Constitution.
