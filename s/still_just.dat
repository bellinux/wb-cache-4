5|$|Almost {{forty years}} after the {{construction}} of Bletchley railway station, the 1884/5 Ordnance Survey shows Bletchley as <b>still</b> <b>just</b> a small village around the C of E church at Bletchley Park, and a hamlet near the Methodist chapel and Shoulder of Mutton public house at the junction of Shenley Road/Newton Road with Buckingham Road. (These districts are known today as Old Bletchley and Far Bletchley). The major settlement of the time is Fenny Stratford.|$|E

In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train.

Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E

5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was <b>still</b> <b>just</b> a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

This was originally a dissenters' chapel built in 1810 and used as a chapel of ease for Kirkburton from 1834 to 1870. Around 1850 there was an unsuccessful local attempt to raise funds for a new church; a second attempt in 1867–1868 came to fruition.|$|E

25|$|As Tampa {{began to}} grow in the mid-1800s, roads across central Florida were <b>still</b> <b>just</b> rough trails and rail lines did not yet extend down the Florida peninsula, so the most {{convenient}} means of traveling to and from the area was by sea. By the late 19th century, however, the shallow nature of Tampa Bay made it impossible for large modern vessels with deeper drafts to reach the city of Tampa's downtown wharves on Hillsboro Bay. Most ships would anchor well out from shore and transfer cargo and passengers to and from the city in smaller boats.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic Richfield Company {{discovered}} oil in Alaska in 1968. In late 1968 {{and early}} 1969, Charlie Spahr {{began to work}} out the details of Sohio’s working relationship with British Petroleum (BP) in Prudhoe Bay. BP had substantial area in Prudhoe Bay, but had no American refineries, which they viewed as the most important oil market in the world. By forging a relationship with Sohio, BP was {{able to take advantage of}} the talents of an established company. Until that point, though Sohio had diversified through coal, and the creation and growth of a series of motels and restaurants on the new Interstate Highway system, it was <b>still</b> <b>just</b> a marketer and refiner. Sohio needed to produce oil, as well as refine and market oil products.|$|E
25|$|As the {{consensus}} of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many right wing elements in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of victor's justice. They see those convicted of war crimes as , Shōwa being the name given {{to the rule of}} Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically valid, they were <b>still</b> <b>just,</b> somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.|$|E

25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a private document of Coimbra cited him, although <b>still</b> <b>just</b> as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him {{it is difficult to see}} why he was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.|$|E
25|$|His {{best season}} in {{representative}} cricket was 1963. He {{played in the}} season opener for MCC against Yorkshire, and scored 176, putting on 142 with Peter Richardson and 209 with Tony Lewis. Three weeks later he was back at Lord's playing for MCC against the West Indies, opening both innings with John Edrich. Atkinson scored 2 and 63, and Edrich scored 63 and 39, and it was Edrich who played {{in the first two}} Tests of the season. Finally he was picked for Young England – he was <b>still</b> <b>just</b> 25 – in the end of season match with an England XI at Scarborough and for the final match of the West Indies' tour against T. N. Pearce XI, but he was not selected for the England tour of India in 1963–64. And with Edrich cementing his England Test place and the emergence of Geoffrey Boycott and Bob Barber as openers, the opportunity never came again.|$|E
25|$|GLaDOS' {{physical}} appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus {{with the four}} personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled {{on the design of}} the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity. A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was <b>still</b> <b>just</b> a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The large chamber that the player-character encounters {{was the result of the}} team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her.|$|E

25|$|On 19 June Frankel {{started at}} odds of 1/10 for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot against a field which {{included}} Excelebration and Strong Suit, respectively ranked the equal second and the equal fifth best three-year-old colts {{in the world}} by the IFHA in 2011. Frankel took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew steadily clear to win by eleven lengths from Excelebration. Frankel ran the penultimate furlong in a time of 10.58 seconds, which equates to a top speed of over 42mph. The Guardian's correspondent described the performance as possibly the greatest in the history of Thoroughbred racing. Timeform responded to the win by raising Frankel's provisional rating to 147, the highest in the organisation's history, two pounds in advance of the 145 recorded in 1965 by Sea-Bird. However the British Horseracing Authority's handicapper, Dominic Gardiner-Hill, was more cautious. He rated the horse at 140, which was <b>still</b> <b>just</b> behind Dancing Brave's all-time record mark of 141. The Racing Post gave the performance a rating of 142, the highest in the publication's history, three pounds ahead of Dubai Millennium.|$|E
