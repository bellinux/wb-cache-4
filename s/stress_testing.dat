Those designing <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> must literally imagine possible futures that the financial system might face. As an exercise of the imagination, the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> is limited by the imaginative capacities of those designing the <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> scenarios. Sometimes, the <b>stress</b> <b>test's</b> designers fail to imagine plausible future scenarios, possibly because of professional peer pressure or groupthink within a profession or trade (witness the failure of the great majority of financial [...] "experts" [...] to envisage the crash of 2008) or because some things are just too horrible to imagine. The successive financial <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> conducted by the European Banking Authority and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in 2009, 2010 and 2011 illustrate this dynamic. The 2009 and 2010 <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> assumed even in their adverse scenarios a relatively benign macro-economic environment of -0.6% economic growth in the Euro area; by 2011 it was clear that such assumptions were no longer just plausible, they were almost certain to happen; the adverse scenario had to be adjusted to a -4.0% growth scenario.

25|$|For most people, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} result from atheroma progression within the heart arteries, most commonly {{resulting in a}} heart attack and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5mm down to microscopic), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have been a difficult target organ to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting atheroma and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>testing,</b> do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict in response to increasing atheroma. It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either <b>stress</b> <b>testing,</b> stress tests or angiograms.|$|E

Next came bypass surgery, to plumb transplanted veins, sometimes arteries, around the stenoses and more recently angioplasty, now including stents, most recently drug coated stents, to stretch the stenoses more open.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> for {{diagnosis}} of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) are incompletely sensitive and specific. Objective: We examined the frequency of significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain {{who have had a}} recent negative or inconclusive (< 85 % of predicted maximum heart rate) cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients identified from ED and cardiology registries at the study hospital. We included patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain, with a negative cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> {{in the past three years}} as the last cardiac test, and hospital admission. One-hundred sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Their admission was reviewed for {{diagnosis of}} CAD by positive serum troponin, percutaneous coronary intervention, or positive <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> while an inpatient. Results: Of 164 patients, 122 (74. 4 %, 95 % CI 67. 7, 81. 1) had a negative <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> prior to the index admission, while 42 (25. 6 %, 95 % CI 18. 9, 32. 3) had otherwise normal but inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Thirty-four (20. 7 %, 95 % CI 14. 4, 27. 0) of the included patients were determined to have CAD. Twenty-five of the 122 patients (20. 5 %, 95 % CI 13. 3, 27. 7) had negative pre-admission <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> and nine of 42 patients (21. 4 %, 95 % CI 9. 0, 33. 8) had inclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> of CAD. A statistical comparison between these two proportions showed no significant difference (p =. 973). Conclusion: Due to inadequate sensitivity, negative non-invasive cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> should not be used to rule out CAD. Patients with negative <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> are just as likely to have CAD as patients with inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> [West J Emerg Med 2010; 11 (4) : 384 - 388. ...|$|R

25|$|Manufacture of YP-38s {{fell behind}} schedule, {{at least partly}} because of the need for {{mass-production}} suitability making them substantially different in construction from the prototype. Another factor was the sudden required expansion of Lockheed's facility in Burbank, taking it from a specialized civilian firm dealing with small orders to a large government defense contractor making Venturas, Harpoons, Lodestars, Hudsons, and designing the Constellation for TWA. The first YP-38 was not completed until September 1940, with its maiden flight on 17 September. The 13th and final YP-38 was delivered to the Air Corps in June 1941; 12 aircraft were retained for flight testing and one for destructive <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> The YPs were substantially redesigned and differed greatly in detail from the hand-built XP-38.

25|$|Intended {{to perform}} {{better in the}} mountainous terrain of the Austrian alps, the Type C {{featured}} a longer fuselage, greater wingspan, and strengthened undercarriage. The Type B's Austro-Daimler engine was exchanged for a Heiro with slightly less power but also much lighter. The extended wingspan soon led to problems, however, when the prototype's wings collapsed under <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> A second prototype, with strengthened wings, was accepted by the Army in August 1913, and placed an order for another 24 aircraft. Soon after deliveries began, {{the wings of a}} Type C failed in flight, and all examples were grounded. Work to strengthen the wing design was carried out under the direction of Professor Richard Knoller but this was not yet complete when war broke out. Six Type Cs were immediately put back into action, with the grounding of the others being lifted shortly afterwards. The design proved too slow and too fragile for operational service, and was quickly reassigned to secondary roles. In February 1915, the Luftschiffabteilung revised its designation system to match that in use by Germany, and the Type C was redesignated B.II. Later the same year, a new and strengthened wing was fitted to all remaining B.IIs, and the B.II (along with the B.I) was put back into production under licence at Flugzeugwerk Fischamend for use as trainers.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Slowed {{heart rate}} {{recovery}} (HRR) {{of less than}} 12 beats per minute in the first minute after an exercise <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> has been suggested as a useful addition to the criteria currently used to assess exercise <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> results. Although HRR has been tested in large populations, the short-term test-retest sta-bility (reproducibility) of abnormal HRR for an individual has not been assessed. METHODS The study was a retrospective comparison of medical record informa-tion using a community-practice–based sample of 90 patients undergoing 2 exer-cise <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> separated by 18 weeks or less. Concordance of abnormal HRR results on {{the first and second}} <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> were assessed for individual patients using definitions of abnormal HRR from the medical literature. RESULTS Individual patient’s HRR was markedly variable from the first to second <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> In this sample, no definition of abnormal HRR provided more than 55 % concordance between results from the first and second <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> CONCLUSION These preliminary data suggest that HRR appears to have limited short-term test-retest stability or reproducibility and therefore might not be a reli-able addition to current results of exercise <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Ann Fam Med 2003; 1 : 236 - 241.
