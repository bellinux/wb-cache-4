5000|$|<b>Shrag</b> were a British post-punk-influenced indiepop band, {{based in}} London and Brighton. The band {{released}} three albums on the Where It's at Is Where You Are label, the last a joint release on Fortuna Pop! ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shrag's</b> first {{release was}} the home-recorded song [...] "Punk Grammar", which debuted on Under The Beach, A Heart Attack - a 2003 {{compilation}} album and fanzine of Brighton bands, {{put together by}} local club night It Came From The Sea, and featuring a foreword by the then Brighton-based music critic Everett True. The fanzine {{tells the story of}} <b>Shrag's</b> formation in a comic book format. At the tail-end of a party in Brighton's Sussex Heights residential tower block, the remaining five revellers - made up of local DJs, promoters, academics and musicians - decide to start a band, named Sussex Heights Roving Artists Group.|$|R
50|$|In adulthood, Claire Usher {{obtained}} {{a degree in}} drama and became a dancer, and appeared in the stage show Riverdance on Broadway in 2000, and in the show's UK tour. She later wrote songs for indie pop band <b>Shrag.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Shrag</b> {{played a}} radio session for Marc Riley on 6Music on 2 January 2013, {{during which they}} {{announced}} they were to split. Their final single was released on 11 February, and their last gig was at London's Lexington on 15 March.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, many of {{the tracks}} <b>Shrag</b> had {{originally}} intended to appear on their forthcoming album were either shelved or re-recorded by the new line-up, while new songs that the band began working on saw them {{turning away from the}} lighter, more poppy original template for the album into much darker and more introspective territory.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a branch}} {{has been cut}} {{or in any other}} way removed from its source, it is most {{commonly}} referred to as a stick, and a stick employed for some purpose (such as walking, spanking, or beating) is often called a rod. Thin, flexible sticks are called switches, wands, <b>shrags,</b> or vimina (singular vimen).|$|R
50|$|<b>Shrag</b> {{continued}} {{to build a}} growing fanbase with steady touring, both supporting The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and headlining their own tours, but ongoing medical problems caused drummer Leigh Anne Walter to be replaced for many live performances by Medicine & Duty drummer Andy Pyne, who in 2009 became a permanent member of the band.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band played}} {{a number of}} early gigs around the UK queercore scene, with Ste McCabe and others; {{following}} an appearance on Brighton queercore label Tuff Enuff Records’s 2012 compilation Why Diet When You Could Riot? gigs with <b>Shrag</b> and (Athens, Georgia’s) Tunabunny led to a split single with London’s Skinny Girl Diet on US label Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records in 2013. A cassette/download EP on Tuff Enuff - [...] "Hens Teeth" [...] - followed in 2014.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} of the queer community in New York City, surrounded by friends that are going through female to male transitions, and even personally dated a transgender woman influence Ariel Schrag significantly on why she wrote the book, Adam. When first creating the character Adam, Schrag imagined him as an older man. The inspiration behind it came from Schrag’s co-worker Adam Rapp when she was writing for the show, The L Word. Rapp was {{the only man in}} the writing group while the rest were lesbians. Rapp is a straight cisgender man, <b>Shrag</b> wondered what he had to bring to a writing group on a Lesbian TV series. <b>Shrag</b> found herself imagining Rapp as a cis gender man going to gay bars trying to blend in as a trans man to collect data for writing. She found this thought funny and interesting and thought she should write a novel about it. The more <b>Shrag</b> thought about the idea she realized an adult man should know that doing something as such would be in poor taste. <b>Shrag</b> then decided the character should be a teenager whose intentions for such actions would come from love. Schrag’s personal experience with friends is one of the inspirations that make her want to write the novel in Adam’s perspective. A straight friend of Schrag's envy about how amazing it is to have the LGBTQ community there for you inspired her. Schrag thinks about how people would misunderstand things by looking at a situation only in either a good or bad way without considering a gray area. Her friend focuses on how great it is to have a community supporting you but not the issues queer people face on a daily basis is just one example. It has surprised Schrag how a lot of people only read the introduction of the book and stop reading further because they felt offended and uncomfortable by the topics the book talks about. Responding to people's reaction, Schrag explains that she wants to write something unique and different. Something that people get to explore the unfamiliar because that is what makes things alluring. In the book, Schrag shows a lot of topics that happens in the LGBTQ community but have not been included much in books, comics and so on. For example, in a scene where different groups of people are talking about their opinions on legalizing same sex marriage, Schrag includes a group of queer people disagreeing with the idea of gay marriage. Schrag decides to present the sex scenes in the book explicitly and intimately with descriptions of body parts rather than quickly passing through in most of the novels. Novels have the power to make it intimate to the readers. She thinks cutting out or not addressing enough of these important moments is incomplete, especially for her book considering that the topics are about gender, sex, and sexuality.|$|R
50|$|Tuff Enuff was {{established}} in 2012 as a spin-off from associated club night Riots Not Diets, and specialises in releasing DIY punk and lo-fi/underground music. The label {{is considered to be}} in the tradition of Slampt Records as well as more recent British queercore labels such as Homocrime and Irrk. First release was compilation album Why Diet When You Could Riot?, which was favourably reviewed in Maximum Rocknroll and elsewhere and included tracks from Ste McCabe and Trash Kit. Two further compilations followed, 2013's Carry On Rioting and 2014's I Know Why the Caged Grrrl Sings, including tracks by <b>Shrag</b> and Shopping, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The band {{split up}} in 1999, {{reformed}} in Brighton {{with a different}} line-up including Bob Brown (now of <b>Shrag)</b> and Nick Hills (now of Coin-op), but after several false starts called it a day in 2001. Most of the original line-up reformed in 2006 for a one-off show with fellow former Noisebox Records artists Navigator. Matt Leuw joined Coin-op in 2001 but left them in 2003 and formed Cortez {{at the end of}} the same year, and in 2007 formed both The Matthew Project and 2 Hot 2 Sweat. He has now disbanded both The Matthew Project and 2 Hot 2 Sweat and has a new project entitled Mild Horses.|$|R
5000|$|Runaround Kids {{formed in}} 2007, {{two years in}} later in 2009 they {{released}} their first EP, Kiss Chase. Jumbo Records, Leeds, described it as; [...] "Really, really great indie pop/rock that chugs along like a frantic newwave addicted monkey". In August 2010 they played Reading and Leeds Festivals. In 2011 they returned to Leeds Festival on special request of Leeds label Dance To The Radio. Between those two milestones the band familiarised themselves with the festival circuit, playing the Constellations and Long Division Festivals, as wells as Live At Leeds, Tramlines, Eurocultured and Bomfest, whilst also supporting bands such as Jeffrey Lewis, Pulled Apart By Horses, Johnny Foreigner, Dinosaur Pile-Up and <b>Shrag.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first single}} from Life! Death! Prizes!, <b>Shrag's</b> second album, was [...] "Rabbit Kids", an anthemic love song {{which won the}} band {{significant}} mainstream radio play and plaudits in Pitchfork, All Music Guide and Drowned in Sound. Musically the band had concentrated their musical range (which had previously drifted from B-52s-esque guitar pop to synth-led ballads) into more concise, driving rock songs, although a string section on the epic album closer Coda and the waltzy Furnishings showed a softer, more vulnerable side to the band. The album's centrepiece, [...] "The Habit Creep" [...] was a harrowing spoken word piece depicting an individual unravelling psychologically, and the download single [...] "Ghosts Before Breakfast" [...] represented the noisier, artier influences of bands like Prolapse and Life Without Buildings.|$|R
