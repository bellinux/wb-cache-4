5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and <b>student</b> <b>interest.</b> His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E

25|$|The Collegian Column is {{a weekly}} school {{bulletin}} produced by faculty, which appeals primarily to older students interested in scholarship information.

25|$|Fisk's {{students}} and many progressive alumni resented the school's outreach to White Nashvillians and strict {{code of conduct}}. While Fisk's strict code of conduct and discipline and role as loco parentis was mirrored by most Black colleges and White universities, including nearby Vanderbilt, the approach collided with the New Negro spirit of Black determination. Dissatisfaction also extended to prohibition of Greek societies on campus, although <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> in social organizations predated McKenzie's arrival.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{use of nuclear}} medicine, the {{potential}} expansion of nuclear power plants, and worries about protection against nuclear threats and {{the management of the}} nuclear waste generated in past decades, the number of students opting to specialize in nuclear and radiochemistry has decreased significantly over the past few decades. Now, with many experts in these fields approaching retirement age, action is needed to avoid a workforce gap in these critical fields, for example by building <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> in these careers, expanding the educational capacity of universities and colleges, and providing more specific on-the-job training.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a Student Union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: The General Assembly and the Board of Directors. The General Assembly consists of all student-members of the Union. It takes place {{on a regular basis}} and is the only decision-making body. During the General Assembly, many topics of <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The Board of Directors makes sure that the decisions of the General Assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the Board of Directors, among which is the Union's President, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the Union.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Mead (American Sociological Review) {{considered}} the book {{more of a}} historical document for later generations to analyze [...] "than {{anything that can be}} taken at its face value". She wrote the school to be [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "counter-pointed to the emphases and excesses" [...] of its era, which she credited to Neill's [...] "rare charismatic personality". To Mead, Summerhill's moral battles had passed since the 1920s, as Neill's audience already agreed with his views on frank discussions about sex and the primacy of <b>student</b> <b>interest.</b> She added that his contemporaries had moved on to [...] "rebelling against a contentless freedom" [...] that prioritized emotional education over intellectual lessons. Similarly, Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) noted Neill's approach as less [...] "sensational" [...] in its method than expected, and asserted that 1960s psychologists would agree with the stance to not guilt children for masturbating and to tell the truth about the origin of babies. Morton Reisman (The Phi Delta Kappan) upheld the book's subtitle and agreed that the book was [...] "radical" [...] in comparison to conventional American morality and education.|$|E
500|$|The oldest form {{of student}} media at Texas State was a {{yearbook}} originally called the Pedagogue and later renamed the Pedagog. [...] It {{was first published}} in 1904 and served to record each year's events through photographs and articles. [...] It was temporarily discontinued in 1975 due to a combination of the cost to publish the annual and a lack of <b>student</b> <b>interest.</b> [...] It was published again in 1978 as part of the school's seventy-fifth anniversary. [...] In 1984 it resumed regular publication. [...] However, it was last published in 2000 after university committees recommended replacing the printed yearbook with a video disk containing the same contents. [...] The annual has since been discontinued entirely. [...] Now called the University Star, it publishes coverage of the college's news, trends, opinions and sports. [...] The newspaper is published on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays while classes are in session in the fall and spring semesters. The paper is published five times during the summer. The Star has a web site which contains videos, blogs and podcasts in addition to the articles that are published in the print version of the paper. The Star and its staff have received awards including merits from Hearst Journalism, the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association and the Society of Professional Journalists.|$|E
500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E

2500|$|The {{national}} fraternity was {{dissolved in}} 1973, due to changing <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> and organizational turmoil. However, several well-established chapters survived and have flourished as semi-local institutions.

2500|$|The Summerhill {{classroom}} was popularly {{assumed to}} reflect Neill's anti-authoritarian beliefs, though their classes were traditional in practice. Neill {{did not show}} outward interest in classroom pedagogy, and was mainly interested in student happiness. He did not consider lesson quality important, and thus there were no distinctive Summerhillian classroom methods. Leonard Waks wrote that, like Homer Lane, Neill thought all teaching should follow <b>student</b> <b>interest,</b> and that teaching method did not matter much once <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> was apparent. In a review of an algebra lesson taught by Neill as recounted through Herb Snitzer's Living at Summerhill, Richard Bailey described Neill's teaching technique as [...] "simply awful" [...] for his lack of student engagement, inarticulate explanations, and insults directed at students. Bailey criticized Neill's absolution of responsibility for his pupils' academic performance, and his view that charismatic instruction {{was a form of}} persuasion that weakened child autonomy. Ronald Swartz referred to Neill's method as Socratic, about which Bailey disagreed.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{inadequate}} funding, the UT Athletic Council {{canceled the}} fledgling program after two seasons, leaving Texas without a basketball {{team for the}} 1908 season. The Athletics Council revived the program in 1909, owing {{in large part to}} the efforts of Longhorn player Morgan Vining, who campaigned to raise <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> in the game. Vining was supported in his efforts by the UT student newspaper, The Daily Texan, which consistently advocated for the reinstatement of basketball—in part because the game was viewed as good physical training for football players in the latter sport's offseason.|$|E
2500|$|Primarily active {{during the}} 1940s and 1950s, these groups were formed in {{response}} to <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> in Greek life for those who required a closer association with peers of the same faith tradition. [...] Some were local organizations, some national. Some were residential, and all were co-ed unless noted. Note that some religious-themed and residential fraternities and sororities are listed under the Academic and Social groups by their choice. Many other religious-oriented groups on campus are NOT designed to resemble fraternities, and are not listed here. Groups are listed by date of local founding.|$|E
2500|$|The College {{curriculum}} {{has taken}} various forms throughout its history. It {{began with a}} general program of study in the liberal arts, but St. John's was a military school {{for much of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century. [...] It ended compulsory military training with Major Enoch Garey's accession as president in 1923. Garey and the Navy instituted a Naval Reserve unit in September 1924, creating the first-ever collegiate Department of Naval Science in the United States. [...] But despite St. John's successfully pioneering the entire NROTC movement, <b>student</b> <b>interest</b> waned, the voluntary ROTC disappeared in 1926 with Garey's departure, and the Naval Reserve unit followed by 1929.|$|E
