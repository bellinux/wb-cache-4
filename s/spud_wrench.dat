2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the <b>spud</b> <b>wrench,</b> bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The <b>spud</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a <b>spud</b> <b>wrench</b> is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E
5000|$|The troll {{first came}} to the public's {{attention}} on January 15, 1990 when the San Francisco Chronicle ran a story about the small figure of a troll complete with a <b>spud</b> <b>wrench</b> that had been welded to the iron below the road {{on the north side of}} the bridge. The article quotes official spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, Greg Bayol, as saying, [...] "If we were asked, we would have said 'no,' I'm sure." [...] The iron workers had never asked to put the troll on the bridge, so the state is stuck with the troll.|$|E
50|$|Drift pins are {{especially}} useful for aligning fastener holes in structural steel members. <b>Spud</b> <b>wrenches</b> used for assembling trusses and steel beams have tapered handles {{to use as}} drift pins.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{construction}} can begin, {{the structural}} ironworkers {{put together the}} cranes {{that will be used}} to lift the steel columns, beams, and girders according to blueprints to erect a structure. To hoist the steel, structural ironworkers use cables connected to the crane to lift the beams onto the steel columns. [...] A rope called a tagline is attached to the beams so an ironworker can control the beams if necessary. [...] The crane hoists steel into place, and the ironworkers position the beams in place with <b>spud</b> <b>wrenches</b> to align bolt holes. [...] Then, the beams can be bolted to the steel columns. [...] This process is continued until there are no beams or columns left to construct the structure. Structural ironworkers also erect joist girders, bar joists, trusses and install metal decking.|$|R
