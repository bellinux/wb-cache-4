40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} retail {{plastic packaging}} system {{was used to}} compare the atmospheric composition within <b>sealed</b> <b>packs</b> containing tomato fruits. A range of plastic films with different permeability properties were tested to study the effects of these conditions on the changes in postharvest qualities of tomatoes harvested at the pink stage of maturity and stored at 13 oC for 60 days. The films used were 20 micron (PE 20) and 50 micron (PE 50) polyethylene, 10 micron polyvinylcholoride (PVC) or 25 micron polypropylene (PP) compared with unwrapped fruit as a control. Tomatoes were evaluated for changes in colour, firmness, weight, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, decay and sensory attributes. All unwrapped tomatoes were overripe and soft after 30 days. Sealed packaging, especially using with PE 50 and PP films, delayed the development of the red colour of tomatoes until 30 days of storage and those tomatoes were also still very firm even after 60 days of storage. Tomatoes sealed within PE 50 and PP films had also the lowest weight loss and the highest soluble solids after 60 days of storage...|$|R

Global emergence of Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) displays a mechanism of resistance to all existing antimicrobials. Due to its strong ability to acquire resistance, there is a need of some alternative treatment strategy. Objective of this study was to investigate the effect of biofield treatment on antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of P. fluorescens. P. fluorescens cells were procured from MicroBioLogics in <b>sealed</b> <b>packs</b> bearing the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 49838) number. Two sets of ATCC samples were taken in this experiment and denoted as A and B. ATCC-A sample was revived and divided into two groups (Gr) i. e. Gr. I (control) and Gr. II (revived); likewise, ATCC-B was labeled as Gr. III (lyophilized). Gr. II and III were given biofield treatment and were measured by MicroScan Walk-Away ® system before and after treatment. Parameters studied in experiment were antimicrobial sensitivity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biochemical reactions, and biotype number of both control and treatment groups using MicroScan Walk-Away ® system. Experimental results showed antimicrobials such as cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, tetracycline, and tobramyci...|$|R

So I took a boat, in the black of night, when the lookout dozed on the fo'c'slehead, and went alone to the warm, long land. And I journeyed south to meet the men by Yeddo Bay, who are wild and unafraid.

The present work was designed to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of K. pneumoniae.
