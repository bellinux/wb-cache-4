A basic problem, occuring {{notably in the}} analysis of securities markets, is to decide whether there is a probability measure Q on F equivalent toP such that (<b>St)</b> <b>t</b> 2 I is a martingale with respect to Q. It is known since the fundamental papers of Harrison-Kreps (79), Harrison-Pliska(81) and Kreps(81) that there is an intimate relation of this problem with the notions of "no arbitrage" and "no free lunch" in financial economics. We introduce the intermediate concept of "no free lunch with bounded risk". This is a somewhat more precise version of the notion of "no free lunch": It requires that there should be an absolute bound of the maximal loss occuring in the trading strategies considered in the definition of "no free lunch". We shall give an argument why the condition of "no free lunch with bounded risk " should be satisfied by a reasonable model of the price process (<b>St)</b> <b>t</b> 2 I of a securities market. We can establish the equivalence of the condition of "no free lunch with bounded risk " with the existence of an equivalent martingale measure in the case when the index set I is discrete but (possibly) infinite. A similar theorem was recently obtained by Delbaen (92) for the case of continuous time processes with continuous paths. We can combine these two theorems to get a similar result for the continuous time case when the process (<b>St)</b> <b>t</b> 2 IR + is bounded and | roughly speaking | the jumps occur at predictable times...|$|E

Also, in many applications of semigroup theory to concrete evolution equations like transport equations (e. g. [17] or [3]) or population equations (e. g.

Introduction In 1959, H. F. Trotter [9] proved the following theorem. Theorem 1. Suppose that (T (t)) t 0 and (<b>S(t))</b> <b>t</b> 0 are strongly continuous contraction semigroups on a Banach space E with generators (A; D(A)) and (B; D(B)), respectively. If the closure of A + B generates a strongly continuous semigroup (U(t)) t 0, then the generated semigroup is given by the product formula U(t) f = lim n! 1 T (t n) S(t n) n f (1) for all f 2 E and uniformly for t in compact intervals. In 1974, more general product formulas were considered by P. R. Cherno [1, Chap. 1, 2]. Following his approach one can prove the theorem below (cf. [2, Chap. III. 5]). Theorem 2.
