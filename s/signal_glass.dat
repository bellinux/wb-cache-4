40|$|Microarray {{analysis}} is a critically important technology for genome-enabled biology, {{therefore it is}} essential that the data obtained be reliable. Current software and normalization techniques for microarray analysis rely on the assumption that fluorescent background within spots is essentially the same throughout the glass slide and can be measured by fluorescence surrounding the spots. This assumption is not valid if background fluorescence is spot-localized. Inaccurate estimates of background fluorescence under the spot create a source of error, especially for low expressed genes. We have identified spot-localized, contaminating fluorescence in the Cy 3 channel on several commercial and in-house printed microarray slides. We determined through mock hybridizations (without labeled target) that pre-hybridization scans could not be used to predict the contribution of this contaminating fluorescence after hybridization because the change in spot-to-spot fluorescence after hybridization was too variable. Two solutions to this problem were identified. First, allowing 4 h of exposure to air prior to printing on to Corning UltraGAPS slides significantly reduced contaminating fluorescence intensities to approximately the value of the surrounding glass. Alternatively, application of a novel, hyperspectral imaging scanner and multivariate curve resolution algorithms, allowed the spectral contributions of Cy 3 <b>signal,</b> <b>glass,</b> and contaminating fluorescence to be distinguished and quantified after hybridization...|$|E

Demonstrators show how light can be used for communication, how glass can accurately carry light <b>signals,</b> what <b>glass</b> composition will carry light signals most clearly, and how optical fiber provides us with the massive amounts of bandwidth necessary for today’s world. The presentation begins with a discussion of how man has been using light to communicate for centuries.

In the mid-1800s, Daniel Colladon, a Swiss scientist, explained how total internal reflection allowed light to be directed along a very specific path with lively visible demonstrations that showed light following the path of a stream of falling water. Total internal reflection traps the light in the stream, and traps it the same way in a glass fiber.|$|R

This is done without resorting {{to any kind of}} extrapolation, i. e., T_K(c) is indeed an equilibrium property of the system. We also measure the distribution function of the overlap, i. e., the order parameter that <b>signals</b> the <b>glass</b> state. We find that the transition line obtained from the overlap coincides with that obtained from the thermodynamic integration, thus showing that the two approaches give the same transition line. Finally we determine the geometrical properties of the potential energy landscape, notably the T-and c-dependence of the saddle index and use these properties to obtain the dynamic transition temperature T_d(c). The two temperatures T_K(c) and T_d(c) cross at a finite value of c and indicate {{the point at which the}} glass transition line ends.

40|$|Ultrasonic NDE {{has been}} a well known {{approach}} to investigate materials microstructures, mechanical properties and structure integrity in industry. The internal structure of a material and position of anomalies can be recognised by the reactions of different materials to ultrasound. However, the interpretation of ultrasound signals is difficult in composite material inspection task {{due to the fact}} that the ultrasonic pulse is reflected not only by the defect occurred within the material but the microstructures and multiple lay ups of the material. This phenomenon causes the backscattering noise to hinder the real defects signal during the inspection. Backscattering noise exists in multiple frequencies. The objective of this study was to develop a new noise reduction method to enhance the defect detectability in coarse-grained structure material such as composites materials. This method increases Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR) by means of decomposing the original signal into multiresolution representations. To prevent the loss of information, the signal is processed in both temporal and frequency domain.

The beacon consisted of a fluorophore-labeled aptamer strand hybridized with a shorter, quencher-carrying complementary strand. Cytokine molecules were expected to displace quenching strands of the beacon, disrupting FRET effect and resulting in fluorescence <b>signal.</b> The <b>glass</b> substrate was first micropatterned with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel microwells (35 lm diameter individual wells) so as to define sites for attachment of beacon molecules.

Subsequent incubation with quencher-carrying complementary strands resulted in formation of DNA duplex and caused quenching of fluorescence due to FRET effect. When exposed to IFN-c, microwells changed fluorescence from low (quencher hybridized with fluorophore-carrying strand) to high (quenching strand displaced by cytokine molecules). The fluorescence signal was confined to microwells, was changing in real-time and was dependent on the concentration of IFN-c.

40|$|AbstractRecently, we {{described}} {{a method to}} quantify {{the time course of}} total transmembrane current (Im) and the relative role of its two components, a capacitive current (Ic) and a resistive current (Iion), corresponding to the cardiac action potential during stable propagation. That approach involved recording high-fidelity (200 kHz) transmembrane potential (Vm) <b>signals</b> with <b>glass</b> microelectrodes at one site using a spatiotemporal coordinate transformation via measured conduction velocity. Here we extend our method to compute these transmembrane currents during stable and unstable propagation from fluorescence signals of Vm at thousands of sites (3 kHz), thereby introducing transmembrane current imaging. In contrast to commonly used linear Laplacians of extracellular potential (Ve) to compute Im, we utilized nonlinear image processing to compute the required second spatial derivatives of Vm. We quantified the dynamic spatial patterns of current density of Im and Iion for both depolarization and repolarization during pacing (including nonplanar patterns) by calibrating data with the microelectrode signals. Compared to planar propagation, we found that the magnitude of Iion was significantly reduced at sites of wave collision during depolarization but not repolarization. Finally, we present uncalibrated dynamic patterns of Im during ventricular fibrillation and show that Im at singularity sites was monophasic and positive with a significant nonzero charge (Im integrated over 10  ms) in contrast with nonsingularity sites. Our approach should greatly enhance the understanding of the relative roles of functional (e. g., rate-dependent membrane dynamics and propagation patterns) and static spatial heterogeneities (e. g., spatial differences in tissue resistance) via recordings during normal and compromised propagation, including arrhythmias...|$|R
