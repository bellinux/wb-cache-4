5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end <b>segregation</b> <b>in</b> public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. <b>Segregation</b> <b>in</b> the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{segregation}} {{between blacks}} and whites persists in urban America. However; evidence from the 1990 Census suggests that peak segregation levels were reached in the past. We evaluate <b>segregation</b> patterns <b>in</b> 1990 and trends <b>in</b> <b>segregation</b> between 1980 and 1990 for the 232 U. S. metropolitan areas with substantial black populations. We review the historical forces that intensified segregation for much of the twentieth century, and identify key developments after 1960 that challenged institutionalized segregation. The results suggest that the modest declines <b>in</b> <b>segregation</b> observed during the 1970 s continued through the 1980 s. While <b>segregation</b> decreased <b>in</b> most metropolitan areas, the magnitude of these changes was uneven. Testing hypotheses developed from an ecological model, we find that the lowest <b>segregation</b> levels <b>in</b> 1990 and the largest percentage decreases <b>in</b> <b>segregation</b> scores between 1980 and 1990 occurred in young, southern and western metropolitan areas with significant recent housing construction. Because the black population continues to migrate to such areas, residential segregation {{between blacks and}} whites should decline further; but remain well above that for Hispanics or Asians...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen {{sensitive}} {{cell lines}} of U. maydis were crossed with three killer strains and sample progenies were screened for killer segregation patterns.

Many of the killers were unstable on further culture. Killer suppression showed varying degrees of specificity, appeared to be cytoplasmically determined {{for at least one}} strain, and was associated with possession of dsRNA in this strain and one other. No dsRNA was detected in two other suppressive strains. There was no evidence for segregation of nuclear maintainer genes for any of the killer determinants...|$|R

The primary objective {{of this research is}} to develop a model that captures the logistical costs of increased grain <b>segregations</b> <b>in</b> the marketing system. A simulation model was developed to add logistical uncertainty in demand, receipts, rail deliveries, and transit time. Sensitivities were conducted on certain variables to determine their effects on logistical costs. Logistical costs increase as more <b>segregations</b> are added. <b>In</b> addition, increasing uncertainty into the system raises logistical costs.

5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended <b>segregation</b> <b>in</b> interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the end of}} the sit-in {{campaign}} {{brought a}} brief respite for civil rights activists in Nashville, institutionalized racism remained a problem throughout the city. Over the next few years, further sit-ins, pickets, and other actions would take place at restaurants, movie theaters, public swimming pools, and other segregated facilities across Nashville. These actions continued until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited <b>segregation</b> <b>in</b> public places throughout the United States. In that year, many of the key figures of the sit-ins, including James Lawson and Kelly Miller Smith, were interviewed by Robert Penn Warren for his book Who Speaks for the Negro?, in which they reflected on their experiences.|$|E

Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country. Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end <b>segregation</b> <b>in</b> public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C, a series of sit-ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests.|$|E

However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit <b>segregation</b> <b>in</b> schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E
