40|$|OBJECTIVE: Existing {{criteria}} for the classification of gout have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, and were developed {{at a time when}} advanced imaging was not available. The current effort was undertaken to develop new classification {{criteria for}} gout. METHODS: An international group of investigators, supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, conducted a systematic review of the literature on advanced imaging of gout, a diagnostic study in which the presence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus was the gold standard, a ranking exercise of paper patient cases, and a multicriterion decision analysis exercise. These data formed the basis for developing the classification criteria, which were tested in an independent data set. RESULTS: The entry criterion for the new classification criteria requires the occurrence of at least 1 episode of peripheral joint or bursal swelling, pain, or tenderness. The presence of MSU crystals in a symptomatic joint/bursa (i. e., synovial fluid) or in a tophus is a sufficient criterion for classification of the subject as having gout, and does not require further scoring. The domains of the new classification criteria include clinical (pattern of joint/bursa involvement, characteristics and time course of symptomatic episodes), laboratory (serum urate, MSU-negative <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirate),</b> and imaging (double-contour sign on ultrasound or urate on dual-energy computed tomography, radiographic gout-related erosion).

These prostaglandin derivatives were also measured in serum samples collected from 42  healthy control subjects.  RESULTS—Overall, serum levels of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α and 15 -keto-dihydro-PGF 2 α were much higher in patients with arthritic diseases than in the healthy control subjects. The levels of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α and 15 -keto-dihydro-PGF 2 α in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirated</b> from knee joints were also high and varied among various types of arthritic patients. Although the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> level of these prostaglandin derivatives was sometimes {{higher than in the}} corresponding serum sample, this was not a consistent finding. Overall, there was no correlation between serum and <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> levels of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, or between serum and <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> levels of 15 -keto-dihydro-PGF 2 α.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{understand}} aggrecan degradation {{in juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the pattern and abundance of aggrecan fragments in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirates</b> from JIA patients were analysed and compared with aggrecan fragments in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients with other arthritides, juvenile knee injury and a knee-healthy reference group. METHODS: The concentration of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> {{was measured by the}} Alcian blue precipitation assay. Aggrecan fragments were purified by dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation, deglycosylated and analysed by Western blot using antibodies specific for either aggrecanase-derived ARGS, SELE and KEEE neoepitopes, or the aggrecan G 3 -domain. RESULTS: The concentration of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in JIA <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> was significantly lower compared with the levels in fluids from OA (P< 0. 001), juvenile knee injury (P= 0. 006) and knee-healthy reference (P= 0. 022) groups. Western blot analysis detected KEEE, SELE, and G 3 fragments generated by aggrecanase cleavage in the chondroitin sulphate-rich region of JIA aggrecan. The pattern of JIA aggrecan fragments was not identical to that in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> pooled from OA patients, although there were notable similarities. Surprisingly, aggrecanase-derived ARGS fragments were barely detectable in the JIA <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids,</b> in marked contrast to the levels of ARGS fragments in OA <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Aggrecanases appear to cleave minimally in the interglobular domain of aggrecan in JIA patients despite robust levels of cleavage in aggrecan's chondroitin-sulphate rich region.

Similar to most other mammalian collagenases this synovial enzyme is readily inhibited by serum proteins. Proteins of <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> are derived largely from serum and <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> from noninflamed joints was found to inhibit synovial collagenase; the inhibitor was destroyed by trypsin, but not by hyaluronidase. Inhibitory activity was reduced in approximately one-half of the fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a total of nine <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids,</b> collagenolytic activity was detectable. This activity was not present in constant amounts in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> <b>aspirated</b> at different times from the same patient and tended to vary inversely with the titer of inhibitory proteins.

Disc electrophoresis on acrylamide gels and electron microscopy of segment long spacing (SLS) aggregates of reaction products of the enzymes at 27 °C demonstrated that both “A” and “B” enzymes cleaved collagen molecules at a point three-quarters from the amino terminal end of the molecule.

We undertook the present study to identify immune and stromal processes that are present soon after the clinical onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by assessing a panel of T cell, macrophage, and stromal cell related cytokines and chemokines in the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> of patients with early synovitis. <b>Synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> was <b>aspirated</b> from inflamed joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis of duration 3 months or less, whose outcomes were subsequently determined by follow up. For comparison, <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> was <b>aspirated</b> from patients with acute crystal arthritis, established RA and osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid factor activity was blocked in the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> samples, and a panel of 23 cytokines and chemokines measured using a multiplex based system. Patients with early inflammatory arthritis who subsequently developed RA had a distinct but transient <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokine profile. The levels {{of a range of}} T cell, macrophage and stromal cell related cytokines (e. g.

In addition, this profile was no longer present in established RA. In contrast, patients with non-rheumatoid persistent synovitis exhibited elevated levels of interferon-γ at initiation. Early synovitis destined to develop into RA is thus characterized by a distinct and transient <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokine profile.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{intra-articular}} pressure (IAP) rises significantly after isometric quadriceps contraction {{in patients}} with rheumatoid synovitis, a process that may temporarily impede synovial blood flow and cause oxidative injury. In acute traumatic knee effusions (ATE) pressure rises are trivial. This study compared the IAP profiles of patients with ATE with three different populations—an acute synovitis on the background of a chronic inflammatory arthropathy, a chronic low grade inflammatory arthropathy, and an acute intermittent inflammatory arthropathy. The study objective was to discover if the pressure profiles observed in these groups reflect an influence of the inflammatory process or time or both.  METHODS—Thirty three patients were studied. These were divided into four subgroups; group 1 : five acute traumatic knee effusions (ATE); group 2 : acute effusions on the background of a chronic inflammatory arthropathy: seven rheumatoid arthritis (RA), five psoriatic arthritis (PsA); group 3 : seven osteoarthritis (OA) and group 4 : acute effusions on the background of an intermittent inflammatory arthropathy: seven pyrophosphate arthropathy (PA), one amyloid (AA), one Behcet's (B). IAP was measured (mm Hg) at rest and during isometric quadriceps contraction using the hand held portable 295 - 1  intra-compartmental pressure monitor system (Stryker UK). The volume of <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirated</b> was recorded.  RESULTS—Expressed as medians (interquartile range). Resting IAP was; ATE 6  (2 - 12), RA 8  (5 - 47), PsA 18  (11 - 31), OA 17  (7 - 21), PA 25  (9 - 29), AA 14, and B 12.  IAP increased in all subjects during isometric contraction; ATE 9  (7 - 16), RA 56  (33 - 150), PsA 52  (43 - 85), OA 56  (20 - 116), PA 53  (41 - 65), AA 47, B 57  and the IAP rise was significant (p 0. 05). The volume of <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirated</b> in groups 2,  3, and 4  correlated significantly with {{the magnitude of the}} IAP change (r =  0. 45, p <  0. 05).  CONCLUSION—The IAP rise during isometric quadriceps contraction is a feature of all patients with an inflammatory based effusion irrespective of the duration of the effusion. This is not the case {{in patients with}} an ATE. In inflammatory synovitis the rise in intra-articular pressure with isometric quadriceps contraction relates to effusion volume. It is concluded that the inflammatory process prevents reflex muscle inhibition, a locally protective mechanism that minimises the potential for intermittent ischaemia/oxidative injury. ...|$|R

The hypothesis tested {{in this study is}} that the spectra contain sufficient information to serve as an aid in the diagnosis and/or staging of arthritic disorders. The concentrations of all major constituents are carried implicitly in the spectra, and in this sense this approach is similar in spirit to conventional <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> analysis. The distinguishing feature of this method is that we have not converted the raw data (spectra) explicitly to analytical information. Rather, we have used automated pattern recognition methods to identify significant characteristics of the spectra themselves. A total of 109 spectra were measured and split into three classes according to the disease (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or spondyloarthropathy) affecting the patient from whom the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> sample was taken. An automated classification method was then trained by correlating features derived from these spectra to the clinical diagnoses. The robustness of the classification was validated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method, i. e., by training on {{all but one of the}} spectra and using the resulting model to predict the classification for the spectrum that is left out. The result derived by following this procedure for each of the spectra was that 105 of the 109 predicted classifications correctly matched the clinical diagnosis.

The patient's arthritis improved with high-dose intravenous penicillin. Identification of B. burgdorferi from the joint fluid of a patient with long-standing arthritis supports the concept that the arthritis is due to persistent infection. IN APPROXIMATELY 10 % of patients with Lyme arthri-tis, the arthritis may become chronic, with erosion of cartilage and bone {{and the development of}} pannus forma-tion (1, 2). Although the etiology of Lyme disease is firmly linked to a newly named Borrelia species, Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by the tick vector Ixodes dam-mini (3, 4), our understanding of the pathogenesis of the development of chronic arthritis continues to evolve (5). The most plausible hypotheses are that infection with B. burgdorferi may persist in the tissue or lead to an inflam-matory response that damages host tissues. In support of the former hypothesis is the demonstration of spirochetes in the synovium of patients with Lyme arthritis using a Dieterle stain (6); furthermore, high-dose parenteral penicillin has cured over half of the patients with arthritis (7).

In contrast to our recent observations concerning monocytes, there was no change in COX- 2 message stability and cytosolic phospholipase A 2 activity in the FLS under hypoxia. Treatment of monocyte conditioned medium with an IL- 1 blocking antibody showed that most of the effect of the conditioned medium was attributable to IL- 1. Conclusion: The findings suggest that hypoxia is an important factor in aggravating the inflammatory lesion in RA, through increased production of COX- 2 -derived nociceptive eicosanoids and increased release of tissue-damaging MMPs.

40|$|Objective. To {{identify}} biomarkers in {{the first}} <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> (SF) <b>aspirate</b> obtained from children with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), {{which could be used}} to identify children whose disease is likely to extend to a more severe phenotype. Methods. Patients with recent-onset oligoarticular JIA were identified and grouped according to those whose mild disease persisted (persistent disease) or those whose disease would extend from a mild to more severe phenotype (extended-to-be disease) at 1 year after diagnosis. Flow cytometry was used to delineate differences in the mononuclear cell populations between the first blood sample and first SF aspirate from the same patient and between outcome (persistent versus extended-to-be) groups.

40|$|A {{young male}} {{immigrant}} from Syria with a vasculitic-appearing leg rash, asymmetrical polyarthritis, microscopic haematuria, and raised inflammatory markers was provisionally diagnosed with Henoch– Schönlein purpura. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Low-grade fevers persisted despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy, and Brucella sp. was subsequently grown from both blood and <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirates.</b> Further tests gave positive results for B. abortus, and triple antibiotic therapy produced a rapid clinical response. Cutaneous vasculitis {{has rarely been}} described in brucellosis, {{and this is the}} first report in the English medical literature of brucellosis mimicking Henoch–Schönlein purpura. (MJA 2007; 186 : 602 - 603) Clinical record A 22 -year-old man presented with arthralgia, fevers, weight loss and a leg rash. His medical history was unremarkable, and he was taking no medications. He had emigrated from Syria 2 months before to be with his family in Australia. He had been sexually active before emigration, but did not describe any illness consistent with a sexually transmitted disease. One month before presentation, the patient had left elbow pain and swelling, with subsequent involvement of the left knee, right ankle and foot. One week later, he developed a dry cough and night sweats. The non-pruritic leg rash started 1 week before presentation, ascending gradually to his knees. He had lost 8 kg in weight over the preceding weeks. Blood tests performed 2 weeks before admission showed: C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 18 mg/L (referenc...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} by {{high frequency}} ultrasonography {{the appearance of}} calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) calcifications, in the most commonly affected sites in CPPD disease, {{and the relationship between}} ultrasonographic CPPD deposits and the presence of CPPD crystals in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid.</b> METHODS: Three ultrasonographic patterns of CPPD calcification were identified and 11 patients enrolled. A control group comprised 13 patients with no evidence of CPPD deposits. <b>Synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> was <b>aspirated</b> from all patients and controls and examined for identification of crystals. All patients underwent a standard radiography examination at the same sites investigated by ultrasound. RESULTS: In all patients with ultrasonographically defined CPPD deposits, CPPD crystals were found in the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid.</b> In two cases, standard radiographic examination did not show evidence of the calcific deposits that were identified by ultrasonography. CPPD crystals were not found in the <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> of controls. In four control group patients, ultrasonography identified calcifications defined as deposits of another nature. CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasonographic pattern used in this study for the diagnosis of CPPD disease demonstrated a very high correlation with the presence of CPPD crystals in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid.</b> Ultrasonography demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity at least equal to that of radiography in identifying CPPD crystal calcifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this study were based on the quantative {{analysis}} of mucosaccharide and vitamin C of <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>aspirated</b> from several different diseases of 99 human knee joints of 83 cases, and which were compared with those of 5 normal cases. Mucosaccharide was analysed by mean of the target of hexosamin- - -fraction I from hyaluronic acid by acetic acid, fraction H from glycoprotein by trichloracetic acid and fraction III from supernate. Elson Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s and Roe-Terauchi 2 ̆ 7 s techniques were employed for quantative analysis of mucosaccharide and vitamin C respectively. 1. Fraction I [...] Hyaluronic acid; Decrease of this fraction is observed in the fluid of rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculous arthritis, and especially in traumatic arthritis. 2. Fraction II. [...] Glycoprotein; Comparing with normal cases there is an increase in amount of this fraction in the fluid of affected knee joints; rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculous arthritis. Rise and fall of serum glycoprotein is parallel with those in <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid,</b> which is considered due to the permiability of synovial membrane that has close relation with the degree of inflammatory changes of knee joints. 3. Fraction III [...] Mucoolygosaccharide; There an increase of this fraction in affected knee joints, especially much increase is observed, in rhematoid arthritis. Because of fraction HI increases by depolymerization of hyaluronic acid with hyaluronidase, and decreases by polymerization of hyaluronic acid with cortison, this fraction is composed of the low polymerized molecules. 4. Total hexosamin; Decrease of hexosamin is observed in affected joints, especially in traumatic arthritis, but this does not vary each other in several diseases. 5. Vitamin C; Total amount of vitamin C reflects the pathological condition of joints, and increase of the difference of vitamin C between <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> and serum is little in affected joints in contrast to normal cases. Study of mucosacchride and vitamin C is worth mentioning to determine the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease of the joints...|$|R
40|$|Proteoglycan {{levels were}} {{measured}} {{in a series}} of <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> samples from patients with acute and chronic joint diseases using a modified chemical dye binding method. Levels found in 50 miscellaneous inflammatory arthritis fluids (mean = 173. 2 ± 90. 9 ug/ml) were higher than found in either 50 with rheumatoid arthritis (96. 3 ± 31. 3 ug/ml) or 50 with osteo-arthritis (83. 8 ± 27. 3 u. g/ml). For comparison, proteoglycan levels were measured in 15 cadaver <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> (98. 9 ± 44. 2 (ig/ml) and 12 <b>synovial</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients with sports injury (163. 7179. 4 ug/ml). Patients were recruited into a trial where <b>synovial</b> <b>fluid</b> was <b>aspirated</b> as often as possible over a 6 -month period during which the patients were followed using a number of well proven clinical parameters. No correlation was found between the degree of joint destruction as measured by X-ray damage and the concentration or total amount of proteoglycan in the syn-ovial fluid. In addition, there was no correlation between the level or total amount of proteoglycan and any clinical para-meter of disease activity.
