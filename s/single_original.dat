5|$|The Angel of Death was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital, {{as opposed}} to the other games in the Broken Sword series, which had Revolution as the sole game developer. Cecil {{believed}} that because of the requirement for ever larger development team sizes, it was no longer possible to maintain a large team to write <b>single,</b> <b>original</b> titles. As a result, Revolution concentrated on design, while Sumo concentrated on production. The game uses Sumo's Emmersion engine. It is the first game ever to be amBX enabled.|$|E
5|$|A single light novel {{written by}} Mako Komao and {{illustrated}} by the manga's artist was published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint in January 2006. The manga series was adapted into a twelve-episode anime television series plus a <b>single</b> <b>original</b> video animation (OVA) sequel by Studio Hibari. The anime aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between January and March 2006; the OVA was released in October 2006. A visual novel was created based on the series for the PlayStation 2 and was released in March 2006. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008. Media Blasters licensed the anime series, including the OVA, and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles. Media Blasters re-released the anime with an English dub.|$|E

The anime contained twelve episodes which aired between October 6 and December 24, 2006 on several UHF networks including TV Kanagawa and Chiba TV. The episodes were released on four DVD compilations released in Japan as limited and regular editions. A <b>single</b> <b>original</b> video animation (OVA) episode was released on the final limited edition DVD on April 4, 2007. Media Blasters released the series, including the OVA, as English-subtitled DVDs between June 24 and October 7, 2008 under the title Otoboku: Maidens Are Falling For Me!.|$|E

5|$|The L134/L183 {{is a dark}} nebula complex that, {{along with}} a third cloud, is likely formed by {{fragments}} of a <b>single</b> <b>original</b> cloud located 36 degrees away from the galactic plane, a large distance for dark nebulae. The entire complex {{is thought to be}} around 140 parsecs distant. L183, also referred to as L134N, is home to several infrared sources, indicating pre-stellar sources thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and prestellar cores. The core is split into three regions, with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{gene family}} (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} similar or identical functions) arises by duplication of a <b>single</b> <b>original</b> gene, {{this is usually}} {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.|$|E
25|$|Common ancestry between organisms of {{different}} species arises during speciation, in which new species are established {{from a single}} ancestral population. Organisms which share a more recent common ancestor are more closely related. The most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms is the last universal ancestor, which lived about 3.9 billion years ago. The two earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. All currently living organisms on Earth share a common genetic heritage (universal common descent), with each being the descendant from a <b>single</b> <b>original</b> species, though the suggestion of substantial horizontal gene transfer during early evolution has led to questions about monophyly of life.|$|E

500|$|Revolution Software and THQ {{announced}} Broken Sword: The Angel of Death on August 17, 2005. According to Charles Cecil, the Broken Sword {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} a trilogy, but that {{after the release of}} Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, the demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming. Though The Sleeping Dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as PC, this approach required certain development compromises as the PC version was held back by the constraints of the console versions. As a result, The Angel of Death was written for PC only [...] "so as to really push the boundaries in terms of the technology and graphics." [...] As a series' first, Revolution was not the only developer, but was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital. Cecil believed that because of the requirement for ever larger team sizes, it was no longer possible to maintain a large development team to write <b>single</b> <b>original</b> titles, resulting in Revolution closed the production side in order to concentrate on design, and Sumo to concentrate on production. It is the first game to be amBX enabled. Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon was criticised for featuring a high number of action elements. Cecil stated that he aimed to put the player under pressure. While he still stood behind this principle, he thought the action elements were not the right approach. The Sleeping Dragon was also criticised for using a high number of crate puzzles, resulting in Cecil reducing the number of them. The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough and features tracks by Übernoise. While Rolf Saxon returns to voice George Stobbart, Nicole [...] "Nico" [...] Collard was this time played by Katherine Pageon.|$|E

"It was a screenwriting {{assignment}} {{unlike any}} other that my writing partner, William Rabkin, and I had ever been involved with," [...] wrote screenwriter Lee Goldberg, who adapted four Stout stories for the series.

2500|$|Subsequent {{excavations}} by Grimes in 1957 re-interpreted {{this feature}} {{to be an}} earlier Iron Age enclosure dating to approximately 250 BC, with Iron Age pottery found within the primary fill. It was therefore speculated that the visible interruptions {{have been made by}} post Medieval ploughing. Faint traces of a remnant bank survive along the north and west sections, and an adjoining ditch has a causewayed nature, and survives in short segments varying between [...] in length. There is also evidence of a <b>single</b> <b>original</b> west facing entrance currently discernible as a [...] wide gap in the enclosure boundary. The straight southeastern side of the enclosure is formed by a ditch that is truncated by the main hillfort boundary, and this again has been interpreted as further evidence that the linear ditch and contiguous enclosure pre-date the main hillfort.|$|E
2500|$|The French medievalist Joseph Bédier {{thought all}} the Tristan legends could {{be traced to}} a <b>single</b> <b>{{original}}</b> poem, adapted by Thomas of Brittany into French from an original Cornish or Breton source. He dubbed this hypothetical original the [...] "Ur-Tristan", and wrote his still-popular Romance of Tristan and Iseult {{as an attempt to}} reconstruct what this might have been like. In all likelihood, Common Branch versions reflect an earlier form of the story; accordingly, Bédier relied heavily on Eilhart, Béroul and Gottfried von Strassburg, and incorporated material from other versions to make a cohesive whole. Some scholars still consider Bédier's argument convincing. A new English translation of Bédier's Roman de Tristan et Iseut (1900) by Edward J. Gallagher was published in 2013 by Hackett Publishing Company. A translation by Hilaire Belloc, first published in 1913, was republished in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (literally {{translated}} {{and roughly}} known as [...] "the Yellow Woodpecker Farm" [...] or [...] "the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch") {{is the title}} given {{to a series of}} 23 fantasy novels written by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and as the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. Lobato's <b>single</b> <b>original</b> adult fiction, a sci-fi novel entitled O Presidente Negro ("The Black President") set in the far future, would not achieve the same popularity of Sítio. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 novel A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado, and was later republished as the first chapter of Reinações de Narizinho, which is the first novel of the actual Sítio series. The main setting is Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, where a boy, a girl and their living and thinking toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. [...] On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as the Clear Waters Kingdom, and outer space. Sítio is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato's most famous creation alongside Jeca Tatu.|$|E
