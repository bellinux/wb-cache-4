In that respect, this study shows that reactive transport modelling is a useful tool to extrapolate laboratory results to site conditions characterized by lower solution/solid (L/S) ratios, site specific geometry, infiltration, etc. A cement solidified/ stabilized (S/S) waste containing lead is investigated as a typical example. The reactive transport model developed in a previous study to simulate the initial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> as well as laboratory batch and dynamic tests is first summarized.

40|$|Marginal soils, {{including}} loose sands, soft clays, and organics are {{not adequate}} materials for construction projects. These marginal soils {{do not possess}} valuable physical properties for construction applications. The current methods for remediation of these weak soils such as stone columns, vibro-compaction, etc. are typically expensive. Waste materials such as scrap tires, ash, and wastewater sludge, offer a cheaper method for stabilizing marginal soils. As an added benefit, utilizing waste materials in soil stabilization applications keeps these materials from being dumped into landfills, thereby saving already depleting landfill space.
