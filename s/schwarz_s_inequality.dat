40|$|Functional {{observer}} {{design for}} Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with multiple mixed time {{delays in the}} states of the system is addressed. Two structures for the design of a minimum-order observer are considered: 1 - delay-dependent, and 2 - internal-delay independent. The parameters of the delay-dependent observer are designed using the Lyapunov Krasovskii approach. The delay-dependent exponential stability of the observer for a specified convergence rate and delay values is guaranteed upon the feasibility of a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) together with a rank condition. Using the descriptor transformation, a modified Jensen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>inequality,</b> and improved Park 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>inequality,</b> the results can be less conservative than the available functional observer design methods that address LTI systems with single state delay. Furthermore, the necessary and sufficient conditions of the asymptotic stability of the internal-delay independent observer are obtained, which are shown to be independent of delay. Two illustrative numerical examples and simulation studies confirm the validity and highlight the performance of the proposed theoretical achievements...|$|R

By the use of Laplace Convolution Theorem, some monotonicity results related to digamma function psi and its derivatives of order n are obtained.

40|$|Based on {{the recent}} successes in {{stochastic}} linear programming and mixed integer programming, in this thesis we combine these two important areas of mathematical programming; specifically we study stochastic integer programming. We first study a simple and important stochastic integer programming problem, called stochastic uncapacitated lot-sizing (SLS), which is motivated by production planning under uncertainty. We describe a multi-stage stochastic integer programming formulation {{of the problem and}} develop a family of valid inequalities, called the (Q, <b>S)</b> <b>inequalities.</b> We establish facet-defining conditions and show that these inequalities are sufficient to describe the convex hull of integral solutions for two-period instances. A separation heuristic for (Q, <b>S)</b> <b>inequalities</b> is developed and incorporated into a branch-and-cut algorithm. A computational study verifies the usefulness of the inequalities as cuts. Then, motivated by the polyhedral study of (Q, <b>S)</b> <b>inequalities</b> for SLS, we analyze the underlying integer programming scheme for general stochastic integer programming problems. We present a scheme for generating new valid inequalities for mixed integer programs by taking pair-wise combinations of existing valid inequalities. The scheme is in general sequence-dependent and therefore leads to an exponential number of inequalities. For some special cases, we identify combination sequences that lead to a manageable set of all non-dominated inequalities. For the general scenario tree case, we identify combination sequences that lead to non-dominated inequalities. We also analyze the conditions such that the inequalities generated by our approach are facet-defining and describe the convex hull of integral solutions. We illustrate the framework for some deterministic and stochastic integer programs and we present computational results which show the efficiency of adding the new generated inequalities as cuts. Ph.

40|$|The year 2008 {{marked the}} 30 th anniversary of China 2 ̆ 7 s {{beginning}} on its path of economic transformation. During {{the past three}} decades, a series of reform policies {{have been carried out}} to liberalize the economy and attract foreign investments. Rapid economic growth is accompanied by rising inequality. The Gini Coefficient of China increased from 0. 23 in 1980 to 0. 47 in 2005, according to official statistics (NBS). This disequalizing trend coincides with the initial stage of the debated Kuznets curve in which inequality of income distribution first increases during urbanization because of the difference between returns to industries and agriculture; then decreases {{as a result of the}} spill-over effect of macroeconomic growth. Question remains whether China 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>inequality</b> has reached the top of the U-curve and started the down-sloping trend of inequality or has yet to experience more acute inequality.
