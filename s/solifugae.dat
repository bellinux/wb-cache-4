25|$|Although the <b>Solifugae</b> are {{considered}} to be endemic indicators of desert biomes, they occur widely in semidesert and scrub. Some species also live in grassland or forest habitats. <b>Solifugae</b> generally inhabit warm and arid habitats, including virtually all warm deserts and scrublands in all continents except Antarctica and Australia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solifugae</b> is a {{group of}} 900 species of arachnids, {{commonly}} known as camel spiders, wind scorpions, and sun spiders. The name derives from Latin, and means those that flee from the sun. Most <b>Solifugae</b> live in tropical or semitropical regions where they inhabit warm and arid habitats, but some species have been known to live in grassland or forest habitats. The most distinctive feature of <b>Solifugae</b> is their large chelicerae. Each of the two chelicerae are composed of two articles forming a powerful pincer; each article bears a variable number of teeth. Males in all families but Eremobatidae possess a flagellum on the basal article of the chelicera. <b>Solifugae</b> also have long pedipalps, which function as sense organs similar to insects' antennae and give the appearance of the two extra legs. Pedipalps terminate in reversible adhesive organs.|$|E
25|$|Various other predators, such as {{the large}} slit-faced bat, scorpions, toads, and insectivores, may prey on <b>Solifugae.</b>|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s they {{were thought to}} be closely related to mites (Acari). In 1990, Shultz {{proposed}} grouping them with scorpions, pseudoscorpions and <b>Solifugae</b> ("camel spiders"); he named this clade Dromopoda. This view is currently widely accepted. However, the relationships of the orders within Dromopoda are not yet sufficiently resolved. When only considering recent taxa, the harvestmen appear as a sister group to Novogenuata (Scorpions, Pseudoscorpions, <b>Solifugae).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Solifugae</b> are {{carnivorous}} or omnivorous, {{with most}} species feeding on termites, darkling beetles, {{and other small}} arthropods; however, <b>solifugae</b> have been videotaped consuming larger prey, such as lizards. Prey is located with the pedipalps and killed and cut into pieces by the chelicerae. The prey is then liquefied and the liquid ingested through the pharynx. Reproduction can involve direct or indirect sperm transfer; when indirect, the male emits a spermatophore {{on the ground and}} then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore.|$|E
25|$|Like pseudoscorpions and harvestmen, <b>Solifugae</b> lack book lungs, having {{instead a}} {{well-developed}} tracheal system that inhales and exhales air through {{three pairs of}} slits on the animal's underside.|$|E
25|$|When also {{considering}} fossils, the harvestmen are {{sister to}} Haplocnemata (Pseudoscorpions and <b>Solifugae).</b> Recent analyses have also recovered the Opiliones as sister-group to the extinct Phalangiotarbids, although this has low support.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solifugae</b> are {{typically}} univoltine. Reproduction can involve {{direct or indirect}} sperm transfer; when indirect, the male emits a spermatophore {{on the ground and}} then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore. To do this, he flings the female on her back.|$|E
25|$|Tetrapulmonata, here {{consisting}} of Araneae, Amblypygi and Thelyphonida (Schizomida {{was not included}} in the study), received strong support. The addition of Scorpiones to produce a clade called Arachnopulmonata was also well supported. Pseudoscorpiones may also belong here, possibly as the sister of Scorpiones. Somewhat unexpectedly, there was support for a clade comprising Opiliones, Ricinulei and <b>Solifugae,</b> a combination not found in most other studies.|$|E
25|$|Recent genetic {{research}} {{has caused a}} change in the naming scheme, however, and recent publications have changed the superorder Parasitiformes to an order. Other recent research has suggested that Acari is polyphyletic, with ticks and spiders being more closely related than ticks and mites. The cladogram is based on Dabert et al 2010, which used molecular data. It showed the Acariformes sister to the <b>Solifugae</b> (camel spiders), while the Parasitiformes were sister to the Pseudoscorpionida.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solifugae</b> are {{carnivorous}} or omnivorous, {{with most}} species feeding on termites, darkling beetles, and other small, ground-dwelling arthropods. Solifuges are aggressive hunters and voracious opportunistic feeders {{and have been}} recorded as feeding on snakes, small lizards, and rodents. Prey is located with the pedipalps and killed and cut into pieces by the chelicerae. The prey is then liquefied and the liquid ingested through the pharynx. Although they do not normally attack humans, their chelicerae can penetrate human skin, and painful bites have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} {{unfamiliar}} spider-like appearance and rapid movements, <b>Solifugae</b> have startled or even frightened many people. This fear {{was sufficient to}} drive a family from their home when one was discovered in a soldier's house in Colchester, England, and caused the family to blame the solifugid {{for the death of}} their pet dog. An Arizona resident developed painful lesions due to a claimed solifugid bite, but could not produce a specimen for confirmation. Though they are not venomous, the powerful chelicerae of a large specimen may inflict a painful nip, but nothing medically significant.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all adult}} arachnids have eight legs, and arachnids may be easily {{distinguished}} from insects by this fact, since insects have six legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages {{that have become}} adapted for feeding, defense, and sensory perception. The first pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair of appendages, the pedipalps, have been adapted for feeding, locomotion, and/or reproductive functions. In <b>Solifugae,</b> the palps are quite leg-like, so that these animals appear to have ten legs. The larvae of mites and Ricinulei have only six legs; a fourth pair usually appears when they moult into nymphs. However, mites are variable: as well as eight, there are adult mites with six or even four legs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Solifugae</b> {{apparently}} have neither venom glands nor any venom-delivery apparatus {{such as the}} fangs of spiders, stings of wasps, or venomous setae of caterpillars (e.g., Lonomia or Acharia species). One 1978 study is frequently quoted, in which the authors report detection of an exception to this rule in India, in that Rhagodes nigrocinctus had venom glands, and that injection of the secretion into mice was frequently fatal. However, no supporting studies have confirmed either {{the facts of the}} matter, such as by independent detection of the glands as claimed, or the relevance of the observations if correct. Even the authors of the original account denied having found any means of delivery of the putative venom by the animal, and the only means of administering the material to the mice was by parenteral injection. Given that many non-venoms such as saliva, blood and glandular secretions can be lethal if injected, and that no venomous function was even speculated upon in this study, there is no evidence as yet for even one venomous species of solifugid.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Solifugae</b> – solpugids, windscorpions, sun spiders or camel spiders (900 species) ...|$|E
2500|$|Like that of {{the spider}} order, the Araneae, the body plan of the <b>Solifugae</b> has two main tagmata: the prosoma, or cephalothorax, is the {{anterior}} tagma, and the 10-segmented abdomen, or opisthosoma, is the posterior tagma. As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or [...] "pedicel" [...] as occurs in [...] "true spiders", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between <b>Solifugae</b> and spiders, namely that Solifugids lack both spinnerets and silk, and do not spin webs. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the <b>Solifugae</b> have no need for any such adaptation.|$|E
2500|$|The first, or anterior, of {{the five}} pairs of leg-like {{appendages}} are not [...] "actual" [...] legs, but pedipalps and they have only five segments each. The pedipalps of <b>Solifugae</b> function partly as sense organs similar to insects' antennae, and partly in locomotion, feeding and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of <b>Solifugae</b> on their tactile senses, their anterior true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the posterior three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role {{as a supplement to}} the pedipalps, and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their pedipalps, <b>Solifugae</b> bear [...] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} <b>Solifugae</b> are their large chelicerae, which in many species are longer than the prosoma. Each of the two chelicerae has two [...] (segments, parts connected by a joint), forming a powerful pincer, much {{like that of a}} crab; each article bears a variable number of teeth, largely depending on the species. The chelicerae of many species are surprisingly strong; they are capable of shearing hair or feathers from vertebrate prey or carrion, and of cutting through skin and thin bones such as those of small birds. Many <b>Solifugae</b> stridulate with their chelicerae, producing a rattling noise.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Solifugae</b> is {{an order}} of animals in the class Arachnida known {{variously}} as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae) – though they are {{more closely related to}} scorpions than to spiders. Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a [...] "tail". Most species of <b>Solifugae</b> live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the <b>Solifugae,</b> and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Solifugae</b> are {{an order}} of their own, though are {{sometimes}} confused with spiders, which form a completely distinct order, the Araneae. The order comprises over 1000 described species in 153 genera assigned to the following 12 families: ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most other}} arachnids, {{although}} <b>Solifugae</b> {{appear to have}} five pairs of legs, only the hind four pairs actually are [...] "true" [...] legs. Each true leg has seven segments: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and tarsus.|$|E
2500|$|Solifugids {{have been}} {{recognised}} as distinct taxa from ancient times. The Greeks recognized {{that they were}} distinct from spiders; spiders were called [...] (arachne) while <b>Solifugae</b> were named [...] (phalangion). In Aelian's De natura animalium, they are mistakenly mentioned, along with scorpions, as responsible for the abandoning of a country in Ethiopia. Anton August Heinrich Lichtenstein theorised in 1797 that the [...] "mice" [...] which plagued the Philistines in the Old Testament were <b>Solifugae.</b> During World War I, troops [...] stationed in Abū Qīr, Egypt would stage fights between captive [...] "jerrymanders," [...] as they referred to them, and placed bets on the outcome. Similarly, British troops stationed in Libya in World War II would stage fights between solifugids and scorpions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name means}} [...] "split or cleaved middle", {{referring}} {{to the way the}} cephalothorax is divided into two separate plates. Like the Thelyphonida, Amblypygi, and <b>Solifugae,</b> the schizomids use only six legs for walking, having modified their first two legs to serve as sensory organs. They also have large well-developed pedipalps (pincers) just behind the sensory legs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Solifugae</b> are {{the subject}} of many legends and exaggerations about their size, speed, behaviour, appetite, and lethality. They are not {{especially}} large, the biggest having a leg span of about [...] They are fast on land compared to other invertebrates, with their top speed estimated to be , close to one-half as fast as the fastest human sprinter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, Pierre André Latreille erected {{the family}} [...] "Phalangida" [...] for the then known harvestmen, but {{included}} the genus Galeodes (<b>Solifugae).</b> Tord Tamerlan Teodor Thorell (1892) recognized the suborders Palpatores, Laniatores, Cyphophthalmi (called Anepignathi), but also included the Ricinulei as a harvestman suborder. The latter {{were removed from}} the Opiliones by Hansen and William Sørensen (1904), rendering the harvestmen monophyletic.|$|E
2500|$|The female then digs a burrow, {{into which}} she lays 50 to 200 eggs – some species then guard {{them until they}} hatch. Because the female does not feed during this time, she will try to fatten herself beforehand, and a species of [...] has been {{observed}} to eat more than 100 flies during {{that time in the}} laboratory. <b>Solifugae</b> undergo a number of stages including, egg, postembryo, 9–10 nymphal instars, and adults.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the most}} part, only the {{posterior}} {{three pairs of}} legs are used for running. On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, <b>Solifugae</b> have fan-shaped sensory organs called malleoli or racquet [...] (or racket) organs. Sometimes, the blades of the malleoli are directed forward, sometimes not. They have been suspected to be sensory organs {{for the detection of}} vibrations in the soil, perhaps to detect threats and potential prey or mates. These structures may be chemoreceptors.|$|E
2500|$|The name <b>Solifugae</b> {{derives from}} Latin, and means [...] "those that flee from the sun". The order {{is also known}} by the names Solpugida, Solpugides, Solpugae, Galeodea, and Mycetophorae. Their common names include camel spider, wind {{scorpion}}, scorpion carrier, jerrymunglum, sun scorpion, and sun spider. In southern Africa, they are known {{by a host of}} names, including red romans, [...] ("hair cutters") and [...] ("beard cutters"), the latter two relating to the belief they use their formidable jaws to clip hair from humans and animals to line their subterranean nests.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Solifugae</b> are {{moderately}} {{small to}} large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), {{with the larger}} species reaching [...] in length, including legs. In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ drastically, so the resulting figures are often misleading. More practical measurements refer primarily to the body length, quoting leg lengths separately, if at all. The body length is up to [...] Most species are closer to [...] long, and some small species are under [...] in head-plus-body length when mature.|$|E
2500|$|The Thelyphonida (formerly Uropygi), {{commonly}} known as vinegarroons or whip scorpions, range from 25 to 85mm in length; the largest species, of the genus Mastigoproctus, reaches [...] Like the related orders Schizomida, Amblypygi, and <b>Solifugae,</b> the vinegarroons use only six legs for walking, having modified their first two legs to serve as antennae-like sensory organs. Many species also have very large scorpion-like pedipalps (pincers). They have one pair of eyes {{at the front of}} the cephalothorax and three on each side of the head. Whip scorpions have no poison glands, but they do have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are bothered. Other species spray formic acid or chlorine. As of 2006, over 100 species have been described worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The Opiliones [...] or [...] (formerly Phalangida) are {{an order}} of arachnids colloquially known as harvestmen, {{harvesters}} or daddy longlegs. Although both harvestmen and spiders are arachnids, the two orders are not otherwise closely related. , over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although {{the total number of}} extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones includes five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently named Tetrophthalmi. With the exception of the Dyspnoi (which are restricted to North America and Eurasia), representatives of each can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, and 305-million-year-old rocks in France, which look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body plan appeared very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time. Their phylogenetic position within the Arachnida is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones, and <b>Solifugae).</b> Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} cephalothorax. Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.|$|E
