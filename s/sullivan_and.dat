5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> his son, but between <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Denis Meikle, Robertson, Mamoulian, and Fleming's films followed a pattern set by Sullivan's play: making Hyde's evil sexual and the Jekyll-Hyde transformation central to the performance. Meikle viewed this as a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by Sullivan. Later adaptations diverged from the model established by <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects of earlier versions.|$|E
5|$|Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the {{financial}} resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from {{the directors of the}} Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore {{for the duration of the}} initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, <b>Sullivan</b> <b>and</b> Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when Pinafore resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.|$|E
