Cooperation, non-cooperation and predation are the main strategies of the two dominant players, namely OCP (Morocco) and Phosrock (USA) during the period 1960 - 2000. These strategies are analyzed by 'prisoner dilemma' and 'limit pricing' models. We consider a two-steps game within a duopoly according to Kreps-Scheinkman framework with Cournot and Bertrand duopoly hypothesis. The empirical results reveal the influence of stockpiles fluctuations and phosphate fertilizer price on the world phosphate rock prices. intersectoral relations, multipliers, labour qualifications, export promotion...|$|E

Scarcity and conflict, but also considerable uncertainty, inter-annual variability, and simple lack of reliable data characterize the problems of water resource management in many countries and river basins. Within the EU sponsored international RTD project OPTIMA a water resources optimization system is being developed that addresses a broad range of objectives and criteria. A web based client-server implementation supports distributed use and easy access, providing considerable server side computing power for distributed web browser clients. This architecture supports a participatory approach involving local stake holders for multi-criteria optimisation and decision support. The multi-criteria optimization approach covers global and sectoral demand and <b>supply</b> <b>balances,</b> reliability of supply, cost and benefits, as well as compliance with water quality standards. Arbitrary penalty functions can be used for the valuation of missing targets, both shortfalls of supply as well as excess (flooding or pollution), or exceeding water quality standards.

In OECD Member countries the data are collected by official bodies (most often the national statistics office in each country) from firms, government agencies and industry organisations and are then reported to the IEA using questionnaires to ensure international comparability. In non-OECD countries the data are collected directly from government and industry contacts and from national publications. The International Energy Agency (IEA) Natural Gas Information database contains time series of annual gas <b>supply</b> <b>balances</b> for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries from 1960 onwards. Country aggregates include OECD Total, OECD North America, OECD Pacific, OECD Europe, IEA and regional totals. World statistics include data on production, total imports and exports and gross inland consumption. For the OECD countries, more detailed information on supply and consumption by sector, and trade by origin and destination is available. This database is updated by the IEA in August each year.

40|$|Purpose – Are {{business}} outcomes due {{primarily to}} entrepreneurial and managerial ability {{or are they}} mainly the result of business content? The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore this question by comparing the railroads of Victoria and Queensland (Australia) and the South-West and Northern Plains of America between 1881 and 1900. Given the commonalities of the four railway systems in terms of their economic orientation towards rural custom, and their marked difference in terms of ownership, one would expect similarities in their financial circumstances if outcomes were primarily determined by fluctuations in global commodity markets. Conversely, marked differences would be expected if outcomes primarily resulted from managerial initiative. Design/methodology/approach – Conceptually, this study is informed by the idea that social and economic outcomes are shaped by long historical movements, with meaningful structural change occurring rarely but to great effect. In exploring this concept through a comparison of the railways of Australia and the American West, the study draws on two forms of archival evidence. One source of evidence relates to railroad management, operations and finances. Figures cited come primarily from Australian railway commissioners’ reports and Poor’s Manual of the Railroads of the USA. The other source of evidence relates to agricultural statistics. These are drawn from official reports. Findings – This study argues that effective strategic decision-making can only occur if we understand the structural changes that alter our world. In the late nineteenth century, the Australian and American railroads servicing newly settled rural regions were financial failures because management failed to appreciate the structural changes that the revolution in steam-powered transport had initiated; a revolution which resulted in commodity prices – and hence, the railway rates for farm produce – being determined by global demand and <b>supply</b> <b>balances</b> rather than by local factors. As a result, they continued a policy of expansion that was no longer financially justified. Originality/value – This study seeks to contribute to a fundamental debate in historical studies and management about the drivers of social and economic change. Increasingly, there is acceptance of the view that historical circumstances are inherently unstable and what counts is the particular change cascading through a myriad of “events”. This study points in a contrary direction, suggesting that business outcomes are primarily determined by deep structural shifts that can be understood and steered but seldom opposed.

40|$|The water {{industry}} in Melbourne {{is facing a}} range of challenges associated with a notoriously varying climate and population growth. As a response to this, new water entitlement arrangements were introduced in 2014, seeking to promote a more integrated water cycle management. Melbourne’s three water retail corporations and four regional urban water corporations were assigned so called Delivery Bulk Entitlements, giving each of {{them the right to}} an individually quantified volume of water and the responsibility to manage that water. As a part of this, it was also decided that the actors are allowed to trade water. According to economic theory, having a water market like this is likely to promote a more efficient water system – at least from an economic point of view. However, the overall aim of the water system management is not only to promote efficiency but also to provide affordable, secure water supplies and enable for a water system supporting liveability and sustainability while protecting the environment and public health. Recognising this and also the limited experiences from water trading in urban settings, the aim {{of the present study was}} to explore and review the risks (i. e. opportunities and threats) associated with the new water trading scheme in Melbourne. By performing interviews with industry representatives in combination with a literature review, features of water trading that could potentially affect the possibility to attain the objectives of the Melbourne water system management were identified. While confirming that the possibility to trade indeed offers an opportunity to improve allocative as well as productive and dynamic efficiency, it was also recognised that this brings about opportunities as well as threats in relation to liveability, environmental health, security and, potentially, affordability. For example, there could be ideological and/or religious opposition towards treating water as a commodity and considering the essentiality of the water services provided by the bulk entitlement holders, anything affecting their operations could be seen to affect the liveability and sustainability of Melbourne. However, there are currently little to no room for trading to directly affect the costumers’ costs for water since the prices are regulated and predetermined. By increasing efficiency, trading could potentially defer the next major water augmentation, which nevertheless would be positive in this regard. Furthermore, it offers a way to redistribute the available water after a disturbance, which is positive in relation to the water security. Currently, the lack of security frameworks guiding any trading activities is however problematic not only in relation to this but also since it basically keeps any trades from happening and thereby limits the scope for a market altogether. As regards the environment, trading brings with it an opportunity to solve a potential overallocation problem as well as a way for the environmental water holder to acquire additional water for the environment and to readjust its water holdings and get around delivery constraints. However, trading among other actors also potentially brings with it unwanted effects due to a change in quantity and/or quality of the water flows. Additionally, it may encourage entitlement holders to sell of water that would otherwise have been left unused. It should be emphasised that the present study did not seek to provide a complete risk assessment but to offer an initial mapping and understanding of opportunities and threats. From this, it also made some brief recommendations about how some of the identified barriers such as the low number of market participants and the current need for trades to get ministerial approval potentially could be overcome. All in all, although the scope for having a market in Melbourne could be questioned due to a number of factors (currently) keeping the low number of entitlement holders from trading, this study suggests that water trading could be both positive and negative in relation to the overall objectives of the water system government. Thus, the key is to develop a water market seeking to promote the identified opportunities while mitigating the threats, indeed giving the water corporations in Melbourne the possibility to use the new management tool for managing their respective demand and <b>supply</b> <b>balances</b> without compromising the level of service towards their customers.  Aktörerna som ansvarar för Melbournes vattenförsörjning står inför en rad utmaningar kopplade till ett mycket omväxlande klimat och en kraftig befolkningstillväxt. I ett försök att främja ett holistiskt och mer integrerat förhållningssätt där alla möjligheter tas i beaktande infördes under 2014 ett nytt sätt att organisera rättigheterna till vatten. De sju statligt ägda företag i Melbourne som distribuerar vatten till privatkunder och företag tilldelades så kallade ”Bulk Delivery Entitlements” som ger var och en av dem rätt till en individuellt kvantifierad mängd vatten och även ansvar för dess förvaltning. Som ett led i detta möjliggjordes även för aktörerna att handla med vattnet, något som enligt ekonomisk teori torde främja effektivitet – i alla fall utifrån ett ekonomiskt perspektiv. Det övergripande målet för vattenförsörjningen gäller dock inte bara effektivitetsnivån utan tar även hänsyn till pris och säkerhet och söker främja beboelighet (”liveability”) och hållbarhet samtidigt som miljön och folkhälsan skyddas. Utifrån detta och med tanke på de begränsade erfarenheterna av vattenhandel i urban miljö var syftet med denna studie att undersöka och granska de risker (i form av möjligheter och hot) som kan associeras med att ha en vattenmarknad i Melbourne. Genom att genomföra intervjuer med företrädare för industrin och kombinera detta med en litteraturstudie identifierades aspekter kopplade till vattenhandel som kan komma att påverka potentialen att nå målen för hur Melbournes vattensystem ska förvaltas. Studien bekräftar att en vattenmarknad troligen verkligen erbjuder möjlighet till ökad allokativ, produktiv och dynamisk effektivitet, men identifierade också en rad möjligheter och hot i förhållande till (social) hållbarhet, miljö, säkerhet och kostnadsbild. Till exempel kan det finnas ideologiskt och/eller religiöst grundat motstånd mot att se vatten som en handelsvara. Dessutom, med tanke på hur fundamentala de tjänster som tillhandahålls av de inblandade företagen är, kan det argumenteras för att vad som än påverkar dessa företags verksamhet är relevant i förhållande till social hållbarhet. Det finns för närvarande dock inget direkt utrymme för vattenhandeln att påverka kundernas kostnader för vatten eftersom priserna är på förhand reglerade. Genom att öka effektiviteten kan en vattenmarknad dock vara delaktig i att skjuta upp nästa stora utbyggnad av vattenförsörjningen, vilket skulle vara positivt ur detta avseende. Därtill erbjuder en vattenmarknad ett sätt att omfördela det tillgängliga vattnet efter en störning, vilket är positivt med tanke på försörjningssäkerheten. För närvarande är dock bristen på säkerhetsföreskrifter i förhållande till handelsaktiviteter problematiskt inte bara i förhållande till säkerhetsnivån utan även med tanke på att det avhåller vattenföretagen från att genomföra någon handel alls och därmed begränsar möjligheten att omsätta både möjligheter och hot. När det gäller miljöhänsyn erbjuder vattenhandel en möjlighet att lösa en eventuell situation där för mycket vatten avleds från naturen till försörjningsnätet. Dessutom kan den aktör som ansvarar för det vatten som avsatts för miljöändamål förvärva ytterligare vatten, justera sitt vatteninnehav och komma runt fysiska leveransbegräsningar. Handel mellan andra aktörer medför dock hot om en förändring i kvantitet och/eller kvalitet hos vattenflöden, något som kan komma att ha negativ miljöpåverkan. Dessutom kan en vattenmarknad medföra att vatten som tidigare lämnats orört nu istället säljs för konsumtionsändamål. Det bör understrykas att denna studie inte gör något anspråk på att erbjuda en fullständig riskutvärdering utan snarare en första kartläggning av och förståelse för möjligheter och hot.  Utifrån detta formulerades även förslag på hur några av de identifierade barriärerna, bland annat det låga antalet marknadsdeltagare och det nuvarande kravet på att handelsavtal godkänns av en minister, skulle kunna övervinnas. Sammantaget föreslår denna studie att vattenhandel kan vara både positivt och negativt i förhållande till de övergripande målen för förvaltningen av vattensystemet, även om utrymmet för en marknad i Melbourne kan ifrågasättas med tanke på en rad faktorer som för närvarande medför att det låga antalet potentiella marknadsdeltagare faktiskt avstår från att handla.

When <b>supplying</b> <b>balancing</b> energy in addition to the supply in the day-ahead market, total income increase by only 2. 2 %. However, the additional income because of the investment increases by 21 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{study focused}} on the status and {{prospects}} of three major Philippines feed crops (corn, palay & soybean), as they functionally relate to the livestock sector. A detailed discussion on local livestock, poultry, aquaculture, and feed milling industry sub-sectors, {{as well as the}} three feed crops is presented to examine the current status of these industries. The study analyzed the trends and projections of supply and demand of feed crops from 1998 - 2015 and evaluated the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in developing the feed crop sector in the Philippines. feed crops, <b>supply</b> <b>balance,</b> livestock, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{initiated}} with {{the objectives of}} elucidating and analyzing potentials, weaknesses, opportunities, constraints and policy options {{in the development of}} feed crop farming with an emphasis on secondary crops in Southeast Asian developing countries. In Malaysia, feed crops currently not much to employment, income generation, import substitution and export promotion because the sub-sector is small. The scope of the study is limited to the dominant non-ruminant sector of the livestock industry. This sector, particularly poultry and swine, has not only experienced rapid growth but also produces more than is required for domestic consumption and thus exports to neighbouring countries. food crops, <b>supply</b> <b>balance,</b> trade, livestock, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInterest in Demand Response (DR) is {{increasing}} {{due to its}} potential to improve reliability and save costs for electricity systems. DR can provide a sustainable and cost-effective option for <b>supply</b> <b>balancing,</b> especially in a scenario with more volatile inflows from renewable energy sources. End-users can be incentivized to provide DR through time-based pricing in general and dynamic pricing in particular. This paper provides a theoretic framework and practice-oriented review {{of the status of}} DR in Europe, outlining the major challenges currently hampering further DR development. Important challenges involve the split-incentive issue for investments in enabling technologies, traditional market rules for flexibility that favor large generation units and the need for electricity market and network operation coordination...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Uremic {{symptoms}} can be con-trolled {{and nitrogen}} equilibrium established {{by means of}} low protein diets, but cer-tain principles of nutrition must be observed. Only "high biologic value proteins " (meat, eggs, and milk) <b>supply</b> <b>balanced</b> quantities of essential amino acids vital for new protein synthesis. "Low bio-logic value proteins " (starches, cereals, fruits, and legumes) while good calorie sources, impose an unusable nitrogen load. The decrease of dietary protein to a minimum demands a marked increase in calories, vitamin supplementation, and almost exclusive use of "high biologic value protein " at each meal {{in order to provide}} enough essential amino acids in proper proportions. A varied, non-formula, 40 -g diet that will maintain nitrogen equi...|$|R

40|$|Fossil fuels still {{constitute}} {{an important source}} of energy in the world, but they need to comply with more strict environmental requirements. The coal industry, the basic primary energy supplier to the Polish economy, not only faces new environmental regulations but also restructuring and changes in the industry¿s organisational structure. The issues of primary importance are the medium and longterm prospects of achieving a suitable quantity and quality of coal supplied, as well as suitable costs. The structure of power generation needs to adjust to emissions limits with given fuel supplies. The paper discusses the construction of a coal <b>supply</b> <b>balancing</b> system which has been developed and applied as a decision support for rational planning of the development of the Polish coal industry. It consists of two linked groups of models: coal <b>supply</b> and coal <b>balancing.</b> Such a structure allows it to respond to the problems emerging for the most part from new environmental regulations, and to select policies that will lead to sustainability in the industry.

40|$|A single {{indicator}} [i. e., {{the power}} quality factor (PQF) ] {{in the range}} between 0 and 1 is suggested in this paper to integrally reflect the power transfer quality of a general three-phase network feeding unbalanced nonlinear loads. The prominent power quality aspects considered in the paper are the following: 1) the voltage and current harmonic levels; 2) the degree of unbalance; and 3) the phase displacement factor in the different phases at the fundamental frequency. A network that <b>supplies</b> <b>balanced</b> sinusoidal currents at balanced sinusoidal voltages with zero phase displacement between the corresponding currents and voltages yields a PQF of unity. The measurement of the PQF is discussed. Practical examples illustrate the use and relevance of the new quality factor. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The project {{presents}} an approach for load balancing and power factor correction. First we have considered a three phase grounded load system where the supply is a three phase <b>balanced</b> <b>supply.</b> Before <b>balancing</b> the load and correcting the power factor {{it is necessary}} to compensate the neutral current. We propose three schemes for neutral current balancing. After that the system becomes equivalent to ungrounded star connected load. Now to carry power factor correction and load balancing we need to convert the load to delta connected load. Hence we carry out star-delta transformation and we carry out our main objective through the proposed methods...|$|R
