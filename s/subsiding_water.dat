6000|$|Weeks {{passed before}} {{he was able to}} leave his bed--and then only as an impoverished and {{physically}} shattered man. He had no means to restock the farm left bare by the <b>subsiding</b> <b>water.</b> A kindly train-packer offered him a situation as muleteer in a pack train going to the mountains--for he knew tracks and passes and could ride. The mountains gave him back a little of the vigor he had lost in the river valley, but none of its dreams and ambitions. One day, while tracking a lost mule, he stopped to slake his thirst in a waterhole--all that the summer had left of a lonely mountain torrent. Enlarging the hole to give drink to his beast also, he was obliged to dislodge and throw out with the red soil some bits of honeycomb rock, which were so queer-looking and so heavy as to attract his attention. Two of the largest he took back to camp with him. They were gold! From the locality he took out a fortune. Nobody wondered. To the Californian's superstition it was perfectly natural. It was [...] "nigger luck"--the luck of the stupid, the ignorant, the inexperienced, the nonseeker--the irony of the gods! ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} plan and utilize <b>water</b> {{resources}} of <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> area, the basic water quality information of <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> area is needed. fourteen large scaled <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> areas have been selected in Panji coal mining area of Huainan city, the investigation and sampling have been carried out. Heavy element of water quality has been analyzed and fuzzy synthetic evaluation method {{was used to evaluate}} water environment. The results show that most of the twelve investigated <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> areas which developed for the fish farming have been polluted already. Only one <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> area was assessed as class III. Appropriate measures are taken to control <b>subsided</b> <b>water</b> areas of different areas and pollution, then comprehensive development and utilization of water resources can be adopted...|$|R

In his {{acceptance}} speech, he said: [...] "The idea {{of human rights and}} freedoms must {{be an integral part of}} any meaningful world order. Yet I think it must be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the <b>subsiding</b> <b>waters</b> of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world." ...|$|R

60|$|For these or {{some other}} reasons Egypt has been {{occupied}} by man from the most remote antiquity. The oldest records of the human race, made three thousand years ago, speak of Egypt as ancient then, when they were written. Not only is Tradition silent, but even Fable herself does not attempt {{to tell the story}} of the origin of her population. Here stand the oldest and most enduring monuments that human power has ever been able to raise. It is, however, somewhat humiliating to the pride of the race to reflect that the loftiest and proudest, as well as the most permanent and stable of all the works which man has ever accomplished, are but the incidents and adjuncts of a thin stratum of alluvial fertility, left upon the sands by the <b>subsiding</b> <b>waters</b> of summer showers.|$|R

60|$|The {{band played}} {{as usual in}} the evening. Gradually the shadows fell and it became dark. The hungry {{inhabitants}} betook themselves to bed. The anxious but indomitable commander knew that the crisis impended, and knew also that he was powerless to avert it. Perhaps he slept, satisfied {{that he had done}} his duty; and in the silence of the night the savage enemy crawled stealthily towards the town. The weary and disheartened sentinels, weakened by famine and tired of war, maintained a doubtful vigilance along the ramparts. The <b>subsiding</b> <b>waters</b> of the river had left a bare gap between the White Nile and the wall. Perhaps there was treachery besides. On a sudden the loud explosion of musketry broke the stillness of the night and the slumbers of the people; and with a continual shouting thousands of Dervishes swarmed through the unprotected space and entered Khartoum.|$|R
60|$|Even {{when she}} crept up the castle stairs, she {{was met with}} an angry rebuke, {{not so much for}} the peril she had {{incurred}} as for having taken away the Schneiderlein, by far the most availing among the scanty remnant of the retainers of Adlerstein. Attempting no answer, and not even daring to ask from what quarter came the alarm, Christina made her way out of the turmoil to that chamber of her own, the scene of so much fear and sorrow, and yet of some share of peace and happiness. But from the window, near the fast <b>subsiding</b> <b>waters</b> of the Debateable Ford, could plainly be seen the small troop of warriors, of whom Jobst the Kohler had brought immediate intelligence. The sun glistened on their armour, and a banner floated gaily on the wind; but they were a fearful sight to the inmates of the lonely castle.|$|R

5000|$|Mangala Fossa is a graben in the Memnonia {{quadrangle}} of Mars, {{located near}} , which {{originated in the}} Hesperian and Amazonian epochs. The graben {{is located at the}} head of the outflow channel Mangala Valles, which is thought to have been formed by at least two catastrophic flood events during the same geological period, leading to the release of vast quantities of water from Mangala Fossa onto the Martian surface. The flooding was probably initiated by the emplacement of a dike radiating from the volcano Arsia Mons, resulting in the formation of the graben, Mangala Fossa, at the channels' head. This dike breached a pressurized aquifer trapped beneath a thick [...] "cryosphere" [...] (layer of frozen ground) beneath the surface. As the floor of the graben <b>subsided,</b> <b>water</b> found its way up one or both of the faults in the crust that defined the edges of the graben and spilled into the depression, eventually filling it and overflowing at the lowest point on the rim to erode the Mangala Valles channels.|$|R
50|$|The Jamuna is a {{very wide}} river. During the rains it is about 5 - 8 mi from bank to bank. Even {{during the dry season}} when the <b>waters</b> <b>subside,</b> the breadth is hardly less than 2 - 3 mi.|$|R
50|$|Beach front flora plays a {{major role}} in {{stabilizing}} the foredunes and preventing beach head erosion and inland movement of dunes. If flora with network root systems (creepers, grasses and palms) are able to become established, they provide an effective coastal defense as they trap sand particles and rainwater and enrich the surface layer of the dunes, allowing other plant species to become established. They also protect the berm from erosion by high winds, freak waves and <b>subsiding</b> flood <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the mythology of many other civilizations and {{cultures}} which tell of a Great Flood, certain Native American tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the <b>water</b> <b>subsides,</b> various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.|$|R
50|$|Aquaculture was {{operating}} in China circa 2500 BC. When the <b>waters</b> <b>subsided</b> after river floods, some fish, mainly carp, {{were trapped in}} lakes. Early aquaculturists fed their brood using nymphs and silkworm feces, and ate them. A fortunate genetic mutation of carp {{led to the emergence}} of goldfish during the Tang dynasty.|$|R

50|$|Flash floods hit Chai Chee after a heavy downpour in the afternoon, {{leaving some}} {{vehicles}} stranded. The flood {{at the junction}} of New Upper Changi Road and Chai Chee Road made the roads, at one point, impassable to traffic. The <b>waters</b> <b>subsided</b> in half an hour. By 5 pm, the road was once more passable to traffic.|$|R
50|$|Osage Lake {{is almost}} {{completely}} surrounded by gravel park roads. The roads {{end at the}} edge of the dam on the south end of the lake. Some of the roadway in the southeast quarter of the lake is barely above the water level. Since it easily floods, vehicles may be trapped in that quarter until the <b>water</b> <b>subsides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Espada Formation {{represents}} {{a long period}} of geologic history - tens of millions of years - in which sediments were deposited in warm, quiet water in a basin that was gradually <b>subsiding.</b> The <b>water</b> was usually shallow, as indicated by the frequent sandstone beds (coarse sediment such as sand is deposited nearer shore unless carried far offshore by submarine landslides and other subsea mass movements). [...] The Espada resembles some strata of the underlying Franciscan Formation, even though the two units may have been deposited at great distances from each other, and brought together by tectonic forces along the boundaries of the Pacific and North American Plates.|$|R
50|$|On Thursday, heavy downpour causes flash {{floods in}} various parts of Singapore such as Serangoon, Bukit Timah, Toa Payoh and Orchard Road. Rain <b>water</b> <b>subsided</b> quickly. One driver lost control of his car while {{travelling}} in heavy rain and crashed into a canal after colliding with another car. Strong currents drifted the car down the canal for more than 50m.|$|R
50|$|On Wednesday, flash floods were {{reported}} along Ayer Rajah Expressway after the Alexandra exit at around noon, according to Facebook updates {{from the national}} water agency PUB.

Corals (represented in tan and purple) settle and grow around an oceanic island, forming a fringing reef. In favorable conditions, the reef expands, {{and the interior}} island subsides. Eventually the island completely <b>subsides</b> beneath the <b>water,</b> leaving a ring of growing coral with an open lagoon in its center. The process of atoll formation may {{take as long as}} 30,000,000 years.|$|R

50|$|Effects of {{the trash}} and sewage in flood waters were {{expected}} to peak when <b>waters</b> <b>subsided,</b> leaving behind stagnant pools of water. A spokesman for UNICEF encouraged everyone {{to stay out of}} the water as much as possible. Since a household sanitation system won't operate under flood water, individuals who remained in flooded areas exposed themselves to risks and increased risks for those living downstream by continuing to generate more sewage and trash in waters carried downstream.|$|R
50|$|Sixteen pre-school {{children}} and their carers were rescued at Jamberoo by the State Emergency Service. Albion Park received 63 mm of rain in the hour leading up to 1 pm on 21 March 2011.

50|$|Approximately 600 {{million years}} ago in the Precambrian, the area was covered by a sea. As <b>waters</b> <b>subsided</b> and land masses began to appear 60 to 30 {{million years ago}} (between the Paleocene and Oligocene epochs), drainages such as Spearfish Canyon formed as softer rock was eroded away. Today, a National Scenic Byway, U.S. Highway 14A, winds through the canyon.
