40|$|SummaryLeishmaniasis is a vector-borne {{protozoan}} {{infection with}} a wide clinical spectrum, which ranges from asymptomatic infection to fatal visceral leishmaniasis. A review of the recent literature indicates {{a sharp increase in}} imported leishmaniasis cases in developed, non-endemic countries over the last decade, in association with increasing international tourism, military operations, and the influx of immigrants from endemic countries. South America is the main area for the acquisition of cutaneous leishmaniasis, and adventure travelers on long-term trips in highly-endemic forested areas are at particular risk. Popular Mediterranean destinations are emerging as the main areas of acquisition of visceral leishmaniasis for European travelers. Leishmaniasis should be considered in patients presenting with a compatible clinical syndrome and a history of travel to an endemic area, even if this occurred <b>several</b> <b>months</b> or years <b>ago.</b> Appropriate counseling should be provided to adventure travelers, military personnel, researchers, and other groups of travelers likely to be exposed to sandflies in endemic areas...|$|R

500|$|They {{discover}} a nearby planet that {{shows signs of}} a previous civilization but has been stripped of all industrial and mechanical elements, similar to destruction found <b>several</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> to Federation outposts bordering the Romulan Neutral Zone. Moments later, they detect and are then met by a much larger, cube-shaped vessel which does not answer their hails. Guinan warns Picard that the ship belongs to the Borg, a powerful, cyborg-like race that nearly wiped out her people, scattering the survivors across the galaxy, and again urges Picard to leave immediately or face certain destruction. Though Picard orders the Enterprise shields raised, a single, speechless Borg transports into Engineering and begins to probe the Enterprises computer systems. Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) initially attempts to incapacitate the intruder with his phaser set on stun, which has absolutely no effect, and is forced to increase power in order to neutralize the Borg. Immediately afterwards, a second Borg appears and [...] continues probing the computer, proving to be immune to phaser fire. Completing its mission, it strips several components from the dead Borg, then transports away and the dead Borg disintegrates. The Borg ship then contacts the Enterprise and demands their surrender. The Borg then immobilizes the Enterprise with a tractor beam, disables the shields, and uses a cutting beam to slice into the saucer section to remove a cross-section of the ship, killing eighteen people.|$|E
