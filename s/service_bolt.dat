50|$|The <b>Service</b> Module was <b>bolted</b> to {{a flange}} {{at the top}} of the longer panels, and power to the SLA multiply-redundant {{pyrotechnics}} was provided by an umbilical. Because a failure to separate from the S-IVB stage could leave the crew stranded in orbit, the separation system used multiple signal paths, multiple detonators and multiple explosive charges where the detonation of one charge would set off another even if the detonator on that charge failed to function.|$|R

The crest is completed by the blue and gold framing.Traditionally used in the coat of arms of women, the lozenge, honors Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. The single silver star is a representative to Admiral Hopper for being {{the first woman to}} achieve the rank of rear admiral. The trident symbolizes the focus of her life’s work and love for the United States Navy and her Naval <b>service.</b> Lightning <b>bolts</b> along with the framing {{on the bottom of the}} shield suggest the appearance of the ship’s hull cutting through water, also representing the sophistication and power of the AEGIS warship. The wreath, consisting of laurel and oak represent honor and strength. The color gold represents excellence, while red denotes courage and sacrifice.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an effort to {{understand}} the basic concepts for securing Web services, the standards associated to solve this puzzle, and the requirements for implementing secure Web services. It is commonly said, "Security is as strong as the weakest link. " Security in Web <b>services</b> cannot be <b>bolted</b> into a existing architecture. The architecture design must be modular, so that specific security technologies can be plugged in at appropriate parts of the infrastructure. The set of requirements provided in this paper helps in incorporating security throughout. The second white paper planned in this series, Securing Web Services - Architect, Deploy, and Manage, will provide more details on architecting, implementing, and deploying secure Web services.

5000|$|On May 23, 2006, Bauer {{was injured}} in a {{single-engine}} airplane crash shortly after taking off from a small airfield in Blacksburg, South Carolina. Bauer, who was the pilot of the Mooney M20E single-prop airplane, and his passenger escaped the wreckage before the plane caught fire. Bauer's passenger had only minor injuries. Bauer, however, was more seriously injured. He underwent surgery for a shattered left heel. The incident was voted [...] "Best Political Stunt in 2006" [...] by readers of the Free Times alternative weekly tabloid. [...] While the factual report [...] indicated that [...] "best practice" [...] procedures would have revealed that the airfield was too short to safely take off from, the findings [...] only addressed Bauer's [...] "failure to abort the takeoff after the airplane failed to achieve adequate airspeed on the takeoff roll for undetermined reasons." [...] According to FAA regulations, [...] "the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for [...] [...] [...] the operation of that aircraft" [...] including determining if the aircraft is in airworthy condition and properly making the decision to abort takeoff in time to avoid a crash. Though in no way relieving Bauer of his being responsible for the crash, a June 11, 2009 court ruling [...] points to a possible reason the airplane might not have achieved sufficient takeoff speed. Administrative Judge Richard C. Goodwin concluded “By overhauling the engine and returning it to <b>service</b> with incorrect <b>bolts</b> installed, respondent created an unnecessary risk in engine performance.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the weapon showed the {{emphasis}} on accurate, rapid fire emphasised by British Army training during this period. The adjustable flip-up aperture rearsight with a 300-yard battle setting when folded down was an excellent design, allowing rapid and accurate sight acquisition, and was advanced for the period. The Mauser-type bolt had a low-profile bolt handle with an integral safety lug built into its base that locked in the receiver. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently. The action was configured to be easily operable, even when heated by sustained rapid fire, with slick operation, cock-on-closing feature and positive camming action when opening or closing the bolt. The Pattern 1913 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The Lee-Enfield rifle also featured helical locking surfaces. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort {{was applied to the}} extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The action was large and strong compared to other military <b>service</b> rifle <b>bolt</b> actions, since it had to be capable of handling the dimensionally large [...]276 Enfield cartridge variants, and the barrel was given a heavy profile. The Pattern 1913 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. It was a long and comparatively heavy rifle - the Lee-Enfield Mk III weighed 8 lb empty - and the pronounced sight protector 'ears', the 'pot-belly' magazine and 'dog-leg' bolt handle gave it an ungainly air.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the physical/mechanical characteristics of typical selected mining tasks and the energy expenditure required for their performance. The study comprised two phases designed to monitor and record the typical activities that miners perform and to measure the metabolic energy expenditure and thermal responses during the performance of these activities under a non-heat stress environmental condition (ambient air temperature of 25. 8 °C and 61 % relative humidity with a wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 22. 0 °C). Six common mining jobs were evaluated in 36 miners: (1) production drilling (jumbo drill) (n = 3), (2) production ore transportation (load-haul dump vehicle) (n = 4), (3) manual bolting (n = 9), (4) manual shotcrete (wet/dry) (n = 3), (5) general services (n = 8) and, (6) conventional mining (long-hole drill) (n = 9). The time/motion analysis involved the on-site monitoring, video recording, and mechanical characterization of the different jobs. During the second trial, continuous measurement of oxygen consumption was performed with a portable metabolic system. Core (ingestible capsule) and skin temperatures (dermal patches) were recorded continuously using a wireless integrated physiological monitoring system. We found that general <b>services</b> and manual <b>bolting</b> demonstrated the highest mean energy expenditure (331 ± 98 and 290 ± 95 W, respectively) as well as the highest peak work rates (513 and 529 W, respectively). In contrast, the lowest mean rate of energy expenditure was measured in conventional mining (221 ± 44 W) and manual shotcrete (187 ± 77 W) with a corresponding peak rate of 295 and 276 W, respectively. The low rate of energy expenditure recorded for manual shotcrete was paralleled by the lowest work to rest ratio (1. 8 : 1). While we found that production drilling had a moderate rate of energy expenditure (271 ± 11 W), it was associated with the highest work to rest ratio (6. 7 : 1) Despite the large inter-variability in energy expenditure and work intervals among jobs, only small differences in average core temperature (average ranged between 37. 20 ± 0. 22 to 37. 42 ± 0. 18 °C) were measured. We found a high level of variability in the duration and intensity of tasks performed within each mining job. This was paralleled by a large variation in the work to rest allocation and mean energy expenditure {{over the course of the}} work shift...|$|R
