40|$|Vapour-compression water <b>chilling</b> <b>machines</b> {{of large}} {{capacity}} (megawatts of refrigeration) are extensively utilised for process cooling in the manufacturing, chemical and food industries, and for cooling hot mines. If these machines under-perform, not only may {{the costs of}} consequent losses in production be considerable, but products or working conditions may degrade or become unsafe. Performance monitoring instrumentation, including water flow meters, fitted to machines on site may be infrequently calibrated, though. Therefore, the apparent performance of a machine, indicated by the measurements in its water circuits, should be verified through independent, confirming measurements in its refrigerant circuit. For custom-built machines with screw compressors, though, there is a difficulty with so verifying apparent performance. The oil cooling load of screw compressors is large, and so {{must be taken into}} account in such verification. If the oil is cooled by water, it is easy to measure oil cooling load, but not if the oil is cooled by condensed liquid refrigerant in a thermosyphon ‘loop’, because of the two-phase flow of the refrigerant there. This research report describes a study done on a water <b>chilling</b> <b>machine</b> with a screw compressor, using ammonia as refrigerant, at KDC East Mine, Westonaria, South Africa. This study was of a proposed, alternative way of determining the oil cooling load – by measuring flows and properties in the oil circuit. The oil cooling load so determined could be independently verified by measurements in the water circuit of this machine’s oil-to-water cooler. The chief problem in determining oil cooing load from measurements in the oil circuit is that the ‘oil’ is not pure lubricant, but a solution of oil and refrigerant. Therefore the most accurate available methods of predicting the thermophysical properties of oil-ammonia solutions were identified and employed. The oil cooling load hence determined agreed within 0. 43 per cent with that determined on the water side of the oil cooler. It was hence used to correct the coefficient of performance (COP) calculated from measurements in the machine’s refrigerant circuit. This corrected refrigerant-circuit COP, with the estimate of total mechanical power input to the machine, were then used to indirectly estimate the <b>machine’s</b> water <b>chilling</b> load. This indirectly estimated load compared very closely, within 1. 12 per cent, to the apparent water chilling load determined from the measurements in the machine’s water circuits. It is concluded that in this study, oil cooling load could be determined with satisfactory accuracy from measurements in the oil circuit. Hence, this proposed technique offers promise of being a useful and practicable development, enabling apparent performance of such machines to be more conveniently verified than hitherto...|$|R

Numerous case studies within the report illustrate how these pioneers face many of the same challenges of any entrepreneur but with the added complexity of developing hardware and scaling in remote areas with scarce resources. There is a significant opportunity for actors across sectors to strategically leverage their resources in order to support the journeys of these hardware pioneers, from initial inspiration to ultimate impact at scale. Top Takeaways Hardware pioneers lack the right supports in the critical Pioneer Gap stages when they are blueprinting, validating, and preparing their models. In the early stages, these needs range from patient capital to prototyping facilities. Later on, issues such as distribution, financing, servicing, and quality standards become more important. Critically, because the success of hardware pioneers depends on the successful blending of both business and technology skills, those working closely with pioneer teams also need to bring the right combination of these skills, and this unfortunately is rare in the impact enterprise ecosystem. There is need to not just support hardware pioneers directly but also to assemble the other needed parts of the ecosystem, from last-mile specialist companies that help pioneers reach and serve their target markets to the programs and institutions that are helping to spark the initial impulse that gets pioneers started on their journey in the right way. New ideas can have an ultimate impact that is much greater than that of the original pioneer alone through a transfer of the idea to a more scale-ready partner or just through adoption and adaptation of the idea by follower entrepreneurs.

50|$|<b>Chilled</b> fog <b>machines</b> are {{designed}} to create thick clouds of fog that lie {{close to the ground}} and dissipate as they rise. They are typically created by using either dry ice, liquid nitrogen, or more recently liquid air.Dry Ice (solid carbon dioxide) effects are produced by heating water to or near boiling in a suitable container (for example: a 55-gallon drum with water heater coils in it), and then dropping in one or more pieces of dry ice. Because at standard temperature and pressure carbon dioxide is a gas, the carbon dioxide sublimates and instantly produces a gas, condensing water vapor and creating a thick white fog. A fan placed {{at the top of the}} container directs the fog where it is needed.Liquid nitrogen (N2) is used to create low lying fog effects in a manner similar to dry ice. A machine heats water to at or near the boiling point, creating steam and increasing the humidity in a closed container. When liquid nitrogen is pumped into the container, the moisture rapidly condenses, creating a thick white fog. A fan placed at the output of the container directs the fog where it is needed, creating a rolling fog that lies low to the ground.Liquid air is an alternative to using liquid nitrogen in generating low lying fog effects. Liquid air is composed of N2 and O2 mixed in a ratio of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen stored as a liquid in insulated cylinders. This ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is the same as that of atmospheric air, and indeed liquid air may be fabricated by simply liquefying atmospheric air. Liquid air can be used as a direct replacement for liquid nitrogen in chilled-fog effects and is intended to be used in the same manner in the same equipment. Its key advantage over liquid nitrogen is that it presents no asphyxiation hazard, since it contains oxygen. A disadvantage is that it supports combustion, whereas liquid nitrogen inhibits combustion.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{economical}} {{and environmental}} concerns, the energy e fficiency of buildings nowadays {{has proven to}} play an increasingly important role. To satisfy the occupants comfort, the cooling of buildings generally involves a considerable consumption of electricity. Solar radiation, which is a free and renewable resource, {{is linked to the}} cooling needs of buildings. This work consists in the evaluation, from an energy-saving and economical point of view, of a potential use of solar energy for air-conditioning in residential and o ffice buildings. It includes an integral approach of solar air-conditioning, involving the analysis of the buildings cooling needs, the cold production devices, the solar collector fields and climates. This analysis is supported by simulations and experimental setups. The study of solar air-conditioning systems already available on the market or in laboratories reveals their operational principles as well as their main performance indicators. Two main solar cooling paths are investigated: a thermal and a photovoltaic conversion of solar energy. Besides this, the performance of the entire air-conditioning system broadens the question of the energy performance to the interactions between the diff erent parts of the system. The building thermal loads (heating, cooling, domestic hot water) of some theoretical residential and o ffice buildings are computed in a part of this work dealing with the influence of the comfort model, the building energy performance level and the climate. What comes across through this analysis is that, the location of the buildings put aside, the cooling load is greatly influenced by the envelope thermal performance and the internal gains. The cooling systems involving absorption or adsorption or vapour compression <b>chiller</b> cooling <b>machines</b> are simulated for the previously defi ned building cases. The use of solar energy through thermal collectors for heating meets higher primary energy savings than for cooling. In all cases, the thermally driven system achieves a lower energy and economical performance than a vapour compression chiller partially supplied with a photovoltaic field. Some real scale testing of solar air-conditioning systems was carried out in Arlon (Belgium). A thermally driven adsorption chiller and a vapour compression chiller with a photovoltaic grid-connected fi eld were operated during the cooling season. The measurements made during this experiment and their analysis manage to discover every thermal and electrical energy flows of the systems leading to a new adsorption chiller model. Concerning the comparison with the simulations, the main point of interest is the consumption of electricity dedicated to thermally driven systems, which is two times higher in real scale conditions.

Among the natural refrigerants available, only propane (R 290) and carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) are realistic candidates to replace currently used HFC refrigerants. While many of the thermodynamic and transport properties of R 290 are favorable over R 744, propane is listed as an ASHRAE A 3 refrigerant and therefore bears an inherent flammability risk even when the refrigerant charge is limited to 150 g or less as required by applicable safety standards. While it seems possible to design and implement safe, low-charge hydrocarbon refrigeration systems, some manufacturers prefer solutions that completely eliminate the flammability risk and therefore focus on R 744, which is a non-flammable, non-toxic, natural refrigerant listed as ASHRAE A 1. The challenges encountered with R 744 are mostly due to lower performance at elevated ambient temperatures requiring a transcritical cycle, which often makes R 744 systems more expensive for designs that are aimed at providing comparable cooling capacity and energy efficiency. Therefore, the component and system design challenges encountered with the two fluids are very different, which drives design solutions in very different directions. This study elaborates on the different fluid-specific challenges that are inherent to the {{each of the two}} refrigerants and demonstrates the resulting consequences in terms of system and component design.

More than 400 trucks of fresh fish {{products are}} weekly transported from Norway to European countries. The traditionally chilled fish is packed in boxes filled with approximately 30 % ice (equivalent to approximately 130 trucks) to keep the temperature low during transport and storage. Superchilled fish contains 10 - 15 % ice. The ice serves as a heat sink and thus, do not require use of ice during transport and storage. Compared with traditionally chilled foods, advantages related to superchilling are among others, extended shelf life, higher yield and reduced microbiological risk. Extended shelf life of superchilled products {{make it possible to}} sell a food product as fresh during a longer period of time. The results show that the traditionally chilled fillets have approximately 30 % higher impact potentials than the superchilled fillets for all environmental impact categories. This number is a direct reflection of the ice content in the boxes with chilled fillets, and this is thus, the most important parameter in this assessment. Transportation by truck and packaging material are by far the two biggest contributors to impact potentials, in both systems, while the electricity used in the ice <b>machine</b> (<b>chilled</b> case) and in the Contact Blast Chiller (superchilled case) have only insignificant contributions.

Moreover, some kindergartens and schools have conducted the replacement of menus considered incorrect by other more healthy in order to promote healthy eating habits early. Increasingly convinced that they must change their eating habits, consumers are starting to look healthy foods themselves and they provide satisfaction. This work follows a study of the market already developed by a consulting company and has since become established in which products are the need of consumers with interest in being produced and marketed. This market research was prompted by a company that sells vegetables in bulk and you want to enhance your business through the enhancement of its products, and that the focus on new products, aims to gain a competitive advantage relative to other companies.

Optimized formulations were based on physical parameters, consistency, synerisis and sensory characteristics. A descriptive sensory tests were performed in the sensory laboratory of the Department of Food Science and Technology, ISA/UTL. The sensory evaluation was performed by a total of ten semi trained judges (food engineering students and staff). All of them were non-smokers and their age ranged from 25 to 63 years old. The room, at 20 °C, was equipped with seven isolated sensory booths. The tasting sessions occurred in the period from 10. 00 AM to 12. 30 PM.

In addition, shelf life was established monitoring physical, microbiological and sensory parameters during four weeks. Microbial account included: total mesophiles, coliform bacteria, clostridia, psychrotrophic and yeasts and molds. The developed soups presented a lower caloric value than the commercial ones. Results indicated that samples were stable during the preservation period (four weeks) for microbiological and sensory parameters.

40|$|Every day, {{huge amounts}} of energy are used by all sectors of the economy. From {{transport}} to industries, energy constitutes the base of development and people’s way of living. Besides, the energetic demand of millions of individuals must be satisfied with resources that are in constant depletion while the consumption is growing at a 2 % rate every year. The consequence of such increase {{is that in the}} last decade energy costs have risen extremely fast. Societies must now find a way of maintaining the actual social-economic growth whilst reducing the energy demand in order to ensure sustainable development. Ice hockey arenas in Sweden have an average energy consumption of more than 1000 MWh per year, and around 42 % of the total is used by the refrigeration system to cool the rink surface. The core of these units is the <b>chiller,</b> a <b>machine</b> that removes heat from a cold refrigerant and as a product of this chilling process, waste heat is generated. This energy can be exhausted to the environment or recovered for heating purposes. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the uses given to the waste heat in Läkerol Arena, in Gävle. Some alternatives have been proposed and analysed in order to diminish the amount of rejected heat. Other objectives set in this project are to examine the possibility of reducing the dependence on district heating and to determine the efficacy of insulating the ground below the heating pipes that prevent permafrost. Nowadays the heat recovery system is used to preheat tap water until 30 ºC and then up to 60 ºC, to warm the air sent to the main rink area and to prevent the creation of permafrost in the ground below the main arena. The unused energy is sent to ambient with six big fans placed on the roof. The first additional use for waste heat proposed in this study is to design a heating system just for the resurfacing water. The current method in Läkerol Arena is to mix hot tap water with cold water. The problem is that the first one is three times more expensive than the second, so installing a unit that warms only cold cheap water up to 30 ºC would result into saving 18760 SEK per season. Although this solution does not reduce the waste heat sent to the environment, it does reduce the demand of the desuperheater and increases the demand in the glycol circuit by 7 %. Another option is to build a pit to melt the snow generated in the ice rinks. This solution would increase the use of the waste heat by 26 % and bring annual savings of 32198 SEK, since it would not be necessary to rent any transport service to remove this snow. Besides, the emissions of CO 2 would be reduced by 43774 kg. The possibility of sending part of the produced heat to a nearby building has also been investigated. The suggestion made in this study is to use part of the waste heat to warm the air for the ventilation of the Gefle Tennisklubb, an indoor tennis facility located at 150 m of the ice hockey arena. It has been calculated that this ventilation unit has an average heating demand of 9, 1 kW. Results showed that in average this would represent 2 % of the total heating capacity of the chillers and annual savings of 39858 SEK and 6880 kg of CO 2 sent to the environment. The option of installing a heat pump in the hockey facility has also resulted beneficial. The purpose of such equipment is to cover the demand of district heating from the arena, which is currently used for radiators, radiant floor and 4 small ventilation units. After analysing average consumptions and talking with an expert, it has been decided that the best option is to install a ground source heat pump with a heating capacity of 415 kW. The interesting aspect about the heat pump is its efficiency, being it over the 300 % (COP of 3, 26). Although it means an important economic investment, this technology would save the arena around 239264 SEK every year and reduce CO 2 emissions by 58331 kg. Finally, the installation of an insulation layer below the heating pipes has been analysed. The purpose was to see if this measure would be energy efficient. A simulation has been done with the educational version of the software ANSYS 14. 5, and the results show that with a 100 mm insulation layer placed under the heated sand below the tubes, the heating demand is reduced by 44 kW (– 54, 6 %), while the cooling demand increases by 5 kW (+ 1, 1 %). At the end this alternative has been dismissed since the installation would be too expensive and more heat would be sent to the environment, which is counter-productive. To sum up, with all the measures being installed, the arena would reduce the waste heat sent to the environment by 175, 5 kW. It would represent the 49 % of the total capacity generated (currently it is around 85 % of the total waste heat). Besides, the annual emission of CO 2 would decrease by 109 tonnes, the equivalent to 22 American cars. Finally, in terms of money, all the measures would bring total savings of 68880 SEK per year. The study concludes with three suggestions to continue with further research. The ideas are to investigate the possibility of introducing a filtering system for the water obtained in the snow pit, the viability of installing renewable energy sources to supply the electricity for the heat pump and study the efficiency of reducing the condensing temperature of the chillers...|$|R
