Eight days later Russian aircraft carried out a rocket attack on a large convoy of refugees heading into Ingushetia, killing at least 25 civilians including Red Cross workers and journalists. Two days later the Russian forces conducted a heavy artillery and rocket attack on Samashki.

Police would not confirm details of the shooting or of the condition of Joyal. A person familiar with the case said he was in critical condition in hospital.

A person familiar with the situation said NBC had hired bodyguards for some of the journalists involved in the program.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the road way, sign theft along parts of M-22 has become an issue for MDOT. The department announced in 2016 that it was removing the [...] "M" [...] from the top of some of the M-22 markers to combat the issue. The state had replaced about 90signs in the previous three years, and a department <b>spokesman</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the highway from merchandise sales and scenic travelers factored into those thefts. The new signs cost between $325 and $350 apiece to manufacture, no different than the standard M-22 signs cost, and MDOT hoped that the modified signs will prove less popular with thieves. The new signs will be installed as replacements in the areas with the most thefts, like Leelanau County, {{while the rest of the}} highway will still receive the standard M-22 marker. A year later, sign theft was still an issue. The department started testing pavement markings because the other efforts had failed. The markings cost $175, but they last only three years compared to the ten-year lifespan of a sign.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} announcement, Farmer began to face {{criticism}} for {{his use of}} state funds during difficult economic times that resulted in austerity measures in most state government agencies. One such criticism involved the attendance of Farmer and three aides at the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture's 2010 annual meeting in St. Croix {{at a cost of}} $10,000. Another involved the approval of merit raises for eleven agriculture department employees in 2010 when workers in all other state government agencies received no cost of living salary increases and were required to take six unpaid furlough days. A department <b>spokesman</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> employees had taken on responsibilities for multiple jobs left unfilled by attrition. [...] "The thought process was that this was more cost-effective than hiring new people," [...] the spokesman said. Every constitutional officer in the state also donated a day's salary to the state treasury or to a charity on each of the mandatory furlough days, but Farmer refused, saying he opposed the entire concept of furlough days for government workers. After significant public criticism, Farmer apologized and decided to donate six days' worth of his salary to charity.|$|E

Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing {{to crack down on}} unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC <b>spokesman</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> network had left out that segment because its programming was [...] "tailored for the US audience". There was also criticism of commentators Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented [...] "If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as [...] "smug American elitism".
