As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was <b>so</b> <b>dramatic</b> that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E

25|$|He {{reached the}} semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship in 1978, {{at the age}} of 64, having {{defeated}} John Virgo 9–8, Dennis Taylor 13–9 and Patsy Fagan 13–10. His defeat by South African Perrie Mans saw Davis miss a crucial pink from its spot on the verge of pulling up to one frame behind at 15–16. This incident is of great note as his brother Joe was following each ball intently, swaying in his seat and almost falling into the gangway when his brother missed this key pot. After this frame Joe Davis was taken ill; he was rushed to hospital to undergo a six-and-a-half-hour operation, and died a few weeks later. <b>So</b> <b>dramatic</b> was the missed pink that it became known as 'the ball that killed Joe Davis'. Davis closed 1978 with a quarter-final appearance in the United Kingdom Professional Championship. He defeated veteran Yorkshireman John Dunning 9–2 before losing to Alex Higgins 9–4.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{performances}} in her final year in age group state cricket, Farrell {{was unable to}} break into senior ranks {{until late in the}} 200607 season. She made her debut for New South Wales in a closely contested match against Western Australia, the sixth of eight qualifying matches in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). After taking 1/19 from her six overs, she came to the crease in the closing stages of the match as New South Wales' tail struggled to reach the target of 134. Farrell was run out for two, but her state held their nerve to scrape home by two wickets. She was omitted for the penultimate match of the season before taking 0/13 from four overs in an eight-wicket win over South Australia. New South Wales, the defending champions placed second and qualified for the finals series hosted by Victoria. Farrell retained her position in the team and was a key player in the first match, taking 3/27 from her ten overs as the hosts were dismissed for 136. New South Wales struggled and Farrell came to the crease and scored one not out and was present when the winning runs were scored, sealing a one-wicket win. The rest of the series was not <b>so</b> <b>dramatic.</b> Farrell took one wicket in each of the two remaining matches; Victoria won the first by eight wickets and New South Wales won the deciding game by three wickets to retain their title. Farrell was not required to bat in this last match and ended the season with 3 runs at 1.50 and six wickets at 21.16.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with the stark view of Winesburg, Ohio above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. Barry D. Bort writes, [...] "Criticism of Winesburg, Ohio has recognized this desperate need to communicate, but what has not been understood about Anderson's work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding...Such moments {{are at the heart}} of Winesburg, Ohio, although they are few and evanescent". Though rarely does escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in [...] "Adventure"), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in [...] "The Untold Lie"), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in [...] "The Strength of God"). While not all of the adventures are <b>so</b> <b>dramatic,</b> each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.|$|E
500|$|Physically, American kestrels are leaner {{and less}} muscular than larger falcons. The {{pectoral}} flight {{muscles of the}} American kestrel make up only about 12% of its body weight, as compared to about 20% for the strongest flying falcons such as the peregrine. The wings are moderately long, fairly narrow, and taper to a point. Their less muscular body type is adapted to energy conserving ambush hunting, rather than spending large amounts of energy consuming time on the wing and getting into long tail-chases of bird prey. For their size, they have strong talons and beaks, and can swiftly dispatch prey. Their lean build and energy conserving strategy allows a lower daily food intake than if they were more strongly muscled, yet with enough strength to commonly take bird prey as large as themselves, and occasionally larger. [...] The success of this body style and hunting strategy {{is reflected in the}} high success of the species in densely populating a large range throughout the Americas. [...] The flight of the American kestrel is not <b>so</b> <b>dramatic</b> and swift as more muscular falcons such as Merlins and peregrines, but their efficient adaptation to a broader diet of more available smaller prey, and need for less food per day, has resulted in there being many more of them.|$|E

2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was <b>so</b> <b>dramatic</b> and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E

2500|$|Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, [...] "I gave up my {{art work}} and wrote Unto This Last ... the central work of my life" [...] the break was not <b>so</b> <b>dramatic</b> or final. Following his crisis of faith, and {{influenced}} {{in part by}} his friend, Thomas Carlyle (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (The Cestus of Aglaia), botany and mythology (Proserpina, The Queen of the Air). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to Abbeville, and {{in the following year}} he was in Verona (studying tombs for the Arundel Society) and Venice (where he was joined by William Holman Hunt). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking industrial capitalism, and the utilitarian theories of political economy underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.|$|E

The series that aired {{for the first time on}} BBC One began on 29 September 2004, and had success with viewing figures which peaked at 5.26 million during the episode aired on 20 October 2004.

2500|$|Rare Earth proponents {{argue that}} simple life may be common, though complex life {{requires}} {{specific environmental conditions}} to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a moon of a gas giant, however the requirements and their complexity increase rather, if volcanicity is absolutely required for life. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not <b>so</b> <b>dramatic</b> as seen on Jupiter's Io. The paradox here is the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. Dirk Schulze-Makuch argues {{that there is no}} evidence to support this conclusion, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries as a method for complex life to arise in completely alien conditions. While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the Hesiocaeca methanicola, an animal that inhabits ocean floor methane clathrates substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the tardigrades which can survive in the vacuum of space or Halicephalobus mephisto which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres deep in the Earth's crust, are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in [...] "alien" [...] environments. Jill Tarter counters the classic counterargument that these species adapted to these environments rather than arose in them, by suggesting that we cannot assume conditions for life to emerge which are not actually known. There are suggestions that complex life could arise in sub-surface conditions which may be similar to those where life may have arisen on Earth, such as the tidally heated subsurfaces of Europa or Enceladus. Ancient circumvental ecosystems such as these support complex life on Earth such as Riftia pachyptila that exist completely independent of the surface biosphere.|$|E
