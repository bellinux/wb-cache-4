2500|$|To address its {{financial}} woes, the Board implemented {{a policy of}} <b>staff</b> <b>reduction</b> through attrition but as economic conditions worsened, fewer people wanted to leave their jobs with the Board, reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} policy. [...] Wages remained the biggest expense, so the Board announced that there would be an 11% wage cut and reduction in working conditions. [...] When the union refused to agree to these terms, the Board exploited a loophole in the industrial award, dismissing its entire traffic staff and then inviting them to apply for new positions with the new conditions. [...] The matter went to arbitration at which the magistrate sided with the union and set aside the changes for a period of 12 months.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a review}} of {{published}} longitudinal empirical research {{on the impact of}} restructuring on employee well-being. We investigated whether restructuring accompanied by <b>staff</b> <b>reductions</b> impacts differently on worker well-being than restructuring without <b>staff</b> <b>reductions,</b> and the differences between short- and long-term effects of restructuring. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms that explain these effects. We conducted a literature search on longitudinal, peer-reviewed, English-written studies from the period 2000 – 2012. Thirty-nine papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that restructuring events, with and without <b>staff</b> <b>reductions,</b> mainly {{have a negative impact on}} the well-being of employees. The majority of studies showed negative changes over time, in the short and the long term. Some groups of workers reacted less negatively: for example, workers with a high organizational status before a merger and workers who underwent a change in workgroup. Variables that intervened in the relationship between restructuring and well-being were physical demands, job control, communication, provision of information, training, procedural justice, job insecurity and change acceptance. Further high-quality longitudinal research is needed to get more insight into the impact of restructuring over time and into the part played by intervening variables...|$|R
