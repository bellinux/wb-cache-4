Statistical methodology consists of using box diagrams, and principal component analysis as well as canonic correlation.

Lower education institutes such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education.

The filters especially respond to the severe distress similar to the distress learned for the lifting scheme that needs careful monitoring. Therefore, we conclude that the automatic distress detection method based on the lifting scheme theory improves the ability of acceleration-based profilometer that contribute to daily monitoring activities by road agencies...|$|R

It can be concluded that rising temperatures have had direct effects on agricultural products, which then affects the income and productivity of farmers. Furthermore, rising temperatures have been found to affect farmers’ health and obstruct their social routines, while causing a shortage in terms of food supply. A brief discussion on the need for adaptation is also highlighted, and hopefully this will assist concerned parties to develop adaptation strategies that are in line with farmers’ needs and abilities. <br /...|$|R
