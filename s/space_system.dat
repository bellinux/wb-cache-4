2500|$|Dream Chaser <b>Space</b> <b>System</b> is {{a planned}} human-rated version {{designed}} to carry {{from two to}} seven people and/or cargo to orbital destinations such as the International Space Station. It would have a built-in launch escape system and could fly autonomously if needed. [...] It could use any suitable launch vehicle but is planned to be launched on a human-rated Atlas V 412 rocket. The vehicle {{would be able to}} return from space by gliding (typically experiencing less than 1.5 g on re-entry) and landing on any airport runway that handles commercial air traffic. Its reaction control system thrusters burn ethanol-based fuel, which is not an explosively volatile material, nor toxic like hydrazine, allowing the Dream Chaser to be handled immediately after landing, unlike the Space Shuttle. Its thermal protection system (TPS) is an ablative tile created by NASA's Ames Research Center that would be replaced as a large group rather than tile by tile, and would need to be replaced only after several flights.|$|E

50|$|A <b>space</b> <b>system</b> is a hardcode or softcode {{system for}} a game server which simulates a {{three-dimensional}} space. A <b>space</b> <b>system</b> such as HSpace (for Hemlock Space) is used on a PennMUSH game server, which simulates three-dimensional space in a text environment. Such a system provides for the navigation of vessels, and sometimes ship-to-ship combat. HSpace isn't the only <b>space</b> <b>system</b> available for PennMUSH, and there are almost certainly space systems available for other servers. Space systems don't generally only contain ships, either. Planets, stars, and stations, for example, may {{be present in the}} simulation. Another <b>space</b> <b>system,</b> ASpace, even employs a system for nebulae and borders, though the borders are spherical and not actually marked. Different space systems are generally suited for different themes. HSpace, for example, may be more suited for a Star Wars MUSH, (though SW1 uses a softcoded system, called DarrienSpace) while ASpace is generally used on Star Trek MUSHes because it will handle warp speeds.|$|E
