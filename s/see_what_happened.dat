5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> and 100 to 200 {{people who}} got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} his capture, when his remand was extended, Kuntar {{confessed that he}} had bludgeoned Einat to death with {{the butt of his}} rifle. Later, however, when testifying in court, Kuntar denied the charges. In his testimony, Kuntar asserted that Israeli gunfire had killed Danny Haran as soldiers burst in to free him, and that he did not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Einat after passing out from blood lost from five bullet wounds. He explained that the group's goal had been to take hostages back to Lebanon, and that he had taken the 4-year-old to prevent Israeli police from shooting at them.|$|E

25|$|The south {{church is}} a square room surmounted by a dome, and {{surrounded}} by two deambulatoria, an esonarthex and a parekklesion (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around {{the central part of}} the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc. The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow and dark, and could barely <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in {{the central part of the}} church.|$|E

500|$|Cars was {{originally}} {{set to be}} released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was changed to June 9, 2006. Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios, or they were buying time to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney. [...] When Pixar's chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule, with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.|$|E

500|$|In August, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{the recording of}} its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly {{after the release of}} Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: [...] "You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. You <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minister for Justice and Law Reform Dermot Ahern, {{himself from}} Louth, made known his {{condemnation}} of the violence. He attended the match. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also made known his disapproval later from New York: [...] "I didn't <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> as the ref was leaving the pitch. But obviously none of that is justified. It was an exciting match obviously. But it doesn't justify anyone engaging {{in that sort of}} activity. So I wouldn't like to see it repeated anywhere".

2500|$|The men in {{the newly}} created small ghetto were sent out to their work {{stations}} that Sunday, {{as they had been}} the day before. On the way, they saw the columns formed up for the march to Rumbula, and they heard weeping, screaming, and shooting, but they could learn no details. The men asked some of the German soldiers with whom they were acquainted to go to the ghetto to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> These soldiers did go, but could not gain admission to the ghetto itself. From a distance, they could still see [...] "many horrible things". [...] They reported these facts to the Jews of the work detachments, who asked them to be released early from work to see to their families. At 14:00 hours this request was granted, at least for a few of the men, and they returned to the ghetto. [...] They found the streets scattered with things, which they were directed to collect and carry to the guardhouse. They also found a small bundle {{which turned out to be}} a living child, a baby aged about four weeks. A Latvian guard took the child away. [...] Kaufmann believed the child's murder was a certainty.|$|E

2500|$|At Jerry's apartment, Elaine {{says that}} the only way that she can get rid of Robert's cats is if they should have some form of [...] "accident" [...] and offers Jerry the job, but he refuses. Kramer tells Jerry that his stock has fallen yet again. George then returns from visiting Wilkinson, but he has no {{information}} because he was thrown out of the hospital when Wilkinson saw him. Jerry decides to sell his shares, while George decides to [...] "go down with the ship". Jerry takes Vanessa to Vermont, but rainy weather keeps them stuck inside the bed-and-breakfast. He regrets going with her because boredom causes them to argue. Jerry reads the business section of the newspaper to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the stock since he sold it. The stock has risen dramatically. Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George is celebrating the rising price of his stock, which has increased by $8,000. Elaine says that she gave Robert an ultimatum, and he chose the cats. George then tells Jerry and Elaine that Wilkinson has another stock tip involving some sort of [...] "robot butcher." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
