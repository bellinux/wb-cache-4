Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it,</b> {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal.

She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it.

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Born This Way, season ten American Idol {{contestant}} Haley Reinhart sang [...] "You and I" [...] as one of two performances for the [...] "Songs from Now and Then" [...] episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star-Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart [...] "sounded amazing" [...] by hitting [...] "some really high notes". Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an [...] "old-fashioned dance-hall groove, kind of like a mid-'70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel-style rocker, and <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> to the house." [...] Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judges—Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler—reacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of [...] "You and I" [...] was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, feeling that if she could [...] "get another 10 songs this good {{when it comes time to}} cut the record, then all my initial misgivings about this girl will vanish into thin air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{worked with}} Ryan Tedder, {{producer}} of her second single [...] "Bleeding Love", on the album's lead single [...] "Happy", written by Lewis, Tedder and Evan Bogart, and [...] "You Don't Care". Tedder commented, [...] "I pushed [...] vocally {{more on this}} song than any song she's ever done. I mean, she did some stuff on [...] "Happy" [...] that's awesome, but this other song <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> to another level." [...] The song [...] "Lost Then Found" [...] was also co-written by Tedder and Lewis along with Dan Muckala, Jess Cates and Lindy Robbins, and features Tedder's band OneRepublic. Another Tedder song, [...] "Shadows", was written with AJ McLean for the Backstreet Boys. After it {{failed to make the}} Backstreet Boys' album, Cowell wanted it for Lewis but then decided it better suited Westlife.|$|E
2500|$|Jon O'Brien from Music Is My Oxygen {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars and praised Lo's {{standing}} {{out from the}} crowd, describing her album as a [...] "refreshingly raw debut which casts Tove Lo as pop’s premier hot mess". Kathy Iandoli from Idolator gave the album 3.5 out of 5 and praised the honesty of the lyrics and noted that Lo [...] "has become masterfully adept at jamming thoughtful words into dancey songs through her past songwriting, but <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> a step further with Queen Of The Clouds". A reviewer from PressPLAY gave the album a 4 out of 5 and praised the album's lyrical content and that Lo [...] "goes into the dark places that modern pop tends to avoid", although they also wrote {{that there was a}} [...] "slight need for variety and a tighter edit of the tracklist". The critic also described Lo as having a [...] "frantic, drunken energy [...] that keeps you hooked on her songs unlike any of her peers" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bree is delighted, but {{insists on}} concocting {{a reason for}} Andrew's long absence. Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. <b>She</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off. Andrew has since got a job working at Tom's pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} the first track on the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] was a huge [...] "epic pop song" [...] which had {{sweeping}} strings. It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat running in the background, and then she got the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: before we knew it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can put their hands in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop. Sandé {{said that the}} song was {{based on the fact that}} she believes in God and heaven, although she does not follow a religion. She said that what inspired her the most to write the track was her idea of heaven, which was being surrounded by music and somewhere which is very calm, and she wrote about that in [...] "Heaven".|$|E
2500|$|The video {{starts with}} an acting {{sequence}} in which JoJo confronts her boyfriend David, played by junior defender Mike Zaher, after she spots {{him at a}} house party flirting with another girl, with a drink in his hand. In the dramatic opening scene, JoJo is very upset. The couple talk and David finally invites JoJo to an important soccer game for his team. As the video progresses, JoJo sings {{next to the window}} in her room. She walks around the room looking at photos, reminiscing about the time they spent together and how generally ungrateful he was. These shots are intercut with David playing at the important soccer game. In the video's finale, rain begins to pour on the game. We see JoJo taking down photographs of the couple and picking up a stuffed animal that David had bought her in happier times. <b>She</b> <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> outside and throws it in the garbage can. It is raining, proving that this is the same moment as the game and she has chosen not to attend. David's team is down one goal with 2:14 seconds remaining in the second half. As he makes the shot for the home team, JoJo sings in the rain. He is not quick enough, failing to score the tying goal and the game ends, suggesting that JoJo's absence from the game has had an unfavourable effect on his performance. The video ends with the camera zooming out and panning away from JoJo's window as the rain subsides. Noticeable in the video is a poster for the Rockcorps Boost Mobile concert at Radio City Music Hall on September 24, 2005, an ad for Q-Tip's single [...] "For the Nasty", and the book [...] "Riding on a Blue Note: Jazz and American Pop" [...] by Gary Giddins, which she is reading on top of the car at the game. The fountain in front of the Universal City Hard Rock Cafe is also visible.|$|E
