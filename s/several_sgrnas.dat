40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits increased expression of cyclin D 1 (CCND 1). Previous studies have shown a correlation between poor prognosis of HNSCC and cyclin D 1 overexpression. tRNase ZL-utilizing efficacious gene silencing (TRUE gene silencing) {{is one of the}} RNA-mediated gene expression control technologies that have therapeutic potential. This technology is based on a unique enzymatic property of mammalian tRNase ZL, which is that it can cleave any target RNA at any desired site by recognizing a pre-tRNA-like complex formed between the target RNA and an artificial small guide RNA (sgRNA). In this study, we designed <b>several</b> <b>sgRNAs</b> targeting human cyclin D 1 mRNA to examine growth inhibition of HNSCC cells. Transfection of certain sgRNAs decreased levels of cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein in HSC- 2 and HSC- 3 cells, and also inhibited their proliferation. The combination of these sgRNAs and cisplatin showed more than additive inhibition of cancer cell growth. These findings demonstrate that TRUE gene silencing of cyclin D 1 leads to inhibition of the growth of HNSCC cells and suggest that these sgRNAs alone or combined with cisplatin may be a useful new therapy for HNSCCs...|$|E
40|$|Genome editing is an {{important}} tool for gene functional studies as well as crop improvement. The recent development of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system using single guide RNA molecules (sgRNAs) to direct precise double strand breaks in the genome {{has the potential to}} revolutionize agriculture. Unfortunately, not all sgRNAs are equally efficient {{and it is difficult to}} predict their efficiency by bioinformatics. In crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), with labor-intensive and lengthy transformation procedures, it is essential to minimize the risk of using an ineffective sgRNA that could result in the production of transgenic plants without the desired CRISPR-induced mutations. In this study, we have developed a fast and efficient method to validate the functionality of sgRNAs in cotton using a transient expression system. We have used this method to validate target sites for three different genes GhPDS, GhCLA 1, and GhEF 1 and analyzed the nature of the CRISPR/Cas 9 -induced mutations. In our experiments, the most frequent type of mutations observed in cotton cotyledons were deletions (âˆ¼ 64 %). We prove that the CRISPR/Cas 9 system can effectively produce mutations in homeologous cotton genes, {{an important}} requisite in this allotetraploid crop. We also show that multiple gene targeting can be achieved in cotton with the simultaneous expression of <b>several</b> <b>sgRNAs</b> and have generated mutations in GhPDS and GhEF 1 at two target sites. Additionally, we have used the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to produce targeted gene fragment deletions in the GhPDS locus. Finally, we obtained transgenic cotton plants containing CRISPR/Cas 9 -induced gene editing mutations in the GhCLA 1 gene. The mutation efficiency was very high, with 80. 6 % of the transgenic lines containing mutations in the GhCLA 1 target site resulting in an intense albino phenotype due to interference with chloroplast biogenesis...|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{modularity}} of the <b>sgRNA,</b> <b>several</b> different <b>sgRNAs</b> with distinct functional modules can {{be expressed}} in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging {{the effects of the}} regulation at another location.|$|R
2500|$|The {{current system}} {{is not able to}} {{simultaneously}} select against more than one target [...] as a result of difficulties in DNA synthesis and ligation independent cloning methods. Essentially this means that the highly repetitive sequences necessary for multiple sgRNA in a single plasmid are constrained by flaws in the biological machinery necessary to express them and target them to more than one target. Future improvements are necessary to allow simultaneous genomic manipulations using <b>several</b> distinct <b>sgRNA</b> in a single plasmid.|$|R
40|$|A Pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant {{has emerged}} in China since 2011 that is not {{protected}} by commercial vaccines, {{and has not been}} well studied. The PRV genome is large and difficult to manipulate, but it is feasible to use clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas 9 technology. However, identification of single guide RNA (sgRNA) through screening is critical to the CRISPR/Cas 9 system, and is traditionally time and labor intensive, and not suitable for rapid and high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs. In this study, we developed a recombinant PRV strain expressing firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter virus for PRV-specific sgRNA screens and rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds. Luciferase activity was apparent as soon as 4 h after infection and was stably expressed through 10 passages. In a proof of the principle screen, we were able to identify <b>several</b> PRV specific <b>sgRNAs</b> and confirmed that they inhibited PRV replication using traditional methods. Using the reporter virus, we also identified PRV variants lacking US 3, US 2, and US 9 gene function, and showed anti-PRV activity for chloroquine. Our results suggest that the reporter PRV strain will be a useful tool for basic virology studies, and for developing PRV control and prevention measures...|$|R
