60|$|Very sullenly did his countenance lower when he {{saw himself}} abandoned--left entirely to his own resources, on a large sofa, with the charge of three <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> on his hands. The fact was, he felt {{disposed}} seriously to cultivate acquaintance with Miss Helstone, because he thought, in common with others, that her uncle possessed money, and concluded that, since he had no children, he would probably leave it to his niece. Gérard Moore was better instructed on this point: {{he had seen the}} neat church that owed its origin to the rector's zeal and cash, and more than once, in his inmost soul, had cursed an expensive caprice which crossed his wishes.|$|E

On {{the broken}} {{rocks in the}} {{foreground}} in the crystalline groups, the mosses seem to set themselves consentfully and deliberately {{to the task of}} producing the most exquisite harmonies of colour in their power. They will not conceal the form of the rock, but will gather over it in little brown bosses, like <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> of velvet, made of mixed threads of dark ruby silk and gold, rounded over more subdued films of white and grey, with lightly crisped and curled edges like hoar frost on fallen leaves, and minute clusters of upright orange stalks with pointed caps, and fibres of deep green, and gold, and faint purple passing into black, all woven together, and following with unimaginable fineness of gentle growth the undulation of the stone they cherish, until it is charged with colour so that it can receive no more; and instead of looking rugged, or cold, or stern, or anything that a rock is held to be at heart, it seems to be clothed with a soft dark leopard's skin, embroidered with arabesque of purple and silver.|$|E
6000|$|... § 6. I {{never have}} had time to examine and throw into classes the {{varieties}} of the mosses which grow on the two kinds of rock, nor have I been able to ascertain whether there are really numerous differences between the species, or whether they only grow more luxuriantly on the crystallines than on the coherents. But this is certain, that on the broken rocks of the foreground in the crystalline groups the mosses seem to set themselves consentfully and deliberately to the task of producing the most exquisite harmonies of color in their power. They will not conceal the form of the rock, but will gather over it in little brown bosses, like <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> of velvet made of mixed threads of dark ruby silk and gold, rounded over more subdued films of white and grey, with lightly crisped and curled edges like hoar frost on fallen leaves, and minute clusters of upright orange stalks with pointed caps, and fibres of deep green, and gold, and faint purple passing into black, all woven together, and following with unimaginable fineness of gentle growth the undulation of the stone they cherish, until it is charged with color so that it can receive no more; and instead of looking rugged, or cold, or stern, as anything that a rock is held to be at heart, it seems to be clothed with a soft, dark leopard skin, embroidered with arabesque of purple and silver. But in the lower ranges this is not so. The mosses grow in more independent spots, not in such a clinging and tender way over the whole surface; the lichens are far poorer and fewer; and the color of the stone itself is seen more frequently; altered, if at all, only into a little chiller grey than when it is freshly broken. So that a limestone landscape is apt to be dull, and cold in general tone, with some aspect even of barrenness. The sandstones are much richer in vegetation: there are, perhaps, no scenes in our own island more interesting than the wooded dingles which traverse them, the red rocks growing out on either side, and shelving down into the pools of their deep brown rivers, as at Jedburgh and Langholme; the steep oak copses climbing the banks, the paler plumes of birch shaking themselves free into the light of the sky above, and the few arches of the monastery where the fields in the glen are greenest, or the stones of the border tower where its cliffs are steepest, rendering both field and cliff a thousandfold more dear to the heart and sight. But deprived of associations, and compared in their mere natural beauty with the ravines of the central ranges, there can be no question but that even the loveliest passages of such scenery are imperfect and poor in foreground color. And at first there would seem to be an unfairness in this, unlike the usual system of compensation which so often manifests itself throughout nature. The higher mountains have their scenes of power and vastness, their blue precipices and cloud-like snows: why should they also have the best and fairest colors given to their foreground rocks, and overburden the human mind with wonder; while the less majestic scenery, tempting us to the observance of details for which amidst the higher mountains we had no admiration left, is yet, in the beauty of those very details, as inferior as it is in scale of magnitude? ...|$|E

50|$|Cushion {{plant and}} bolster moor species {{are active in}} the early phases of succession. Over the first 10 years these species slowly {{increase}} amongst grass colonisers. After 20 years of succession a network of <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> emerges through grass and herbs and displaces these species in wetter areas. These species actively grow in areas where there is surface flow of water and consequently these bolster communities make shifting areas of very wet conditions. Consequently, the water is unable to form permanent water courses and is dispersed in small dams. Because of this, these species are {{often referred to as}} ecological-engineers.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{powdery mildew}} can be {{observed}} as small greyish patches of fluffy fungal growth (mycelium) on the upper surface of the lower leaves. These spots resemble <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> of white powder. Leaf tissue {{on the opposite side}} of an infected leaf turns pale green to yellow. The fungus only infects the epidermal layer and can be easily scraped off with a fingernail. Infections can also occur on the leaf sheaths and ears. Leaves remain green and active for some time following infection, then gradually become chlorotic and die off. As the disease progresses, the mycelium often becomes dotted with minute black points (cleistothecia), which are the sexual fruiting bodies of the fungus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recorded}} {{origins of}} pincushions {{date back to}} the Middle Ages of Europe. In the English language, they became known by many names: [...] "pimpilowes, pimpilos, pimplos, pimploes, pin-pillows, pin-poppets". In 1376, Jehanne de Mesnil was bequeathed a silver pin case in a French text called Testament of Advice written by a woman known as La Monteure, from Rouen. Other references to pin cases during the Medieval era exist. By the 16th century, these were supplanted by references to [...] "pyn pillows". Some examples from various parts of Europe survive that have elaborate embroidery. Small porcelain baskets with a pin cushion inside were highly popular, as were <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> such as wedding pillows or maternity pillows, embroidered with messages.|$|E
50|$|As much as Tay's works {{resonate}} {{well with}} her audiences, her works had also sparked a {{controversy in the}} arts fraternity. In 2002, her installation of 600 small handcrafted lip-shaped fabric cushions was {{on display at the}} atrium of Suntec City, as part of Nokia Singapore Art 2001 exhibition. Unfortunately, the installation became too well-received, resulting with a majority of her <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> being stolen by the public during the exhibition period. In spite of obstacles in her career, Tay continues to believe in communicating a 'social voice' through her fabrics, and at the same time, transform the lives of her audience by instilling self-confidence and creative expression. This spirit was demonstrated in her work with the Asian Women’s Welfare Association (AWWA), and mentioned at a speech delivered by Acting Minister Lawrence Wong, at The 2013 Committee Of Supply Debate at the Parliament.|$|E
50|$|Measuring roughly 40cm by 40 cm, the Podruchnik {{takes the}} form of a <b>small</b> <b>cushion,</b> often with {{patchwork}} decoration which varies from region to region.

5000|$|Roman {{mattresses}} were {{stuffed with}} reeds, hay, or wool. Feathers were used {{towards the end}} of the Republic, when custom demanded luxury. <b>Small</b> <b>cushions</b> were placed at the head and sometimes at the back. The bedsteads were high and could only be ascended by the help of steps. They were often arranged for two people, and had a board or railing at the back, as well as the raised portion at the head. The counterpanes were sometimes very costly, generally purple embroidered with figures in gold; and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front. The bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver, and Elagabalus had one of solid silver. In the walls of some houses at Pompeii bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains or sliding partitions. Ancient Romans had various kinds of beds for repose. These included: ...|$|E
40|$|Alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are among those}} biomes that are most vulnerable to climate change. Cushion plants are an important life form of alpine ecosystems and will likely {{play a critical role}} for the resilience of these habitats to climate change. We studied cushion size distribution and different measures of the compactness of cushions (biomass and rosette density, leaf area index) of the cushion plant, Androsace tapete along an elevational gradient from 4500 to 5200 m a. s. l. in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains of the central Tibetan Plateau. Cushion size distribution, total cover, and compactness of cushions varied substantially along the elevational gradient. At the driest site at low elevation we found the lowest total cushion cover, a particularly high proportion of very <b>small</b> <b>cushions,</b> and the most compact cushions (highest rosette and biomass densities, and leaf area index (LAI) per cushion). Our results indicate that in the semi-arid Tibetan Plateau water availability is the more important climate factor than temperature affecting cushion plant traits and morphology...|$|E
40|$|Am Südabfall des aus Basalt bestehenden Bauersberges in der montanen Langen Rhön wird der Extremstandort "Silikatfels-Blockmeer" floristisch-vegetationskundlich analysiert. Er zeigt aufgrund seiner Azonalitat überregional ein Vegetationsmosaik mit typischem Verteilungsmuster und bietet aufgrund seiner Isoliertheit ein Refugialpotential für Eiszeitrelikte sowie ein Evolutionspotential für Endemismen. Flechten-Gemeinschaften im zentralen, offenen Blockmeer sind im Untersuchungsgebiet nach dem Mikromosaik angeordnet: das Lecideetum lithophilae auf den horizontalen, das Lecanoretum sordidae auf den vertikalen Blockflächen, das Lecideetum lucidae auf den regenabgewandten Block-Unterseiten. Die Moos-Gemeinschaften, die üppig erst in den luftfeuchteren Blockmeer-Randbereichen gedeihen, sind v. a. nach dem Makromosaik angeordnet: Das Grimmietum ovatae im zentralen, offenen Blockmeer, das Andreaeetum petrophilae mehr randlich, das Rhacomitrietum lanuginosi am deutlich luftfeuchteren Hangfuß, das Grimmietum hartmanii und das Isothecietum myuri in den stark beschatteten Randbereichen und auf Blöcken im geschlossenen Wald. Gefäßpflanzen-Gesellschaften wachsen bis auf das Asplenietum septentrionalis erst in Randbereichen oder besetzen als „Gehölzinseln" (Sambuco-Salicion- und Hasel-Gebüsche, Querco-Tilietum platyphylli) feinerdereiche Mulden im Blockmeer. Besonnte Säume werden von der Hieracium murorum-Gesellschaft, beschattete vom Epilobio-Geranietum robertiani (z. T. mit Cynoglossum germanicum) eingenommen. Am sonnigen Trauf wächst in Anklängen das Betulo-Quercetum petraeae, die angrenzende, zonale Waldgesellschaft ist das Galio-Fagetum (montane Dentaria bulbifera-Höhenform). The {{southern}} {{slope of}} the basaltic "Bauersberg" in the montane belt of the "Lange Rhön" is analysed for its flora and vegetation, especially on extensive rocky places with extreme conditions for plant life. These show a typical pattern of vegetation distribution, even in comparison with other regions. Because of the isolation in the landscape of open rocky places, they both offer a refuge for glacial relicts and pose a genetic requirement {{for the evolution of}} endemic organisms. Communities of epilithic lichens grow mostly on the rocks in the centre of the rubble {{slope of the}} "Bauersberg". Each rock shows a typical pattern of lichen communities: the Lecideetum lithophilae grows on horizontal surfaces, the Lecanoretum sordidae on vertical surfaces and the Lecideetum lucidae on the undersides, protected from rainfall. Communities of epilithic mosses grow mostly in more humid, shaded margins. Their vegetation pattern is related to the different conditions along the slope: In the centre grow only the <b>small</b> <b>cushions</b> of the Grimmietum ovatae; if it is a little more humid, it is replaced by the Andreaeetum petrophilae. Extensive blankets of the Rhacomitrietum lanuginosi grow in the clearly more humid area at the base slope. The most shaded epilithic habitats are, finally, occupied by blankets of the Grimmietum hartmanii and the Isothecietum myuri. Communities of phanerogams avoid the centre of the rubble slope, except the Asplenietum septentrionalis and some shrub and tree "islands" with Sambuco-Salicion and Corylus avellana-communities and the Querco-Tilietum platyphylli. On sunny margins the Hieracium sylvaticum-community grows in front of a fragmentar Betulo-Quercetum petraeae. On shady margins the Epilobio-Geranietum robertiani grows, with Cynoglossum germanicum as a small belt in front of the zonal beechwood (Galio odorati-Fagetum with Dentaria bulbifera) ...|$|E
