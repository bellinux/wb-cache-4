In this sense, the present paper arises as a complementary study on the topic, since here shock input is assumed as dynamic loading, so as to investigate the effectiveness of TMDs in reducing the transient structural response. In particular, an impulsive loading has been considered, acting as a base displacement, which is a situation that may occur in real applications. First, a comprehensive dynamic analysis of the system comprising of a primary structure and an attached passive TMD is carried out in the time domain.

The MRVE has dynamic properties such as stiffness and damping adjustable by applied magnetic fields. To achieve better vibration control effectiveness, the optimal bounded parametric control for the MRVE sandwich beam with supported mass under stochastic and deterministic support motion excitations is proposed, and the stochastic and shock vibration suppression capability of the optimally controlled beam with multi-mode coupling is studied. The dynamic behavior of MRVE core is described by the visco-elastic Kelvin-Voigt model with a controllable parameter dependent on applied magnetic fields, and the parameter is considered as an active bounded control. The partial differential equations for horizontal and vertical coupling motions of the sandwich beam are obtained and converted into the multi-mode coupling vibration equations with the bounded nonlinear parametric control according to the Galerkin method. The vibration equations and corresponding performance index construct the optimal bounded parametric control problem. Then the dynamical programming equation for the control problem is derived based on the dynamical programming principle. The optimal bounded parametric control law is obtained by solving the programming equation with the bounded control constraint. The controlled vibration responses of the MRVE sandwich beam under stochastic and <b>shock</b> <b>excitations</b> are obtained by substituting the optimal bounded control into the vibration equations and solving them. The further remarkable vibration suppression capability of the optimal bounded control compared with the passive control {{and the influence of}} the control parameters on the stochastic vibration suppression effectiveness are illustrated with numerical results.

In the integral field datasets, the galaxy presents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. The skewed line profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in the line-of-sight direction.

The three kinematic components have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions, line ratios, and electron densities. We model the line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities with our MAPPINGS IV shock and photoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data and the models. The models demonstrate that the different emission line properties are caused by major galactic outflows that introduce <b>shock</b> <b>excitation</b> in addition to photoionisation by star-forming activities.

We examine two types of <b>shock</b> <b>excitations</b> that excite a subset of plate modes, and systematically study, nonlinear modal interactions and passive broadband targeted energy transfer phenomena occurring between the plate and the attachments. The following attachment configurations are considered: (i) a single ungrounded, strongly (essentially) nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) attachment—termed nonlinear energy sink (NES); (ii) a set of two SDOF NESs attached at different points of the plate; and (iii) a single multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) NES with multiple essential stiffness nonlinearities. We perform parametric studies by varying the parameters and locations of the NESs, in order to optimize passive TETs from the plate modes to the attachments, and we showed that the optimal position for the NES attachments are at the antinodes of the linear modes of the plate. The parametric study of the damping coefficient of the SDOF NES showed that TETs decreasing with lower values of the coefficient and moreover we showed that the threshold of maximum energy level of the system with strong TETs occured in discrete models is by far {{beyond the limits of}} the engineering design of the continua. We examine in detail the underlying dynamical mechanisms influencing TETs by means of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in combination with wavelet transforms. This integrated approach enables us to systematically study the strong modal interactions occurring between the essentially nonlinear NESs and different plate modes, and to detect the dominant resonance captures between the plate modes and the NESs that cause the observed TETs. Moreover, we perform comparative studies of the performance of different types of NESs and of the linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) attached to the plate instead of the NESs.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to vehicular vibration and shocks has {{been related to}} discomfort, reduced work efficiency and various health and safety risks for the drivers, specifically for the off-road vehicle drivers. Enhancement of shock and vibration environment of such vehicles involves characterization of vibration environment, biodynamic response of the driver, design and analysis of secondary suspension, and seating dynamics. Relationships between biodynamic measures are derived through analysis of measured data and selected biodynamic models. The magnitude of variations in subject characteristics and test conditions can be significantly reduced by representing 'to-the-body' biodynamic characteristics in terms of apparent mass (APMS) and by identifying a range of test conditions applicable to off-road vehicle driving. It is further shown that normalized APMS correlates well with the 'through the body' biodynamic function, {{expressed in terms of}} seat-to-head transmissibility (STHT). A synthesis of reported data is performed to propose a range of idealized biodynamic response characteristics. A three degree-of-freedom biodynamic model of the occupant is developed using measured response characteristics. Occupant-seat interactions are investigated through measurement and analysis of contact force and area. The results are utilized to propose a nonlinear and asymmetric seat cushion model. A nonlinear suspension seat model is further developed to incorporate asymmetric force-velocity and nonlinear force-deflection characteristics of the damper and elastic end-stops, respectively. A combined human-suspension seat model is finally derived upon integrating the proposed occupant, cushion and suspension models. The results show that the model is an effective tool for assessment of seating dynamic comfort and whole-body vibration exposure. The results of a comprehensive parametric study clearly revealed that attenuation of continuous and shock-type excitations pose conflicting design requirements. It is thus proposed to develop suspension design for optimal attenuation of continuous vibration, while the severity of end-stop impacts caused by shock-type excitations be minimized through design of optimal buffers. The suspension performance under continuous and <b>shock</b> <b>excitations</b> is assessed in terms of Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT) and Vibration Dose Value (VDV) ratio, respectively. Two different optimization problems are formulated to minimize the SEAT and VDV ratios. The results suggest that soft and lightly damped suspension with low degree of damping asymmetry coupled with low friction and large mass can enhance vibration isolation performance. Thick and soft elastic buffers with linear stiffness characteristics result in low VDV ratio response. The proposed design with optimal suspension and buffer parameters yields considerable reduction in both SEAT and VDV ratio response under selected classes of excitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{response}} of the solar atmosphere to excitations by large amplitude acoustic waves with radiation damping now included. Monochromatic adiabatic waves, due to unbalanced heating, generate continuously rising chromospheric temperature plateaus in which the low frequency resonances quickly die out. All non-adiabatic calculations lead to stable mean chromospheric temperature distributions determined by shock dissipation and radiative cooling. For nonadiabatic monochromatic wave excitation, a critical frequency νcr ∼ 1 / 25 Hz is confirmed, which separates domains of different resonance behaviour. For waves of ννcr persistent resonance oscillations occur, which are perpetuated by <b>shock</b> merging. <b>Excitation</b> with acoustic frequency spectra produces distinct dynamical mean chromosphere models where the detailed temperature distributions depend on the shape of the assumed spectra. The stochasticity of the spectra and the ongoing shock merging lead to a persistent resonance behaviour of the atmosphere. The acoustic spectra show a distinct shape evolution with height such that at great height a pure 3 min band becomes increasingly dominant. With our Eulerian code we did not find appreciable mass flows at the top boundary. Key words: hydrodynamics – shock waves – waves – Sun: chromosphere – Sun: oscillations 1...|$|R
40|$|Oil-free microturbomachinery (MTM) {{are inevitably}} {{subjected}} to base or foundation excitations: multiple periodic load excitations from internal combustion (IC) engines in turbochargers, for example. Too large base excitations can produce severe damage, even failure, due to hard collision or rubbing contact between a rotor and its bearings. Therefore, it is paramount {{to evaluate the}} reliability of rotor-air bearing systems to withstanding base load excitations. In 2008, intermittent <b>shock</b> <b>excitations,</b> up to 30 g (pk-pk), were introduced to a test rig consisting of a rotor (0. 825 kg) supported on two hybrid flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings (FPTPBs). The experiments demonstrated {{the reliability of the}} gas bearings to withstanding external transient load excitations. Presently, a shaker delivers periodic load excitations to the base plate supporting the test rig. The whole system, weighing 48 kg, is supported on two soft coil springs and its lowest natural frequency is ~ 5 Hz. The rod connecting the shaker to the base plate is not affixed rigidly to the test rig base. The rod merely pushes on the base plate and hence the induced based motions are intermittent with multiple impacts and frequencies. As with most practical conditions, the base motion frequencies (5 - 12 Hz) are low respective to the operating speed of the rotor-bearing system. Rotor speed coast down tests evidence the rotor-bearing system natural frequency when the gas bearings are supplied with feed pressures increasing from 2. 36 to 5. 08 bar (ab). Shaker excitation induced rotor response, relative to the bearing housings, contains the main input frequency (5 - 12 Hz) and its super harmonics; and because of the intermittency of the base motions, it also excites the rotor-bearing system natural frequency, with smaller motion amplitudes than synchronous motion components. The excitation of the system natural frequency does not mean rotordynamic instability. With base induced motions, the rotor motion amplitude at the system natural frequency increases as the gas bearing feed pressure decreases, as the rotor speed increases, and as the shaker input excitation frequency increases (5 - 12 Hz). Hence, the test rotor-air bearing system is highly sensitive to base motions, intermittent in character, in particular when the gas bearings are supplied with a low feed pressure. Predicted rotor motion responses obtained from XLTRC 2 and an analytical rigid rotor model, both including the (measured) periodic base motions, show good correlation with the measurements. The research results demonstrate further the applicability of gas bearings into oil-free high speed MTM...|$|R
