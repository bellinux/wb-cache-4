40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{decentralized}} event-triggered communication {{scheme based on}} asynchronous sampling. The event-triggered communication scheme {{does not depend on}} the full-order state of the system. Several spatially distributed sensor nodes are employed to collect the state data. Each node transmits the samples according to a <b>sub-communication</b> scheme. An L 2 controller design method is developed for the decentralized event-triggered control system, which can be used to codesign of the decentralized event-triggered communication scheme and L 2 controller. A numerical example illustrates the merit and effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{the past}} decade, {{supercomputing}} has witnessed {{a paradigm shift}} from massively parallel supercomputers to network computers. Though dedicated high end supercomputers still have {{their place in the}} market yet combined unused CPU cycles of desktop PCs available in the campus network can form comparable virtual supercomputers. Consequently, Parallel Processing in a network of PCs are attracted a boost of attention and becoming {{one of the most promising}} areas of large scale scientific computing. In this paper, we are presenting Grid-enabled PC Cluster (GPCC), exhibiting low latency and bandwidth scalable <b>sub-communication</b> system. The design of the GPCC is such that it keeps in view the socket buffer size of local and non-local nodes in the network environment. The design is relatively easy to use, inexpensive to apply and extremely accurate. The highly accurate results provided by TCP/IP ping-pong were coupled with parallel matrix multiplication benchmark. Parallel Matrix Multiplication (PMM) performance benchmark is used to test the GPCC for node-to-node network performance and parallel floating point performance of all involved processor in a local and non-local cluster environment. PMM benchmark is developed on the basis of master-slave model using dynamic distribution scheme...|$|E
