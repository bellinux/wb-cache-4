When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried to jump up with the move, causing him to land <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> {{top of his head}} and suffer neck damage. Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{distinguished}} {{the payment}} {{that had been}} ordered in this case from expenses that a State might incidentally incur after an injunction is issued in order to comply; the costs of post-judgment compliance are ancillary, whereas the costs of making up for pre-judgment non-compliance were more like an award of damages to the plaintiff. Noting {{that there were no}} precedents <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> point, the Court expressed disapproval of those precedents that hinted at allowing restoration of funds previously withheld.|$|E
25|$|This {{ultimately}} placed {{responsibility for}} Sea Lions success <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> {{the shoulders of}} Raeder and Göring, neither of whom had the slightest enthusiasm for the venture and, in fact, did little to hide their opposition to it. Nor did Directive 16 provide for a combined operational headquarters, similar to the Allies' creation of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) for the later Normandy landings, under which all three service branches (Army, Navy, and Air Force) could work together to plan, coordinate, and execute such a complex undertaking.|$|E
50|$|Demarco’s main {{professional}} asset was {{his sharp}} eye for observation. This is amply attested by the thirty-four works {{we have from}} his forty-two year career in Malta after his return from Paris. All of his speculative reflections, including his philosophical ones, <b>squarely</b> rest <b>on</b> the authority of concrete experience and on pure sense data.|$|R

25|$|Yang Jisheng, {{a long-time}} {{communist}} party member and {{a reporter for}} the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, puts the blame <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> Maoist policies and the political system of totalitarianism, such as diverting agricultural workers to steel production instead of growing crops, and exporting grain at the same time. During the course of his research, Yang uncovered that some 22 million tons of grain was held in public granaries {{at the height of the}} famine, reports of the starvation went up the bureaucracy only to be ignored by top officials, and the authorities ordered that statistics be destroyed in regions where population decline became evident.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{ordinances}} of secession {{passed by}} the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned {{the plight of the}} 'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures. However, at least four states—South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas—also passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of which laid the blame <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the movement to abolish slavery and that movement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the Fugitive slave clause of the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Eugen Mansfeld, who {{was present}} at the battle as a Reserve Leutnant in the German forces, laid the blame for German defeat <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> Franke. Mansfeld stated that Major Ritter had {{occupied}} an excellent defensive position at Otavifontein, but that on the morning of 28 June 1915 Franke arrived with his staff officer and ordered a redisposition of Ritter's forces south of the original position, separating Ritter's three artillery batteries and leaving the companies of troops widely dispersed in no logical order. Mansfeld suggested that if the Germans had kept to Ritter's original plan, the South African forces—who were unable to transport water by railway—would have been forced to retreat to the nearest water station, with severe losses to their horses as a result.|$|E

2500|$|The 1979 {{amendment}} was {{considered as a}} radical departure in clinching the issue of Bargadari settlement on a judicial basis. Previously {{it was almost impossible}} for a tenant to prove his tenancy rights legally owing to the judicial and administrative red-tapism. But in the new amendments, the responsibility of disproving a claim to bagadari rights was <b>squarely</b> put <b>on</b> the landowners. Self-Cultivation was defined as cultivation on the basis of physical participation by members of the landowner's family and resumption of land under self-cultivation were made under many stringent conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies in 2008 {{published}} FASTS Statement on Climate Change which states: [...] Global {{climate change}} is real and measurable...To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses {{in the face of}} these impacts, the policy objective must remain <b>squarely</b> focused <b>on</b> returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions. The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity.|$|R
25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, {{could not have}} been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{idea was}} to {{implement}} welfare programs that were acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as safe working conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women's and child labor. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program. Bismarck's program centred <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> insurance programs designed to increase productivity, and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers' government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree.|$|E
25|$|As such, she campaigned heavily against licentiousness, {{prostitution}} and contraceptives, arguing instead for the rhythm method. She campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Acts, {{arguing that it}} was a pseudo-legalisation of prostitution. Her 1878 Counsel to Parents on the Moral Education of their Children was an essay on {{prostitution and}} marriage arguing against the Contagious Diseases Acts. She was conservative in all senses except that she believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions. Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the shoulders of the woman. The book was controversial, being rejected by 12 publishers, before being printed by Hatchard and Company. The proofs for the original edition were destroyed {{by a member of the}} publisher's board and a change of title was required for a new edition to be printed.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{statistical}} {{measures of}} strength of association, although pioneered by Pearson deliberately to be acausal, nowadays are routinely {{used to measure}} causal efficacy. But their acausal origins have left them ill suited to this latter purpose. I distinguish between two different conceptions of causal efficacy, and argue that: 1) Both conceptions can be useful 2) The statistical measures only attempt to capture the first of them 3) They are not fully successful even at this 4) An alternative definition more <b>squarely</b> based <b>on</b> causal thinking not only captures the second conception, it can also capture the first one better too...|$|R
60|$|Lashings {{were cast}} {{off the boat}} and the falls attached, when the men fled to holding-vantage just ere the whale arrived. She struck the Mary Turner <b>squarely</b> {{amidships}} <b>on</b> the port beam, so that, from the poop, one saw, as well as heard, her long side bend and spring back like a limber fabric. The starboard rail buried under the sea as the schooner heeled to the blow, and, as she righted with a violent lurch, the water swashed across the deck to the knees of the sailors about the boat and spouted out of the port scuppers.|$|R
50|$|The stories usually {{follow a}} single group of survivors, {{caught up in}} the sudden rush of the crisis. The {{narrative}} generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague, then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities, the failure of those authorities, through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large-scale organization and the characters' subsequent attempts to survive on their own. Such stories are often <b>squarely</b> focused <b>on</b> the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe, and how their personalities are changed by the stress, often acting on more primal motivations (fear, self-preservation) than they would display in normal life.|$|R
25|$|The SS Elbe {{incident}} {{resulted in}} a court case {{which took place in}} Rotterdam in November 1895. The court found that the steamship Crathie was alone at fault for the collision. Amazingly the captain was merely censured for leaving the disaster, a verdict that astounded the maritime world at the time. The blame was put <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the first mate, who had left his post at the bridge at the critical time to chat in the galley with other crew members, and therefore had failed in his job of operating the ship's warning lights. The captain, officers and sailors of the SS Elbe received no rebuke from the court either, which caused some concern amongst the German public. The crew of the fishing smack Wildflower each were given, by Kaiser Wilhelm II, a silver and gold watch bearing his monogram and £5 as a gesture of thanks for saving the lives of the eighteen German citizens, an Austrian, and the English pilot. They also received other medals and gifts in the following years.|$|E
25|$|Al-Arian's five-month, 13-day {{trial began}} with frenzied {{attention}} from national media outlets. The prosecution's case was built largely on FBI wiretaps and fax transmissions gathered between 1994 {{and the time}} of Mr. Al-Arian's arrest in 2003. The surveillance included roughly 20,000 hours of dialogue from 472,000 wiretapped telephone conversations on 18 tapped lines gathered from 1994 to 2003. While such wiretaps taken by the intelligence arm of the FBI are usually kept secret from federal criminal investigators, provisions in the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allow their use in certain trials dealing with terrorism. At the end of the prosecution's case, Al-Arian's lawyers chose not to present any witnesses in his defense and rested without offering a defense, hoping to leave the burden of proof <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the government's shoulders. The trial concluded in November 2005. After 13 days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Al-Arian in December on 8 of 17 counts and deadlocked on the remaining nine. Two co-defendants were acquitted of all charges and another co-defendant was also acquitted on majority of his charges. The verdict was seen as a major embarrassment to the government's prosecution and to the Patriot Act.|$|E
25|$|Giotto, (1266–1337), by {{tradition}} a shepherd {{boy from the}} hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time. Giotto, possibly influenced by Pietro Cavallini and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of frescoes of the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin that he painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua set a new standard for narrative pictures. His Ognissanti Madonna hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, {{in the same room}} as Cimabue's Santa Trinita Madonna and Duccio's Ruccellai Madonna where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made. One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.|$|E

In this, and in his 1993 analysis, Māori: The Crisis and the Challenge, he has developed his ideas on the failures of Māoridom, castigating both the traditional leadership and the radical movement for dwelling on the injustices {{of the past and}} expecting others to resolve them, instead of encouraging Māori to get on and help themselves. The blame for Māori underperformance he puts <b>squarely</b> back <b>on</b> Māori, for not making the most of the opportunities given them.|$|R
50|$|Hamidullah {{received}} a gallantry award for Courage on 15 December 1973. M.

Hamidullah's second book was a two-volume set about the Independence War. He also authored four more books and made two documentaries on the events surrounding the war and post-independence. The Bangladesh Government named Road 23 {{in the town of}} Banani, Dhaka after him. Along with those of 55 other fighters, his biography was included in a CD released by the Bangladesh government.|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} {{of information and}} communication technologies (ICTs) is no more an option for the higher education intuitions (HEIs) rather indispensable to their survival in both developed and developing states. For the later, technologies hold unprecedented opportunities however; successful implementation of educational technologies <b>squarely</b> depends <b>on</b> the ability of developers and users in harnessing modern digital-gadgets to stay available and accessible 24 / 7. If the required technical infrastructure (tools and professionals) and live help-desks are not there, eLearning solutions in higher education continue underplaying their role as well as discouraging the users from becoming digitally literate. This paper underlines the role and significance of sustained technical support for successful implementation of eLearning projects in HEIs of the developing states...|$|R

Alexander Pope was an early proponent of less formal gardens, calling in a 1713 article for gardens with the [...] "amiable simplicity of unadorned nature". Other writers in the 18th century who encouraged less formal, and more natural, gardens included Joseph Addison and Lord Shaftesbury. The evolution of cottage gardens can be followed in the issues of The Cottage Gardener (1848–61), edited by George William Johnson, where the emphasis is <b>squarely</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "florist's flowers", carnations and auriculas in fancy varieties that were originally cultivated as a highly competitive blue-collar hobby.|$|E

Ann's strained relationship with her ex-husband Ed slowly mends, as does the girls' relationship with his new wife, Vickie. Julie and Barbara advance through high school and into the working world, and Julie eventually marries flight attendant Max Horvath. Alex, the orphaned son of Ann's deceased boyfriend, moves in, changing the dynamics in the female-dominated apartment. Later in the series run, Julie gives birth to a daughter, [...] "Little Annie" [...] Horvath, Barbara marries dental student Mark Royer, and Ann's mother Katherine moves nearby.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{a theory}} of the supply of inside money that is <b>squarely</b> based <b>on</b> optimisation, and which sets out from the question, 'As outside money has an opportunity cost that a mere promise to pay outside money does not, why is outside money used at all?'. The theory identifies the nominal {{rate of return on}} capital as the key determinant of the supply of inside money. So just as the nominal rate of return on capital is the cost of demanding money, so the nominal rate of return is identified here as the reward for supplying (inside) money. And just as the demand for money is negatively related to the nominal rate of return on capital, so the supply of inside money is positively related to the nominal rate of return on capital. ...|$|R
