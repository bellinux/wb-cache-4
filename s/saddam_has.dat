40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (March 2003), v. 2 no. 3 Given the World War II analogy that apparently guides U. S. policy for {{a transition to}} a stable, democratic, post-Saddam Iraq, what lessons might American policymakers draw from our nation-building experience in post- 1945 Germany and Japan? The Bush administration's goal is to disarm Iraq. But it must make certain that Iraq never again troubles {{the stability of the}} Persian Gulf region. For this to happen, Saddam's ambitions to lead the Arab world in the liberation of Jerusalem must be utterly discredited, both in the eyes of his own people and of the world, especially the Arab world. This will probably require, as in Germany and Japan after 1945, an unambiguous military defeat of Baathist Iraq, followed by war crimes trials. The risk for the United States is that defeat, trials and a politique of public shaming may make Iraqis less, not more, receptive to a democratization process because <b>Saddam</b> <b>has</b> already effectively de-Baathicized his own people. Saddam's organizations of repressive state power must certainly be exorcised. In both post-war German and Japan, however the Allies discovered that, even though freed from SS, Gestapo, Kemptai and party supervision, entrenched government bureaucracies, in which alumni of the defunct ancient rÃ©gimes continued to exercise their authority, remained wedded to authoritarian methods and hence proved remarkably resistant to the imposition of democratic ideas and practices...|$|E
40|$|Thereâ€™s a {{risk that}} governments have learned nothing from the stampede to war in Iraq, writes Rodney Tiffen THIS THURSDAY, just {{two days before the}} {{election}}, the Prime Minister will appear at the National Press Club, where - at the same time during the last election campaign - he committed one of his most infamous fabrications. At the beginning of the 2001 campaign, the government vigorously publicised the â€˜children overboardâ€™ incident, based on false evidence that some asylum seekers had thrown their children into the water. Within days, it became apparent inside the government that this information was wrong. The photos distributed as evidence of the incident were actually from another occasion, and showed children leaving a sinking ship. There were claims about a video, but in fact it showed nothing. The naval personnel involved failed to confirm the incident. After a couple of days of castigating the alleged perpetrators for their lack of humanity, government ministers went silent on the issue. None of them expressed any doubts about the original claims, and the issue disappeared from the public agenda. In the week before the election, the Australian reported some of the disquiet within the Navy about what had been claimed, and desperate efforts were made within the government to avoid admitting publicly that their original claims were wrong. In this atmosphere of mounting controversy, Prime Minister Howard appeared at the National Press Club. He declared that an Office of National Assessments (ONA) report in his possession confirmed what the government had been saying - despite the fact that a covering letter to the month-old report, written immediately after the first ministerial statements, made clear that the basis for the ONAâ€™s report could not be confirmed and that the report may well have been based on ministerial public statements (which {{turned out to be the}} case). According to David Marr and Marian Wilkinson, writing in their book Dark Victory, it was unprecedented for a prime minister to quote directly from an ONA report in this way. John Howard has vigorously defended his integrity on this issue, claiming that he didnâ€™t know of the information inside the government at the time that contradicted the official version of events. Some, such as Mike Scrafton, a former military officer who was working in the Minister for Defenceâ€™s office, have tried to puncture this defence of politically convenient ignorance. But incompatible accounts of their telephone conversations still leaves a choice of whom to believe. The documentary evidence about the ONA report leaves no room for doubt. The Prime Minister deliberately misrepresented the material in front of him for partisan purposes. But as well as providing an irrefutable challenge to the Prime Ministerâ€™s credibility, the incident exposes the dilemma about the role of intelligence information in democratic politics. With the Iraq war the politicisation of intelligence information was to enter a more sinister and consequential stage. The essential problem of intelligence information in a democracy is that at the centre of debate are claims about information to which the public is denied access. This leaves open the possibility - as in the case of children overboard - for that information to be misrepresented for partisan purposes. But even when the information is not distorted it is problematic for democratic processes, because at its heart is an appeal to secret authority rather than a public testing of evidence. The government is telling the public: if you knew what we know you would have no choice but to agree with us. Before the Iraq war, â€˜coalition of the willingâ€™ governments paraded their allegedly intelligence-based certainty about Saddam possessing weapons of mass destruction, and denigrated the character and patriotism of anyone who dared to doubt them. Following the failure to find any such weapons, there were inquiries into the intelligence agencies in America, Britain and Australia. But the idea that innocent and open-minded governments were misled by poor intelligence into going to war inverts the truth. The invasion of Iraq was a government-led war, not an intelligence-led war. Governments already intent on war used intelligence that suited their preconceived views and ignored that which contradicted or questioned it. The way the debate was constructed forced critics of the war to prove a negative - the absence of weapons of mass destruction. In any situation, this was almost impossible. Given the difficulties of access under Saddam, and his long record of evil, anyone making such a claim would have been politically vulnerable in the extreme. The Howard governmentâ€™s political management of the subsequent reports has been effective. It has successfully portrayed the process as containing some unfortunate technical errors, but argued that no one was guilty of anything, none of the leaders was insincere or acted improperly, and is all that is required some fine-tuning. This neatly underplays the recklessness of their decisions and the scale of the misrepresentations. It also frames the problem as one of a lack of tactical acuity by the intelligence agencies rather than a huge strategic blunder by their governments. When secret intelligence information is invoked as a justification for a policy, then it means that dissent often emerges through leaks or briefings by dissenters. Rather than a debate about options and a testing of evidence, this leads only to a witch hunt to find the leaker. Secret information is also seductive: there is tendency to assume that its restricted access means that it is superior in quality. The pros and cons of going to war against Iraq did not rest on the minutiae of intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction. Information on the public record, available to any informed citizen, should have produced far more caution. First, the case for war rested on a fundamental non-sequitur: The political momentum or the invasion came from the attack of 9 / 11, but Iraq had nothing at all to do with 9 / 11. That attack was mounted by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, and relations between Saddam and Osama were almost non-existent. Indeed they came from opposing ideological creeds and viewed each other as enemies. Only someone who tended to lump all Muslims or Arabs together into a â€˜crusadeâ€™ (as George Bush so ineptly labeled the war against terror) would fail to see this. So, second, the attack on Iraq was a diversion from the main â€˜war on terrorismâ€™. Indeed, it might even be counter-productive if, by further inflaming anti-American opinion in the Arab world, the effect would be to increase rather than decrease the fanatical sentiments on which terrorism thrives. To say that the defeat of <b>Saddam</b> <b>has</b> made the Western world or the Middle East safer from terrorism is - to say the least - not yet proved. Third, the war was a leap into the unknown. President Bushâ€™s simplistic hubris that it was just a matter of replacing Saddam with freedom should have made any good conservative pause. It would have taken extraordinary prescience to foresee in detail the mess that is Iraq today (and probably tomorrow). Who forecast the horrors of the kidnappings, the car bombs or the abuses of Abu Ghraib? But the lack of attention to the likely problems of a post-Saddam Iraq seems breathtakingly stupid. The final prop justifying the war - and which, given the absence of WMD and the failure at least so far to secure post-war stability, has retrospectively become a more prominent refrain - is that the world and the Iraqi people are better off without Saddam. Certainly it is hard to exaggerate the horrors of Saddamâ€™s rule, and he would rank near the top of any list of barbaric dictators in the world. But the list of governments which practise humanitarian abuses hardly stops at Saddam, and if this is the justification we can look forward to a series of invasions. Moreover, if military intervention for humanitarian purposes was the aim, it would have been better to deploy the troops in the Congo or the Sudan. In sum, the invasion of Iraq was the product of monumental misjudgments and problematic justifications. Most of the reservations mentioned above were obvious at the time, but all were brushed aside. How did governments so readily ignore all reality checks? How did the threat of being called a dupe of Saddam or unpatriotic make opposition politicians afraid to speak out, and make the debate so one-sided? Why did so much of the media act more as cheer leaders than as analysts? In examining how such a decision was made by democratic governments, and how they so grossly misled their citizens, what we need is not an inquiry into the adequacy of intelligence services, but into the dynamics of a political stampede. Poor intelligence was not at the heart of why we went to war, and even the best intelligence available would probably have been unable to stop the political momentum that the allied governments were able to manufacture. Understanding the dynamics of that political stampede is the most important post-war inquiry we need to undertake.
