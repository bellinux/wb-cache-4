50|$|The Linen Memorial, {{conceived}} and created in 2001 by Lycia Danielle Trouton {{is made from}} almost 400 Irish linen handkerchiefs listing almost 4000 names of those killed during the fraught period in contemporary Northern Ireland, called 'The Troubles';. It was conceived in 1999 after the artist exhibited at The Waterworks, Antrim Road, North Belfast. Subsequently, Lycia did research {{into the fabric of}} linen, at The Linen Museum, Lisburn and also toured a former flax <b>scutching</b> <b>mill</b> in the Irish countryside.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s, the Penitentiary {{created a}} flax plant which {{employed}} {{more than half}} of its inmates. Inmates worked on construction and in the fields, and were paid $0.50-$1.00 per day. The plant was touted nationally as a way to make the prison financially self-sustaining, and to rehabilitate prisoners by giving them something to do and preparing them to work. In 1925, OSP had the largest flax <b>scutching</b> <b>mill</b> in the world, with 175 workers producing 100-150 tons of flax per day.|$|E
50|$|Camlough River {{is a small}} {{meandering}} {{stream that}} makes its way from Camlough to the Newry Canal. It was once a vibrant fast flowing river, teeming with trout and the power source of approximately nine mills. The first of these mills was Kelly's Flax and <b>Scutching</b> <b>Mill</b> in Camlough village. It was situated {{to the rear of}} Carragher's house. Established around the mid-18th century, the mill comprised nine buildings, two of which were split level. It was powered by water from two ponds {{on either side of the}} Keggal Road.|$|E
50|$|The {{banks of}} the Ballynahinch River {{in the early days}} (18th century) were dotted with little bleach greens, but as {{bleaching}} became more centralised in the Lagan-Bann region, the small greens went out of existence. The first water-powered <b>scutch</b> <b>mills</b> were introduced about 1750, the second in Down being at Rademon.|$|R
50|$|The Moynihan family {{operated}} a water mill fed by a sluice from the Durrus River, {{starting at the}} Creamery and continuing to the Mill. It had extensive use during the Second World War. Moynihan was the headmaster in the school. In the 19th century {{there was also a}} <b>scutch</b> <b>mill</b> listed in Griffiths Valuations.|$|R
50|$|Scutching is done {{several ways}} by machine. <b>Scutching</b> <b>mills</b> started in Ireland, and were {{commonly}} used there by 1850, {{at a time when}} hand scutching was still common in Continental Europe. Machine scutching, while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than scutching by hand. One method of machine scutching is to crush the stalks between two metal rollers so that parts of the stalk can be separated.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of airborne dust and bacteria were determined in 12 flax <b>scutching</b> <b>mills</b> {{and in two}} milk processing plants in Normandy, France. A total of 308 of 340 flax workers and 111 of 113 milk processors volunteered to answer a respiratory questionnaire. Personal exposure to airborne dust in the <b>scutching</b> <b>mills</b> varied from 22. 2 mg/m 3 to 144 mg/m 3 and areal concentrations from 8. 92 mg/m 3 to 47. 1 mg/m 3. The concentration of Gram negative bacteria ranged from 3970 (colony forming units) cfu/m 3 to 67, 900 cfu/m 3 and that of total bacteria from 12, 900 cfu/m 3 to more than 600, 000 cfu/m 3. In all, 20 % of the flax scutchers were found, {{on the basis of}} the questionnaire, to suffer from persistent cough and 25 % from chronic phlegm production. The corresponding figures among milk processors were 3. 6 % and 4. 5 %. Unexpectedly, only 12. 5 % of the scutchers appeared to suffer from byssinotic symptoms even though they were heavily exposed to airborne dust and bacteria. The low prevalence of byssinosis might be due to self selection of the workforce or a relatively low concentration of the causative agent despite high airborne contamination...|$|R
50|$|The mill at Ballakermeen, Onchan was a <b>scutching</b> {{and corn}} <b>mill.</b> Permission {{for it to}} be built was granted in 1755. It was in {{existence}} in the 1780s but had gone by 1790.|$|R
50|$|The Employment of Children Act 1903, while {{primarily}} {{providing for}} industries outside {{the scope of}} the Factory Act, incidentally secured that children employed as half Acts of timers should not also be employed in other occupations. The Notice of Accidents Act 1906 amended the whole system of notification of accidents, simultaneously in mines, quarries, factories and workshops, and will be set out in following paragraphs. The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations) to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in flax <b>scutch</b> <b>mills,</b> thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{much of his}} {{writings}} tom Jones Hughes has returned {{again and again to}} the theme of Irish regionalism. Notwithstanding his acknowledgement of the role of cultural, and indeed ethnic, factors in the identification of patterns, he has most frequently employed economic variables in a search for regional indicators. His classic cartographic portrayal of the extend of eighteenth and nineteenth century landlord improvements was based on a detailed interpretation of the Griffith Valuation, and analyses of agricultural statistics provided him with the configuration of major regions of economic specialisation in post-Famine rural Ireland. Even his more recent writings have placed considerable emphasis upon economic data, as witness his mapping of farms with a valuation of one hundred pounds or more. While the ultimate goal of all this analysis has been to identify and measure the nature, scale and intensity of spatial differentiation within this island, and while he would probably recoil from being labelled an economic geographer, it is nonetheless apparent that Tom Jones Hughes’s writings suggest a strong interest in regional economies, their landscapes and their socio-cultural manifestations. This essay seeks to identify the agricultural background of probably the most distinctive regional economy to have matured in nineteenth century Ireland, the linen industry of the northern half of the country. Specifically, this essay will explore the regional dimension of flax cultivation and its immediate proto-industrial offshoot, <b>scutch</b> <b>milling.</b> The secondary stages of textile production – the spinning, weaving and bleaching processes – do not form part of the present study...|$|R
