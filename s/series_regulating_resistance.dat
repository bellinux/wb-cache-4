30|$|Rice genome {{contains}} 74 MAPKKK genes (MPKKK 36 and MPKKK 56 are {{the same}} gene), 8 MAPKK genes, and 17 MAPK genes (Hamel et al. 2006; Reyna and Yang 2006; Rao et al. 2010). The markedly different numbers of {{the three types of}} proteins suggest that MAP kinase cascades initiated with different MAPKKK may sh{{are the same}} MAPKK or MAPK, or that a MAPKK or MAPK may be involved in multiple biological activities. The large numbers of MAPKKK in the rice genome also suggest that MAP kinase cascades may be important for many physiological processes. However, the importance of MAP kinase cascades in pathogen-induced rice defense signaling cannot be evaluated because only three rice MAPKs and one rice MAPKKK have been confirmed to be involved in rice–pathogen interactions so far. The MPK 5 /OsMAPK 5 (named OsMAPK 5 in Xiong and Yang 2003) negatively <b>regulates</b> rice <b>resistance</b> to fungal Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial pathogens Burkholderia glumae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) (Seo et al. 2011). Rice MPK 6 plays opposite roles in the rice response to Xoo infection; it positively <b>regulates</b> local <b>resistance</b> but negatively <b>regulates</b> systemic acquired <b>resistance</b> after Xoo invasion (Yuan et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2010). Rice MPK 12 positively <b>regulates</b> <b>resistance</b> to Xoo (Seo et al. 2011).

50|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling is an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. When transmural pressure increases, sphingosine kinase 1 phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P, which binds to the S1P2 receptor in plasma membrane of cells. This leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium, and activates Rac and Rhoa signaling pathways. Collectively, these serve to increase MLCK activity and decrease MLCP activity, promoting muscle contraction. This allows arterioles to increase resistance in response to increased blood pressure and thus maintain constant blood flow. The Rhoa and Rac portion of the signaling pathway provides a calcium-independent way to <b>regulate</b> <b>resistance</b> artery tone.|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{determined}} that the expression of Os 03 g 16030 (named OsHsp 18.0 -CI according to Sarkar et al. 2009) was up-regulated by inoculating with Xoc strain RS 105. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsHsp 18.0 -CI exhibited enhanced resistance to RS 105, and lines with suppressed expression exhibited increased susceptibility to RS 105. Using an RNA-seq strategy, we further found that the enhanced expression of defense-related genes involved in basal defense was enriched in OsHsp 18.0 -CI-overexpressing (OE) lines compared with wild-type (WT). The expression of these genes was activated more strongly in OE than in WT plants after inoculation with RS 105.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} the disease resistance of transgenic {{lines in the}} T 1 generation, two lines (CD 39 R- 7 and CD 39 R- 11) were selected for inoculation with RS 105, with WT plants as a control. The progeny of the two T 1 lines showed significant reductions in lesion length and were identified as positive plants that carried the construct pU 1301 -OsHsp 18.0 -CI (Fig.  2 c and d). Two lines were further identified that exhibited resistance against RS 105 in the T 2 generation (Fig.  4 a and b). Consistent with the enhanced resistance against RS 105, the bacteria populations of CD 39 R- 7 was dramatically less than control at 4 dpi and 8 dpi in leaves (Fig.  4 c).

30|$|In general honeys tested {{from the}} three {{different}} areas showed varied bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against the tested multidrug resistant bacteria. However, pharmacological standardization and clinical evaluation {{on the effect of}} honey are essential before using honey as a preventive and curative measure to common diseases related to the tested bacterial species. This bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity was different by sites of collection and colour of the honeys. Honey from Samre area showed relatively better bacteriostatic and antibacterial activity than Temben and Atsbi districts. This could be due to the variations in hydrogen peroxide, crops and vegetation’s in these districts available for honeybees to make honey. Both control and test K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were inhibited at relatively higher concentration of honey than the other bacteria in this study. This might be related to nature of the bacteria i.e. low permeability of cell wall, genetic capacity to express resistant mechanisms and mutation in chromosomal genes which <b>regulate</b> <b>resistance</b> genes. Red honeys in this study showed better anti bacterial activity against both control and test bacteria than the white honeys.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} a role of vesicular trafficking in plant cell death. For example, rice spotted leaf 28 (SPL 28) encoding a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit μ 1 (AP 1 M 1), which {{is involved in the}} post-Golgi trafficking pathway (Qiao et al. 2010). The spl 28 mutants displayed a necrotic lesion phenotype spontaneously in the absence of pathogen attack. Another example is the discovery of the μ subunit of Arabidopsis adaptor protein- 2 (AP 2 M), mediating clathrin-coated vesicle formation, is also involved in the necrotic lesion formation. An ap 2 m mutant displayed reduced amount of cell death after Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (Hatsugai et al. 2016). A third example is Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance 4 (EDR 4) negatively <b>regulating</b> <b>resistance</b> to powdery mildew. The EDR 4 interacts with clathrin heavy chain 2 (CHC 2) (Wu et al. 2015). The edr 4 mutants displayed cell death and reduced endocytosis rates, indicating that clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking is involved in cell deaths.

30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of immune receptors to plant survival, few components that mediate the downstream signaling cascade have yet been characterized. One method that has been successful at identifying such proteins is the yeast two-hybrid system. We used this approach to generate an XA 21 interactome (Seo et al. 2011). One of the isolated proteins was named XA 21 BINDING PROTEIN 21 (XB 21). XB 21 encodes an auxilin-like protein that <b>regulates</b> <b>resistance</b> to Xoo and is predicted to function in clatharin-mediated endocytosis (Park et al. manuscript in preparation). To investigate the function of XB 21, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen utilizing XB 21 as bait with a rice cDNA library. From this analysis, we identified LEUCINE RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 1 (LRR 1). LRR 1 shares 55 % identity and 68 % similarity with the extracellular domain of OsSERK 2. To determine if LRR 1 is required for XA 21 -mediated immunity, we assessed its function in rice plants in the presence and absence of XA 21.|$|R

Overexpression of OsHIR 1 (Zhou et al. 2010) or CaHIR 1 (Jung and Hwang 2007) in Arabidopsis both promoted {{the formation of}} cell death lesions (Jung and Hwang 2007). The cell death symptom of CaHIR 1 overexpressing plants was alleviated by simultaneously overexpressing CaLRR 1 (Jung and Hwang 2007). CaHIR 1 positively <b>regulates</b> <b>RESISTANCE</b> TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE PROTEIN 2 (RPS 2)-mediated immunity to Xcv (Choi et al. 2013; Jung and Hwang 2007; Jung et al. 2004; Choi et al. 2011). During infection by Xcv, the virulence factor FILAMENTOUS HAEMAGGLUTININ ADHESIN 1 (Fha 1) targets CaHIR 1 where it modulates cell death and suppresses pepper PR gene expression (Choi et al. 2013). Under normal conditions, CaLRR 1 and CaHIR 1 both co-localize at the plasma membrane (Choi et al. 2011), while CaHIR 1 -Fha 1 heterodimers were mostly found in endosomes during Xcv infection (Choi et al. 2013).
