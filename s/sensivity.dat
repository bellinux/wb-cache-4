The variation of characteristic performance values depend upon the variation of many design parameters. In this paper we present a scheme for accurately and efficiently determining such dependencies at cell level. Additionally we employ an approximation for the performance distribution which does not only rely on a few low-order moments and therefore also performs well in the tails of the distribution. A typical problem that can be handled in this way is for instance the computation of the probability that the leakage current of a cell or circuit is greater than a given thershold value. The same question occurs for power and delay dependencies. Furthermore, <b>sensivities</b> of such marginal probabilities can be determined. Thus, this approach may potentially assist parameter monitoring and optimisation in the fabrication process...|$|R

Parallel imaging enables the reconstruction of MRI images from undersampled multi-coil data that leads to a well-posed reconstruction problem.

40|$|Introduction: The {{most common}} {{standards}} {{being used for}} predicting the health risks of whole body vibrations are ISO 2631 - and BS 6844, presenting frequency weighting anfd different coefficients for different <b>sensivities</b> in variuse axes. In yhis study, vibration was measured about 900 minutes on 9 trains {{in one of the}} active lines of tehran metro with the aim of comparing the mentioned standards in evaluating whole body vibation.. Material and Method: In this research, in addition to evaluation of different kinds of vibration indicators, the differences of ISO 26331 - 1 and BS 6841 Standards have also been investigated. The amounts of r. m. s., vibration dose and daily vibration dose were measured in x, y and z axes for drivers seat and x axis for drivers back rest separately according to the instruction of the two standards.. Result: The mean calculated values of r. m. s and vibration dose on a basis of 135 6841 standard were lower than those values calculated according to ISO 2631 standard. Moreover, the results showed that 3 cases, based on the ISO standard, had risk level of higher than 17 m/s 1. 75 and 3 cases, had risk level of higher than 15 m/s 1. 75 value, provided by BS 6841.. Conclusion: Calculation according to the ISO 2631 - 1 standard show higher values. Indeed, ISO 2631 - 1 can provide a more secure criterion company to BS 6841, although the 15 m/s 1. 75 in BS is lower than the highest level of health guidance caution zone in ISO. Additionally, the association between r. m. s and vibration dose values in ISO 2631 is relatively lower than this association in BS 6841...|$|R
40|$|Purpose and significance: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to investigate}} social values of talent types that were identified based on the psychosocial classification of talents proposed by Tannenbaum (1983). According to this model talents can be classified based on their social values into scarcity talents that preserve and prolong life, surplus talents that elevate sensibilities and <b>sensivities,</b> quota talents that provide goods and services and anomalous talents that provide enjoyment. The societal value of a talent contributes to the degree to which parents in particular and governments and educational institutions in general make investment in the nurturance of this talent. Method: A likert-type questionnaire consisting of 60 different types of talents was developed based on the Tannenbaum Model. Talents were identified through reviewing inventions books, expert opinions and the Guinness Records. The questionnaire included 15 talent types for each class of the Tannenbaum Model. Each talent type was scored from 1 to 4 (1 = above-average; 2 = high; 3 = very high; 4 = extraordinarily high) based on its value as perceived by the participants. The questionnaire was administered to 601 people (female = % 36. 4; male = 63. 6) in a major city in the middle part of Turkey. Two criteria were used for participation in the study: Volunteer participation and being over 18 -years old. Their age ranged from 18 to 72 with a mean of 27. 14 and standard deviation of 10. 83. Their educational status also ranged from elementary school and high school graduates (% 38) to university students and university graduates (% 62). The scale was given to all participants face to face, taking 15 minutes for each participant. Paired-samples t-test was used to compare mean scores of the talent categories and independent-samples t-test was used to test gender differences. Results: Results showed that scarcity talents were rated as the highest (M = 3. 06; SD =. 57) followed by surplus talents (M = 2. 69; SD =. 61), quota talents (M= 1. 96; SD=. 62), and anomalous talents (M= 1. 90; SD=. 59). The differences between the means were found to be significant (p<. 00 for all). The highest rating was given to the item “the person who leads the independence war of a country” (M = 3. 49; SD =. 77); followed by “the person who discovers electricity” and “the person who finds the cure for cancer. ” The lowest rating was given to the item the person who makes the best saddles” (M = 1. 68; SD =. 97). Furthermore, female participants scored the scarcity talents and the surplus talents higher than male participants did. The differences were statistically significant (p<. 00). Effect sizes were found to be low to medium (d =. 39 and. 48 respectively). Similar gender differences were not observed in quota and anomalous talents. Discussion and Conclusions: Research findings imply a hierarchy among talent types with scarcity talents being at the top followed by surplus talents, quota talents and then anomalous talents. Findings also show that talent types related to scientific explorations and inventions, such as “the founder of cure for cancer” and “inventor of genetic cloning,” are attached much more societal value than all other types of talents. What is more interesting is the finding that the item “the leader of the independence war of a country” in the scarcity talents was rated by the participants as the highest talent among sixty talent types, and the item “a commander who successfully overcomes terrorism” was rated the highest among the quota talents. These findings apparently show that talents have societal roots, because Turkey had an independence war in the last century and has experienced terrorism for the last thirty years. Why females attach more value to scarcity and surplus talents than males also is an intriguing finding that needs further explorations...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Preeclampsia is a {{hypertensive}} disorder in pregnancy {{and is known}} as a specific syndrom of pregnancy. Several studies have been done to asses the indicators of preeclampsia for early detection of the disease. Uric acid is considered by some investigators {{as one of the most}} sensetive indicators in preeclampsia. In contrast some researchers have found it not useful in prediction of preeclampsia. Hence, more studies are needed about the role of uric acid levels in diagnosis of preeclampsia. The aim of this research is to compare the serum uric acid levels in preeclamptic and normal pregnant women and its <b>sensivity</b> as an indicator of preeclampsia. Materials and methods : In this case-control study 304 pregnant women were enrolled in the study at Fatmeh Zahrah Hospital of Sari. Among them, 151 preeclamptic women were allocated in case group and 153 healthy pregnant women in control group. SPSS were used for analysis of data and variables were compared by Chi square, ANOVA, Pearson correlation index, and <b>sensivity</b> and specifity were calculated. Results : Difference in the number of term delivery and primi gravidity between the three groups (normal, mild and severe preeclampsia) were significant (P< 0. 05). Considering maternal and fetal outcomes, only Decolman (two cases) had no significant difference between 3 groups. Mean of uric acid levels differed between three groups (P< 0. 0001). Severe preeclampsia had the most significant difference with normal group. Elevated uric acid (defined as up of 5. 5 mg/dl) was observed in 34 / 2 % in hyperuricemia group, 71. 2 % in preeclamtic and 28. 8 % in control group (P< 0. 0001) The <b>sensivity</b> of uric acid levels for determining the preeclampsia and its severity elevated with increasing in concentration of uric acid but the specifity decreased. Conclusion : Results showed that the <b>sensivity</b> of uric acid levels in diagnosis of preeclampsia is moderate and measuring uric acid can be used in determining the severity of preeclampsia, maternal and specially fetal outcomes (LBW, preterm, IUGR, low apgar) ...|$|E
