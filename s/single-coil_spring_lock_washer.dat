The use of a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> or crush washer was rejected as their use can increase visible flash from the shooter's perspective. The Vortex is tightened by hand and repeated firing of the rifle causes the Vortex to tighten to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, {{and safety}} wire {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with thread-locking fluid to prevent loosening of bolted joints.|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the jamming purpose). Jam nuts, other types of locknuts, <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{apply the}} Junker Test {{to determine the}} point at which fastener securing elements - such as lock nuts, wedges and <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> - fail when subjected to vibration. The data collected by the test enables design engineers to specify fasteners that will perform under a wide range of conditions without loosening.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> locknuts, jam nuts, thread-locking fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|R
50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring <b>lock</b> <b>washers</b> with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the washer. (If the space is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end space of another washer and entangle it.) A <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|R
2500|$|The Vortex Flash Hider is a flash {{suppressor}} made by Smith Enterprise {{and has been}} called the [...] "most effective flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. The Vortex made for AR-15 type rifles weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches in length and does not require a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> for attachment to the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The {{fastener}} {{serves the}} functions of both a <b>lock</b> <b>washer</b> and a nut. As the fastener is tightened in the nut the prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on {{the root of the}} thread on the fastener. When the fastener is tightened, the base of the nut, which is arched, elastically deforms and applies a force to the fastener, which locks it from loosening under vibrations.|$|R

A version of the Vortex has been adopted by the Canadian Military for the Colt Canada C8 CQB rifle. Other flash suppressors developed for the M16 include the Phantom Flash Suppressor by Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) and the KX-3 by Noveske Rifleworks.|$|R

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like <b>lock</b> <b>washers,</b> thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|R
