A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The <b>stop</b> <b>mechanism</b> admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the hazard {{function}} provides useful information about the starting and the <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of absence epileptic seizures. The hazard function quantifies changes in the probability that an event (respectively, the starting and the stopping of a seizure) occurs in some small time interval given {{that it has not}} occurred yet. It informs us about changes in the concentration of endogenous substances that modulate the neuronal signalling properties of (parts of) the brain. In a pharmacological experiment, we used the hazard function to study the effect of a GABA-transaminase inhibitor (vigabatrin) on the starting and the <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of absence epileptic seizures in a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy (the WAG/Rij rat). This experiment showed that a high GABA level changed the <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the absence epileptic seizures, creating much better conditions for very long seizures to develop. With respect to the starting mechanism, it was found that both with a high and a low GABA level, there was evidence for a recovery mechanism that decreases the probability that a new seizure starts. Initially, this probability is larger with a high GABA level, but gradually it converges to the same constant baseline probability as in the condition with a low GABA level...|$|R

The early NC23 was designated CBR400R and is also known as Aero, Hurricane or Jellymould, as it shares its major design features {{with the rest of the}} early CBR family of motorcycles, which included significantly rounded body shapes, whereas the later NC23 is designated CBR400RR and is also known as the Tri-Arm, after its racing inspired braced swingarm.|$|E

Entrance into anaphase is mediated by APCCdc20 activation. APCCdc20 is a ubiquitin-protein ligase that tags the protein, securin, for destruction. Securin destruction liberates and activates its bound protease partner, separase. Separase bound to securin remains inhibited; however, when inhibition is relieved, activated separase cleaves the cohesin complex which links the sister chromatids together.|$|R
50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to equip the door itself with a <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high friction material, {{is attached to a}} hinge {{near the bottom of the}} door opposite the door hinge and on the side of the door which is in the direction that it closes. When the door is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of the door towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When the door is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing the door slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping the door with the <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is to attach a magnet to the bottom of the door on the side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of the door, but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the design, fabrication and characterization of CMOS optical sensors for cancer detection based on autofluorescence emission spectra. These optical sensors were fabricated {{for being an}} integrated part of an endoscopic capsule used in diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. Cells and tissues show autofluorescence, {{in a part of}} the visible spectrum, when excited by ultraviolet or short-wavelength visible light. The emission spectrum of cancer tissue is different from the one of the healthy tissue, and, it is dependent on the cancer development stage. CMOS photodetectors can be used to measure that spectrum. Once they are small and easily integrated with readout electronics, they can be placed around all the surface of the endoscopic capsule. While, nowadays, a locomotion and <b>stop</b> <b>mechanism</b> is a challenge, this scheme can cover a large area of the gastrointestinal tract examination during the natural movement of the capsule.

40|$|ABSTRACT—How {{does one}} control an {{inappropriate}} ten-dency? Many studies have investigated this question {{by measuring the}} speed with which subjects stop an initiated response. Yet the rapid stopping of an initiated response is apparently underpinned by a neurocognitive mechanism that has global effects on multiple tendencies. This limits such studies as models of cognitive control because they do not explain the selectivity of control over particular tendencies that is apparent in everyday life. We hypothe-sized that subjects employ a selective <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> when they have foreknowledge of which response to stop, but employ a global <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> when they do not have such foreknowledge. Comparing foreknowledge and no-foreknowledge conditions, we show that when subjects have foreknowledge, stopping is indeed more selective, as evi-denced by less of an effect on the concurrent execution of an alternative response; however, stopping is also slower when subjects have foreknowledge. Thus, selective and global <b>mechanisms</b> of <b>stopping</b> can be dissociated. We suggest that the selective mechanism is used when people maintain the goal of controlling particular responses, whereas the global mechanism is used when it is essential to stop quickly. The question of how people stop inappropriate cognition and behavior is central to psychological research, policy, and rehabilitation. It bears on how children develop self-contro...|$|R

In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet.

In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|R
30|$|Many linear {{interference}} cancellation schemes {{have been}} shown to be equivalent to certain iterative methods [1], and therefore, they tend to have the same semi-convergence behavior for ill-conditioned systems. Therefore, linear IC detectors equipped with efficient early <b>stopping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that do not require the noise level information can be used to implement a low-complexity decorrelating detector that resists noise amplification without requiring knowledge of the noise level. In the following, we focus on the LPIC detector and use it as an iterative regularizing scheme to achieve two simultaneous objectives: low-complexity and resistance to noise enhancement.|$|R
