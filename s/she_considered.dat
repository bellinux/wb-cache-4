5|$|Coolbrith never resumed {{the work}} of writing the history, as {{she was unable to}} balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue. In her life, there were rumors that she had {{accepted}} men such as Harte, Stoddard, Clemens and Miller as occasional lovers—a book discussing these liaisons was one <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> too controversial.|$|E
5|$|Goeslaw later {{provided}} the soundtracks for 2003's Eiffel I'm in Love, 2005's Apa Artinya Cinta (What does Love Mean), 2007's The Butterfly, and 2009's Ketika Cinta Bertasbih (When Love Prays). <b>She</b> <b>considered</b> {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her previous work in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, she felt that she had to be extra careful.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Naylor writes {{books for}} children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor {{typically}} takes {{several years to}} finish a book.

5|$|Throughout her career, Trimmer {{worked with}} four {{different}} publishers — John Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, and Joseph Johnson — and, by 1800, {{she had the}} most works of any author in the Newbery catalogue, the catalogue that sold the most children's literature. Eventually, Trimmer stopped publishing with Joseph Johnson, because she disagreed with his politics—he was {{a supporter of the}} French Revolution and was publishing works that <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> subversive.|$|E

50|$|Sher {{has pursued}} {{research}} into logical positivism and logical foundationalism. She {{has argued that}} strict-ordering Foundationalism, in the vein of Rudolf Carnap, is untenable, supporting Quine's argument from Two Dogmas of Empiricism. She has, however, resisted the mainstream move toward all-or-nothing and semantic holism. The former view <b>she</b> <b>considers</b> unexplanatory, and the latter <b>she</b> <b>considers</b> untenable (see: Jerry Fodor).|$|R

5|$|Along with Sa'd, he also gained {{prestige}} {{among the}} people of Damascus, with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father. Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the sharifs of Damascus at the time; Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to Nazareth because <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.|$|E

Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993. Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated publicly {{that she was so}} depressed that <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> taking her own life. Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{has written}} of his Jewish parents' {{experiences}} during World War II. His mother, Maryla Husyt, {{grew up in}} Warsaw, survived the Warsaw Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two slave labor camps. Her first husband died in the war. <b>She</b> <b>considered</b> {{the day of her}} liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|Her musical {{influences}} {{were better}} expressed on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, when <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> herself mature {{and was able}} to write and produce songs as she wished, without worrying about the expectations of others. Knowles's lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop-soul, psychedelic soul, electronica, and R.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. <b>She</b> <b>considered</b> it challenging; for the most difficult part, {{a scene in which}} she had to cry, she practised in front of a mirror. In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Tamar Ross is a Modern Orthodox Jewish feminist thinker who confronts {{perceived}} flaws within traditional Jewish {{thought and}} law. <b>She</b> <b>considers</b> biases within what <b>she</b> <b>considers</b> patriarchal traditional text. In {{response to a}} traditional concept which <b>she</b> <b>considers</b> particularly problematic: the idea of [...] "Torah from Heaven", she introduces the idea of evolving revelation. She develops this approach, and the metaphor of [...] "Expanding the Palace of Torah", which she adopts from Abraham Isaac Kook's philosophy, as she intends to promote expansion, rather than dismissal of religious tradition, and text. In her 2004 work, Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism, she details a path by which Orthodoxy can become more inclusive of Feminist Ethics and practice.|$|R

The following month, she became the face of DKNY intimates. She noted that by July 2017, her sex appeal, especially her cleavage, has caused her to lose jobs.

Likewise, in an interview with Antara Nugroho stated that the film was intended to remind Indonesians that theirs is a maritime nation, which has influenced the country's culture. The regent of Wakatobi, Hugua, added {{in an interview with the}} Indonesian newspaper Kompas that Indonesian films had historically only presented land based cultures.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. <b>She</b> <b>considered</b> that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly.

5|$|Pankhurst visited North America in 1916 {{together}} with the former Secretary of State for Serbia, Čedomilj Mijatović, whose nation {{had been at the}} centre of fighting {{at the start of the}} war. They toured the United States and Canada, raising money and urging the US government to support Britain and its Canadian and other allies. Two years later, after the US entered the war, Pankhurst returned to the United States, encouraging suffragettes there – who had not suspended their militancy – to support the war effort by sidelining activities related to the vote. She also spoke about her fears of communist insurgency, which <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> a grave threat to Russian democracy.|$|E
5|$|Reforms became {{possible}} {{again in}} the late 1780s. In {{the context of the}} wars being waged against the Ottoman Empire by both the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire, Poniatowski tried to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Catherine gave permission for the next Sejm to be confederated, as <b>she</b> <b>considered</b> some form of limited military alliance with Poland against the Ottomans might be useful.|$|E
