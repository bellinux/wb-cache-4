50|$|L. C. van Atta {{was first}} to {{describe}} a retrodirective antenna, which redirects (rather than reflects) a signal back in the direction from which it came, in his 1959 patent. The signal can be modulated by the redirecting host for purposes such as radio-frequency identification and traffic control (radar target echo enhancement).The first adaptive array, the side-lobe canceller, was developed by Paul Howells and Sid Applebaum at General Electric in 1959 to suppress radar jamming signals. Building on Norbert Wiener’s work with analog filters, in 1960 Stanford University professor Bernard Widrow and PhD student Ted Hoff developed the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm that automatically adjusts an antenna’s directivity pattern to reinforce desired signals.Ted Compton at Ohio State University developed an adaptive antenna technique for recovering direct sequence spread spectrum signals {{in the presence of}} narrowband co-channel interference. Compton’s method, reported in 1974, only requires knowledge of the desired signal’s pseudorandom noise (PN) code—not its direction of arrival. In the late 1970s, Kesh Bakhru and Don Torrieri developed the maximin algorithm for recovering frequency hopping signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference.A 1977 paper by Bell Labs researchers Douglas O. Reudink and Yu S. Yeh described the advantages of <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> beams for satellites. The authors estimated that <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> beams could save 20 dB in link budget which in turn could be used to reduce transmit power, increase communication capacity, and decrease the size of earth-station antennas.

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 85 A {{technique}} is described for suppressing unwanted grain noise in scanned and digitized photographic images. The technique employs the rms granularity statistics {{of the film}} to divide, or quantize, the density range of the digital image into distinguishable ranges of density. For Eastman Kodak type 3414 film, the rms granularity statistics determined indicate constant Selwyn granularity for the range of <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> diameters from approximately 16 to 4 micrometers, and this result agrees with Kodak data for a 48 micrometer diameter spot. For spots from 16 to 4 micrometers diameter, the rms granularity is also determined to {{be a function of}} the square root of diffuse density. The number of distinguishable density levels, required to sup- press the grain noise of the digitally processed image, is found to be directly related to the <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> diameter.

40|$|PURPOSE. The loss {{of quality}} of optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) images resulting from disturbances in the optical media has been modeled. METHODS. OCT measurements were performed in two healthy volunteers using time domain (TD) -OCT (StratusOCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Optical disturbances were approached in three ways simulated with filters. The studied effects were: light attenuation (absorptive and reflective filters), refractive aberrations (defocusing lenses), and light scattering/straylight (scattering filters). The same examiner scanned the subjects with the filters {{placed in front of}} the eye. The signal strength (SS) values of the scans were then collected. The strength of the filters were expressed in optical density (OD), determined for the 830 nm central wavelength of the OCT, (OD lambda= 830). RESULTS. A linear relationship has been found between the OD lambda= 830 of the absorptive and reflective filters and the SS of the corresponding OCT images. Assuming that reduction of light from the OCT <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> on the retina is the critical factor, this light loss was determined for the scattering filters and defocusing lenses. A comparable linear relationship was found between the SS value and the OD lambda= 830 of these filters. CONCLUSIONS. The model indicates that the loss of OCT image quality in patients with disturbances in the optical media is explained by attenuation of the light in the OCT <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> on the retina. A linear relationship between the SS and the single pass logarithmic attenuation of the OCT signal is shown, according to SS = constant-(9. 9 [- 9. 4 to- 10. 6]. OD lambda= 830).

40|$|AbstractServo {{scanning}} 3 D micro electro {{discharge machining}} (3 D SSMEDM) method can automatically compensate the axial wear of micro rod-electrode in real time by preferably keeping a discharge gap. However, the depth errors of 3 D SSMEDM were even to 10 % due to the accumulation of layers’ thickness errors. In addition, the machining process with keeping the discharge gap must bring the initial errors of inclined or uneven workpiece-surfaces into dimensional errors, and also cause that 3 D structures cannot be machined on the workpieces with a hollow area. In this study, a layer depth constrained algorithm (LDCA) is proposed to solve the above problems. LDCA strategy is to control an electrode-feed maximum at every <b>scanning</b> <b>spot</b> during 3 D SSMEDM processes. By using LDCA, machining experiments were carried out on several typical micro cavities < 1 mm of rectangle, truncated cone and cross structure. The experimental results show: The accumulation errors of the layers’ thickness can be avoided, so the machined depth errors can be controlled < 2 μm.
