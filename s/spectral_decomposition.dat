The paper {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} some spectral filtering methods as truncated singular/eigen-value decompositions and Tikhonov/Re-blurring regularizations {{in the case}} of the recently proposed Reflective [18] and Anti-Reflective [21] boundary conditions. We give numerical evidence to the fact that <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions</b> (SDs) provide a good image restoration quality and this is true in particular for the Anti-Reflective SD, despite the loss of orthogonality in the associated transform. The related computational cost is comparable with previously known <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions,</b> and results substantially lower than the singular value decomposition. The model extension to the cross-channel blurring phenomenon of color images is also considered and the related spectral filtering methods are suitably adapted.

Right and left circulants (whose elements topple {{from right to left}} or from left to right, respectively) as well as skew right and skew left circulants (whose elements change their sign when toppling) are analyzed. The inherent periodicity of circulant matrices means that they are closely related to Fourier analysis and group theory.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{introduced}} an extended formulation of dynamics which allows {{a clear distinction}} between temporal behavior of stable systems on one hand, chaotic and unstable systems on the other. For stable systems, the evolution is deterministic and time reversible. For chaotic and unstable systems it is probabilistic and breaks time-symmetry. The new formulation of dynamics incorporates the second law of thermodynamics and leads therefore to a great unification of physics. More precisely: (1) the authors found that unstable dynamical systems have new <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions</b> in extended functional spaces. These <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions</b> incorporate new characteristics of the time evolution associated with irreversibility; (2) these new <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions</b> can be in general obtained iteratively through a well-defined algorithm; and (3) the method provides <b>spectral</b> <b>decompositions</b> of the time evolutions operator in the Liouville space of density matrices or distribution functions which cannot be implemented in the Hilbert space (wave functions) or by trajectories. In summary, they obtain an extension of classical and quantum mechanics. This extension leads to the inclusion of irreversibility into the framework of dynamics. Moreover, it also provides the theoretical basis for probabilistic predictions and control methods for complex systems, where the conventional deterministic predictions and control methods do not work...|$|R
