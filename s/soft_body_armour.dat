40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of preliminary research designed to explore in depth the design, fit and comfort of selected sports bras for large breasted women worn under <b>soft</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> Female armed personnel need to feel safe and protected in soft armour vests, giving them physiological comfort to perform their duties daily. Troublesome physical and additional physiological problems in relation to the female body are frequently caused due to the poor design of various bra components. Different breast sizes require unique bras designs. Specifically, when it comes to plus-size breasts, all the difficulties of fitting are more evident. In general, retail bra designs are not overcoming the above-mentioned bra&# 039;s wear problems even before consideration of how they relate to be worn under the <b>soft</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> As breast size and shape vary greatly between individuals, the design of bra size and style are important. In addition, fit and comfort are the most important factors of concern to the customers. With an aim to achieve a perfect bra shape, fit and comfort, designers have a strong drive to develop a superior quality bra by properly using components and materials with high performance. Five commercial sports bras were selected based on their suitability for wear under body armour. The bras were fitted on a fit model and ranked in terms of the design criteria (1) non-wire, firmness and comfort, (2) fit and size range (D to G-cup) shape, (3) moisture wicking, and (4) composition and textile quality. They were then assessed for correct fit by an expert bra fitter and photographed to assess frontal and side-shape protrusion for mobility and for comfort on the side upper arm. Comparisons indicated differences in the side arm protrusion for some popular brands. Further wear test under a simulation mock-up body armour vest was conducted for observing comfort and moisture management performance over a period of 6 hours. The bra comfort performance was compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{wearing of}} body amour {{has become a}} {{necessity}} for many professions and much work has gone into the optimisation of the mechanics of protection. In the present study a broader view {{of the effects of}} ergonomics, design, reliability and protection has been taken. Three background topics are examined by reference to the literature. First, {{as an example of the}} threats and injury mechanisms that prevail in modern conflicts, the effects of blast injury to the head are investigated. This is followed by a review of ergonomic test methods and is completed by a study exploring the influence of history on modern <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> design. Solutions to some of these problems are then considered. The problem of accurately measuring impact loads to the head is investigated and a rigid instrumented head form is demonstrated. This work showed that the filtering techniques derived from crash tests used in the current helmet standards are not applicable to ballistic impact events. A one day wearer trial for police armour based on typical actions carried out by police officers in the performance of their normal duties is developed and demonstrated. A mechanical flexibility test is shown to give quantitative data but a direct link between ergonomic rankings and flexibility could not be established. Reliability of both <b>soft</b> and hard <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> is investigated and for typical armour types it is demonstrated that a minimal deterioration takes place with time and existing inspections techniques can highlight armour that is below standard. This study has introduced measurement techniques in an attempt to quantify some of the effects investigated with the intention of using quantitative methods to improve armour design and minimise some of the negative effects of wearing <b>body</b> <b>armour...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Body armour is worn {{to lessen the}} {{likelihood}} of sustaining a life threatening injury. Such protective solutions are used every day by law enforcement officers around the world, with strict guidelines governing their design and testing. These activities are monitored by government departments such as the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) within the United Kingdom (UK), and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) within the United States. Despite providing protection against significant levels of impact energy, a number of historical issues continue to be present with modern fibre-based <b>soft</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> – which once addressed may demonstrate an enhancement wearer operational performance. This paper therefore presents research highlighting such issues, and demonstrates how Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, particularly Laser Sintering (LS), could potentially be used to address such operational concerns whilst providing protection against a real-world threat. Results documented within this paper demonstrate that 5. 6 mm thick planar samples, Laser Sintered from a 50 / 50 mix of virgin and recycled PA 2200 successfully achieved penetration resistance to the UK HOSDB KR 1 impact energy of 24 joules. These results therefore influenced the design, manufacture, and testing {{of a series of}} AM textile samples featuring an imbricated layout, which also demonstrated successful knife penetration resistance to the HOSDB KR 1 level – thus developing stab resistant Additive Manufactured Body Armour (AMBA) ...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{published}} research has characterised the behind armour blunt trauma (BABT) effects {{associated with high}} velocity ballistic impact on textile-based armour faced with a ceramic plate. Subsequently dynamic displacements, accelerations and pressures have been characterised both in Gelatine experiments and animal experiments and used to provide test methodologies. High velocity armour consists of a ceramic plate usually backed with a composite panel, which is worn over the conventional textile body armour. The purpose of the plate is to disrupt and spread {{the energy of the}} high velocity projectile such that the resulting displacement can beaccommodated and partially absorbed by the textile armour. On its own, the textile armour isonly capable of preventing penetration by low kinetic energy density projectiles such as fragments, which are of a similar magnitude to hand gun bullets. For police officers, civilian security personnel and for the military, in operations other than war, {{there is a need to}} protect against low-velocity handgun bullets such as 9 mm and 0. 375 Magnum; these being the rounds typically used in ballistic test standards. As the purpose of the ceramic plate is to reduce the energy density of a high-velocity projectile to that which can be arrested bya soft armour; it follows that there may be a relationship between the impact of a low-velocity projectile on soft armour and a high velocity projectile on a ceramic faced soft armour. The purpose of this work was to gather data on the back-face deformation behaviour of <b>soft</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> and compare it to that of hard armour by determining whether there was a correlation between previous ceramic plate data and soft armour tests, and also to determine whether backface pressure data could be used to rank other simulant materials...|$|E

40|$|Police {{officers}} and other {{personnel in the}} UK routinely wear body armour that provides protection from specific threats. Typically, 'soft' armours, usually formed from multiple layers of fabric, can protect wearers from fragmentation and low velocity (handgun) ballistic threats, while ‘hard’ armours, formed from ceramic and composite plates, offer protection from high velocity (rifle) threats. Protection from stab and/or slash attack is predominantly provided by utilising chain mail and laminated solutions. The question has been raised however, {{of what would happen}} when armour is overmatched with a greater threat than it is designed to protect against. A limited number of studies have been published in the open source literature regarding the overmatching of <b>soft</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> This research aims to increase the understanding of overmatching, by investigating the effect of both i) soft fabric body armour designed to protect from handgun ammunition being challenged by high velocity rifle projectiles and ii) knife and spike resistant armour protecting against low velocity handgun projectiles. A subsection of the research considered three tissue simulants in order to find the most suitable for investigating the effects of overmatching armour. A method for recording the damage produced in the simulants was also developed; from which comparison of damage to different targets was possible. Following the tissue simulant investigation, gelatine blocks 10 % in concentration were selected and used to investigate the overmatching of two types of UK police body armour. Three different arrangements were setup, namely 10 % gelatine blocks 500 mm, 10 % gelatine blocks 250 mm in length, and porcine thoracic walls arranged to simulate a thorax. Testing blocks 500 mm in length was a set-up typical to ballistic investigations; the blocks were capable of capturing the majority of the projectiles’ damage, with the damage produced in both unprotected and protected (on the front face only) targets compared. Based on anthropometric measurements, testing 10 % gelatine blocks 250 mm in size was more representative of a torso sized target. With the blocks smaller, armour was placed on both the front and back face of targets. This is more representative of how armour would be worn in a real life scenario; patrolling UK police officer wearing armour that protects both the front and back of their torso. Finally, the use of porcine samples arranged to simulate both protected and unprotected thoraxes enabled comparisons of the damage seen in homogenous tissue simulants to damage in non-homogenous material typical to those found in the human torso. The outcomes from testing three different targets with two ammunition and armour combinations revealed the effect of overmatching armour is not one that can be generalised and predicted for all overmatching scenarios. The presence of armour on the rear face of targets based on typical measurements of human chest depth, increased the chances of the projectiles tested remaining within the targets. EPSR...|$|E

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} are reported as burdening the military. An identified {{risk factor for}} injury is carrying heavy loads; however, soldiers are also required to wear their load as <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> To investigate the effects of <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> on trunk and hip kinematics during military-specific manual handling tasks, 16 males completed 3 tasks while wearing each of 4 <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> conditions plus a control. Three-dimensional motion analysis captured and quantified all kinematic data. Average trunk flexion for the weightiest armour type was higher compared with control during the carry component of the ammunition box lift (p <  0. 001) and sandbag lift tasks (p <  0. 001). Trunk rotation ROM was lower for all armour types compared with control during the ammunition box place component (p <  0. 001). The altered kinematics with <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> occurred independent of armour design.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a new technique which enables a novel type of front panel for female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> to be engineered, providing female contour, high level protection, and therefore comfort in wearing. The traditional cutting and stitching method can be used to form a dome shape to accommodate the bust area but it gives rise to weakness against projectile impact at the seams. A novel type of fabric with the advantage in mouldability is needed as an alternative to the conventional plain woven fabric in making female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> without the need of cutting or folding but ease in manufacture. Dome-shaped fabric and angle-interlock woven fabric are two potential candidates. The analysis and comparisons determine the selection of the fabric with superior dome depth which is more suitable for the female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> application. Ballistic evaluations on the selected fabric were carried out from two aspects: the overall ballistic performance investigation and the parametric study. The result provided a better understanding of kinetic energy absorption capability of single-piece selected fabrics. Additionally, the ballistic performance of fabric panels was further evaluated in the factory in order to ensure the selected fabric could achieve the commercial requirement. After the investigations of mouldability and ballistic resistance of the selected fabric, a mathematical model was created, which determines the pattern geometry for the front panel of the female <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> This mathematical model takes the body figure size and bra size as the input, and the output is the profile of the front panel of female <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> This work enables the speedy creation of a front panel of the female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> in the selected fabric. This is an important advance and a novel approach for making seamless female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> with satisfactory ballistic performance.

40|$|Depth, {{diameter}} and volume of dents in clay backing of <b>soft</b> and hard <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> {{are used to}} assess the protective performance of such vests. The characteristics of the dents are traditionally measured manually. Optical scan techniques are becoming more popular and provide an objective method compared to the manual method and it allows to archive the scans for later evaluation. However, commercial high end scanners, accuracy in 1 - 10 μm, are expensive and there is no software available to automatically determine the dent characteristics. Recently low end scanners, accuracy 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm became available. An automatic dent measuring method was developed using Matlab to control a DAVID 3 Structured Ligth Scanner and process the scans of the clay backing to obtain the dent characteristics. This SLS dent scan system is presented in this paper. Accuracy of the scans is better than the most strict requirement of 0. 5 mm. Scan and processing time to obtain the dent characteristics is less than sixty seconds. The traditional method takes about two minutes between each shot. The accuracy and precision is evaluated by comparison of the SLS scan method with a measurement of a dent by a high end but much slower scanner (accuracy < 0. 05 mm). A comparison between the manual and SLS method is made by measuring dents for three clay trays with each five calibration dents and for a soft and hard armour BABT performance assessment. It is concluded that the accuracy of the SLS method is better than or equal to the manual method...|$|R
