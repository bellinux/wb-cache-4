25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on a Saturday night, <b>sulky,</b> defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{obviously}} {{tasted the}} sarcasm in Gaites's tone, {{and dropped it}} from his own, but he was <b>sulkier</b> if more respectful than before in answering: [...] "'D ought a come right through {{in a couple of}} days. 'D ought a been here a week ago." ...|$|R

25|$|Savage {{was known}} for his {{advertising}} skills and soon capitalized on Dan Patch's growing fame. Rather than charging an exhibition fee, Savage received a proportion of the gate receipts for crowds that grew to between 40 and 50 thousand. In most of his exhibition races, Dan Patch started behind galloping horses who were hooked up to a <b>sulky,</b> which gave Dan Patch a target to beat and also acted as a wind breaker. The pace makers would eventually swing wide, leaving Dan Patch alone against the clock.|$|E
25|$|Victory Tilly, {{along with}} trainer Johansson in the <b>sulky,</b> won {{the rest of}} the races he participated in that year. The biggest win of the year was in the Swedish Trotting Derby, Svenskt Travderby, the richest and most prestigious event for 4-year-olds in Sweden. From gate one, Victory Tilly and Johansson went to the front, where they {{remained}} the entire race. Of the SEK1,300,000 gained through the win, Stall Kalas donated 500,000 to the Swedish Cancer Society (Cancerfonden). Later in the autumn, Victory Tilly won another major race, the Swedish Breeders Crown for 4-year-old stallions and geldings.|$|E
25|$|Katie (Megan Prescott) and Emily Fitch (Kathryn Prescott) {{are very}} {{different}} identical twin sisters. Katie thinks of herself {{as something of a}} WAG and wants to usurp Effy's place as queen bee of the group. Katie's homophobic attitudes cause problems between them, as Emily comes to terms with her homosexuality. The quieter of the two, Emily is used to being in her sister's shadow, and is <b>sulky</b> but perceptive. She tends to not stand out in a crowd due to her insecurities, but later grows out within the show. She is in love with Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), a fiery, politically charged and passionate young woman with idealistic views and an abundance of ambition. Emily also develops a good friendship with JJ, becoming close confidantes to one another.|$|E

For many weeks after this Gaff heard nothing that could lead him to suppose that the men still harboured their dark designs. Yet the state of affairs on board became worse and worse. The captain cursed and tyrannised more than ever, and the men grew <b>sulkier</b> and more wretched, but no word of a murderous nature was ever uttered in the hearing of Gaff or his little son.|$|R

5000|$|Since 1805 women's kortebaanschaatsen is {{held over}} a {{distance}} of 140 meters. In the first race held for women in 1805 in Leeuwarden, the women were [...] "just {{as fast as the}} horses", which referred to a previous kortebaandraverij that had been held previously that week with sleighs instead of wheeled <b>sulkys.</b> The full list of women participants with their ages and addresses was published in an account by Evert Maaskamp. The women's sport was popular because the women were skating with bare arms and were seen to be unusually talented and strong. A print was made that became popular, that was accompanied by another engraving with a commemorative descriptive text.|$|R
500|$|Horse {{racing is}} an equestrian sport and major {{international}} industry, watched {{in almost every}} nation of the world. There are three types: [...] "flat" [...] racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a <b>sulky.</b> A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.|$|E

Sterling picks up on this, noting the many similarities between the two women, including their tightly pulled-back hair, high cheek bones, slanted eyes and <b>sulky</b> expressions.|$|E
500|$|Shearman and Pearson {{analyzed}} the portrayals {{of several of}} the series' regular characters as 1930s villains, noting several meta-references to the wider series. The two noted that, in his portrayal of a Nazi, Jeffrey Spender was allowed to [...] "cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a <b>sulky</b> boy hiding in the basement." [...] In contrast, Walter Skinner's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series, his role [...] "charmingly parodying the ambiguity he's been playing all these years and turning out to be an American-loving ally who tells our heroes to get their 'asses out of here'." ...|$|E

The park stands on {{a portion of the}} old fairground/racetrack site of a hundred years ago. The original racetrack was a , banked oval track where horses, <b>sulkys,</b> and early autos were raced. The Krebs Italian Band played many festivals or 'festas' at the park in bygone simpler times. For years during the 1990s, [...] "The Ethnic Festival" [...] was a popular attraction on Labor Day weekend, taking place on this Historical Site. Games such as bocce ball and morra were played by all for fun.|$|R
60|$|A {{door closed}} and Francesca Bassington {{sat alone in}} her well- beloved drawing-room. The visitor who had been enjoying the {{hospitality}} of her afternoon-tea table had just taken his departure. The tete-a-tete {{had not been a}} pleasant one, at any rate as far as Francesca was concerned, but at least it had brought her the information for which she had been seeking. Her role of looker-on from a tactful distance had necessarily left her much in the dark concerning the progress of the all-important wooing, but during the last few hours she had, on slender though significant evidence, exchanged her complacent expectancy for a conviction that something had gone wrong. She had spent the previous evening at her brother's house, and had naturally seen nothing of Comus in that uncongenial quarter; neither had he put in an appearance at the breakfast table the following morning. She had met him in the hall at eleven o'clock, and he had hurried past her, merely imparting the information {{that he would not be}} in till dinner that evening. He spoke in his <b>sulkiest</b> tone, and his face wore a look of defeat, thinly masked by an air of defiance; it was not the defiance of a man who is losing, but of one who has already lost.|$|R
60|$|Charles came on Saturday {{but went}} early; {{he seems to}} have schemes and plans and wants to get off. He is quite right; I am glad to see him {{employed}} at business. You remember I wrote you a story about a woman named Alice being made young again, or some such stuff. In your next letter tell me whether I gave it as my own, or whether I gave it as a matter Brown was employed upon at the time. He read it over to George the other day, and George said he had heard it all before. So Brown suspects I have been giving you his story as my own. I should like to set him right in it by your evidence. George has not returned from town; when he does I shall tax his memory. We had a young, long, raw, lean Scotchman with us yesterday, called Thornton. Rice, for fun or for mistake, would persist in calling him Stevenson. I know three people of no wit at all, each distinct in his excellence--A, B, and C. A is the foolishest, B the <b>sulkiest,</b> C is a negative. A makes you yawn, B makes you hate, as for C you never see him at all though he were six feet high--I bear the first, I forbear the second, I am not certain that the third is. The first is gruel, the second ditch-water, the third is spilt--he ought to be wip'd up. A is inspired by Jack-o'-the-clock, B has been drilled by a Russian serjeant, C, they say, is not his mother's true child, but she bought him of the man who cries, Young lambs to sell.|$|R
500|$|From August 1989 to March 1990, Rudolf Nureyev {{played the}} King in a North American tour {{opposite}} Liz Robertson, with Kermoyan as the Kralahome, directed by Arthur Storch {{and with the}} original Robbins choreography. Reviews were uniformly critical, lamenting that Nureyev failed to embody the character, [...] "a King who stands around like a <b>sulky</b> teenager who didn't ask {{to be invited to}} this party. ... Not even his one dance number ... goes well. ... Rodgers and Hammerstein's King [...] supposed to be a compelling personality [...] bears no resemblance to the man described ... in the [...] "Something Wonderful" [...] number. [...] The show therefore comes across as something of a charade ... with everyone pretending to be dealing with a fearsome potentate who, in fact, is displaying very little personality at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{from the}} myth were also {{recorded}} in writings {{that may have}} been intended as entertainment. Prominent among these texts is [...] "The Contendings of Horus and Set", a humorous retelling of several episodes of the struggle between the two deities, which dates to the Twentieth Dynasty (c. 1190–1070 BCE). It vividly characterizes the deities involved; as the Egyptologist Donald B. Redford says, [...] "Horus appears as a physically weak but clever Puck-like figure, Seth [...] as a strong-man buffoon of limited intelligence, Re-Horakhty [...] as a prejudiced, <b>sulky</b> judge, and Osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue." [...] Despite its atypical nature, [...] "Contendings" [...] includes many of the oldest episodes in the divine conflict, and many events appear in the same order as in much later accounts, suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming {{at the time that the}} story was written.|$|E
500|$|Toyah's image {{eventually}} {{began to}} change and she became {{more aware of the}} way she looked when she got a boyfriend and started college. Toyah also took extra English lessons from Ken Barlow (William Roache) in a bid to better herself. Taylor later commented that her character got on her nerves due to her naivety. She also thought that Toyah had a romantic view of love, was too trusting and occasionally needed to be [...] "a bit more clued up". The actress added that Toyah was [...] "a very decent person", who was loyal to her friends. Digital Spy's Kris Green described Toyah as [...] "the more mellow of the Battersbys" [...] and thought that was due to Les (Bruce Jones) not being her biological father. The Daily Mirror's Charlie Catchpole commented that Toyah went [...] "from lumpy, <b>sulky</b> schoolgirl to confident, radiant young woman".|$|E
60|$|There lies all Genoa, in {{beautiful}} confusion, with its many churches, monasteries, and convents, pointing {{up into the}} sunny sky; and down below me, just where the roofs begin, a solitary convent parapet, fashioned like a gallery, with an iron across at the end, where sometimes early in the morning, I have seen a little group of dark-veiled nuns gliding sorrowfully to and fro, and stopping {{now and then to}} peep down upon the waking world in which they have no part. Old Monte Faccio, brightest of hills in good weather, but <b>sulkiest</b> when storms are coming on, is here, upon the left. The Fort within the walls (the good King built it to command the town, and beat the houses of the Genoese about their ears, in case they should be discontented) commands that height upon the right. The broad sea lies beyond, in front there; and that line of coast, beginning by the light-house, and tapering away, a mere speck in the rosy distance, is the beautiful coast road that leads to Nice. The garden near at hand, among the roofs and houses: all red with roses and fresh with little fountains: is the Acqua Sola- -a public promenade, where the military band plays gaily, and the white veils cluster thick, and the Genoese nobility ride round, and round, and round, in state-clothes and coaches at least, if not in absolute wisdom. Within a stone's-throw, as it seems, the audience of the Day Theatre sit: their faces turned this way. But as the stage is hidden, it is very odd, without a knowledge of the cause, to see their faces changed so suddenly from earnestness to laughter; and odder still, to hear the rounds upon rounds of applause, rattling in the evening air, to which the curtain falls. But, being Sunday night, they act their best and most attractive play. And now, the sun is going down, in such magnificent array of red, and green, and golden light, as neither pen nor pencil could depict; and to the ringing of the vesper bells, darkness sets in at once, without a twilight. Then, lights begin to shine in Genoa, and on the country road; and the revolving lanthorn out at sea there, flashing, for an instant, on this palace front and portico, illuminates it as if there were a bright moon bursting from behind a cloud; then, merges it in deep obscurity. And this, so far as I know, is the only reason why the Genoese avoid it after dark, and think it haunted.|$|R
6000|$|Fishing is {{generally}} associated in men's minds with wild mountain scenery; if {{not with the}} alps and cataracts of Norway, still with the moors and lochs of Scotland, or at least with the rocky rivers, the wooded crags, the crumbling abbeys of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Hereford, or the Lowlands. And it cannot be denied {{that much of the}} charm which angling exercises over cultivated minds, is due to the beauty and novelty of the landscapes which surround him; to the sense of freedom, the exhilarating upland air. Who would prefer the certainty of taking trout out of some sluggish preserve, to the chance of a brace out of Edno or Llyn Dulyn? The pleasure lies not in the prize itself, but in the pains which it has cost; in the upward climbs through the dark plantations, beside the rock-walled stream; the tramp over the upland pastures, one gay flower-bed of blue and purple butter-wort; the steady breathless climb up the crags, which looked but one mile from you when you started, so clear against the sky stood out every knoll and slab; the first stars of the white saxifrage, golden-eyed, blood-bedropt, as if a fairy had pricked her finger in the cup, which shine upon some green cushion of wet moss, in a dripping crack of the cliff; the first grey tufts of the Alpine club-moss, the first shrub of crowberry, or sea-green rose-root, with its strange fleshy stems and leaves, which mark the two-thousand-feet-line, {{and the beginning of the}} Alpine world; the scramble over the arid waves of the porphyry sea aloft, as you beat round and round like a weary pointer dog in search of the hidden lake; the last despairing crawl to the summit of the Syenite pyramid on Moel Meirch; the hasty gaze around, far away into the green vale of Ffestiniog, and over wooded flats, and long silver river-reaches, and yellow sands, and blue sea flecked with flying clouds, and isles and capes, and wildernesses of mountain peaks, east, west, south, and north; one glance at the purple gulf out of which Snowdon rises, thence only seen in full majesty from base to peak: and then the joyful run, springing over bank and boulder, to the sad tarn beneath your feet: the loosening of the limbs, as you toss yourself, bathed in perspiration, on the turf; the almost awed pause as you recollect that you are alone on the mountain-tops, by the side of the desolate pool, out of all hope of speech or help of man; and, if you break your leg among those rocks, may lie there till the ravens pick your bones; the anxious glance round the lake to see if the fish are moving; the still more anxious glance through your book to guess what they will choose to take; what extravagant bundle of red, blue, and yellow feathers, like no insect save perhaps some jewelled monster from Amboyna or Brazil--may tempt those <b>sulkiest</b> and most capricious of trout to cease for once their life-long business of picking leeches from among those Syenite cubes which will twist your ankles and break your shins for the next three hours. What matter (to a minute philosopher, at least) if, after two hours of such enjoyment as that, he goes down again into the world of man with empty creel, or with a dozen pounders and two-pounders, shorter, gamer, and redder-fleshed than ever came out of Thames or Kennet? What matter? If he has not caught them, he might have caught them; he has been catching them in imagination all the way up; and if he be a minute philosopher, he holds that there is no falser proverb than that devil's beatitude--'Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.' ...|$|R
500|$|Instead, on the B note {{is another}} {{dominant}} seventh. [...] Such chords {{are the basis}} of the twelve-bar blues, and are used in this way to give [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] a bluesy, rock-'n'-roll feel, the chord change is manipulated to emphasize the B's flatted seventh (a minor third from the tonic), giving the song a <b>sulky</b> mood. This chord change is used for the intro, verse, chorus and the instrumental sections, with exception to the pre-chorus, which is in the relative key of D minor. [...] Overall, even regardless of the chord progression, the song seems to fall somewhere between major and minor, and the use of four-note seventh chords (as opposed to [...] "three-note" [...] chords) help to form a rich atmosphere. [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is mainly carried by this arrangement, along with drum beats, sampled from [...] "Train In Vain".|$|E
500|$|Particular praise {{after the}} race went to both {{newcomers}} Haas and debutant Jolyon Palmer, who delivered what The Guardian described as an [...] "impressive" [...] drive. Palmer {{had been able to}} hold off attacks by both Toro Rosso drivers for several laps in the closing stages of the race. Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen was very unhappy with his team's strategy in the race handling the situation, repeatedly complaining and swearing over the team radio. He lost several seconds in a rushed pitstop, after which he lamented that he had wanted to pit before his teammate Sainz. While driving behind Sainz when both where trailing Palmer, he asked for team orders to allow him to pass his teammate, which were denied, leading him to describe his team's strategy as a [...] "joke". Verstappen received criticism for his outbursts, with Sky Sports describing him as sounding [...] "like a teenager - and a <b>sulky</b> one at that". He later apologised to his team for his outbursts.|$|E
500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly simply {{wrote of}} [...] "Fading" [...] that the song, a [...] "walk away ballad", is a [...] "gorgeously {{synthesized}} moment of sweet defiance". David Driver of Sputnikmusic wrote that [...] "Fading", along with [...] "California King Bed", are both [...] "well-done, soulful ballads" [...] {{and that they}} are [...] "completely free" [...] of the <b>sulky</b> tones which could be found on some compositions on Rihanna's previous album, Rated R (2009). Colin Gentry of 4Music also noted in his review that the song communicates a passionate expression of grief to the listener. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song {{was one of the best}} on the album, commenting that it stands out [...] "sonically". Burleson added that it is [...] "a hopeful, piano and string-based R" [...] song, and compared to the work of late 1990s artists such as Aaliyah and Faith Evans. Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media criticized [...] "Fading" [...] as well as Rihanna herself, for copying [...] " [...] own lightweight R formula so much it's redundant".|$|E
500|$|Essayist Steve Almond called Ferris [...] "the most {{sophisticated}} teen movie [...] had ever seen," [...] adding that while Hughes {{had made a}} lot of good movies, Ferris was the [...] "one film [...] would consider true art, [...] only one that reaches toward the ecstatic power of teendom [...] and, at the same time, exposes the true, piercing woe of that age." [...] Almond also applauded Ruck's performance, going so far as saying he deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 1986: [...] "His performance is what elevates the film, allows it to assume the power of a modern parable." [...] The New York Times reviewer Nina Darnton criticized Mia Sara's portrayal of Sloane for lacking [...] "the specific detail that characterized the adolescent characters in Hughes's other films", asserting she [...] "created a basically stable but forgettable character." [...] Conversely, Darnton praised Ruck and Grey's performances: [...] "The two people who grow in the movie—Cameron, played with humor and sensitivity by Alan Ruck, and Ferris's sister Jeanie, played with appropriate self-pity by Jennifer Grey—are the most authentic. Grey manages to play an insufferably <b>sulky</b> teen-ager who is still attractive and likable." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] is an uptempo dancehall and R song. which {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} raggamuffin. The song {{is written in}} the key of E minor (recorded in E minor) with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 87 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of D5, and the song follows a sequence of Em−Bm−C−Am−Bm as its chord progression. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that [...] "Rude Boy", and the album's previous single [...] "Hard", were the highlights of Rated R, praised the singer's vocal performance in the song, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a <b>sulky,</b> icy, monotone." [...] Michael Menachem of Billboard commented on the lyrical content of the song, and wrote, [...] "with 'Rude Boy', Rihanna delivers her most provocative lyrics and perhaps most authentic-sounding single to date." [...] Menachem also wrote about the song's composition, [...] "Steel drums are a welcome presence on the production, which gives a nod to ska and dancehall. Rihanna's swagger has never been as convincing as on this song." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{said that}} Rihanna lashes {{out on the}} song, with [...] "help from an even harder-edged MC, Young Jeezy." [...] Monica Herrerra of Billboard {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "Rihanna effectively assumes the hip-hop posture and even recruits the ultimate street cred booster in rapper Young Jeezy, who provides the thrust needed to send a song with a somewhat inert chorus home". Herrerra continued, [...] "Though 'Hard' doesn't find Rihanna in her typical comfort zone, the atypical is precisely what she has aimed for with her new material—and it works". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] the highlights of Rated R, and wrote, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a <b>sulky,</b> icy, monotone". Petridis {{also noted that the}} song [...] "undercuts the standard braggathon of Hard—'fan mail from 27 million. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Rihanna's vocal style and the persona she adopts in the song. Greenblatt wrote, [...] "Rihanna dons hip-hop swagger like borrowed armor, leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest-bitch boasts via dancehall-riddim'd bangers like 'Hard,' 'G4L,' and 'Wait Your Turn. Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the bulletproof guise is good for the record's high point on 'Hard', a strutting statement of power bolstered by a roiling undertow of a beat from 'Umbrella' producer Tricky Stewart." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly <b>sulky</b> hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
