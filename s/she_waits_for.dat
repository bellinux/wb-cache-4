5|$|The {{following}} day, Roger summons all {{the partners}} {{to his office}} to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him {{it is not about}} money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> an elevator.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
500|$|Sally invites Glen {{to visit}} while Don and Megan {{are at work}} the next day. He agrees. The next morning, <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> Megan to leave the {{apartment}} before rushing to change out of her pajamas. Glen arrives at the Draper apartment. They visit the American Museum of Natural History. He admits that he told friends {{he was going to}} [...] "do it" [...] with her, but that he thinks of her as a little sister. Feeling ill, Sally runs to the bathroom and finds blood on her underwear. Arriving home, Megan looks for Sally and sees Glen's duffel bag. Sally takes a cab to the Francis house and sprints to the bathroom. She later hugs Betty tightly and explains that her menstrual cycle has started. Glen shows up at the Draper apartment and tells Megan that Sally left him at the museum. Betty phones and tells her that Sally [...] "became a woman today," [...] and just needed her mother. Megan insists Glen stay until she can drive him to his train. Betty gives Sally a hot water bottle and assures her that starting her cycle means [...] "everything is working." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video of}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was {{considered}} to be a sequel to the one for the previous clip on the album, [...] "Partition". It opens with Beyoncé watching a man while he is sitting on a table in front of her, reading a newspaper. She stands up and the scene transitions to the singer walking down the stairs in a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up. Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding a drink in her hands and straddling a pinball machine. As the song nears its end, sped-up scenes of a car driving on different streets follows. During the end, Beyoncé runs to a man who is seen only from the back, dressed in a hooded coat. She embraces him with teary eyes, sighing with relief. Throughout the video, close-up shots of the singer are also featured, showing her expressions. Beyoncé is seen wearing a high-waist corset and a cropped lace top designed by Ulyana Sergeenko with her look being complete with an earring. She also wears a studded plate cuff, a chain, and a gold bracelet from jewelry by Eddie Borgo. During scenes at the party, she wears a sweatshirt designed by Givenchy.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interlude}} is {{the opening}} for eighth track [...] "With U", which {{was described as}} [...] "the follow-up to 1986's 'Let's Wait Awhile'", where a couple postpone intimacy. [...] "With U" [...] takes place after the act, which results in romantic confusion. In it, she sings, [...] "I wish {{you were the one}} the one I could be with forever". [...] "Call on Me" [...] is the ninth song and lead single from 20 Y.O. It features Nelly, and samples The SOS Band's 1983 song [...] "Tell Me If You Still Care". It includes whispered vocals from both Jackson and Nelly. Second interlude finds Jackson remembering her Good Times days as Penny. [...] "Daybreak", the eleventh song, begins with fairy tale infused chimes before introducing electronic soul handclaps before Jackson starts singing. It has a few lyrics which deal about sex. The following track, [...] "Enjoy", is composed by piano and bass. In the song, Jackson's vocals were heavily treated. Both songs have additional carnival charms, sing-along melodies, and a children's chorus at its end of the latter. An interlude follows, with Jackson calling her lover, asking him to come home. Fourteenth song [...] "Take Care" [...] is a love song which finds the singer pleasuring herself while <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> her lover. The last song from the album, [...] "Love 2 Love" [...] was recorded by Jackson with her brother Michael in mind. She sings, [...] "We are a couple / Which love knows no bounds". An outro closes the album.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the series}} premiere, [...] "Give Me a Ring Sometime" [...] (1982), Diane Chambers, a college student, enters Cheers and meets Sam Malone, a {{recovering}} alcoholic and a womanizer. While <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> her fiancé Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), Diane realizes that Sumner has left her, {{and that she}} is jobless and penniless with nothing else in her life. Sam offers Diane {{a job as a}} cocktail waitress, and she accepts. In the next episode, [...] "Sam's Women" [...] (1982), Diane snootily teases Sam for preferring just beautiful women with below average intelligence. In response, Sam involves his ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie), in a pretend relationship to prove Diane wrong. (In some syndicated prints, Sam's past marriage is omitted.) When Sam and Debra are leaving [...] "for" [...] an opera, Diane retrieves the opera pamphlet from Debra only to find it two years old, foiling Sam's scheme. Sam blames Diane for making his romantic life less fun anymore, and Diane assures that he would never win an intelligent woman. They argue but then make up. When Sam explains a color of the sky at a ski resort and compares it to Diane's eyes in vivid detail, apparently distracted Diane is nearly touched but then averts herself and treats it as repulsive to an intelligent woman. Throughout the season, Sam and Diane are attracted to each other and trade each other flirts and innuendos, but they never consummate their relationship. In the two-part season finale, [...] "Showdown" [...] (1983), Diane briefly dates Sam's successful, handsome, well-educated brother Derek, making Sam jealous. No longer able to suppress their feelings, Sam and Diane kiss passionately in the bar's office.|$|E

2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while <b>she</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
