40|$|Introduction: Since {{there are}} few studies on stress {{experienced}} by nursing staff in private hospitals, this study aimed to determine the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress among nurses in private hospitals in southwest of Iran. Method: In a cross-sectional design, nurses in private hospitals in Shiraz were investigated; about 160 nurses were selected by single-stage cluster sampling as the study samples in three selected hospitals. A standard questionnaire on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress was used for data collection. The data were analyzed through SPSS, version 21, using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The level of significance was considered as 0. 05. Results: Five important causes of stress among nurses were low income, lack <b>of</b> <b>job</b> security, work-home interface, lack of enough time for work, and exposure with unsuitable physical situation. There were significant associations between the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> stress and having persons with chronic disease in family and concurrent education and work (P = 0. 021, X 2 = 426. 5 and P = 0. 022, X 2 = 717. 5, respectively).

Job stress {{is one of the}} important causes of musculoskeletal disorders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between rate and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress with low back, shoulder, and neck pains in the staff of one hospital in Tehran city. Methods: This research was conducted as a descriptive-analytical study on 264 individuals (out of 700 individuals) of the staff of one hospital in Tehran city (2014). The samples were selected randomly. To collect the data, personal-occupational information, rate and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress, and Music questionnaires, were used, which had appropriate reliability and validity. Data analysis was performed using t-test. Results: In this study, the mean occupational stress among the staff was 20. 55 and a majority of subjects (66. 7 %), were compatible in terms of stress levels. The frequency of low back pain was more than other parts of the body. Half (48. 9 %) of the staff suffered from low back pain and the remaining (26. 1 %) suffered from shoulder pain and 25 % had neck pain. There was a significant relationship between rate and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress. Also, there was a significant difference between rate and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> stress with low back, shoulder, and neck pains. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is very high in stressful jobs, and chronic and severe pain in the staff is associated with severe disability and low quality of life.
