5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left <b>school</b> <b>without</b> finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cupertino, California, Eckhart {{moved to}} England at age 13, {{when his father}} {{relocated}} the family. Several years later, he began his acting career by performing in school plays, before moving to Australia for his high school senior year. He left high <b>school</b> <b>without</b> graduating, but earned a diploma through an adult education course, and graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film. For much of the mid-1990s, he lived in New York City as a struggling, unemployed actor.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, the Saltire can {{be flown}} {{at any time}} by any individual, company, local authority, {{hospital}} or <b>school</b> <b>without</b> obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.|$|E
5|$|Other bull terriers like Saxa {{filled in}} as mascot until World War II, when {{athletics}} {{at the school}} paused during the war. After the war, a series of Great Danes, named Bo, Butch, and Hobo, served as mascot. William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, {{was one of the}} students to care for Butch. During this time period mascot abductions by rival schools became a common threat to the animal's safety. A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school, but in 1951, the school suspended the football program {{as part of a larger}} backlash against university sports. This left the <b>school</b> <b>without</b> a mascot.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the school}} adopted the General Certificate of Education, but {{students}} {{were barred from}} taking any exams {{before the age of}} 16, which meant that many students left <b>school</b> <b>without</b> any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5percent in 1970, peaking at 95percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88percent pass rate in 1978. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Eleventh grade {{students}} (n = 1, 953) in 17 public schools across New York State were surveyed regarding their agricultural perceptions and stereotypes. Four types of schools were targeted for this study: {{rural and urban}} schools with agriculture programs, and rural and urban <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> agriculture programs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine perceptions among high school students about agriculture and careers in agriculture. Results indicated a lack of understanding regarding the importance of a college education for agricultural careers. The agricultural perception scores of students attending a school with an agriculture program but not enrolled in an agriculture course were similar to the scores of students attending <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> agriculture programs; only the students enrolled in agricultural education courses had significantly higher perception scores. The demographics from the rural <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> agriculture programs indicated an opportunity may exist to expand agriculture programs within these areas. The majority of the population believed no specific individual, media, and/or environment influenced their perception; however those who indicated an influence held more positive perceptions of the field of agriculture...|$|R

25|$|The year 828 saw Kūkai {{open his}} School of Arts and Sciences (Shugei shuchi-in). The {{school was a}} private {{institution}} open to all regardless of social rank. This was {{in contrast to the}} only other school in the capital which was only open to members of the aristocracy. The school taught Taoism and Confucianism, in addition to Buddhism, and provided free meals to the pupils. The latter was essential because the poor could not afford to live and attend the <b>school</b> <b>without</b> it. The school closed ten years after Kūkai's death, when it was sold in order to purchase some rice fields for supporting monastic affairs.|$|E

Students who enter the <b>school</b> <b>without</b> Algebra I credits will take both Algebra I and Geometry Pre-AP as freshman and then follow the aforementioned track until their senior year. If a student who has had both Algebra I and Geometry in their 7th and 8th grade years begins their math curriculum at TAG with Algebra II, they continue on to take Pre-Calculus as a sophomore, AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics as a junior, and AP Calculus BC as a senior.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda, had an {{interest}} in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage. After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products. After attending engineering <b>school</b> <b>without</b> graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes, by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} on practices {{of teachers in}} community secondary <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> adequate teaching and learning facilities in Bukoba Municipality, Kagera. Specifically the study examined if adequacy {{of teaching and learning}} facilities is one of the factors affecting teachers’ motivation and job satisfaction, identified factors making teachers to remain at work and analysed strategies and methods which teachers use to teach in community secondary <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> adequate teaching and learning facilities. The study adopted a mixed research approach, and case study was the design used. The study revealed that teachers are not motivated and not satisfied with the adequacy of teaching and learning facilities. The study showed that teachers are remaining at work although teaching and learning facilities are not adequate because employment opportunities are minimal. Lecturing method and improvisation are mainly used by teachers to teach in community secondary <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> adequate teaching and learning facilities. Adequacy of teaching and learning facilities in community secondary schools in which teachers teach influences their level of job satisfaction and motivation. Inadequacy of teaching and learning facilities found not to be a major source of teachers’ quit from teaching job though strategies and methods teachers use to adjust themselves with teaching job are challengeable. The study recommends appropriate strategies to be designed to find adequate school facilities to motivate and satisfy teachers. Also, the study recommends that schools should not be registered until teaching and learning facilities are adequate to check the problem of having <b>schools</b> <b>without</b> adequate <b>school</b> facilities...|$|R
