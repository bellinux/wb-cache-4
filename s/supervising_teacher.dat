25|$|Having {{discovered}} his sexual inclination early in life, Negoiţescu {{claimed to have}} had his first sexual experiences while still a young boy. According to his own testimony, he made his coming out at around age sixteen, when he wrote about his homosexuality in a test paper which he then handed to his <b>supervising</b> <b>teacher.</b> Reportedly, the paper was graded a ten out of ten, without further commentary from its recipient. Negoiţescu later openly assumed his sexual identity and, in contrast to other gay men of 20th century Romania, did not deny {{it in front of}} the conservative cultural establishment (see LGBT rights in Romania). At the time however, the various ways in which the adolescent Negoiţescu disregarded social conventions caused a rift between him and his parents, resulting in the first of his several suicide attempts. Negoiţescu's subsequent life was marked by successive bouts of clinical depression and self-hatred.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if preservice teachers, during their student teaching experiences., were utilizing the strategies they had learned in university methods courses, and if these strategies were being modeled by the <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers.</b> Responses were obtained from 31 preservice elementary teachers. Students responded to questions based on the following constructs: classroom management; type of assessment; experiential learning; integrative curriculum; and multicultural education. A comparison of the means of the two groups (e. g., student <b>teachers</b> vs. <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers)</b> was made through the use of t-tests. There was a significant difference between how the student teachers perceived their use of effective inszructional strategies and what they reported they had observed being used by their <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers</b> in all areas but one.

40|$|The Australian Professional Teaching Standards require pre-service {{teachers}} {{to complete a}} minimum number of days of professional experience in order to graduate. Problems can arise, however, when the evaluation of their professional experience against the Standards shifts from the providers of teacher education programmes to school-based <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers.</b> The Lesson Observation On-line Platform (LOOP) begins to address these problems by utilising a secure, shared digital platform to facilitate evidence-based evaluation {{of the performance of}} {{pre-service teachers}}. In this research, we evaluated the potential of LOOP to assess pre-service teachers against the Standards as well as to enhance the professional development of both pre-service <b>teachers</b> and their <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers.</b> The responses from two pre-service <b>teachers</b> and their <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers</b> demonstrate that the methodological matters can be easily overcome. Nevertheless our findings indicate that there are several practical issues that need to be overcome if LOOP were to be fully successful...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} the Bakhtinian {{conceptualisation}} of ideological becoming to examine the professional becoming of pre-service teachers (PSTs) and their <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers</b> in paired placements as they negotiate unfamiliar situations and tensions. It considers the changing environment of the placement space in Australia by examining findings from survey and interview data with secondary PSTs and their <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers.</b> The findings suggest collaborative teaching in the secondary teaching space was an unfamiliar discourse, with many PSTs perceiving {{the outcome of a}} paired placement as limiting their ability to practice their skills in teaching, and with <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers</b> placing limited value on the skills learnt from the experience. The findings illustrated that for paired placements to make a valuable contribution to PST and supervising teachers’ professional becoming it is important to carefully consider the purpose and use of paired placements and in this chapter I suggest strategies for doing so. The chapter concludes by considering the potential of future of alternative models of placement such as paired and group placements and the development of strong school-university partnerships with clusters of schools...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if discrepancies existed in the views of principals, <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers,</b> and Chapter I paraprofessionals regarding the actual and ideal role behavior of Chapter I paraprofessionals. The study also sought to determine if there were discrepancies between paraprofessionals 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of role content and role behavior. In addition, the differences among certain biographical variables: age, sex, education, experience, certification and role knowledge of the paraprofessionals were examined. The study was conducted during the 1988 - 89 school year. A questionnaire based on the job description of Chapter I paraprofessionals was developed by the researcher and mailed to randomly selected principals, <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers,</b> and Chapter I paraprofessionals in the elementary schools of a large metropolitan school system. The sample included 27 principals, 46 <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 46 paraprofessionals. Given a list of role behavior tasks on the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to identify actual duties performed by Chapter I paraprofessionals, give frequencies of duties, and indicate ideal duties that should be performed by the paraprofessionals. The paraprofessionals were also asked to complete a role knowledge questionnaire and demographic checklist of biographical variables. There was an 82 percent return of completed questionnaires. FINDINGS Significant differences were found in the views of principals, <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers,</b> and the paraprofessionals themselves regarding ideal role behavior of paraprofessionals. Significant differences were found between the views of Chapter I paraprofessionals concerning their actual role behavior and their role knowledge. A significant difference was found among age groups of paraprofessionals regarding role knowledge. It was recommended that administrators, <b>supervising</b> <b>teachers,</b> and Chapter I paraprofessionals be more involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the Chapter I program. Adherence to the guidelines should be an important focus; and superintendents should ensure that principals and staff adhere to the guidelines. Additionally, there should be frequent monitoring of Chapter I services with technical support and assistance available from area, central, and state consultants. In-service should be given at the beginning and continue throughout the school year. Mature and better educated paraprofessionals should be hired for the Chapter I program...|$|R
