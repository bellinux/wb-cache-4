If the sentence is split into a main and <b>subclause</b> and the verbs highlighted, the logic behind the word order can be seen.|$|E

40|$|My paper {{presents}} a diachronic {{study of the}} Left Periphery of Hungarian comparative <b>subclauses,</b> primarily focussing {{on the development of}} the complementisers and the operator. Adopting a cartographic approach, I will show that there were two main interrelated processes at work in the development of these <b>subclauses,</b> changing the initial configuration of hogy ‘that’ as a complementiser to a new one having mint ‘than’ as a C head, possibly followed by an overt operator. These two processes involve the reanalysis of mint from an operator to a complementiser by way of the relative cycle, and the appearance of new overt comparative operators due to a change in the deletion of the operator (Comparative Deletion) ...|$|R

5000|$|Both {{juxtapose}} two actions, {{the action}} in the <b>subclause</b> and {{the action in}} the main clause. The difference between them is that with se the action in the <b>subclause</b> necessarily came first, while -ko conveys more of an unordered juxtaposition. Se is frequently used to imply causation, and in many common expressions like manna se pankapsupni ta [...] mannaseo bangapseumnida (literally, [...] "Since I met you, I'm happy" [...] or [...] "Having met you, I'm happy"). If -ko was used instead, the meaning would be closer to [...] "I meet you and I'm happy," [...] that is, without any implied logical connection.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{sometimes}} called gerunds, the verb form that ends in se {{and the one}} that ends in -ko juxtapose two actions, the action in the <b>subclause</b> and the action in the main clause. The difference between them is that with se the action in the <b>subclause</b> necessarily came first, while -ko conveys more of an unordered juxtaposition. se is frequently used to imply causation, and is used in many common expressions like manna se pan.kapsupnita [...] Manna-seo bangapseumnida (literally, [...] "Since I met you, I'm happy" [...] -or- [...] "Having met you, I'm happy").

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we will present {{evidence}} for language specific preferences in anaphor resolution from two {{series of experiments}} in English, German, and French.

We will argue that our data can most easily be explained by a usage-based account, linking comprehension preferences to production preferences...|$|R
