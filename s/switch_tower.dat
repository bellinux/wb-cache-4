25|$|On February 16, 1925, the Board of Transportation {{directed}} its {{engineers to}} prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at twelve stations along the Fourth Avenue Line (Myrtle Avenue, DeKalb Avenue, Pacific Street, Union Street, Ninth Street, Prospect Avenue, 25th Street, 45th Street, 53rd Street, Bay Ridge Avenue, 77th Street, and 86th Street) to accommodate eight-car trains {{at the cost}} of $633,000. Later that month, on February 28, the Board made public the bids for the contract to complete the 95th Street terminal station. The station, as part of the contract, was built with two tracks, and was built to be 530 feet long to accommodate eight-car trains. A signal and <b>switch</b> <b>tower,</b> and a dispatcher's office was also built at the station. On April 22, 1925, it was announced that $200,000 had been appropriated by the BMT to pay for signal equipment, station control and lighting, drainage and ventilating equipment, and for telephone cables. The final extension to 95th Street, Route 18, opened on October 31, 1925.|$|E

50|$|Huntingdon Borough Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Huntingdon in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. The district includes 521 contributing buildings in the central business district and surrounding residential areas of Huntingdon. They date from the late-18th century to the arly-20th century, and are primarily two- and three-story brick or frame structures. The buildings are reflective of popular architectural styles including Federal, Italianate, and Queen Anne. Notable buildings include the county jail (1829), Union Depot (1872), Penn Hunt Hotel (1873-1874), <b>switching</b> <b>tower</b> (c. 1900), Fisher and McMurtie's Store (c. 1850), Reed's Drug Store (1865), Port Building (1875), Iron Front Store (1884), and Blair Building (1889).|$|R

50|$|The 189-acre {{site was}} {{acquired}} by the BBC in November 1939 and the station, known as Overseas Extension 3 (OSE3), was equipped with four Marconi type SWB 18, 100 kW short-wave transmitters. The transmitter halls, each containing a pair of these transmitters, were separated by heavy blast walls. A comprehensive aerial system was installed consisting of 29 arrays supported between 15 masts of heights varying between l00 ft and 325 ft. Full world coverage was given by this aerial system, although the transmissions were primarily intended for areas outside Europe. This {{was the first of}} the BBC's short-wave stations to be provided with 4-wire transmission lines, following tests made at Daventry (OSE1). A remotely controlled <b>switching</b> <b>tower</b> was used for connecting any transmitter to any aerial array (antenna).|$|R

It is the last stop for New Haven super-express trains before they run non-stop to Grand Central Terminal in New York. Just east of the station is the South Norwalk Railroad Bridge, and next to that is the SONO <b>Switch</b> <b>Tower</b> Museum, a preserved <b>switch</b> <b>tower</b> which is open on summer weekend afternoons.

He also urges Peter to remember exactly what distracted him on the day of Evie's death. Peter recalls looking into a toy shop window at a railroad set, specifically, a model of a <b>switch</b> <b>tower.</b> The next morning, he investigates the <b>switch</b> <b>tower</b> beside the tracks and finds Barry, who has committed suicide, inside. When the police arrive, Peter confesses to Barbara that Barry was there the night of the accident, but he intentionally left him out of the confession. Later, he tells her about his hallucinations since Evie's death. When she does not believe him, he tells her details about Erica that he wouldn't otherwise know. Rattled, she orders him to leave.|$|E

There were connections to a roundhouse used for helper locomotives. In 1942, the switching towers at West Henryville and Analomink were replaced by electric interlockings, remotely controlled from the Gravel Place tower. The equipment at Gravel Place was moved to another tower (in East Stroudsburg) in 1950; thereafter Gravel Place was unmanned.|$|E

50|$|The middle {{track is}} used for storage of rush hour trains, or for {{maintenance}} and refuse trains. West (railroad south) of this station, the center track has switches to the two outer tracks before ending at a bumper block, while the trackway continues into Classon Avenue.

The tail tracks continue to Marcy Avenue and end at bumper blocks.

50|$|The easternmost two {{tracks were}} used by Brighton trains. The westernmost pair {{were used by}} Culver trains, which {{continued}} north along the Fifth Avenue elevated towards Downtown Brooklyn and City Hall in Manhattan. At {{the south end of}} the platforms, gates were present to further segregate inbound and outbound passengers. Passengers were required to purchase tickets before boarding (unlike at other stations, where fares were collected on trains), via ticket booths in the passenger concourse designed to resemble an elevated car cab. At the north end of the elevated station was a dispatchers office, connected to the western outer platform. Further north was a signal and <b>switch</b> <b>tower.</b> On the west side of the depot, there were five balloon loops for terminating streetcars. Additional storage tracks for both elevated trains and streetcars were at the north end of the depot.|$|E

In 1958, Metro Parks took over operations and made renovations in 1961-62. Currently unused, the lighthouse is occasionally open for public tours, including on the annual Doors Open Toronto weekend.|$|R
