5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum <b>smectite,</b> iron/magnesium <b>smectite,</b> kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E

The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} <b>smectite</b> clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E

Swelling and dispersion of the clays were evaluated from the changes in hydraulic onductivity of the mixture and from the clay concentration in the effluent. The effect of exchangeable potassium percentage (EPP) on the hydraulic onductivity ofthe <b>smectites</b> depended on the charge density of the clays. The effect of potassium at EPPs < 20 on the hydraulic conductivity ofsmectites having high charge density was negligible. Conversely, the hydraulic onductivity of <b>smectites</b> having low charge density (<b>smectites</b> from Wyoming and Belle Fourche, South Dakota), changed markedly when leached with ddute solutions as the EPP of the clay increased. The dispersive effect of exchangeable potassium on low-charge <b>smectites</b> was similar to that of exchangeable sodium.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study of}} the Quaternary clay {{sedimentation}} i the Grenada Basin (Southeastern Caribbean) is based on six cores raised from depths of 1800 to 3000 m.

Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, <b>smectite,</b> sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E

Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance.

Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface <b>smectite</b> clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This tudy {{investigates the}} {{complexes}} formed between amino acids, {{which are the}} natural degradation products of organic matter, and <b>smectites.</b> Thus, the adsorption and desorption behavior of cysteine and Na-, Ca-, Cu-homoionic <b>smectites</b> with different layer-charge location, a montmorillonite, and a beidellite, were studied. The clay samples were treated with Na, Ca, and Cu 1 N solutions {{and then with a}} 0. 2 M cysteine solution. To test smectite-cysteine stability at acidic pH, the solids obtained were repeatedly treated with distilled water acidified to pH = 5. All treated samples were characterized by thermal, X-ray diffraction, chemical, and infrared analyses. The results showed that: 1) Na- and Ca-rich <b>smectites</b> adsorbed and retained small amounts of cysteine, and did not show interlayer cation-cysteine complexes, whereas the amino acid was strongly retained in the interlayer by Cu-rich smectites; 2) d(001) -values for Na- and Ca-rich <b>smectites</b> howed little or no expansion, whereas for the Cu-rich <b>smectites</b> the intercalation of the organic molecule produced a swelling of the structure; 3) the interaction mechanism of homoionic <b>smectites</b> with cysteine in an aqueous medium occurs by weak interactions, (e. g., van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and other electrostatic forces such as entropy-driven hydrophobic bonding), and/or by complexes involving interlayer cations and organic ligands.

40|$|Natural bentonites are an {{important}} material in the casting industry. <b>Smectites</b> as {{the main component of}} bentonites plasticize and stabilise sand moulds. Pore water as well as interlayer water within the <b>smectites</b> are lost as a function of time, location and temperature. Although rehydration of the <b>smectites</b> should be a reversible process, the industrially dehydrated <b>smectites</b> lose their capability to reabsorb water. This limits the number of possible process cycles of the mould material. A full understanding of the dehydration process would help to optimise the amount of fresh material to be added and thus save resources.

5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and <b>smectite.</b> Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Cu-triethylenetetramine-complex (Cutrien) {{is one of}} the {{commonly}} used index cations for CEC determination in clay science. Cutrien-exchanged <b>smectites</b> show basal spacings between 13. 0 and 13. 5 A ̊ after correction for the Lorentz and polarization factors. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the d 001 reflection is today related to the percentage of tetrahedral charge (beidellitic character) and/or to the Fe content of the <b>smectites.</b> The structural Fe content and the tetrahedral charge correlate, so their individual influence on d 001 cannot be resolved. Nevertheless, the FWHM of Cutrien <b>smectites</b> should depend on the charge distribution rather than the Fe content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and water uptake capacity measurements showed that the interlayer of Cutrien-exchanged <b>smectites</b> does not swell any more, but can take up a few water molecules. Accordingly, the water uptake capacity of the external surface area can be determined independently from the interlayer water uptake capacity. Adjusting the pH of Cutrien-bentonite dispersion to different values allows for the determination of the variable charge. In conclusion, Cutrien exchange of <b>smectites</b> appears to be suitable for the study of external surfaces area related phenomena (e. g. edge adsorption processes) without any influence of the interlayer region...|$|R

In field trials, conducted by scientists from the International Water Management Institute in cooperation with Khon Kaen University and local farmers, this {{had the effect of}} helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%.

25|$|Carbonate rocks dominantly {{consist of}} {{carbonate}} minerals such as calcite, aragonite or dolomite. Both the cement and the clasts (including fossils and ooids) of a carbonate sedimentary rock can consist of carbonate minerals. The mineralogy of a clastic rock {{is determined by}} the material supplied by the source area, the manner of its transport to the place of deposition and the stability of that particular mineral. The resistance of rock forming minerals to weathering is expressed by Bowen's reaction series. In this series, quartz is the most stable, followed by feldspar, micas, and finally other less stable minerals that are only present when little weathering has occurred. The amount of weathering depends mainly on the distance to the source area, the local climate and the time it took for the sediment to be transported {{to the point where it}} is deposited. In most sedimentary rocks, mica, feldspar and less stable minerals have been reduced to clay minerals like kaolinite, illite or <b>smectite.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or <b>smectite,</b> illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) including high-resolution transmission electron mi-croscopy (HRTEM) and analytical {{electron microscopy}} (AEM) {{were used to}} study the fine clay fraction (< 0. 1 Ixm) from the eluvial E horizon of podzols located in central Finland that had developed from till materials. Soils of increasing age (6500 - 9850 y BP) were selected to represent a chronosequence of soil development. Expandable phyllosilicates (vermiculite, <b>smectites)</b> are formed in the eluvial E horizon of podzols {{in a short time}} (6500 y). TEM observations show that dissolution and physical-breakdown pro-cesses affect the clay particles. As the age of the soils increases, fragmentation a d exfoliation of large precursor minerals lead to thinner clay particles of two to three layers thick. The chemical compositions of individual particles obtained by AEM indicate that expandable phyllosilicates from the E horizon of podzols are heterogeneous, involving a mixture of vermiculite, Mg-bearing <b>smectites,</b> and aluminous beidellite. Results suggest hat heterogeneity is related to the nature of their precursors. Vermiculite and Mg-bearing <b>smectites</b> are derived from biotite and chlorite weathering whereas phengitic micas alter to aluminous beidellite. Because the transformation f biotite and chlorite is more rapid than phengitic micas, biotite and chlorite contributes predominantly to <b>smectites</b> in the younger soils, as long as ferromagnesian phyllosilicates are present in the E horizons.

25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and are not exactly linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a meteoric water δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and adularia in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of hydrous silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original meteoric water signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in <b>smectite</b> {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to hydrous minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD lapse rate in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of meteoric water observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm hydrous mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E

The investigation of Cu-triene-exchanged <b>smectites,</b> which on drying at 105 degrees C still had a d(001) value accounting for approximately 13 A, proved that the SSA(N 2 BET) of low-charged <b>smectites</b> increased more than that of high-charged <b>smectites.</b> This could be explained by: (i) more space between the permanent charge sites in the case of low-charged <b>smectites</b> and (ii) the fact that the layers of Cu-triene <b>smectites</b> do not collapse at 105 degrees C. In contrast the SSA(N 2 BET) of Ca(2 +) -exchanged bentonites could not be related to the layer charge density (LCD) {{as in the case of}} the Cu-triene-exchanged bentonites which is probably due to the varying number of collapsed layers. In conclusion, the SSA(N 2 BET) of bentonites which is known to be largely variable is probably determined by microporosity resulting from the quasi-crystalline overlap region and accessible areas of the interlayer. The number of layers per stack and the microstructure are supposed to play a subordinate role.
