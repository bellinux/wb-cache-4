25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E
50|$|The side {{elevations}} {{are similar}} to the front elevations, with central entrances of columns and piers with Doric order capitals and bases. However, they <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the line of the building and do not project forward as the main entrance portico does.|$|E
5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ⌴) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket head cap screw, is required to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{apartment}} complexes are 6 stories of concrete elements {{topped with a}} flat roof. The windows <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with the facade in vertical rows broken by exterior or interior balconies. On the side facing the water the balconies are round while they are rectangular towards the courtyard and street. The {{apartment complexes}} are made of thin elements which is very visible in the exterior, giving the massive buildings a lightness.|$|R
50|$|Normally, voicing {{is carried}} out by {{inserting}} the plectrum into the jack, then placing the jack on a small wooden voicing block, so that {{the top of the}} plectrum <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with the block. The plectrum is then cut and thinned on the underside with a small, very sharp knife, often an X-Acto knife. As the plectrum is progressively trimmed, its jack is replaced in the instrument at intervals to test the result for loudness, tone quality, and the possibility of hanging.|$|R
5000|$|The Maserati Spyder is a soft-top {{convertible}} that is electronically {{operated by}} a pushbutton on the center console. The top automatically stows beneath a hard cover that <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with the body {{in front of the}} boot. Both deployment and stowage of the top takes about 30 seconds. [...] Arch-type roll bars are provided behind each seat. The Spyder's 96.1 in wheelbase is 8.6 in shorter than the Coupé's. Overall length is 169.4 in, width 71.7 in, and height 51.4 in. Curb weight is 3600 lb.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the design, the {{headlamps}} may {{be mounted}} in a housing that rotates {{so as to}} <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the front end as on the Porsche 928, may retract into the hood and/or fenders as on the 1963-2004 Chevrolet Corvette, or may be concealed behind retractable or rotating grille panels as on the Dodge Charger, Mercury Comet, or the 1960s Buick Riviera, which pioneered the feature.|$|E
5000|$|... 22 is a {{suite of}} {{electrical}} accessories that {{eliminate the need for}} a visible cover plate. Operative components (such as outlets, switches, and ports) are designed to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with any surface they are mounted to. The 22 series won a Red Dot Award, a Yellow Pencil Yearbook Entry and an iF Design Award in 2009. 22 holds US Patent Numbers 7,956,295 and 8,232,482.|$|E
50|$|Installation problem: However it happens, {{this is the}} toughie. There is an offset and {{the shutter}} does not <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the casing. The shutter may sit proud on the casing as drawn, or the shutter sits within the casing with its {{thickness}} exceeding the rabbet depth - in any case the hinge and pintle will each mount at a different distance {{from the face of}} the structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{model used}} for the ES-125 has a string spacing on the neck pickup of 1" [...] from high E to low E. The ES-125 also used a tapered dogear cover for their neck {{position}} pickups with a thickness of 4/16" [...] on the treble side and 5/16" [...] on the bass side. Since the fingerboard <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> to the body (as opposed to an ES-175) the ES-125 requires a shorter neck pickup than a typical dogear. This pickup is, however, not as short as those found on an ES-330TD which has the pickup mounted flush {{to the end of}} the fingerboard.|$|R
50|$|Rides {{custom-designed}} {{to accommodate}} wheelchair riders means that every family member {{can enjoy the}} fun. Adapted rides include the Wonderland Express train, with a half-mile of track that wraps around the park’s scenic lake; the Off-Road Adventure, where guests can test their driving skills in sporty vehicles; the Whirling Wonder™ Ferris wheel, with a dozen brightly colored gondolas that rise up to 5 ½ stories high for panoramic views of the park; and a carousel, offering all kinds of horses and other animals ready to be ridden. The latter <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with the ground and has “chariots” that {{move up and down}} as the carousel turns, giving those in wheelchairs the same sensation as guests riding horses.|$|R
50|$|The Sendai Mediatheque {{is located}} {{in the heart of the}} city of Sendai, only a few blocks away from the city hall. The {{building}} <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with Jozenji street, a six-lane divided boulevard, although there are entrances on all four sides of the building. The diaphanous glass and metal façade of the institution, while differing from the mainly white, opaque volumes of the neighbouring buildings, blends harmoniously with the environment during the daytime due to its reflectivity, while at night the interior lighting scheme transforms the volume into a multi-hued lantern. The ground floor is conceived as an extension of the street, with a cafe, bookstore, and event plaza sitting freely (without partitions) within the ground floor space, with views to the sidewalk through the double-glazed facade facing Jozenji Street.|$|R
50|$|To retract {{the blade}} the button is again pressed {{so that its}} slot aligns with the blade. The cocking arm is pulled {{backwards}} which itself pulls the blade backward. When the blade is fully retracted the spring mounted button rests in the forward notch and again pops up and locks the blade in the cocked position. The cocking arm is then manually pushed forward to again <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the handle.|$|E

50|$|A {{countersink}} (symbol: ⌵) is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} countersunk bolt or screw, when placed in the hole, to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.|$|E
50|$|The Magic Trackpad mainly {{consists}} {{of glass and}} aluminium. The device's design {{is similar to the}} trackpad found on the current MacBook family of laptops, but 80% larger. It connects via Bluetooth and runs on two AA batteries. The trackpad is designed in the same style as Apple's Wireless Keyboard, and when put next to one, <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> to it. Usage can be compared to the multitouch trackpads found in Apple's MacBook and Macbook Pro laptops. Additionally, the entire pad can be clicked; pressing on the device puts pressure on it and the surface it is resting on, pushing down two circular feet {{at the base of the}} trackpad, registering a click. The trackpad's required software update also added inertial scrolling and three-finger drag gestures to certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{design to}} the toggle switch is the rocker switch. Large switches of this design are {{commonly known as}} [...] "decorator style" [...] in the United States. Switches of this design <b>sit</b> almost <b>flush</b> with the wall plate, and are activated by [...] "rocking" [...] a flat, broad lever, rather than pushing a short protruding actuator up or down.|$|R
50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old lock pins with new lock pins. Locks are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the lock has 5 pins. Different brand locks each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R
50|$|This was Murano's debut {{work after}} he left Setsu Watanabe's office. Completed in 1931 the Morigo {{building}} was a seven storey office building situated in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. The baked salt tiles on the façade give it a warmer presence to the street than would normally be expected for a building of its size. The regularly spaced windows <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> to external face of the wall and this along with the curved corner and expressed eaves-line reduce visual clutter and give the building clean lines. In 1960 an eighth floor was added but {{this has not been}} detrimental to the overall appearance.|$|E
50|$|Bedding {{increases}} {{accuracy in}} part by relieving stress on the action. The rifle's action will rarely <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> in the stock without bedding. This causes the action to flex when tightening the bolts holding the action to the stock. The flexing results {{in a loss of}} accuracy. Bedding will create a flush surface for the action and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of the action in the stock. Without bedding, the action {{may be more likely to}} shift after a shot. If the action shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{associated}} with VIP style usually have common characteristics, {{such as high}} end wheels with excessive amounts of dish. (usually broad faced designs) with low offsets that <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the fender, exhausts that stick out past the rear bumper (although not so much emphasized these days), a full bodykit or lip kit, glossy paint and a lowered ride height. It {{is not uncommon to}} see extremely negative camber on many VIP style cars. Traditional colors of VIP Style cars are usually black, white, grey and silver. The appearance of these vehicles is regarded in Japan as conspicuous and attention-seeking, as owning this type of vehicle is expensive, with regards to the annual road tax obligation.|$|E
50|$|While the Steyr M is {{frequently}} compared to Glock-series pistols (both are polymer-framed striker-fired pistols, with Tenifer finishes), {{there are several}} differences {{in the details of}} the design. For example, the M-series had a fully supported chamber in all chamberings from the start (Some Glock models also had this feature from the start, other Glock models evolved to having more supported chambers when compared to their original internal layout), unique triangular/trapezoid sights, a loaded chamber indicator {{in the form of an}} extractor protrusion, witness hole on the top rear of the barrel and a rod below the rear sights that <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> in the rear of the slide when the chamber is empty and is raised slightly when the chamber is loaded for a visual and tactile indicator of the firearm’s condition (on third and later generation Glock pistols this feature is present on the extractor on the right slide side) and a different grip angle (111°).|$|R
50|$|The NAHRA awards {{the titles}} Started Hunting Retriever (SR), Working Retriever (WR), Master Hunting Retriever (MHR), and Grand Master Hunting Retriever (GMHR). The {{standard}} of {{training for the}} higher levels of NAHRA hunt test require a more advanced degree of training than those of AKC hunt tests. These simulate actual hunting by testing for the following skill sets. Quartering, trailing a crippled duck, and <b>sit</b> to <b>flush.</b> NAHRA tests are primarily for nonslip retrievers, although many spaniel and versatile breeds may compete. Poodles, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers(NSDTR) are often found on the NAHRA scene.|$|R
25|$|The {{rectangular}} church comprises a nave and presbytery {{flanked by}} lateral corridors, with a sacristy {{to the left}} of the altar. The main facade faces west, defined by Tuscan pilasters crowned with pyramidal pinnacles over parallel-elliptical plinths. The central wall along the nave is decorated in blue and white azulejo tiles. This two-storey high facade and azulejo wall are broken by a frieze and cornices over finial cut-breaks, forming lateral volutes, which are topped by a vegetal-shaped frontispiece crowned by a rectangular Latin cross. At the centre of the frontispiece is a niche formed from semi-circular conch shell and decorated lateral frame. The niche is framed by a rectangular border and surmounted by an inverted fleur-de-lis motif. The first basalt image installed in the niche was later sold to the priests of the Society of Jesus, and later installed in the niche of a house of Fajã de Cima. On the first floor is a simple framed door and on the second-floor three rectangular windows framed by false corbels and terminated in a frieze and cornice. The central window is larger and flanked by two vertical friezes. The lateral panels are plastered and painted in white, corresponding to the northern bell-tower, and a false bell-tower to the south, marked by a belfry in mortar, painted to imitate stonework. Three doorways access the building: the larger central door occupies the main facade, with two lateral doorways underneath the real and false belfreys. The rectangular false belfry door is inset from the facade, and surmounted by a rectangular oculus, while the lattice-door under the real belfrey (with similar rectangular frame) <b>sits</b> <b>flush</b> on the facade.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} upgraded {{as well with}} blue-lit dashboard controls (unlike the green color used in other Hyundai models), a gated shifter pattern, illuminated cup holders, and higher quality leather on Limited models. The rear seat head restraints caused visibility problems in the previous model due to their size. The new style features 'shingled' head rests that when lowered completely, <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with {{the top of the}} seat, helping to maximize rear visibility. The middle rear seating position now comes with its own head restraint and a three-point seat belt built in. LATCH child seat anchors are also standard, and an optional 50/50 third row seat allows Santa Fe to seat seven passengers.|$|E
50|$|During {{this same}} period, another style became {{available}} {{in which the}} lenses were mounted to two arms {{as well as a}} bridge; the style became known as three-piece glasses for the three separate structural components. The most popular three-piece style was known as a riding temple, and was modeled after a style of eyeglasses favored by those who relied on horses for transportation. The style lacked nosepads, and featured small, oval lenses designed to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the face by way of the combined efforts of curved temples that conformed {{to the back of the}} wearer's ears and a curved nosepiece that conformed to the bridge of the nose. The design eliminated any obstruction of vision caused by eyeglass frames and also kept the glasses secure on the wearer's head.|$|E
5000|$|The Joachim Plambeck House is a {{historic}} house located in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. It and the neighboring Claus Untiedt House are replicas of each other, although the Plambeck House has more alterations. [...] The 2-story Late Victorian style residence features a three-bay façade with a side entrance and a front gable. An enclosed porch was added in the re-entrant angle. Stone hoods that <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the exterior wall decorate {{the tops of the}} rectangular windows. The light pink brick structure rests on a stone foundation that has subsequently been covered with cement. The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984. [...] Joachim Plambeck, who was the first occupant of this house, was a German immigrant and worked as a woodworker.|$|E
60|$|Well, therefore, {{might he}} <b>sit</b> with <b>flushed</b> cheeks and {{sparkling}} eyes chewing {{the butt of}} his pen and smiling to himself at the memory of the enthusiasm of which he had been the centre a half-hour ago. Here, indeed, was something that a man might live for, something that a man might take pride in, and something that might console a man for a woman's treachery. What, indeed, could woman's love give him that might compare with this? Was it not more glorious far to make himself the admired, the revered, the very idol of those stern men, than the beloved of a simpering girl? The latter any coxcomb with a well-cut coat might encompass, but the former achievement was a man's work.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat with}} Gerald {{drinking}} some sweetish liqueur, and staring with black, sullen {{looks at the}} various groups {{of people at the}} tables. She would greet nobody, but young men nodded to her frequently, with a kind of sneering familiarity. She cut them all. And it gave her pleasure to <b>sit</b> there, cheeks <b>flushed,</b> eyes black and sullen, seeing them all objectively, as put away from her, like creatures in some menagerie of apish degraded souls. God, what a foul crew they were! Her blood beat black and thick in her veins with rage and loathing. Yet she must sit and watch, watch. One or two people came to speak to her. From every side of the Cafe, eyes turned half furtively, half jeeringly at her, men looking over their shoulders, women under their hats.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there is}} singing, the strange bestial singing of these hills. Sometimes the guitars {{can play an}} accompaniment, but usually not. Then the men lift up their heads and send out the high, half-howling music, astounding. The words are in dialect. They argue among {{themselves}} for a moment: will the Signoria understand? They sing. The Signoria does not understand in the least. So with a strange, slightly malignant triumph, the men sing all the verses of their song, sitting round {{the walls of the}} little parlour. Their throats move, their faces have a slight mocking smile. The boy capers in the doorway like a faun, with glee, his straight black hair falling over his forehead. The elder brother <b>sits</b> straight and <b>flushed,</b> but even his eyes glitter with a kind of yellow light of laughter. Paolo also sits quiet, with the invisible smile on his face.' Only Maria, large and active, prospering now, keeps collected, ready to order a shrill silence {{in the same way as}} she orders the peasants, violently, to keep their places.|$|R

It and the neighboring Joachim Plambeck House are replicas of each other, although the Plambeck House has more alterations. [...] The 2-story Late Victorian style residence features a three-bay façade with a side entrance and a front gable. Two-story porches {{on the front and}} back of the east wing feature an Eastlake character. Stone hoods that <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with the exterior wall with drip lintels decorate the tops of the rectangular windows. The dark red brick structure rests on a stone foundation that has subsequently been covered with cement. [...] The main entryway may have been altered and its porch may have been removed. [...] The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984.|$|E
50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|E
50|$|Bocci's {{success as}} a company allowed Arbel to move several more designs into production, notably 22 and 28. 22 is a {{collection}} of electrical accessories designed without the visual disruption of a cover plate, allowing outlets and switches to <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> with their surroundings. Arbel was awarded a Red Dot Award and a Yellow Pencil yearbook entry at the D&AD awards in 2009 for 22. 28 is a hand-blown glass pendant with interior glass satellites that is available in a multitude of colours. It is created through a complicated technique that involves adding and removing air while heating and cooling a glass matrix. It is emblematic of Arbel’s search for “specificity in manufacturing,” essentially designing a system that produces form rather than designing the form itself. Arbel received an iF product design award and the Best of Year Award from Interior Design Magazine in 2011 for 28.|$|E
50|$|The car, cheap {{gasoline}} and postwar affluence created boom {{conditions for the}} expansion of suburbia. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the <b>flush,</b> <b>sit</b> toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.|$|R
5000|$|South San Francisco is {{not known}} as a tourist destination, {{but it is a}} key {{landmark}} visible to anyone who travels along the San Francisco Peninsula or through the nearby San Francisco International Airport. Sign Hill, near San Bruno Mountain State Park, displays huge letters on its mountainside [...] which reads [...] "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO THE INDUSTRIAL CITY." [...] The letters are made of painted concrete and <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> along the hillside (in contrast to the raised steel letters of the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles). The sign was put up in the 1920s, and in 1996 was given a place in the National Register of Historic Places as an outstanding example of early 20th-Century [...] "civic boosterism", a tribute to the past importance of heavy industry to the regional economy, and recognizing significant contributions the area made during World Wars I and II.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2013, FCS {{introduced}} FCS II [...] a new pre-glass fin {{system to}} the market. The new system boasts {{a number of key}} advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, {{the leading edge of the}} fin resides inside the plug, and the base of the fins <b>sit</b> <b>flush</b> to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the new system is that it’s backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two grub screws and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the new system. Many consider the new system inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the new system and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity Project fins.|$|E
