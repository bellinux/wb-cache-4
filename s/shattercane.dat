Problematic soils such as acidic soil are a frequent problem for farmers. Weeds reduce yields and compete with sorghum. Weeds that are commonly associated with Sorghum are striga, <b>shattercane,</b> and jonsongrass. Other common pests and diseases in sorghum are anthacnose, and greenbug. It is important to include genetic diversity to stabilize yield because it can be insurance against unexpected pests and disease outbreaks.|$|E

Nonirrigated sorghum had 67 % infestation compared to 53 % for irrigated sorghum. <b>Shattercane</b> infestation in soybean fields was lowest at 30 and 29 % of the irrigated and nonirrigated fields, respectively. Rotation of corn or sorghum into soybeans reduced <b>shattercane</b> infestation 9 and 20 % compared to continuous corn or sorghum, respectively. Rectangular hyperbolic models were constructed to describe <b>shattercane</b> interference with corn, sorghum, and soybeans. Total crop loss from <b>shattercane</b> interference exceeded $ 14 million annually for thirty counties in Nebraska. ^ <b>Shattercane</b> interference in irrigated soybeans was evaluated during 1987, 1988, and 1989 at Clay Center, Nebraska. <b>Shattercane</b> interference with soybeans began when <b>shattercane</b> height exceeded soybean height. Significant soybean yield loss occurred before the height differential reached 30 cm. Soybean nodes/stem, pods/stem, and beans/pod decreased as duration of interference increased. Soybean plant height, biomass, nodes/stem, pods/stem, pods/node, and beans/pod decreased as <b>shattercane</b> density increased. A <b>shattercane</b> interference model for estimation of soybean yield and economic loss was developed utilizing rectangular hyperbolic models. ^ <b>Shattercane</b> seed survival during soil burial was {{highly dependent on}} attached glumes. <b>Shattercane</b> seed tightly enclosed by glumes averaged 5 and 53 % germination after four months of winter burial in 1988 and 1989. <b>Shattercane</b> caryopsis survival averaged 0. 5 and 17 % compared to 17 and 41 % when treated with seed fungicides. <b>Shattercane</b> caryopsis tannin and lignin content {{were significantly higher than}} for cultivated sorghum caryopsis.

However, grain sorghum and <b>shattercane</b> can interbreed, and introduced traits such as herbicide tolerance could increase the invasiveness of the weedy relative. Moreover, ALS-resistance in <b>shattercane</b> populations has been reported, indicating that over-reliance on ALS-chemistry may also select for resistant biotypes. In 2013, seeds from 190 <b>shattercane</b> and 59 johnsongrass populations were collected with the objective to evaluate the distribution of ALS-resistance in weedy-sorghum populations across northern Kansas and Nebraska. Five <b>shattercane</b> and five johnsongrass populations were confirmed resistant to imazethapyr. Four <b>shattercane</b> and three johnsongrass populations were confirmed resistant to nicosulfuron. All ALS-resistant <b>shattercane</b> and johnsongrass populations were collected in Nebraska except for one nicosulfuron-resistant johnsongrass population collected in Kansas. Inzen sorghum will carry a double mutation in the ALS gene (Val 560 Ile and Trp 574 Leu), which confers high levels of resistance to ALS herbicides. Primers specific to the Val 560 and Trp 574 region of the ALS-gene were used to screen populations using PCR. The Trp 574 Leu mutation was present in one ALS-resistant johnsongrass population. The Val 560 Ile was detected in resistant and susceptible <b>shattercane</b> and johnsongrass populations, indicating that by itself, Val 560 Ile amino acid substitution does not confer resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. None of our populations presented both mutations simultaneously, as does Inzen sorghum. This research indicates that ALS-resistance persists and that ALS mutations present in Inzen sorghum already exist individually in weedy-sorghum populations. According to our modeling efforts, evolution of resistance was predicted to occur rapidly if Inzen sorghum is planted continuously because of high selection pressure (ALS-herbicide application) and gene flow. The time for resistance evolution was predicted to decrease with increased cropping system complexity (more crop diversity than continuous production of Inzen).

The overall objective of this research was to understand the interaction of weed emergence, weed density, herbicide choice, and herbicide rate in soybean. Specific objectives were 1) to characterize the seedbank and emergence patterns of <b>shattercane</b> (Sorghum bicolor L.), prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.), and ivyleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea Jacq.) including initial, peak, end, and duration of emergence in response to crop and herbicide treatments in soybean, and 2) to evaluate large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), <b>shattercane,</b> Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) mortality and dry weight reduction in response to herbicide rates across varying weed densities as well as to determine the influence of velvetleaf growth stage and density on herbicide efficacy. In the emergence study of 2006 to 2008, four treatments were nocrop, no-residual herbicide, half-rate of residual herbicide and full-rate of residual herbicide. Reduction in weed emergence was observed over the years in the same species patch. Species emerged in mid-May in both years, coinciding with soybean planting. Extended emergence was observed for <b>shattercane</b> when moisture was low and temperature high, while for prickly sida and ivyleaf morningglory, extended emergence was observed when moisture was high and temperature low. Applying residual herbicide decreased weed emergence. Herbicide choice was the whole plot, herbicide rates were subplots and weed densities were sub-subplots in field experiments conducted in 2006 and 2007. <b>Shattercane</b> was more susceptible to both glyphosate and clethodim than large crabgrass. Increasing large crabgrass density reduced percent mortality with clethodim, while with glyphosate, density did not affect both species mortality. <b>Shattercane</b> dry weight was reduced to 0 g per plot with 0. 1 X labeled rate of clethodim or glyphosate while 0. 5 X of the labeled rate reduced dry weight of large crabgrass to 0 g per plot. For broadleaf weeds, higher percent mortality was observed with glyphosate than with lactofen at high densities. Palmer amaranth was more susceptible than velvetleaf. Velvetleaf response was density dependent, such that increasing density did not increase dry weight. Velvetleaf growth stage was of importance, as stage affected herbicide efficacy, with higher mortality achieved at the two-leaf stage than the four- and six-leaf stages. For glyphosate, 0. 125 X of labeled rate on velvetleaf density of 5 seedlings per pot achieved more than 90 % mortality when applied at the two-leaf stage, but dropped to 60 and 50 % mortality when applied at the four- and six-leaf stage, respectively. The trend was the same for velvetleaf at a density of 30 seedlings per pot, which had 80, 60, and 55 % mortality for the two-, four-, and six-leaf stages, respectively.

The overall objective of this research was to understand the interaction of weed emergence, weed density, herbicide choice, and herbicide rate in soybean. Specific objectives were 1) to characterize the seedbank and emergence patterns of <b>shattercane</b> (Sorghum bicolor L.), prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.), and ivyleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea Jacq.) including initial, peak, end, and duration of emergence in response to crop and herbicide treatments in soybean, and 2) to evaluate large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), <b>shattercane,</b> Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S.), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) mortality and dry weight reduction in response to herbicide rates across varying weed densities as well as to determine the influence of velvetleaf growth stage and density on herbicide efficacy. In the emergence study of 2006 to 2008, four treatments were no-crop, no-residual herbicide, half-rate of residual herbicide and full-rate of residual herbicide. Reduction in weed emergence was observed over the years in the same species patch. Specie...|$|E

A field experiment was conducted in 2009 to determine the influence of increasing N fertilizer rates and increasing Palmer amaranth densities on weed biomass and grain sorghum biomass and yield. Three rates were 0, 67, and 134 kg N ha- 1 and natural populations of Palmer amaranth were thinned to densities of 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m- 1 of row. Palmer amaranth biomass increased as weed density and N rates increased. Weed-free grain sorghum yields were similar across all three N rates, and parameter estimates of yield across Palmer amaranth densities were not different between N rates. Based on the parameter estimates from the rectangular hyperbola model, initial slope (I) as density approached zero was 16 %. Maximum expected yield loss (A) at high Palmer amaranth densities was 68 %. Palmer amaranth showed a high response to N and the higher N rate increased the ability of the weed to reduce grain sorghum yield. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the influence of six N rates on growth of six selected plant species, including grain sorghum, soybean, yellow foxtail, velvetleaf, Palmer amaranth and <b>shattercane.</b> Covariance analysis was performed with N rate as a covariate. Biomass of all species increased as N rate increased in both runs of the study. Soybean responded the least to N rate of all species in regards to biomass, height and leaf area production. In the first run, the biomass of three grass species (grain sorghum, yellow foxtail, <b>shattercane)</b> had similar estimates of slope and intercept of biomass across N rates. In the second run, the biomass slopes of grain sorghum and <b>shattercane</b> differed from soybean and were the only slopes that differed between species. Palmer amaranth had the highest rate of response as N increased but slopes of height were similar for Palmer amaranth, grain sorghum and <b>shattercane.</b> Soybean leaf area slopes were different from grain sorghum, yellow foxtail, and velvetleaf, but all other slopes were not different among species. Addition of N to grain sorghum increased weed growth and resulted in more yield loss as a result of weed density. The greenhouse study demonstrated that grain sorghum and Palmer amaranth increased in response similarly to the addition of N. Alternative N fertilizer management could play a role in minimizing Palmer amaranth impacts in grain sorghum production...|$|E

Addition of crop oil concentrate to the spray solution increased phytotoxicity. When plants {{were treated with}} single droplets, smaller concentrated droplets were more phytotoxic than larger more dilute droplets. Application site of single herbicide droplets also influenced phytotoxicity. ^ Fluazifop-butyl, haloxyfop-methyl and sethoxydim exhibited soil herbicidal activity in greenhouse and field experiments. When grass seeds were planted at the soil surface control was greater with all three herbicides than when planted 2, 4, or 6 cm deep. Imbibition of the herbicides by grass and soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. seed did not reduce germination at concentrations of 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 3) M or below. All three herbicides were more readily absorbed from the soil by seedling roots than shoots. Haloxyfop-methyl exhibited the longest soil residual in the field followed by fluazifop-butyl and sethoxydim. Haloxyfop-methyl and fluazifop-butyl controlled <b>shattercane</b> Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench in soybeans with preemergence and early postemergence applications; whereas, control from similar applications of sethoxydim was limited and variable. ^ Behavior of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl was examined in soybean, <b>shattercane,</b> and yellow foxtail Setaria lutescens (Weigel) Hubb. intact plants and soybean and yellow foxtail cell cultures. Foliar absorption of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl was rapid and almost complete within 48 h. Significant translocation occurred within 48 h of treatment with soybean and <b>shattercane</b> plants translocating more (2 ̆ 714) C than yellow foxtail. Metabolism of (2 ̆ 714) C-haloxyfop-methyl in intact plants was similar among the three species. Soybean cells contained greater levels of (2 ̆ 714) C than did yellow foxtail cells.

40|$|Weed {{control is}} by far the most {{pervasive}} and costly need in agriculture, both in underdevel­ oped as well as in technologically advanced production systems. In 1994, losses due to weeds in U. S. agriculture—including herbi­ cide costs and yield losses—amounted to over $ 15 billion, and about 96 % of the more than 21 million acres of row crops grown in Iowa received at least one chemical herbicide appli­ cation. Pesticide use statistics reveal that more herbicides are used than any other class of pesticide. Despite the extensive use of herbi­ cides, certain weed species continue to cause problems in agriculture, and current control strategies for some of these are inadequate.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJohanna A. DilleThis {{dissertation}} has two complementary components: educational, in {{a survey}} of students in Weed Science and their perception of the Kansas State University Agronomy Learning farm, and research, regarding interactions between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides. The Learning Farm serves as a resource where undergraduate students at KSU can develop agronomic skills through hands-on field site experiences and investigations. Students’ perceptions of experiential learning activities in the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills were studied {{as a result of the}} Learning Farm. Activities included: undergraduate students in Weed Science (AGRON 330) developing a weed management recommendation, and Undergraduate Research Assistants (URAs) conducting weed science research projects at the Learning Farm. Students stated that experiential learning activities increased their critical thinking skills, required effective time management, and presented concepts that could be used in other situations. Pre- and post-project evaluation questionnaires showed that URAs had an increased interest in agronomy, weed science, and research following the completion of their project. For the research project, field and greenhouse studies were conducted from 2003 to 2006 to evaluate the efficacy of various sulfonylurea herbicides when applied with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine. Research demonstrated that the addition of mesotrione to sulfonylurea herbicides decreased efficacy of sulfonylurea herbicides on green foxtail, yellow foxtail, and <b>shattercane.</b> The addition of atrazine to the tank mix, or increased mesotrione rates, resulted in additional decrease in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy on <b>shattercane</b> and foxtail species. Additional studies were performed to determine if absorption, translocation, or metabolism was the basis for the reduction in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy when mixed with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine. Results indicated that the cause of antagonistic interaction between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides in green and yellow foxtail was reduced absorption and translocation of the sulfonylurea herbicides. Producers who choose to apply mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides to corn should apply the herbicides sequentially to achieve maximum control of weedy grass species...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse and {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted on}} the fungal bioherbicides Colletotrichum graminicola and Gloeocercospora sorghi on <b>shattercane</b> (Sorghum bicolor), to evaluate any potential interactions among and between these two plant pathogens for management of this weed. Intraspecific interactions were evaluated with back to back applications of C. gramincola or G. sorghi, and results indicate additive or no effects. Results indicate that interspecific interactions between C. graminicola and G. sorghi lower expected disease incidence when C. gramincola is applied first, while the opposite effect occurs when G. sorghi is applied first. Tank mixtures were also evaluated, and results indicate that no synergistic relationships occur when both species are applied simultaneously. When using spores {{in conjunction with the}} chemical herbicide RoundUp (a. i. glyphosate), applying spores with or before glyphosate results in decreased biomass loss, while applying glyphosate prior to spore application results in increased weed biomass loss. Data from intra- and interspecific interactions evaluated in vitro support these findings. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale in 2006 and 2007 {{to evaluate the}} herbicide tembotrione for postemergence grass control. Tembotrione inhibits the p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) enzyme, which aids {{in the formation of}} essential plant constituents for photosynthesis. Tembotrione efficacy was examined in the greenhouse on large crabgrass, giant foxtail, <b>shattercane,</b> and fall panicum. Significant activity that could translate to commercial levels of weed control in the field was found on all species except fall panicum. Greenhouse studies also compared the efficacy of tembotrione, mesotrione, and topramezone which represent the three HPPD-inhibiting herbicides commercially available in U. S. corn production. Tembotrione and topramezone have more activity on these grasses than mesotrione. Tembotrione was also tank-mixed with either nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron to evaluate fall panicum response. Activity on fall panicum was similar weather nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron was applied alone or with tembotrione. In the field, it was also determined that nicosulfuron or foramsulfuron could be added to tembotrione to control fall panicum. The addition of atrazine to nicosulfuron and tembotrione did not negatively effect fall panicum control. It was also observed in both the field and greenhouse that utilizing methylated seed oil provided more activity than crop oil concentrate...|$|E

Weeds between the rows can be controlled with a cultivator but weeds within the row are best controlled with herbicides. Success with postemergence herbicides hinges on timing of the application. Do Not Use Pursuit on Corn We are aware that some growers are considering using Pursuit postemergence for <b>shattercane</b> control 1 n corn. Pursuit is registered for use in soybeans but is not approved for use in corn. The use of Pursuit in corn would result in illegal pesticide residues in the corn and subject the crop to condemnation. Grain not only from the treated crop but all grain stored with it would be subject to condemnation. The applicator would be subject to penalties for violating the pesticide label. Research conducted by Dr. Fred Roeth shows that treating corn with Pursuit postemergence results in a yield reduction of 30 - 50 % even if no weeds are present. We and American Cyanamid strongly discourage the use of Pursuit or any other pesticide in a manner other than specified on the label.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyJ. Anita DilleIntegrated weed {{management}} (IWM) is {{an ecological}} approach to weed control that reduces dependence on herbicides through understanding of weed biology and involves using multiple weed control measures including cultural, chemical, mechanical and biological methods. The critical period of weed control is {{the duration of}} the crop life cycle in which it must be kept weed-free to prevent yield loss from weed interference. Eight experiments were conducted throughout Kansas between October 2010 and June 2012 to identify this period in winter wheat grown under dryland and irrigated conditions. Impact of henbit and downy brome density on winter wheat yields were evaluated on four farmer’s fields with natural populations and on a research station with overseeded populations. Henbit density up to 156 plants m- 2 did not affect winter wheat yield, while downy brome at a density of 40 plants m- 2 reduced yield by 33 and 13 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In the presence of downy brome, winter wheat should be kept weed-free approximately 30 to 45 days after planting to prevent yield loss; otherwise, weeds need to be removed immediately following release from winter dormancy to prevent yield loss due to existing weed populations. Flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone are herbicides registered for use in winter wheat, soybean and corn for control of broadleaf and grass weeds. Flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone were evaluated for plant response to localized herbicide exposure to roots, shoots, or both roots and shoots utilizing a novel technique. Two weed species, ivyleaf morningglory and <b>shattercane,</b> as well as two crops, wheat and soybean, were evaluated for injury after localized exposures. The location and expression of symptoms from the flumioxazin and pyroxasulfone herbicides were determined to be the shoot of seedling plants. The utilization of preemergence herbicides in winter wheat is not a common practice, although application may protect winter wheat from early season yield losses as determined by the critical weed-free period. Kansas wheat growers should evaluate the presence and density of weed species to determine which weed management strategy is most advantageous to preserving winter wheat yield...|$|E

Crop plants seeded 1 to 2 inches deep escape appreciable injury from a rotary hoe. For best results weed seedlings {{should be in the}} 2 ̆ 2 white stage, 2 ̆ 2 from germination to emergence at the time of hoeing. Timeliness is critical for success because emerged green weeds, even though small, are generally too well anchored for control. A second hoeing 5 - 7 days after the first provides improved control. A dry firm soil surface during the hoeing operation is· required. A rain-free period of several hours after hoeing is needed to desiccate the weed seedlings. Hot windy conditions for a few hours after the operation are best. A rainy period of several days seriously reduces the effectiveness of a rotary hoe program. A rotary hoe will not satisfactorily control larger-seeded weed seedlings including <b>shattercane</b> and velvetleaf because they germinate deeper in the soil and are more firmly anchored than small-seeded weeds such as pigweed and foxtails. Operational speeds of 7 - 14 mph are used in rotary hoeing. Effectiveness is greater at the faster speeds; however, injury to delicate crops also increases with speed.
