25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson and Cox (1983) {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of a group of pedophile club members. The most marked differences between pedophiles and controls were on the introversion scale, with pedophiles showing elevated shyness, sensitivity and depression. The pedophiles <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> neuroticism and psychoticism, but not enough to be considered pathological as a group. The authors caution that [...] "there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion {{is a result of the}} isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social approbation and hostility that it evokes" [...] (p.324). In a non-clinical survey, 46% of pedophiles reported that they had seriously considered suicide for reasons related to their sexual interest, 32% planned to carry it out, and 13% had already attempted it.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} links between narcissism, unethical behavior, and undergraduate business majors. It has been theorized that altruism {{has a negative}} relationship with narcissism and research {{has suggested}} that religiosity is linked to disapproval of the unethical. Based on this information, the current study hypothesized that business majors would <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> narcissism than religion majors, measured as selfism using the Phares and Erskine Selfism Test. The current study also hypothesized that religion majors would <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> altruism than business majors, measured by Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Report Altruism Scale. Forty-one male and 27 female undergraduates majoring in either business or religion participated in the study.

40|$|In {{studies on}} gender {{differences}} {{with respect to}} Holland's (1997) vocational interests, men often <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Realistic (and sometimes also on Investigative and Enterprising) interests, and women <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Social and Artistic interests. In research and practice, vocational interests are almost exclusively assessed by means of questionnaires. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether these results are also stable across assessment methods. Thus, a questionnaire and a nonverbal interest inventory were administered to a sample of N = 448 participants. Results were in the expected direction for both inventories, men <b>scoring</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Realistic interests and women <b>scoring</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Artistic and Social interests. However, the structure of interests varied between men and women. The structural assumptions of Holland's theory fit the data for men better than the data for women. Thus, mean-level gender differences should be interpreted conservatively...|$|R
2500|$|The {{intensity}} of aphasia therapy {{is determined by}} the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding. The review found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of studies investigating sexual functioning use heterosexual participants exclusively, unfortunately limiting {{the generalizability of}} the dual control model. To date, one study comparing heterosexual and homosexual males found that homosexual men had similar scores for SIS2, but scored significantly higher for SIS1 and SES. Straight, lesbian, and bisexual women’s scores on the SESII-W found that bisexual women <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> SES than the other groups and straight women <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the sexual inhibition factor than both the lesbian and bisexual women. More studies need to be done using the dual control model to gain a more broad view of sexual orientation and sexual arousability.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the game}} of chess has often {{featured}} in psychological research, we {{know very little about}} people who play chess, especially about children who take up chess as a hobby. This study presents the personality profiles as measured with the Big Five model (BFQ-C; Barbaranelli et al., 2003) of 219 young children who play chess and 50 of their peers who do not. Children who <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Intellect/openness and Energy/extraversion are more likely to play chess while children who <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Agreeableness {{are less likely to be}} attracted to chess. Boys with <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> Agreeableness are less likely to take up chess than boys with lower scores. Considering that girls <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Agreeableness, this factor may provide one of the possible reasons why more boys are interested in chess. Although none of the Big Five factors were associated with self-reported skill level, a sub-sample of 25 elite players had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> Intellect/openness than their weaker chess playing peers...|$|R

5000|$|The {{recognition}} heuristic {{is part of}} the [...] "adaptive toolbox" [...] of [...] "fast and frugal" [...] heuristics {{proposed by}} Gigerenzer and Goldstein. It {{is one of the most}} frugal of these, meaning it is simple or economical. In their original experiment, Daniel Goldstein and Gerd Gigerenzer quizzed students in Germany and the United States on the populations of both German and American cities. Participants received pairs of city names and had to indicate which city has more inhabitants. In this and similar experiments, the recognition heuristic typically describes about 80-90% of participants' choices, in cases where they recognize one but not the other object (see criticism of this measure below). Surprisingly, American students <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> German cities, while German participants <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> American cities, despite only recognizing a fraction of the foreign cities. This has been labeled the [...] "less-is-more effect" [...] and mathematically formalized.|$|E

50|$|This {{questionnaire}} was developed {{based on the}} idea that individuals who <b>score</b> <b>high</b> <b>on</b> negative affectivity are dysphoric and have a negative view of self. They are also prone to more somatic symptoms, and focus more on negative situations and stimuli. <b>Scoring</b> <b>high</b> <b>on</b> social inhibition means that these individuals tend to avoid the potential 'dangers' involved in social interactions, such as disapproval. Generally speaking, social situations tend to make type D individuals feel inhibited, tense, uncomfortable, and insecure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, James Laird {{conducted}} two {{experiments on}} how changes in facial expression can trigger changes in emotion. Participants {{were asked to}} contract or relax various facial muscles, causing them to smile or frown without awareness {{of the nature of}} their expressions. Participants reported feeling more angry when frowning and happier when smiling. They also reported that cartoons viewed while they were smiling were more humorous than cartoons viewed while they were frowning. Furthermore, participants <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> aggression during frown trials than during smile trials, and <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> elation, surgency, and social affection factors during smile trials than during frown ones. Laird interpreted these results as [...] "indicating that an individual's expressive behavior mediates the quality of his emotional experience." [...] In other words, a person's facial expression can act as a cause of an emotional state, rather than an effect; instead of smiling because they feel happy, a person can make themselves feel happy by smiling.|$|E
