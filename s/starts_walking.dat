5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He <b>starts</b> <b>walking</b> down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
25|$|After {{working on}} his {{mechanics}} for a month, Kazmir {{was sent to the}} Salt Lake Bees, the Angels' Triple-A affiliate, for a series of rehabilitation starts as he tried to work {{his way back to the}} major leagues, possibly as a relief pitcher. However, his struggles only grew worse in the minors. Kazmir had a 17.02 ERA in 5 <b>starts,</b> <b>walking</b> 20 and striking out 14 in 15+ innings. He was released by the Angels on June 15 despite having $14.5 million remaining on his guaranteed contract.|$|E
25|$|Yvaine finds Tristan gone, and <b>starts</b> <b>walking</b> {{towards the}} wall, {{thinking}} he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so takes the caravan of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, {{to the wall}} to stop her. Lamia arrives, kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long-lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.|$|E

25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and <b>starts</b> <b>walking</b> again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{is shown}} {{getting out of}} a limousine, being carried by male dancers to a wheelchair. It is during this scene that the song starts. As the dancers gyrate around her, she <b>starts</b> <b>walking</b> down the carpet {{with the help of}} a pair of {{crutches}} while wearing a metallic bustier and a matching helmet. The metallic outfit is a reference to the film Metropolis. These scenes are interspersed with scenes of dead models lying around the mansion. Next Gaga is shown on a golden couch where she makes out with a trio of hair metal rockers during the line [...] "Loving you is cherry pie". The trio, which consist of the triplets Calle [...] "Kelii" [...] Landeberg, Nisse [...] "Izzy" [...] Landeberg, and Pelle [...] "Rock" [...] Landeberg are known as Snake of Eden and they are from the reality television dating program Daisy of Love.

500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Spears driving a Porsche 928 {{at high speed}} in the Hollywood Hills. She crashes through a fence and lands into a pool inside a manor where a party is taking place. She emerges from the water and crawls in top {{of the car to}} sing the first verse. Spears's brother Bryan makes a cameo in these scenes. After she leaves the pool, she enters the manor and passes couples making out around her. She appears in a {{stainless}} steel kitchen, where a maid cuts the straps of her black wet dress. In the next scene, she walks into a study in which her husband at the time, Kevin Federline, is smoking and watching a black-and-white video of Spears on a projection screen. According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV, the clip had the style of pornographic films from the 1940s and 1950s. Rolling Stone in their article [...] "Britney Spears: The Complete Video Guide", compared it to Madonna's performances of her 1984 single [...] "Like a Virgin". She then entered a dressing room with mirrors, wearing lingerie, high heels, stockings and a short fur jacket. She proceeds to a bedroom, in which a black dress is laid out on the comforter. She puts on the new dress and the camera cuts to the party outside where people gathered waiting. During the song's bridge, it is revealed that the party is actually Spears's wedding, as she <b>starts</b> <b>walking</b> towards the aisle and Federline waits next to a priest. The video ends with a shot of the black-and-white video and Spears looking into the camera. The black-and-white footage was released as an alternate version of the music video in the 2004 DVD [...]|$|E
