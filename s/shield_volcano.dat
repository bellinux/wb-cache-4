5|$|Magmatism in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million years ago to construct the Ilgachuz Range <b>shield</b> <b>volcano,</b> which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years ago {{led to the creation of}} the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. The Itcha Range continued to be an area of Anahim hotspot volcanism well into the Quaternary period (2.58million years ago to present).|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} <b>shield</b> <b>volcano,</b> basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a cinder cone {{in the middle of}} the shield could be much younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
50|$|All stratovolcanoes and <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> have a {{tendency}} to form a cone at the surface. However, stratovolcanoes are able to form steeper sides whilst <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> only form very flat cones. The {{reason for this is that}} stratovolcanoes are composed largely of solid, eruptive material, whereas <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are built up mainly by fluid lava flows.|$|R
50|$|Hellas Planitia is {{antipodal}} to Alba Patera. It and {{the somewhat}} smaller Isidis Planitia together are roughly antipodal to the Tharsis Bulge, with its enormous <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> while Argyre Planitia is roughly antipodal to Elysium, {{the other major}} uplifted region of <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> on Mars. Whether the <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> were caused by antipodal impacts like that which produced Hellas, {{or if it is}} mere coincidence, is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Most Ionian volcanoes {{start as}} steep-sided <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> After an eruptive construct-building phase, the central region collapses {{to form a}} caldera. Since steep-sided <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> have not been {{observed}} inside collapsed calderas, this indicates a failure to reform steep-sided volcanoes after the collapse, which {{can be associated with}} various variables such as change in temperature, eruptive rate, and/or lava composition. Failure to reform <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> is caused by failure to supply magma through the magma chamber. These interpretations might be a sign that current <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> will follow this pattern and transform to caldera-forming eruptive sites.|$|R
5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. Built {{around the same time}} as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily {{eroded the}} volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and flanks of the <b>shield</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> {{are found}} worldwide. They can form over {{hotspots}} (points where magma from {{below the surface}} wells up), such as the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain and the Galápagos Islands, or over more conventional rift zones, such as the Icelandic shields and the <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> of East Africa. Many <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are found in ocean basins, such as Tamu Massif, the world's largest, although they can be found inland as well - East Africa being one example of this.|$|R
50|$|Shield {{field are}} regions 100-200 km in {{diameter}} that contain many small, mostly <b>shield,</b> <b>volcanoes</b> (<20 km). Such fields may have tens {{to hundreds of}} <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> Rarely, individual <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> will be named colles. These fields form {{in areas where the}} magma replenishment rate is too low to produce a magma reservoir in the crust, resulting in several small eruptions on a regional scale. The dominance of shield-type volcanoes in these regions has led to the name shield fields.|$|R

5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types {{of volcanic}} events, characterized by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of that found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a <b>shield</b> <b>volcano.</b> Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of an Anahim hotspot was supported in a detailed Bulletin of Volcanology report by Kuehn et al. (2015). This included new geochemical and geochronometric data for the Baldface Mountain and Satah Mountain volcanic fields, {{as well as for}} Nazko Cone. The data obtained indicated that volcanism in the two volcanic fields were contemporaneous with the Itcha Range <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> and that both fields agree with the vector of the North American Plate motion over a hotspot in the British Columbia Interior. It was also noted that the trace and rare-earth element patterns of mafic lavas in the Anahim Volcanic Belt are similar to ocean island basalts, providing more evidence for a hotspot.|$|E

5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine <b>shield</b> <b>volcano,</b> similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found in Kenya and Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial striae on polished surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|E
50|$|The Galápagos Islands are an {{isolated}} set of <b>volcanoes,</b> consisting of <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> and lava plateaus, located 1200 km west of Ecuador. They {{are driven by}} the Galápagos hotspot, and are between 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age. The largest island, Isabela, consists of six coalesced <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> each delineated by a large summit caldera. Española, the oldest island, and Fernandina, the youngest, are also <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> as are {{most of the other}} islands in the chain. The Galápagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Galápagos Platform, which creates a shallow-water depth of 360 to 900 m {{at the base of the}} islands, which stretch over a 174 mi-long diameter. Since Charles Darwin's famous visit to the islands in 1835, over 60 recorded eruptions have occurred in the islands, from six different <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> Of the 21 emergent volcanoes, 13 are considered active.|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a <b>shield</b> <b>volcano</b> that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land {{now known as the}} Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large <b>shield</b> <b>volcano.</b> The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive <b>shield</b> <b>volcano.</b> This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the volcanoes in the Wrangell volcanic field lie at {{the western end of}} the Wrangell Mountains. The western Wrangell volcanoes are unusual for subduction-related volcanoes, in their generally non-explosive nature. The {{majority of}} the volcanoes are unusually large <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> that built to their present size quickly from voluminous flows of andesite lavas which erupted from multiple centers. Their growth is associated {{with the arrival of the}} Yakutat terrane, with considerable activity until about 200,000 years ago, when movement along the Denali-Totchunda and Fairweather faults began to accommodate some of the Pacific Plate's motion. For that reason, very large magmatic flows are regarded as unlikely in the present day. The {{majority of the}} Wrangell <b>volcanoes</b> are <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> with large collapse calderas at their summits. All but Mount Wrangell have been modified by glaciers to sharper, steeper relief than the gentle, rounded forms that characterize young <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> The <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are surrounded by cinder cones that formed after the main volcano.|$|R
40|$|Plains {{volcanism}} in Tharsis {{region on}} Mars: Ages and Rheology of Eruption Products Remote sensing data show clusters of low <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in Tharsis volcanic province on Mars (Hauber et al., 2009).

We used crater size-frequency distribution method (CSFD) developed by Hartman and Neukum (2001) and Ivanov (2001) for determination of absolute dating of the surface.

5000|$|<b>Shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are {{distinguished}} from the three other major volcanic archetypes - stratovolcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones - by their structural form, a consequence of their unique magmatic composition. Of these four forms <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> erupt the least viscous lavas: where stratovolcanoes and especially lava domes {{are the product of}} highly immotile flows and cinder cones are constructed by explosively eruptive tephra, <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are the product of gentle effusive eruptions of highly fluid lavas that produce, over time, a broad, gently sloped eponymous [...] "shield". Although the term is generally ascribed to basaltic shields it has also at times been appended to rarer [...] volcanoes of differing magmatic composition - principally pyroclastic shields, formed by the accumulation of fragmental material from particularly powerful explosive eruptions, and rarer felsic lava shields formed by unusually fluid felsic magmas. Examples of pyroclastic shields include Billy Mitchell volcano in Papua New Guinea and the Purico Complex in Chile; an example of a felsic shield is the Big Obsidian Flow in Oregon. <b>Shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are also related in origination to vast lava plateaus and flood basalts present {{in various parts of the}} world, generalized eruptive features which occur along linear fissure vents and are {{distinguished from}} <b>shield</b> <b>volcanoes</b> proper by the lack of an identifiable primary eruptive center.|$|R
