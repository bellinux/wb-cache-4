This study is aimed at {{designing}} and developing a new method for obtaining, displaying and sending the meter readings over 300 m distance. The proposed design is composed of three modules: Analog Meter, transmitter and receiver modules. The BASIC Stamp 2 (BS 2) microcontroller is used to display the received <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> data on the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen and initiate a connection to send the obtained <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> data as Radio Frequency (RF) signal to the receiver module.

5000|$|The primary {{driver for}} the {{automation}} <b>of</b> <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> {{is not to}} reduce labor costs, but to obtain data {{that is difficult to}} obtain. As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of walk-by and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings <b>of</b> the <b>meters.</b> Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US Energy Policy Act of 2005 asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a [...] "...time-based rate schedule (to) enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology." [...] The trend now is to consider the use <b>of</b> advanced <b>meters</b> as part <b>of</b> an Advanced <b>Metering</b> Infrastructure.|$|R
