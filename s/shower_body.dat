40|$|Purpose: Assessment of post-exercise {{changes in}} {{hydration}} with bioimpedance (BI) {{is complicated by}} physiological adaptations that affect resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) values. This study investigated exercise-induced changes in R and Xc, independently and in bioelectrical impedance vector analysis, when factors such as increased skin temperature and blood flow and surface electrolyte accumulation are eliminated with a cold shower. Methods: Healthy males (n = 14, 24. 161. 7 yr; height (H) : 182. 465. 6 cm, body mass: 72. 366. 3 kg) exercised for 1 hr at a self-rated intensity (15 BORG) in an environmental chamber (33 uC and 50 % relative humidity), then had a cold shower (15 min). Before the run BI, body mass, hematocrit and Posm were measured. After the <b>shower</b> <b>body</b> mass was measured; BI measurements were performed continuously every 20 minutes until R reached a stable level, then hematocrit and Posm were measured again. Results: Compared to pre-trial measurements body mass decreased after the run and Posm, Hct, R/H and Xc/H increased (p, 0. 05) with a corresponding lengthening of the impedance vector along the major axis of the tolerance ellipse (p, 0. 001). Changes in Posm were negatively related to changes in body mass (r = 20. 564, p = 0. 036) and changes in Xc/H (r = 20. 577, p = 0. 041).

This study investigated exercise-induced changes in R and Xc, independently and in bioelectrical impedance vector analysis, when factors such as increased skin temperature and blood flow and surface electrolyte accumulation are eliminated with a cold shower. Healthy males (n =  14, 24. 1 ± 1. 7 yr; height (H) : 182. 4 ± 5. 6 cm, body mass: 72. 3 ± 6. 3 kg) exercised for 1 hr at a self-rated intensity (15 BORG) in an environmental chamber (33 °C and 50 % relative humidity), then had a cold shower (15 min).

Present findings showed that after a bout of exercise-induced dehydration followed by cold shower the impedance vector lengthened that indicates fluid loss. Additionally, BI values might be useful to evaluate fluid shifts between compartments as lower intracellular fluid loss (changed Xc/R) indicated greater Posm increase...|$|E

40|$|A {{microgravity}} whole <b>body</b> <b>shower</b> (WBS) {{and waste}} water recovery systems (WWRS) were evaluated in three separate closed loop tests. Following a protocol {{similar to that}} anticipated for the U. S. Space Station, test subjects showered in a prototype whole <b>body</b> <b>shower.</b> The WWRS processes evaluated during the test series were phase change and reverse osmosis (RO). A preprototype Thermoelectric Integrated Hollow Fiber Membrane Evaporation Subsystem phase change process {{was used for the}} initial test with chemical pretreatment of the shower water waste input. The second and third tests concentrated on RO technologies. The second test evaluated a dynamic RO membrane consisting of zirconium oxide polyacrylic acid (ZOPA) membranes deposited on the interior diameter of 316 L porous stainless steel tubes while the final test employed a thin semipermeable RO membrane deposited on the interior surface of polysulfone hollow fibers. All reclaimed water was post-treated for purity using ion exchange and granular activated carbon beds immediately followed by microbial control treatment using both heat and iodine. The test hardware, controls exercised for whole <b>body</b> <b>showering,</b> types of soaps evaluated, shower subject response to reclaimed water showering, and shower water collection and chemical pretreatment (if required) for microbial control are described.
