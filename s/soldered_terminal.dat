The test method design for monitoring the electrical conductivity of the soldered joint {{is described in}} the practical part. Simulated BGA package with four pin (BGA 4) is used for experiments. Tested PCBs are subjected to isothermal aging and current load. During isothermal aging is measured electrical conductivity and optical microscope is used for intermetallic layer (IMC) growth observation. Two types of surface finish (OSP and ENIG) are used for tests and three diameters of <b>solder</b> <b>terminal</b> balls (<b>solder</b> alloy SAC 405).

40|$|AbstractCopper alloys {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} circuits mainly due to their electrical conductivity. In electrical circuits, <b>solder</b> <b>terminals</b> are used to provide multiple electrical connections and swage type turret terminals are preferred owing to their high reliability under dynamic environments where the electrical systems are subjected to higher vibrations and line currents, {{as in the case}} of satellite launch vehicles. Owing to high machinability, free-cutting brass is preferred in the manufacture of such small sized terminals, which will be cold worked/swaged to the printed circuit boards. Improper selection of the composition of free-cutting brass can lead to cracking of the terminals, thereby affecting the reliability of the system. This paper describes cracking of turret terminals made of free cutting brass during swaging operation. The crack propagation tendency during cold working of brass turret terminals made from different compositions is studied through optical and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, composition for obtaining crack free terminals during swaging is suggested for applications involving cold swaging...|$|R
40|$|The underfilling of CSP and BGA {{components}} with area I array {{lead free}} and lead containing <b>solder</b> <b>terminals</b> in {{surface mount technology}} has been systematically studied and evaluated. One {{of the goals of}} the research was to define the particular requirements that have to be put on CSP/BGA underfill materials and to estimate what level of process reliability for underfilling can be achieved. The knowledge and experience with flip chip underfilling could not be directly transferred to CSP and BGA assemblies due to the differences in material combinations and geometry of the joint gap as well as the differences in the nature and magnitude of the stress. Ageing and stress tests on test assemblies with commercially available and alternative underfill materials highlighted the specific advantages of underfilling CSPs and BGAs. The experimental findings and the simulations results allowed the required property profiles of CSP/BGA underfillers to be defined. From the effects of underfill defects, statements about process reliability could be made...|$|R
50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A cross connect field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another cross connect or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for idle trunks to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the cross connect fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation cross connect fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from <b>soldered</b> <b>terminals</b> to wire wrap.|$|R

Each building block was magnetically attached to a metal plate serving both as a work surface and ground, {{eliminating the need for}} <b>soldering,</b> spring <b>terminals</b> or a breadboard. This gave the benefit of safety as well as the ability to rearrange the blocks to determine the effect on the circuit.|$|R

The easy cuspid appliance was suggested as modification of the Jones Jig appliance, originally developed for molar distalization, and combined with the original idea of Jacoby’s ballista spring [4]. The major difference is a <b>soldered</b> double <b>terminal</b> with a larger end for insertion into the molar band’s headgear tube and a smaller end for the auxiliary tube. A triple-tube molar band is used so that a stabilizing wire can be inserted into the main archwire tube, providing solid anchorage for the traction system [21].|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} to guarantee the quality of the industrial products by means of visual inspection. In order to reduce the <b>soldering</b> defect with <b>terminal</b> deformation and terminal burr in the manufacturing process, this paper proposes a 3 D visual inspection system based on a stereo vision with single camera. It is technically noted that the base line of this single camera stereo was precisely calibrated by the image processing procedure. Also to extract the measuring point coordinates for computing disparity; the error is reduced with original algorithm. Comparing its performance with that of human inspection using industrial microscope, the proposed 3 D inspection could be an alternative in precision and in processing cost. Since the practical specification in 3 D precision is less than 0. 02 mm and the experimental performance was around the same, it was demonstrated by the proposed system that the <b>soldering</b> defect with <b>terminal</b> deformation and terminal burr in inspection, especially in 3 D inspection, was decreased. In order to realize the inline inspection, this paper will suggest how the human inspection of the products could be modeled and be implemented by the computer system especially in manufacturing process. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} a step-stress random {{vibration}} tests are {{used to assess the}} interconnect reliability of various <b>solder,</b> component <b>terminal</b> and printed wiring board pad finishes. The durability assessment of leadless chip resistors attached with tin-lead and tin-silver-copper is examined. Component terminal finish, tin and tin-lead, in tin-lead soldered assemblies are examined. The board pad finishes used in the assemblies tested included immersion tin, immersion silver, electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold, and organic solderability preservative, while tin-lead hot air solder leveling pad finish assembled with tin-lead solder served as a baseline. Destructive failure analysis is used to assess failure locations. Although the results obtained from the test indicate that under the vibration regimen studied no significant difference was found between the durability of tin-lead and tin-silver-copper assemblies, the lead-free components did outperform the tin-lead assemblies. Pad finish is found to have a greater influence on tin-lead as compared to tin-silver-copper soldered assemblies. Immersion silver and electroless or electrolytic nickel immersed in gold showed the best durability results...|$|R
40|$|Many {{of us have}} {{constructed}} the front panel and chassis for crystal radio sets using 1 / 8 th-inch hardboard, purchased at Lowes, Ace, or Home Depot. This board is inexpensive, easy to saw, drill, and punch, and the resulting sets have worked satisfactorily. At the same time, many are aware, starting with the DX contesters, that using low-loss sheet plastic can boost performance when working with high impedance sets. The resistive losses in hardboard are hinted at in the experiments outlined below. Two measurements schemes were taken, using an 8 ” by 7 ” by 1 / 8 th inch piece of hardboard, shown in Figure 1. The <b>solder</b> lug <b>terminals</b> were – arbitrarily- spaced 3 inches apart. While the first scheme used {{was found to be}} incorrect, I’ll described it anyway, {{as an example of how}} one can go astray when “assuming ” a circuit model and ignoring part of the data obtained. Figure 2 denotes this first test circuit, consisting of a B&K signal generator, a 1 Meg ohm resistor, the resistance of the hardboard between terminals, and a two-channel scope (not shown). Assuming the circuit model was correct, the generator output was attached to channel 1 of the scope and the output of the voltage divider – between R 1 and the hardboard resistor – was attached to channel 2. Knowing the generator voltage, V 1, Vout, and R 1, R of the hardboard connections could be calculated: 1...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{lead free}} {{connector}} products involves {{at least two}} distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the <b>solder.</b> Connector <b>terminals,</b> made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the solder pot into the plastic. FEM results are compared to experimental results from lab and production manufactured testing of solderable interconnects. A test method for evaluating plastic performance in wave solder applications is proposed...|$|R

Several of the effects, as, for instances, {{those with}} helices(1066.), with {{according}} or counter currents (1097. 1098.), {{and those on}} the production of lateral currents (1090.), appeared to indicate that a current could produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily than in its own carrying wire, in which case it might be expected that some variation of result would be produced if a bundle of wires were used as a conductor instead of a single wire. In consequence the following experiments were made. A copper wire one twenty-third of an inch in diameter was cut into lengths of five feet each, and six of these being laid {{side by side in}} one bundle, had their opposite extremities <b>soldered</b> to two <b>terminal</b> pieces of copper. This arrangement {{could be used as a}} discharging wire, but the general current could be divided into six parallel streams, which might be brought close together, or, by the separation of the wires, be taken more or less out of each other's influence. A somewhat brighter spark was, I think, obtained on breaking contact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder.|$|R
40|$|Solder dip {{may be used}} as a {{peripheral}} leaded terminal refinishing process to replace the original pure tin finish with eutectic tin-lead finish to mitigate tin-whisker risk. Tin-silver-copper is an option of lead-free <b>terminal</b> finish. <b>Solder</b> dip is the way to obtain tin-silver-copper finish. However, the reliability of solder joints formed with these refinished terminals may be affected by the refinishing process. The solder joint reliability of refinished components under temperature cycling conditions need to be determined to study the effects of refinishing on the solder joint reliability. Tin-bismuth terminal finish is another tin-whisker mitigation strategy. The reliability of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions formed with tin-bismuth finished terminals also needs to be determined before the implementation. The microstructure and strength of solder joints formed with refinished terminals were evaluated by comparing with those of solder joints formed with original pure tin finished terminals. The reliability of solder joints formed with original pure tin finished terminals, refinished terminals and original tin-bismuth finished terminals were tested under temperature cycling. Under temperature cycling test, solder joints formed with Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu <b>solder</b> dipped <b>terminals</b> have shorter characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those formed with the original pure tin finished terminals in both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. Solder joints formed with eutectic SnPb dipped terminals have equal characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages, but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those formed with the original pure tin finished terminals when reflowed with eutectic SnPb solder. Solder joints formed with tin-bismuth finished terminals have shorter characteristic life than original pure tin finished terminals for thin-small-outline-packages for both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. If a 20 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions is acceptable, then the SAC solder dip process can be a potential choice for refinishing purpose. SnPb solder dip process is a good choice of refinish process without causing degradation to characteristic life under temperature cycling conditions. If a 25 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions can be accepted, then SnBi finish can be an alternative finish to tin finish...|$|R
40|$|High {{volumetric}} efficiency of commercial base metal electrode (BME) ceramic capacitors {{allows for a}} substantial reduction of weight and sizes of the parts compared to currently used military grade precious metal electrode (PME) capacitors. Insertion of BME capacitors in space applications requires a thorough analysis of their performance and reliability. In this work, six types of cases size 0603 BME capacitors from three vendors have been evaluated. Three types of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) were designed for automotive industry and three types for general purposes. Leakage currents in the capacitors have been measured {{in a wide range}} of voltages and temperatures, and measurements of breakdown voltages (VBR) have been used to assess the proportion and severity of defects in the parts. The effect of soldering-related thermal shock stresses was evaluated by analysis of distributions of VBR for parts in 'as is' condition and after <b>terminal</b> <b>solder</b> dip testing at 350 C. Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) at different temperatures was used to assess the activation energy of degradation of leakage currents and predict behavior of the parts at life test and normal operating conditions. To address issues related to rework and manual soldering, capacitors were soldered onto different substrates at different soldering conditions. The results show that contrary to a common assumption that large-size capacitors are mostly vulnerable to soldering stresses, cracking in small size capacitors does happen unless special measures are taken during assembly processes...|$|R
