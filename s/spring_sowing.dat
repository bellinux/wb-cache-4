This paper reports how non-inversion (reduced) tillage impacts energy consumption and crop yield, utilising 8 years of replicated field trials undertaken by The New Farming Systems study in the East of England. Tillage regimes include: (1) plough, (2) shallow non-inversion (typically 10 cm), and (3) deep non-inversion (20 - 25 cm) within two rotations of either (1) winter <b>sown</b> / <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> crops or (2) winter <b>sown</b> / <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> + autumn cover crop. Energy use per ha (highest to lowest) was: plough > deep non-inversion > shallow non-inversion. Crop specific and temporal yield responses were observed. Winter sown crops responded favourably to deep non-inversion tillage, and yields improved as the trial progressed. When considered in combination with lower energy input per hectare, energy efficiency increased relative to the plough-only control. Yield response to shallow non-inversion tillage was variable. <b>Spring</b> <b>sown</b> crops, notably <b>spring</b> beans, declined in yield and overall energy efficiency, in the non-inversion tillage treatments...|$|R

40|$|Heat stress during {{reproductive}} {{and grain}} filling phases adversely affects {{the growth of}} cereals through reduction in grain’s number and size. However, exogenous application of antioxidants, plant growth regulators and osmoprotectants {{may be helpful to}} minimize these heat induced yield losses in cereals. This two year study was conducted to evaluate the role of exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA), salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) applied through seed priming or foliar spray on biochemical, physiological, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and quality of late <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> hybrid maize. The experiment was conducted in the spring season of 2007 and 2008. We observed that application of AsA, SA and H 2 O 2 applied through seed priming or foliar spray improved the physiological, biochemical, morphological and yield related traits, grain yield and grain quality of late <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> maize in both years. In both years, we observed higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activity in the plants where AsA, SA and H 2 O 2 were applied through seed priming or foliar spray than control. Membrane stability index (MSI), relative water contents (RWC), chlorophyll contents, grain yield and grain oil contents were also improved by exogenous application of AsA, SA and H 2 O 2 in both years. Seed priming of AsA, SA and H 2 O 2 was equally effective as the foliar application. In conclusion, seed priming with AsA, SA and H 2 O 2 may be opted to lessen the heat induced yield losses in late <b>sown</b> <b>spring</b> hybrid maize. Heat tolerance induced by ASA, SA and H 2 O 2 may be attributed to increase in antioxidant activities and MSI which maintained RWC and chlorophyll contents in maize resulting in better grain yield in heat stress conditions...|$|R

40|$|Two {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} at Crop Research Division, D. S. I. R., Lincoln, in the 1971 / 72 and 1972 / 73 seasons to examine ways {{of reducing the}} cost of establishing lucerne and reducing the loss of production in the first year. Trial I examined {{the effect of a}} <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> barley (cv Zephyr) cover crop at three seeding rates, 0, 56 and 112 kg/ha, on lucerne sown at the same time at three seeding rates, 2. 9, 3. 8 and 5. 8 kg/ha with and without irrigation. The 1971 / 72 season was drier than normal but lucerne establishment was unaltered by a cover crop regardless of seeding rate or irrigation treatment. The overall establishment was high with 73 % of viable seeds being present as plants after the first winter at a seeding rate of 2. 9 kg/ha. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was reduced by barley sown at 56 kg/ha to 21 % and 49 % non-irrigated and irrigated respectively and remained depressed for two further cuts non-irrigated but yield was restored by the following cut irrigated. Irrigation increased the first season lucerne yield by 100 % clear seeded and 194 % with 56 kg/ha of barley and lucerne seeding rate had no effect on lucerne yield. Undersown lucerne at all seeding rates reduced barley grain yield by 20 % at the low barley seeding rate but lucerne at the high seeding rate only reduced grain yield at the high barley seeding rate. Trial II examined the effect of a winter sown wheat (cv Arawa) and a <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> barley (cv Research) on the establishment and early yield of lucerne <b>sown</b> in the <b>spring</b> at three seeding rates (2. 25, 9. 0, 35. 0 kg/ha). The influence of cover crop competition was further examined by sowing the cover crops at three seeding rates (56, 112 and 224 kg/ha), and by simulated grazing of the wheat and the use of a herbicide on the barley and clear seeded lucerne. The 1972 / 73 season was drier than normal and although percentage lucerne establishment decreased as the lucerne seeding rate increased, no cover crop treatments effected lucerne establishment. Overall establishment was low with 36. 5 % of viable seed being present as plants after harvest at the 2. 25 kg/ha seeding rate. Lucerne production at the harvest cut was low and was reduced markedly by cover crop treatments and height, root weight and root weight distribution data suggested that wheat had a greater effect than barley. No further cuts w. ere taken in the establishment season but cover crops continued to reduce lucerne yields in four cuts, in the following season. The use of <b>spring</b> <b>sown</b> cereal cover crops for lucerne establishment can be justified on the basis of providing a more profitable return, provided the establishment year production of clear seeded lucerne is low but cannot be justified on the basis of weed suppression. Lucerne seeding rates of 2. 25 and 2. 9 kg/ha produced stands with at least 30 plants/m² which was a density sufficient for maximum production...|$|R
