25|$|A preform is a pre-made {{shape of}} solder {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture the solder preform, stamping being the most common. The solder preform may include the <b>solder</b> <b>flux</b> needed for the soldering process.

50|$|Certain {{manufacturing}} standards, such {{as those}} written by the IPC - Association Connecting Electronics Industries require cleaning regardless of the <b>solder</b> <b>flux</b> type used to ensure a thoroughly clean board. Even no-clean flux leaves a residue which, under IPC standards, must be removed. Proper cleaning removes all traces of <b>solder</b> <b>flux,</b> as well as dirt and other contaminants that may be invisible to the naked eye. However, while shops conforming to IPC standard are expected {{to adhere to the}} Association's rules on board condition, not all manufacturing facilities apply IPC standard, nor are they required to do so. Additionally, in some applications, such as low-end electronics, such stringent manufacturing methods are excessive both in expense and time required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the specific agent responsible for eczema on the forearms of 2 electronic assemblers who cleaned out a flux-spraying unit once a week. <b>Soldering</b> <b>flux</b> can be a source of skin irritation as well as allergy. Patch test with dried flux residue (as is) and rosin in dilution series of 20 %, 10 %, and 1 % in olive oil was performed. Readings were taken on day 2 and day 3. The rosin in dilution series was negative; however, the flux residue gave a + reaction on day 2, and by day 3 the reaction had weakened (+?). Similar results were obtained in 2 unexposed controls. Patch tests results in our cases indicate that the flux used in the soldering process caused irritant contact dermatitis.

50|$|A wetted small sponge, often {{supplied}} with soldering equipment, {{can be used}} to wipe the tip. For lead-free solder a slightly more aggressive cleaning, with brass shavings, can be used. <b>Soldering</b> <b>flux</b> will help to remove oxide; the more active the flux the better the cleaning, although acidic flux used on circuit boards and not carefully cleaned off will cause corrosion.

50|$|Potentiometers and {{trimmers}} are three-terminal electromechanical parts, {{containing a}} resistive path with an adjustable wiper contact. Along with the failure modes for normal resistors, mechanical wear on the wiper and the resistive layer, corrosion, surface contamination, and mechanical deformations {{may lead to}} intermittent path-wiper resistance changes, which are a problem with audio amplifiers. Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the <b>solder</b> <b>flux.</b> Mechanical deformations (like an impaired wiper-path contact) can occur by housing warpage during soldering or mechanical stress during mounting. Excess stress on leads can cause substrate cracking and open failure when the crack penetrates the resistive path.|$|E
50|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) are {{vulnerable}} to environmental influences; for example, the traces are corrosion-prone and may be improperly etched leaving partial shorts, while the vias may be insufficiently plated through or filled with solder. The traces may crack under mechanical loads, often resulting in unreliable PCB operation. Residues of <b>solder</b> <b>flux</b> may facilitate corrosion; those of other materials on PCBs can cause electrical leaks. Polar covalent compounds can attract moisture like antistatic agents, forming {{a thin layer of}} conductive moisture between the traces; ionic compounds like chlorides tend to facilitate corrosion. Alkali metal ions may migrate through plastic packaging and influence the functioning of semiconductors. Chlorinated hydrocarbon residues may hydrolyze and release corrosive chlorides; these are problems that occur after years. Polar molecules may dissipate high-frequency energy, causing parasitic dielectric losses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design for}} the {{computer}} was essentially complete by April 1981, when the manufacturing team took over the project. IBM could not only use its own hardware and make a profit with [...] "Acorn". To save time and money, the IBU built the machine with commercial off-the-shelf parts from original equipment manufacturers whenever possible, with assembly occurring in Boca Raton. The IBU would decide {{whether it would be}} more economical to [...] "Make or Buy" [...] each manufacturing step. Various IBM divisions for the first time competed with outsiders to build parts of the new computer; a North Carolina IBM factory built the keyboard, the Endicott, New York factory had to lower its bid for printed circuit boards, and a Taiwanese company built the monitor. The IBU chose an existing monitor from IBM Japan and an Epson printer. Because of the off-the-shelf parts only the system unit and keyboard has unique IBM industrial design elements. Furthermore, the IBM copyright appears in only the ROM BIOS and on the company logo, and the company reportedly received no patents on the PC, with outsiders manufacturing 90% of it. Because the product would carry the IBM logo, the only corporate division the IBU could not bypass was the Quality Assurance Unit. A component manufacturer described the process of being selected as a supplier as rigorous and [...] "absolutely amazing", with IBM inspectors even testing <b>solder</b> <b>flux.</b> They stayed after selection, monitoring and helping to improve the manufacturing process.
