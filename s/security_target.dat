50|$|Unlike earlier criteria, {{notably the}} TCSEC {{developed}} by the US defense establishment, the ITSEC did not require evaluated targets to contain specific technical features {{in order to achieve}} a particular assurance level. For example, an ITSEC target might provide authentication or integrity features without providing confidentiality or availability. A given target's security features were documented in a <b>Security</b> <b>Target</b> document, whose contents had to be evaluated and approved before the target itself was evaluated. Each ITSEC evaluation was based exclusively on verifying the security features identified in the <b>Security</b> <b>Target.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} get a product {{evaluated}} and certified according to the CC, the product vendor has to define a <b>Security</b> <b>Target</b> (ST) which may comply with one or more PPs. In this way a PP may serve as a template for the product's ST.|$|E
5000|$|Although every {{product and}} system must fulfill the same {{assurance}} requirements {{to achieve a}} particular level, {{they do not have}} to fulfill the same functional requirements. The functional features for each certified product are established in the <b>Security</b> <b>Target</b> document tailored for that product's evaluation. Therefore, a product with a higher EAL is not necessarily [...] "more secure" [...] in a particular application than one with a lower EAL, since they may have very different lists of functional features in their Security Targets. A product's fitness for a particular security application depends on how well the features listed in the product's <b>Security</b> <b>Target</b> fulfill the application's security requirements. If the Security Targets for two products both contain the necessary security features, then the higher EAL should indicate the more trustworthy product for that application.|$|E

The TOE is evaluated against the SFRs (Security Functional Requirements. Again, see below) established in its ST, no more and no less. This allows vendors to tailor the evaluation to accurately match the intended capabilities of their product. This means that a network firewall does not have to meet the same functional requirements as a database management system, and that different firewalls may in fact be evaluated against completely different lists of requirements. The ST is usually published so that potential customers may determine the specific security features that have been certified by the evaluation.|$|E

In such a case, a PP may serve as a template for the product's ST (<b>Security</b> <b>Target,</b> as defined below), or the authors of the ST will at least ensure that all requirements in relevant PPs also appear in the target's ST document. Customers looking for particular types of products can focus on those certified against the PP that meets their requirements.|$|E
