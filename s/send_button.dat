Jonathan Agnew described how on one occasion he arrived at Lord's for a match which unfortunately was due to be played {{on the other side}} of London at the Oval. He also struggled with modern technology, once mistaking the television remote control in his hotel room for his mobile phone. When attempting to email a report to his newspaper, he would occasionally press the Delete button rather than the <b>Send</b> <b>button,</b> causing him much consternation.|$|E
50|$|Since version 38, Thunderbird has {{integrated}} {{support for}} automatic linking of large files instead of attaching them {{directly to the}} mail message. As the user presses the <b>send</b> <b>button,</b> if a large file is attached, Thunderbird proposes automatically uploading the file to a third-party provider and sending the link to the file instead.|$|E
5000|$|On April Fool's Day 2016, Google {{created a}} button on its Gmail service that sent a [...] "mic drop" [...] along with a GIF of a Minion. However, the feature {{immediately}} received a backlash. Many people complained about accidentally sending the GIF during job searches, which resulted in some people being dropped from job consideration or even being fired. Google removed the feature not long after, citing those reasons and a bug that caused the GIF to be sent after hitting the regular <b>send</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Nokia 7230 is a slim slider with a glossy, curvaceous design. The {{sides have}} a chrome-like {{finish with a}} {{dedicated}} button for the camera and a matte textured plastic battery cover on the back. While the phone looks deceptively solid, once you take it in hand, its flimsy low-end nature becomes evident. The screen {{is surrounded by a}} finely textured panel that covers two soft keys, a <b>send</b> <b>button</b> and an end button with a five way d-pad within. This panel comes in pink or graphite, as does the battery cover.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{features}} were removed in version 9.0 however, {{such as the}} ability to use add-ins, the ability to transfer files when the recipient is signed in as offline, the [...] "Be right back," [...] "Out to lunch," [...] and [...] "In a call" [...] status options, the Go to my space button, the ability to adjust webcam settings during a video call, the <b>Send</b> <b>button,</b> some games (depending on your localization) and integration with Windows Contacts. Other {{features were}} replaced, such as Sharing Folders (replaced by integration with Windows Live SkyDrive) and background sharing (replaced by the [...] "Scene" [...] feature).|$|E

5000|$|The worm arrives as an {{attachment}} with various names in emails {{claiming to be}} a security update from either Microsoft or Symantec, depending on the variant. When run, the worm installs itself to the system and displays a fake Windows Error Reporting dialog box, which the user cannot move or close and contains two <b>buttons</b> <b>Send</b> Error and Send and Close, if the user clicks on the <b>Send</b> Error <b>button,</b> the worm mass-mails itself to all the user's contacts and displays fictitious [...] "technical details" [...] about the supposed error report, which contains a Back button and a Close button. Clicking the Back button {{will return to the}} original error reporting box, whereas the Close button does not do anything. When the user presses Send and Close, the worm will disable or terminate Windows Explorer, eject the CD/DVD drive, open many Control Panel options, and then display a dialogue box that cannot be closed, which contains two buttons, [...] "Retry" [...] and [...] "Cancel".|$|R
50|$|They {{discover}} {{an historic}} feast of finds, {{ranging from a}} Tudor bodkin, chainmail, a gunpowder keg to early police <b>buttons,</b> <b>sending</b> the boys on an explosive journey {{into the world of}} law enforcement. Their quest sees them fire both old and new police weapons at the National Shooting Range at Bisley and experience possibly their most extreme challenge yet, as they take on petrol bombs and bricks with the riot police.|$|R
40|$|A PCM {{telemetry}} command {{system is}} presented having {{a capacity of}} 256 unique commands, an end-to-end actuation time of less than 250 milliseconds, and an address plus complementary command code to provide security against the acceptance of anything but intended commands. The system consists of a ground-based encoder and a balloon-borne decoder, both built using low-current drain, high reliability CMOS logic elements. Commands are normally issued by a simple switch closure to + 5 VDC on the appropriate input line, however as a backup mode, the 8 -bit command may be entered manually on 8 toggle switches and executed via a <b>SEND</b> <b>button.</b> In any case, the command is then serialized into a PCM bit stream and sent via a P-Band radio link to the DECODER aloft. All 256 outputs from the DECODER are buffered through drivers and thus {{may be used to}} drive CMOS, TTL, or DTL logic...|$|E
40|$|Click. In the {{fraction}} of a second it takes for the human brain to transmit the command to the index finger, a single transmission of text can be distributed to potentially thousands, even millions of people. The click is always the same: the ominous, irreversible <b>send</b> <b>button</b> relays a series of words, audio files, or images across cyberspace and into the life of a new receiver, who may then choose to pass the message on to others or tempt fate by disregarding the warnings bestowed upon the reader. I am referring, of course, to the phenomenon known as chain letters. For {{the purpose of this article}} I define chain letters as any form of communication that demands recirculation of its contents and threatens the possibility of missed opportunities, injury, or ill-fate for loved ones or the receiver if they refuse to comply. 1 Hoaxbusters, a hoax database maintained by a division of the United States Department of Energy, notes that the three key ingredients of a chain letter are “the hook, the threat, and the request” (Hoaxbusters 2006, 4). Usually these letters have a long, emotional story that ultimately ends with the instruction to resend the message to a certain number of people within a set time frame or face the consequences of a potential disaster or forfeiture of promised goods. 2 One such chain letter that has been widely circulated on the Internet tells of a devious criminal (usually male) that dupes women into sniffing his “perfume, ” which really turns out to be ether: “I was approached yesterday afternoon … in the Wal-Mart parking lot, by two males, asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. Then they asked if I'd like to sample some fabulous scent they were willing to sell me … I probably would have agreed had I not received an email some weeks ago, warning of a ‘wanna smell this neat perfume? ’ scam… Here, the chain letter begins with the emotional story, or “hook. ” The sender personalizes the content by placing herself as the protagonist, hence inserting a personal twist to legitimize the remainder of the e-mail’s contents. Secondly, the sender uses a ubiquitous location, in this case Wal-Mart, to both further hook the audience and also cast suspicion a...|$|E
500|$|The {{context-sensitive}} attacks received {{praise and}} criticism. Antista said, [...] " [...] fans will {{be thankful for}} is the triumphant return of the contextual attacks", but added that the control limitations were the [...] "only real problem", as {{the sensitivity of the}} cursor button can result in a failed combo, [...] "And the jump <b>button</b> <b>sends</b> you forward in the direction you're facing automatically." [...] Buchanan noted that the contextual attacks [...] "can prove frustratingly tricky as you have a brief amount of time to input the commands, but the controls on most handsets are quite small".|$|R
50|$|The Amazon Dash Button {{is a small}} {{electronic}} device designed to make ordering products easy and fast. The Dash buttons come in packs; each device contains an embedded button emblazoned {{with the name of}} a frequently ordered product. Users can configure each button to order a specific product and quantity, via the user's Amazon.com account, and mount the buttons, using adhesive tape or a plastic clip, to locations where they use the products. Pressing the <b>button</b> <b>sends</b> a Wi-Fi signal to the Amazon Shopping app, and orders new stock of whatever product the button is configured to order; the click also sends a message to the user's mobile phone, giving the user a half-hour to cancel.|$|R
50|$|While Pete Sampras Tennis uses {{all three}} control pad buttons, the game play remains simple yet realistic, for its time. While serving, the A <b>button</b> <b>sends</b> the ball automatically, and B allows the player {{to control the}} ball speed and direction, {{and is the only}} way to score aces against the best players. During play, A lobs, B sends a normal shot and C, if pressed alone {{performs}} a top spin shot, if in conjunction with left or right on the D-Pad the player dives in that direction. It is also possible to aim the ball by pressing any direction on the D-Pad before there is contact between the racket and the ball.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{systems may}} {{communicate}} text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for {{a call and}} any related details. The tow truck driver may press an acknowledge <b>button,</b> <b>sending</b> data {{in the opposite direction}} and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send radio paging messages which can either 1) beep a paging receiver, 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.|$|R
50|$|Lum {{has caught}} {{a very bad}} cold, and the hotel staff send for a doctor, who arrives to their room a while later. The doctor determines Abner to be {{perfectly}} healthy, but also that Lum is dying. Lum decides {{to take the job}} as a rocket passenger instead of Abner. Before the two men make it to the launch pad, Gimpel answers the phone in their room and receives news that Stark has sold their land for $20,000. Stark starts for the launch pad while Lum seats himself in the rocket. When Abner hears the good news he has to sit down, and does so on the launch <b>button,</b> <b>sending</b> Lum off into space. Fortunately, the rocket malfunctions and crashes back down to Earth, landing in Mars, Iowa.|$|R
5000|$|The piano's next {{destination}} is Casbahmopolis (based on The Middle East), where Pontoffel {{falls in love}} with a girl named Neefa Feefa, a famous [...] "eyeball dancer" [...] who dislikes her job of dancing for the King and, like Pontoffel, wants to [...] "get away from it all". He infiltrates the King's palace to rescue her and is pursued and surrounded by the palace guards, one of whom breaks the Homing Pigeon Switch such that Pontoffel cannot take Neefa Feefa home with him. When he decides to travel somewhere else, he loses control of the piano and Neefa Feefa slips off into the guards' clutches. Having lost his sense of direction, Pontoffel starts pushing random <b>buttons,</b> <b>sending</b> him to several different places (which are based on many real places such as the North Pole, the Congo region, Spain, Africa, China, and others) in the hope of returning to her.|$|R
5000|$|Though nationally distributed, the {{presentation}} was localized by the network's talent pushing a <b>button</b> <b>sending</b> a subaudible tone over the network that would trigger a tape machine at the receiving station. For example, a button would be pressed triggering a local station's call letters and channel (referred to as [...] "magicalls") at the receiving station that was pre-recorded by the talent. The talent would then wait anywhere from 3 to 5 seconds before beginning to speak. Another button pressed {{at the end}} of a talk break by the talent would trigger a cluster of local commercials at the receiving station, or a closure tone at the receiving station would send control back to the network if there were no commercials. The network provided music and DJ's, localized talent-matching liners, limited promotions support consisting of ideas used by other affiliates, and years later, a website. As the network moved from analog to digital satellite, it also provided receivers to affiliates to use on a loaned basis.|$|R
30|$|Facebook users {{interact}} with posts in several ways. The {{most popular and}} easiest to use is the “like” button, introduced in 2009 (Kincaid, 2009). Anyone who can see the post can see how many likes a post receives and who liked the post. In addition to liking, users can make comments to posts and can reply to other comments, potentially including images and web links. Comments also have like buttons, independent of the post’s likes. Often, when a user likes or comments on posts and other comments in their feed, Facebook shares this activity with friends in their network. Finally, when users wish to share a post in their feed, they can press the share <b>button,</b> <b>sending</b> it to their timeline and their friends’ newsfeeds. Like any other post, a shared post can receive likes and comments as a shared event. Since these events are shared with friends, {{it is possible for}} posts to become “viral” where likes, comments, and shares multiply exponentially as a critical mass of people view and {{interact with}} the post.|$|R
