40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a guide on the design and {{fabrication}} of thick adherend double lap shear joints (DLS), {{often referred to as}} butt connections/joints in ship structures including patch repair. The specimens consist of 10 mm steel inner adherend and various outer adherend materials including 0 / 90 WR GFRP and 0 / 90 UD CFRP laminates and steel. The focus here is on CFRP/steel joint due to availability of test data. The thickness of the outer adherend varies from 3 mm to 6 mm. <b>Shear</b> <b>overlaps</b> of 25 - 200 mm were considered. The overall objectives are (i) to assess the quality of the standard fabrication method, (ii) to determine joint strength and overlap plateau for various specimens with a range of material combinations and (iii) to understand aspects of failure and design of joint under quasi-static loading.

40|$|The {{formation}} of west Pacific tropical cyclone Nuri (2008) was observed over four days from easterly wave to typhoon stage by aircraft using scanning Doppler radar and dropsonde data. This disturbance developed rapidly in a significantly sheared environment. In {{spite of the}} <b>shear,</b> <b>overlapping</b> closed circulations existed {{in the frame of}} reference of the storm in the planetary boundary layer and at 5 km elevation, providing a deep region protected from environmental influences. The rapid spinup of Nuri {{can be attributed to the}} strong increase with height at low levels of the vertical mass flux during and after the tropical depression stage, and the correspondingly strong vorticity convergence in the planetary boundary layer. As Nuri developed, convective regions of boundary layer vortex stretching became fewer but more intense, culminating in a single nascent eyewall at the tropical storm stage. A non-developing tropical wave case was also analyzed. This system started with much weaker circulations in the boundary layer and aloft, leaving it unprotected against environmental intrusion. This may explain its failure to develop...|$|R

In this paper the surface structure and adhesive bonding properties of PTFE treated by three types of plasma are reported. The results indicate that different plasma gases have different effects on the surface structure. Argon plasma treatment protected a highly cross-linked honeycomblike structure produced air and oxygen plasma treatment resulted in a surface displaying high aspect ratio protrusions. All experimental plasma treatments caused a marked improvement in <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> strength, with the highest shear strength achieved after oxygen plasma treatment.

30|$|An {{apparent}} {{difficulty with}} {{this analysis is}} that we have used water estimates and then applied Couette responses of VES solutions. VES fluids are non-Newtonian and because of the complex behaviour it is not straightforward to calculate the wall shear rate in a capillary. However, a previous study (Yamamoto et al. 2008) suggests a plug flow profile for VES fluids which means a rapid shear rate decay near the wall. Therefore the maximal shear rates at the wall for VES solutions are expected to be higher than for water. Thus, we expect that the shear rate range at least includes that from 0 to 128  s− 1. These <b>shear</b> rates <b>overlap</b> the <b>shear</b> rates (measured with the Couette cell) associated with the non-monotonic range of Figs.  3 and 4, although we will later show that this is not absolutely necessary for selective retardation in capillaries.|$|R
40|$|Lightweight alloy {{materials}} such as magnesium and aluminum alloys are frequently employed in the automotive and manufacturing industry {{in order to improve}} vehicle fuel economy. This creates a pressing need for joining of these materials to each other, as well as to steels. Given the drastic difference in thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and the limited solubility of aluminum or magnesium in steel, dissimilar alloy fusion welding is exceptionally difficult. Refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW) is a solid-state joining technology which connects two materials together with minimal heat input or distortion. The RFSSW process involves a three-piece non-consumable tool with independently controlled sleeve and pin components, which rotate simultaneously at a constant speed with the sleeve penetrating into only the top sheet. Joining of Al 5754 alloy and DP 600 plate using friction stir seam welding is investigated. Two travel speeds of the shoulder are used to compare the mechanical and microstructural properties of the two kinds of welds made. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy are utilized to characterize the microstructure. Mechanical properties are evaluated using tensile testing. Joining of Al 6063 -T 6 and Zn coated DP 600 steel using RFSSW is studied. Spot welds could reach a maximum <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> load of 3. 7 kN when using a tool speed of 2100 RPM, a 2. 5 s welding time and 1. 1 mm of penetration into the upper Al 6063 sheet. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were conducted to characterize the interface, which revealed that zinc layer was displaced into the interface and upper sheet, which may facilitate the bonding between the two sheets. Microhardness measurements reveal that the fracture path propagates through the soft heat affected zone of the Al alloy during <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> testing. Joining of Mg alloys ZEK with Zn coated DP 600 steel sheets by RFSSW is also studied here. In joints between ZEK 100 and DP 600, the maximum <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> fracture load is 4. 7 kN, when a 1800 RPM tool speed, 3. 0 s welding time and 1. 5 mm penetration into the upper ZEK 100 sheet is applied. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that a continuous layer of FeAl 2 particles accommodate bonding of the ZEK 100 and DP 600 sheets, which appears to have originated from the galvanized coating on the DP 600. If the zinc layer is removed then the maximum <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> fracture load is 3. 1 kN. X-ray diffraction analysis of the interface between the Mg alloy and the DP 600 steel on the Mg side also revealed that intermetallic (IMCs) such as FeAl 2 existed as an interfacial layer between the two sheets. It can be revealed from the displacement curve that the absorbed energy of the weld made under the condition of 1800 RPM, 3. 5 s, and 1. 5 mm of plunge depth in tensile testing up to failure point is approximately 2. 73 J...|$|R

The weld strength increases significantly by increasing the penetration depth into the lower steel substrate at all travel speeds.

40|$|Bonded single <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> {{specimens}} were fabricated from Graphite/PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) composite adherends and titanium adherends. Six advanced thermoplastic adhesives {{were used}} for the bonding. The specimens were bonded by an electromagnetic induction technique producing high heating rates and high-strength bonds in a few minutes. This contrasts with conventionally heated presses or autoclaves that take hours to process comparable quality bonds. The Graphite/PEEK composites were highly resistant to delamination during the testing. This allowed the specimen to fail exclusively through the bondline, even at very high shear loads. Nondestructive evaluation of bonded specimens was performed ultrasonically by energizing the entire thickness of the material through the bondline and measuring acoustic impedance parameters. Destructive testing confirmed the unique ultrasonic profiles of strong and weak bonds, establishing a standard for predicting relative bond strength in subsequent specimens...|$|R

Therefore, it is proposed to evaluate the influence of welding time analyzing the mechanical properties of the joints of bituminous heat welded roofing materials.

40|$|Although {{there is}} an {{increasing}} desire to apply structural adhesive bonds in glass constructions, {{the lack of a}} reliable failure criterion is a major obstacle.

Firstly, an appropriate mesh and element type was chosen after which the influence of different geometries on the peak shear stress was investigated. Additionally, simulations with different stiffness levels for the adhesive were performed. From the numerical analysis, it could be concluded that the impact of the thickness is most important.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of laser weldments for automotive steels with high strength ranging from 370 MPa to 1500 MPa. Design/methodology/approach: Butt joint welding {{was conducted on}} high strength steel sheets by using a CO 2 laser with 6 kW output power. For sound welds with full penetration, the proper welding conditions were chosen and the cross-sectional bead shape, tensile strength, hardness profile and micro-structure were evaluated for each case. Findings: Laser welding {{is known to be}} a low heat input process because of its high heat density and welding speed. But for laser welding of ultra high strength steel with strength over 780 MPa, micro-structural softening was observed in the HAZ (heat affected zone), resulting from dissolved martensite. Practical implications: The tensile strength reduction in laser welding of ultra high strength steed should be considered in the design of car body structures. The HAZ softening that occurs in butt joint welding can reduce the tensile <b>shear</b> strength for <b>overlap</b> joint welds, which are predominantly mostly used in the BIW (body-in-white) structure.

40|$|Along mid-ocean ridges the {{extending}} {{crust is}} segmented 1 on length scales of 10 – 1, 000 ?km. Where rift segments are offset from one another, motion between segments is accommodated by transform faults that are oriented orthogonally {{to the main}} rift axis. Where segments overlap, non-transform offsets {{with a variety of}} geometries 2 accommodate shear motions. Here we use micro-seismic data to analyse the geometries of faults at two overlapping rift segments exposed on land in north Iceland. Between the rift segments, we identify a series of faults that are aligned sub-parallel to the orientation of the main rift. These faults slip through left-lateral strike-slip motion. Yet, movement between the overlapping rift segments is through right-lateral motion. Together, these motions induce a clockwise rotation of the faults and intervening crustal blocks in a motion that is consistent with a bookshelf-faulting mechanism, named after its resemblance to a tilting row of books on a shelf 3. The faults probably reactivated existing crustal weaknesses, such as dyke intrusions, that were originally oriented parallel to the main rift and have since rotated about 15 ° clockwise. Reactivation of pre-existing, rift-parallel weaknesses contrasts with typical mid-ocean ridge transform faults and is an important illustration of a non-transform offset accommodating <b>shear</b> motion between <b>overlapping</b> rift segments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of a {{triaxial}} deformation experiment conducted on a transversely isotropic shale specimen. This specimen was instrumented with ultrasonic transducers to monitor the evolution of the micro-seismic activity induced by shear faulting (triaxial failure) and subsequent fault slip at two different rates. The strain data demonstrate the anisotropy of the mechanical (quasi-static) compliance of the shale; the P-wave velocity data demonstrate the anisotropy of the elastic (dynamic) compliance of the shale. The spatio-temporal evolution of the micro-seismic activity suggests the development of two distinct but <b>overlapping</b> <b>shear</b> faults, a feature similar to relay ramps observed in large-scale structural geology. The shear faulting of the shale specimen appears quasi-aseismic, at least in the 0. 5 MHz range of sensitivity of the ultrasonic transducers used in the experiment. Concomitantly, the rate of micro-seismic activity is strongly correlated with the imposed slip rate and the evolution of the axial stress. The moment tensor inversion of the focal mechanism of the high quality micro-seismic events recorded suggests a transition from a non-shear dominated to a shear dominated micro-seismic activity when the rock evolves from initial failure to larger and faster slip along the fault. The frictional behaviour of the shear faults highlights the possible interactions between small asperities and slow slip of a velocity-strengthening fault, which could be considered as a realistic experimental analogue of natural observations of non-volcanic tremors and (very) low-frequency earthquakes triggered by slow slip events...|$|R

The combs are polybutadienes (1, 4 -addition) consisting of an H-skeleton with an additional off-center branch on the backbone. We chose to investigate a solution in order to obtain reliable nonlinear <b>shear</b> data in <b>overlapping</b> dynamic regions with the two different techniques. The transient measurements obtained by cone partitioned plate indicated the appearance of overshoots in both the shear stress and the first normal stress difference during start-up shear flow. Interestingly, the overshoots in the start-up normal stress difference started to occur only at rates above the inverse stretch time of the backbone, when the stretch time of the backbone was estimated in analogy with linear chains including the effects of dynamic dilution of the branches but neglecting the effects of branch point friction, in excellent agreement with the situation for linear polymers. Flow-birefringence measurements were performed in a Couette geometry, and the extracted steady-state shear and first normal stress differences were found to agree well with the mechanical data, but were limited to relatively low rates below the inverse stretch time of the backbone.

However the details of fault geometry and where porosity develops around faults remains poorly documented. Integration of 3 -D seismic, wireline and production data from Saybrook Field in northeastern Ohio {{has shown that the}} productive trend is controlled by a 3. 4 mi (5. 5 km) long, NW-SE oriented basement fault that was probably reactivated during the Taconic Orogeny in the Mid- to Late Ordovician. The far-field stresses of this compressional activity caused strike-slip movement of the pre-existing fault to create echelon synthetic shear faults that branch 1350 ft (411. 5 m) upward into the Trenton-Black River interval. Circular collapse structures between <b>overlapping</b> <b>shear</b> faults are the primary drilling targets. Faults were mapped using amplitude and coherency versions of the seismic data.

It is also of interest because of its sophisticated feeding apparatus and a prooral (anteriorly directed) mode of shearing used to rip food apart. However, despite several detailed descriptions of the skull, the three-dimensional relationship between individual bones of the skull has generally been ignored. Here we provide the first joint by joint description of the hard tissue anatomy for almost every cranial suture in the skull of Sphenodon. This survey shows that most joints involve either abutments (e. g., along the midline) or extensive overlaps (e. g., more peripheral areas) {{but there are others}} that are heavily interlocked (e. g., postorbital-postfrontal) or involve a notable amount of soft tissue (e. g., vomer-premaxilla).

The research in this thesis evaluates overlap FSW joints between thin sheets of AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 6022 -T 4 when the welding parameters of tool geometry and welding speed are varied. The resulting joints are characterized by optical microscopy, <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> tests, microhardness tests, and temperature measurements. The effect of a post-weld heat treatment is also examined. The main objective of the research are to determine a tool geometry that can produce good quality welds over a wide range of operating conditions, for use in an industrial setting. Friction stir welds of good quality are made successfully at speeds of up to 500 mm/min, and it is found that weld microhardness and joint strength are greater at faster welding speeds; whereas temperatures in the weld area are lower at faster welding speeds. Five different tool geometries are tested, and the tool design that delivers the best performance is a one that uses a concave shoulder shape, and a pin with a tapered profile, threads, and 3 flats.

40|$|Adhesive bonding as an {{alternative}} method of joining materials together has many advantages over the more conventional joining methods such as fusion and spot welding, bolting and riveting. For example, adhesives {{can be used to}} bond dissimilar materials, adhesive joints have a high stiffness to weight ratio and the stress distribution within the joint is much improved. Stainless steels are commonly used in applications that would clearly benefit from adhesive bonding; architectural cladding, because of the large bond areas involved, and in the railway industry, due to improved acoustic insulation and greater fatigue resistance. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with adhesive bonding of stainless steels intended for structural applications. As a starting point to the investigation, {{a review of the literature}} was conducted, covering the intrinsic mechanisms of adhesion, the significance of the chemical and physical nature of the adherend surface, the types of structural adhesives, the methods of testing adhesive joints and surface characterisation techniques. The first experimental stage, involved a screening programme to evaluate a number of candidate adhesive systems and adherend surface pre-treatments. Standard single <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> and floating roller peel tests conducted in ambient conditions were employed in the discrimination and the degree of compatibility between adhesive and adherend, as measured by the proportion of cohesive failure on the post-fracture face, was also considered. In the second stage of the experimental work, lap shear tests were used to evaluate the affects of surface contamination on joint strength. In addition, lap shear and peel tests were considered to assess the significance of the adhesive bondline and primer thickness. In order to assess the environmental durability of adhesive joints, lap shear and peel tests were conducted after ageing in ambient and high humidity environments. To compliment the data, Boeing wedge crack extension tests were also carried out on adhesive bonded joints incorporating adherends with different surface conditions, to investigate the contribution to joint strength in ambient and adverse environments afforded by surface pre-treatment. The next stage of the experimental work was designed to evaluate the significance of the adherend type and its thickness on initial lap shear strength. Several different commercial grades and gauges of stainless steel were used in the tests, which were conducted at room temperature. The final stage of the experimental work was concentrated on the room temperature creep and dynamic fatigue performance of adhesive joints. Throughout the course of study a number of different surface analytical techniques were employed to physically and chemically characterise the surfaces of pm-bonded adherends and to identify the locus of failure on post-fracture faces. The single <b>overlap</b> <b>shear</b> and floating roller peel tests were able to differentiate between the candidate adhesives; epoxy systems, particularly the toughened variants, were considered the most suitable structural adhesives for bonding stainless steels in load bearing applications. However, these tests and subsequent tests using lap shear and peel, failed to discriminate conclusively between the different surface pre-treatments (except untreated or crudely prepared surfaces) and ageing environments. The Boeing wedge crack extension tests were found to be sensitive to the condition of the adherend surface and the environment in which the joint is located; roughening the surface of the adherend either chemically or physically was found to enhance joint durability in ambient, high humidity and sub-zero environments. The use of surface primers and coupling agents may protect the un-bonded surface and benefit joint durability, but excessively thick primer layers may reduce joint strength. The stiffness of the adherend material was found to significantly influence lap shear strength. Stiffer adherends, either thicker or inherently stronger, give higher joint strengths because they resist joint rotation and the peel stresses at the extremes of the overlap are minimised. Lap joints with low stiffness adherends will fail by peel-dominated, adherend-controlled failure and lap joints with high stiffness adherends will fail by shear-dominated, adhesive-controlled failure. Two elastic models were proposed for determining the elastic rotation and the line peel force as a function of the shear stress. The room temperature creep results showed an endurance limit of - 40...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Polyethylene {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for natural gas transport since the mid- 1970 's. The pipeline system is sound and well-functioning, {{but there are some}} aspects of the system that could be improved. One of these is the repair method of leaking pipes. Presently if a natural gas pipe begins to leak, the damaged pipe is completely excavated. The pipeline around the damaged area is clamped to seal the pipe and stop the gas flow. The bad piece of pipe is cut out, and a new piece is welded in place. Often, with the passage of time, these welds leak. This is not dangerous but it is costly. The current research focuses on the viability of using a polyethylene patch and a commercial adhesive to seal a leak in the natural gas pipeline. The patch would be applied to the pipe through a keyhole excavation (18 " diameter) with a tool designed and manufactured by Timberline Tool. This tool offers an advantage because repairmen will be able to operate the tool from the ground level through a single keyhole excavation, and possibly without stopping the gas flow in the pipe depending on the leak size. Four commercial, acrylic-based, structural adhesives were analyzed for bonding the patch to the natural gas pipe. Three of the adhesives are manufactured by 3 M Worldwide, DP- 8005, DP- 8010, and DP- 8 OIONS. The fourth is manufactured by Henkel Loctite, Loctite 3030. The cure kinetics of the adhesives were studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. The material and mechanical properties of three types of polyethylene substrates (HDPE, pipe MDPE, and pressed MDPE) were studied with tensile testing, contact angle analysis, DSC experiments, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Previous research of determined the bonded patch must be able to withstand up to 500 psi of shear force with an internal pipe pressure of 100 psi (normal pressure in the pipeline is 65 psi). <b>Overlap</b> <b>shear</b> tests were used to analyze the shear strength of the bond between each adhesive and the different polyethylene substrates. The shear tests were used to determine the optimal cure conditions of the adhesives. One adhesive, DP- 8010 from 3 M, was proven to be appropriate for bonding a polyethylene natural gas pipe. When this adhesive is cured under optimal conditions, and the surface of the polyethylene substrate is prepared properly, consistent shear strengths between 800 and 1400 psi can be attained...|$|R
40|$|Important {{problems}} related to the governing mechanism of flame blowoff in bluff body stabilized turbulent premixed combustion have been investigated in this dissertation. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation fundamental aspects of unforced and forced response in premixed and partially premixed fuel stratified flames encountered in low NOx gas turbine engines and afterburners are studied. Combustion in these devices presents complexities and instabilities introduced by thereto-acoustic, entropy wave and convective interactions. In this context, generalized blowoff limits and transfer functions of premixed turbulent flames under controlled acoustic perturbations and mixture gradients have been characterized. ^ The second part of the study concerns the flame dynamics of a bluff body stabilized turbulent premixed flame as it approaches lean blowoff. Experiments were performed in a laboratory scale burner as well as in a prototypical combustor with different geometries (axisymmetric and planar two dimensional), length and velocity scales. High speed chemiluminescence imaging along with simultaneous particle imaging velocimetry and OH planar laser-induced fluorescence were utilized in both these experiments for premixed propane-air flames to determine the sequence of events leading to blowoff and provide a quantitative analysis of the experimental data. It was found that near blowoff, the flame front and <b>shear</b> layer vortices <b>overlap</b> as a result of the reduced flame speed in fuel lean mixtures, to induce high local stretch rates on the flame. The high stretch rates exceeded the extinction stretch rate values instantaneously and in the mean, resulting in local flame extinction along the shear layers. Following partial or whole shear layer extinction, fresh reactants could pass through the non-reacting shear layers to react within the recirculation zone with some or all other parts of the flame extinguished. The flame kernel within the recirculation zone might survive for a few milliseconds and could reignite the shear layers such that the entire flame can be reestablished for a short period. This extinction and reignition event could happen several times before final blowoff event which occurred when the flame kernel failed to reignite the shear layers and ultimately lead to total flame extinguishment. Strikingly similar findings in the two different experimental setups suggest the general validity of the proposed flame blowoff mechanism and its insensitivity to a particular geometry. ^ Finally, recent results from ongoing research on the mechanism of forced blowoff and an experimental study on scalar mixing in an interacting field of two successively generated counter rotating laminar line vortices at the interface of two gas streams are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{consists of a}} detailed microstructural investigation of in-target, single-crystal [001], clad (with Inconel 718) and unclad, W long-rod, ballistic penetrators. The rods were shot into rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) steel targets approximately 76 mm in thickness at impact velocities ranging from 1100 m/s to 1350 m/s. A comprehensive microstructural overview of the penetration process was obtained from this investigation. Solid-state flow/erosion, solid-state target/rod mixing as well as influencing factors such as strain rate, penetration performance, cladding interference and the interaction between target and projectile were emphasized. ^ Some of the microstructural features observed, including deformation twins, cleaving, adiabatic shear bands and DRX support an overall solid-state penetration process. Furthermore they provide for a unifying perspective for {{the applicability of the}} hydrodynamic paradigm (DOP 2 ̆ 6 ap; l 2 ̆ 6 j 0;rp/rt) and earlier mechanistic erosion approaches. DRX and grain growth within adiabatic shear bands observed at specific high strain/strain-rate zones within the rods suggest that the projectile erodes by means of these microstructures in a solid-state form. This erosion process contributes to the performance of the rod by either allowing optimum flow of rod material which would increase penetration depth, or by maximizing rod material consumption which would reduce it. Since flow and/or erosion are also necessary in the target for perforation to occur, {{it is not surprising that}} the erosion process in the target was observed to mirror the one in the projectile. That is both target and projectile developed erosion zones with DRX facilitating the extreme deformation via dense <b>overlapping</b> <b>shear</b> band formation. ^ Mechanical alloying and/or mixing of the target (steel) and rod (W, or W-Inconel 718) was also observed and investigated. Selective etching techniques as well as energy-dispersive x-ray mapping revealed unambiguous evidence of the latter. Considerable mixture (target/rod) material was observed to intercalate into vehicles of erosion including shear bands. These mixtures, which included some isolated melt regimes, differ in composition for clad and unclad samples. The Inconel 718 alloy clad material which is used in order to prevent fragmentation of the projectile during launch, also contributed to the penetration deformation and to the projectile/target interaction. The cladding material appears to influence the solid-state flow by functioning as the principal flow interaction regime between the target and penetrator at the penetrating interface. Since material flow efficiency at the target/rod interface and erosion initiation zones was found to be a necessary condition for increasing penetration depth, a penetrator design strategy can include the careful selection of cladding material. That is the cladding can function first as a solid-state lubricant at the penetrating target/rod interface and secondly as an intercalated mixture in vehicles of erosion allowing for optimum flow. ...|$|R
