5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from <b>sweet</b> <b>clover,</b> {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from <b>sweet</b> <b>clover</b> (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{state that}} colony collapse disorder is mainly {{a problem of}} feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food {{from a variety of}} sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as corn syrup (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including <b>sweet</b> <b>clover</b> and mustard.|$|E
40|$|In the agro-pastoral ecotone of {{northern}} China, two exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers</b> have spread widely and have significant impacts on local animal husbandry, vegetation {{and the visual}} landscape. In order to evaluate the invasion mechanism of these exotic plants in a farmland-grassland ecosystem, a line-transect survey was conducted and field sampling was undertook in August of 2011. The results showed that land use patterns markedly influenced the distribution and dispersal of exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers</b> in a farmland-grassland ecosystem and <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers</b> grew well in hay-making grassland but growth was restricted in farmland and free-grazing grassland. Environmental parameters may be also the important factors in the invasion process. Distance affected the distribution of exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers.</b> When comparing farmland and grassland, {{the density of the}} plants declined significantly with increasing distance from the interface between farmland and grassland. Prevailing winds may also be a trigger factor that facilitated the distribution and dispersal of the two exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers.</b> There was a higher density of <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers</b> in a downwind direction than in an upwind direction in the grassland ecosystem. Furthermore, competition with native plants may affect the establishment and development of the two exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers.</b> The dominant species, Chinese leymus (Leymus chinensis), had a negative correlation with the two exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers</b> for above-ground biomass. The native dicotyledonous plant, Saussurea runcinata, had a positive effect on the biomass of the two exotic <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers.</b> Th...|$|R

5|$|The {{identity}} of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled <b>sweet</b> <b>clover</b> remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and <b>sweet</b> <b>clover.</b> The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of bioactive molecules from botanical sources is an expanding field, preferentially oriented to plants having {{a tradition of}} use in medicine and providing high yields and availability. Temperate forage legumes are Fabaceae species that include worldwide-important crops. These plants possess therapeutic virtues {{that have been used}} in veterinary and folk medicine, but have also attracted the interest of official medicine. We have examined here Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Trifolium pratense and T. repens (clovers), Melilotus albus and M. officinalis (<b>sweet</b> <b>clovers),</b> Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil), Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), Lespedeza capitata (roundhead lespedeza), and Galega officinalis (goat's rue). The phytochemical complexes of these species contain secondary metabolites whose pharmacological potentials deserve investigation. Major classes of compounds include alkaloids and amines, cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoids, coumarins, condensed tannins, and saponins. Some of these phytochemicals have been related to anti-hypercholesterolemia, antidiabetic, anti-menopause, anti-inflammatory, antiedema, anthelmintic, and kidney protective effects. Two widely-prescribed drugs have been developed starting from temperate forage legumes, namely the antithrombotic warfarin, inspired from <b>sweet</b> <b>clover's</b> coumarin, and the antidiabetic metformin, a derivative of sainfoin's guanidine. Available evidence suggests that temperate forage legumes are a potentially important resource for the extraction of active principles to be used as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals...|$|R

The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, {{one of the most}} prominent ports in the world at that time. The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, betel nuts, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, Italian wines, tin, lead, topaz, storax, <b>sweet</b> <b>clover,</b> flint glass, antimony, gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants.

5000|$|The {{mountain}} leafhopper survives on winter {{annual weeds}} during winter, usually near stream banks or canals. In late winter or spring, adults {{can be found}} in sugar beet fields and can then migrate to favored weed hosts (curly dock, burclovers) in orchards. The mountain leafhopper is most often the abundant vector found on cherry, however, cherry is not the preferred host and the leafhopper does not reproduce on cherry. Preferred hosts for the mountain leafhopper are; alfalfa, California burclover, clovers, curly dock, and <b>sweet</b> <b>clovers.</b> Of the preferred hosts alfalfa and curly dock cannot become infected with the disease itself but are just a host for the leafhopper. Occasional hosts are; vetches (in legume family) and sweet cherry. It’s believed that the role of this leafhopper is introducing the disease into cherry orchards rather than spreading the disease between cherry trees within an orchard.(http://ucanr.org/sites/cccoopext/files/80935.pdf) ...|$|R
