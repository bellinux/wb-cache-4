30|$|An {{integrating}} sphere {{is characterized by}} its diameter, its ports, its baffle and its wall reflectance (typically ~ 98 %).

Meanwhile, the program Coulter LS 230 was opened and the option “use optical module ” was selected. After the instrument was ready, nanopure water was used to fill the <b>sample</b> <b>port.</b> When the chamber was filled the ‘Fill ’ button was pressed on the machine in order to activate the debubbling routine.

30|$|The total {{luminous}} flux inside the spheres is calibrated using the radiant flux from Quartz Tungsten Halogen (QHT) lamp irradiance {{standards that are}} attached to the spheres. One lamp is located in sphere R and the other one in sphere T. These lamp standards (supplied by LabSphere) include a calibration certificate and a calibrated spectral flux data, in W/nm. The calibration of each sphere is done individually by introducing a Spectraflect sample (same material that covers the wall of the sphere) in the <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> and switching on one calibration QHT lamp at a time. This calibration is necessary to well account for the measured spectral flux within each sphere.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of adsorption characteristics of activated carbon (porous material) in the temperature range from 5 to 20 K is essential {{when used in}} cryosorption pumps for nuclear fusion applications. However, such experimental data are very scarce in the literature, especially below 77 K. So, an experimental system is designed and fabricated to measure the adsorption characteristics of porous materials under variable cryogenic temperatures (from 5 K to 100 K).

40|$|A novel inlet {{has been}} {{designed}} for selective sampling of gas and aerosol phases of volatile species from high-speed aircraft. A multistage flow system brings the flow nearly isokinetically towards the sampling port. Two small airfoil-shaped "blades" are placed close to the <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> to provide the flow conditions required for aerosol and gas sampling. Aerosols are sampled when these blades are positioned to operate the inlet as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI). The design enables sampling of particles as small as 0. 1 w m from a high-speed aircraft under stratospheric conditions, a substantial improvement over that possible with previous CVI designs. For gas sampling, one of the blades is moved by a stepper motor to occlude the inlet opening and gas is sampled perpendicular to the bulk flow. Boundary layer suction is used to prevent the sampled gas from coming {{in contact with the}} impactor walls.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} a new instrumental setup at the University of Twente Faculty ITC with an optimized processing chain to measure absolute directional-hemispherical reflectance values of typical earth science samples in the 2. 5 to 16 µm range. A Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer {{was chosen as the}} base instrument. It was modified with an external integrating sphere with a 30 mm sampling port to allow measuring large, inhomogeneous samples and quantitatively compare the laboratory results to airborne and spaceborne remote sensing data. During the processing to directional-hemispherical reflectance values, a background radiation subtraction is performed, removing the effect of radiance not reflected from the sample itself on the detector. This provides more accurate reflectance values for low-reflecting samples. Repeat measurements taken over a 20 month period on a quartz sand standard show that the repeatability of the system is very high, with a standard deviation ranging between 0. 001 and 0. 006 reflectance units depending on wavelength. This high level of repeatability is achieved even after replacing optical components, re-aligning mirrors and placement of <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> reducers.

40|$|A vibrating-sample {{magnetometer}} was constructed, calibrated {{and used}} to measure the magnetic hysteresis of rock samples. The magnetometer was designed around a large electromagnet capable of producing fields of approximately 3600 Oe (360 mT). Between the poles of this magnet, pick-up coils and a liquid nitrogen bath surrounded a <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> assembly in which the sample could be vibrated. The <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> assembly contained a heating element that allowed the sample temperature to be varied from room temperature to 98 K (- 175 ﾟC). A novel method was used to vibrate the large (5 gram) rock samples. The sample was mounted off-axis on a rotating shaft in a way that kept the sample's orientation in the applied field from changing while the sample moved uniformly in a circle of 2 mm radius 29. 2 times a second. This induced a 29. 2 Hz sinusoidal voltage in the pick-up coils proportional to the magnetization of the sample. Cycling the magnetic field intensity allowed hysteresis loops to be automatically plotted. [...] Seven magnetite-bearing Precambrian dolerite dyke samples which had likely retained their original remanence direction for over a billion years were studied. Measurements of their magnetic hysteresis as a function of low temperature were used to investigate what mechanisms allowed them to retain such stable remanence. [...] The coercive force, Hc, of the samples decreased as a linear function of saturation magnetostriction on cooling. This suggests that internal stresses opposing domain wall motion are mainly responsible for the ability of most of these rocks to retain stable remanence. The one clear exception was the specimen of highest coercive force (Hc = 487 Oe = 3. 9 x 10 ⁴ A/m) in which Hc hardly changed on cooling suggesting that remanence was carried by single-domain grains with shape anisotropy. [...] The ratio of saturation remanence to saturation magnetization JR/Js was found to change linearly with saturation magnetostriction and with coercive force on cooling. These linear relationships and that between coercive force and saturation magnetostriction were used to infer what proportion of the magnetite present was in the form of single-domain or pseudo-single-domain grains using the method of Hodych (1990). This method could not be applied to the sample of highest coercive force because its coercive force and saturation remanence did not change on cooling. [...] Reversible work, Wrev, done on descending from saturation to the remanence point in a hysteresis loop was measured as a function of low temperature. When Wrev was estimated by integrating to a constant magnetization rather than to a constant field, Wrev was found to decrease on cooling. However, this does not allow inference of what is controlling domain rotation in the samples...|$|E

30|$|This work presents, for {{the first}} time, a {{detailed}} methodology on the measurements of absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PL-QY) of solid phosphors carried out in a double integrating sphere system. We also show and emphasize the potential of this instrument for extensive studies on optical properties of luminescence materials such as phosphors, nano-crystals, QDs or turbid media, reinforcing the work of previous studies that implemented double integrating spheres systems [9 - 11]. We present a DIS instrument that is optimized for absolute PL-QY measurements. The integrating spheres {{have been designed to}} maximize their gain and light homogeneity within the sphere before reaching the detector (as fluorescence can be a very weak signal). The spectrometers (Ocean Optics, Maya Pro- 2000) were also chosen for their low electronic noise, temperature stability and high dynamic range. A special effort was done to minimize light losses in the optical system in order to accurately evaluate absolute PL-QY values. To do so, glass slides, which are very commonly employed to hold the sample, were not used in order to avoid total internal reflection effects; the sample was irradiated with a small beam (relative to the <b>sample</b> <b>port</b> size, at least 2 / 10 ratio) due to the very diffusive nature of the phosphor samples; and finally, a method to trap the specular reflection from the sample’s front face within the DIS system was applied.|$|E

Moreover, Fresnel losses were completely avoided as the 1 inch aperture of the integrating sphere was closed with a mechanical piece that let the 1.5 mm beam pass through (through a 5 mm whole) and recovered the reflected specular light within the R sphere. This piece was covered with Spectraflect® material in order to provide a lambertian reflectance inside the sphere. The angle of incidence of the beam was slightly tilted from the normal incidence (approx. 3 °) by careful adjustment of the position of the source installed on a XYZ optical mount. When the beam passes through the 5 mm whole, it hits the sample slightly off-axis and the reflected light encountered the aluminum piece that closed the 1 inch aperture of the sphere, getting trapped in the DIS system.|$|E
