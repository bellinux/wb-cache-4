40|$|AbstractShort-term {{treatment}} of rat submandibular tissues with 10 μM isoproterenol (IPR) resulted in reduction of mucin secretion {{in response to}} the agonist during further incubation, and in increases in EC 50 values. This IPR-induced reduction of secretion was coupled with selective decreases in the number of β-adrenoceptors in the tissues and in their affinity for agonists, as assessed by measurement of the specific binding of [3 H]dihydroalprenolol. Treatment of the tissues with IPR caused a 30 % decrease in IPR-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and a 25 % increase in the GTP binding capacity of inhibitory <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> (Gi proteins). This IPR treatment triggered a 60 % increase in the ability of pertussis toxin (LAP) to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins in the tissue membranes. Enhanced function of <b>stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>Gs</b> <b>proteins)</b> was observed only during the first incubation of the tissues with IPR. The IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins in tissues treated with IPR was decreased by prior treatment with cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase, but was increased markedly by prior treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Neither IPR-induced desensitization of protein secretion nor increase in the IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins was observed in the tissues pretreated with 0. 25 μM okadaic acid. These findings suggest that the regulation of Gi protein phosphorylation {{plays an important role in}} the IPR-induced heterologous desensitization of mucin secretion from rat submandibular glands...|$|R

5000|$|Many other immunomodulating {{factors have}} been isolated, the most {{important}} of which are prostaglandins and cytokines. PGE2 was the first immunomodulator to be derived from macrophages and described. PGE2 functions in amplifiying peripheral blood lymphocyte IL-10 transcription and protein production; as well as in deactivating macrophages and T-cells. PGE2 is an immunomodulatory eicosanoid derived from the cell membrane component, arachidonic acid, and is processed in the arachidonic acid cascade: the successive oxygenation and isomerization of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and PGE2 synthase enzymes. [...] The regulation of target cells by PGE2 occurs via signaling through four cell membrane-associated G-protein-coupled E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, named EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. PGE2 inhibits bacterial killing and ROI production by AM by impairing Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis through its ability to stimulate the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) effectors via EP2 and EP4 receptors signaling. EP2 and EP4 receptors signal primarily through <b>stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> (Gs), increasing adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and subsequent cAMP formation. cAMP is a second messenger that influences multiple cellular functions via the activation of two downstream effector molecules, protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac-1 and -2). Epac-1 and PKA are both important factors involved in the inhibition of AM bacterial killing. The effects of PKA results from its ability to phosophorylate serine and threonine residues on many cellular proteins, especially transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). cAMP/PKA/CREB axis mediates the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. [...] The killing of phagocytosed bacteria by AMs is dependent upon several distinct microbicidal mechanisms, like the reduced NADPH oxidase-mediated release of ROI. ROI generation by NADPH oxidase is an important bactericidal mechanism after FcR-mediated phagocytosis. PGE2 activates both Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors by ligation, stimulating cAMP production and subsequent activation of downstream cAMP effectors, PKA and Epac-1; both which in turn impair the phosphorylation and phagosomal membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase component, p47phox, thereby inhibiting the respiratory burst.|$|E

Cholera toxin is composed of catalytic A 1 subunit, an A 2 linker, and a homopentameric cell-binding B subunit.

Following expression of the Apdop 1 receptor in HEK 293 cells, a higher level of cAMP was observed {{in the absence of the}} receptor ligand, showing that Apdop 1 is constitutively active.

Appli-cation of dopamine (EC 50 of 35 nM) or serotonin (EC 50 of 36 lM) to Apdop 1 -transfected HEK 293 cells further increased the level of cAMP, suggesting that the receptor is linked to the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>Gs</b> <b>protein</b> pathway.

Methods: We screened 32 patients classified as PHPIc for GNAS mutations and identified three mutations (p. E 392 K, p. E 392 X, p. L 388 R) in four unrelated families. These and one novel mutation associated with PHPIa (p.

40|$|Cachexia {{in cancer}} is characterised by {{progressive}} depletion of both adipose tissue stores and skeletal muscle mass. Two catabolic factors produced by cachexia-inducing tumours {{have the potential}} for inducing these changes in body composition: (i) proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) which acts on skeletal muscle to induce both protein degradation and inhibit protein synthesis, (ii) lipid-mobilising factor (LMF), which has been shown to directly induce lipolysis in isolated epididymal murine white adipocytes. Administration of lipid-mobilising factor (LMF) to mice produced a specific reduction in carcass lipid with a tendency to increase non-fat carcass mass. Treatment of murine myoblasts, myotubes and tumour cells with tumour-produced LMF, caused concentration dependent stimulation of protein synthesis, within a 24 hr period. It produced an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which was linearly related to the increase in protein synthesis. The observed effect was attenuated by pretreating cells with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, MDL 12330 A and was additive with stimulation produced by forskolin. Both propranolol and a specific 3 adrenergic antagonist SR 59230 A, significantly reduced the stimulation of protein synthesis induced by LMF. LMF also affected protein degradation in vitro, as demonstrated by a reduction in proteasome activity, a key component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. These effects were opposite to those produced by PIF which caused both a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis and an elevation on protein breakdown when incubated in vitro. Incubation of LMF with a fat cell line produced alterations in the levels of guanine-nucleotide binding <b>proteins</b> (<b>G</b> <b>proteins).</b> This was also evident in adipocyte plasma membranes isolated from mice bearing the tumour model of cachexia, MAC 16 adenocarcinoma and from patients with cancer cachexia.

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors {{comprise}} a large superfamily of membrane proteins which transmit extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses. Adrenoceptors (AR) {{belong to the}} α-group of Rhodopsin-family G protein-coupled receptors. Physiological activation of adrenoceptors is mediated by binding of the endogenous catecholamines noradrenaline and adrenaline and leads to the regulation of neuronal, endocrine, cardiovascular, vegetative and metabolic functions. In addition to the classical activation of GPCRs by binding of ligands, experimental evidence has accumulated showing that GPCR activation can be modulated by the membrane potential. In this study adrenoceptors β 1 -AR and β 2 -AR have been investigated {{in regard to the}} modulation of their activity by the membrane potential. Both receptors couple to the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>Gs</b> <b>protein.</b> They were used as model receptors because despite increasing knowledge of voltage-dependent regulation of Gi- and Gq-coupled receptor activity, no data has been published on the voltage-sensitivity of Gs-coupled receptors. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based assays were combined with whole-cell patch-clamp in a voltage-clamp mode in order to monitor agonist- and voltage-dependent alterations in either protein conformation or protein-protein interaction. Conformational changes of the receptor molecule upon stimulation with catecholamines in {{the presence or absence of}} depolarizing steps were directly monitored using FRET-based intramolecular receptor fusion proteins. By means of the combination of FRET and patch-clamp, voltage-dependence of β 1 -AR and to smaller extent β 2 -AR activation was shown to be an intrinsic property of these Gs-coupled receptors and was transmitted to downstream signaling. Receptor activity and downstream signaling decreased during depolarization. This expands voltage-dependent GPCRs to the group that couple to <b>stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>proteins.</b> Voltage-dependence of β 1 -AR was mainly mediated via an alteration in efficacy of either Iso or Adr and occurred with highest sensitivity at physiological membrane potentials. Regarding Adr this is a unique finding since voltage-dependence of other GPCRs activated by their endogenous ligands were shown to rely on alterations in ligand affinity. Agonist-specificity of voltage-dependence was also apparent as dopamine-induced β 1 -AR interaction with arrestin 3 was enhanced during depolarization whereas it was reduced when induced by adrenaline, isoprenaline, noradrenaline or dobutamine. A different binding mode of dopamine might be responsible for these differences. The second part of this thesis focused on the molecular mechanism underlying voltage-dependence. Mutation of a charged amino acid and a residue involved in agonist binding did not seem to alter voltage-dependence or only yielded inconclusive results. However, the introduction of an additional positive charge in the vicinity of a highly conserved aspartic acid in TM 2 (D 2. 50) reduced voltage-dependence of the mutant receptor. We might have identified this aspartic acid as one residue of a voltage-sensor in α 2 A-AR but further experiments are required in order to corroborate this hypothesis. Taken together these data expand voltage-dependent GPCRs to the group coupling to <b>Gs</b> <b>proteins.</b> Especially in excitable tissue like the heart, which expresses voltage-dependent β 1 -AR the membrane potential could fine-tune adrenoceptor signaling on a time scale within cardiac action potentials and in the presence of endogenous or synthetic catecholamines. On a molecular level we suggest a possible involvement of the highly conserved aspartic acid D 2. 50 in the detection of alterations in the membrane potential in α 2 A-AR. Whether this conclusion is also transferable to other G protein-coupled receptors remains to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{predominant}} histamine receptor subtype in the supraventricular and ventricular {{tissue of}} various mammalian species is the H 2 receptor (H 2 -R) subtype, {{which is known}} to couple to <b>stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> (<b>Gs),</b> i. e. the major effects of this autacoid are an increase in sinus rate and in force of contraction. To investigate histamine effects in H 2 -R-transfected rat atrial myocytes, endogenous GIRK currents and L-type Ca 2 + currents were used as functional assays. In H 2 -R-transfected myocytes, exposure to His resulted in a reversible augmentation of L-type Ca 2 + currents, consistent with the established coupling of this receptor to the Gs–cAMP–PKA signalling pathway. Mammalian K+ channels composed of GIRK (Kir 3. x) subunits are directly controlled by interaction with βγ subunits released from <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> which couple to seven-helix receptors. In mock-transfected atrial cardiomyocytes, activation of muscarinic K+ channels (IK(ACh)) was limited to Gi-coupled receptors (M 2 R, A 1 R). In H 2 -R-overexpressing cells, histamine activated IK(ACh) via Gs-derived βγ subunits since the histamine-induced current was insensitive to pertussis toxin. These data indicate that overexpression of Gs-coupled H 2 -R results {{in a loss of}} target specificity due to an increased agonist-induced release of Gs-derived βγ subunits. When IK(ACh) was maximally activated by GTP-γ–S, histamine induced an irreversible inhibition of the inward current in a fraction of H 2 -R-transfected cells. This inhibition is supposed to be mediated via a Gq/ 11 -PLC-mediated depletion of PIP 2, suggesting a partial coupling of overexpressed H 2 -R to Gq/ 11. Dual coupling of H 2 -Rs to Gs and Gq is demonstrated {{for the first time in}} cardiac myocytes. It represents a novel mechanism to augment positive inotropic effects by activating two different signalling pathways via one type of histamine receptor. Activation of the Gs–cAMP–PKA pathway promotes Ca 2 + influx through phosphorylation of L-type Ca 2 + channels.

Cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac Gsα {{were used to assess}} the role of Gsα on the whole-cell Ca 2 + currents (ICa). Cardiac myocytes from transgenic mice had a 490 % higher peak ICa compared with those of either wild-type controls or Gsα-nonexpressing littermates. The effect of Gsα overexpression was mimicked by intracellular dialysis of wild-type cardiac myocytes with GTPγS-activated Gsα. This effect was not mediated by protein kinase A activation as intracellular perfusion with a protein kinase A inhibitor rendered the same degree of activation in either transgenic or wild-type myocytes also dialyzed with activated Gsα. The data indicate that Gsα overexpression is associated with a constitutive enhancement of ICa which is independent of the cAMP pathway and activation of endogenous adenylyl cyclase...|$|R
40|$|Progestin hormones stimulate sperm {{motility}} in teleosts but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Preliminary {{results suggest that}} progestin upregulation of {{sperm motility}} in southern flounder and several other marine species is mediated through a sperm membrane progestin receptor with the characteristics of membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPRα, also known as Paqr 7 b). The hypothesis that mPRα has {{an important role in}} progestin regulation of southern flounder sperm motility and fertility was tested in the present study. The specific mPRα agonist, 10 -ethenyl- 19 -norprogesterone (Org OD 02 - 0, 100 nM), mimicked the stimulatory actions of the endogenous progestin, 17, 20 β, 21 -trihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (20 β-S, 100 nM) on flounder sperm motility. The concentration of the mPRα protein on sperm plasma membranes was positively correlated to sperm motility as well as the responsiveness of sperm to progestin stimulation. Acute in vitro progestin treatment of sperm with high mPRα protein levels increased both sperm motility and fertilization success in strip spawning experiments. However, in vitro progestin treatments were ineffective on sperm with low receptor abundance. A single injection of the superactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (LHRHa, 100 μg/kg) increased sperm motility and fertilization success in strip spawning experiments 72 h post-injection which was accompanied by an increase in mPRα protein concentrations on sperm plasma membranes. These results provide clear evidence that southern flounder sperm hypermotility is mediated through mPRα. <b>Stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> but not inhibitory <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> were identified in flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions. The finding that treatment of flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions with either 20 β-S or Org OD 02 - 0 increases cAMP levels suggests progestins stimulate flounder sperm motility by activating an mPRα/stimulatory G protein/membrane adenylyl cyclase pathway. A similar mechanism has been identified in Atlantic croaker, suggesting that the signaling pathway mediated by mPRα in sperm is highly conserved in advanced teleosts. Collectively, our results indicate that progestin-stimulation of flounder sperm hypermotility and fertility is dependent on a sufficient concentration of mPRα which can be upregulated by in vivo LHRHa treatments. These findings potentially have practical applications for enhancing the fertility of male flounder broodstock...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a benign bone lesion charac-terized by the replacement of normal bone structure with abnormal fibro-osseous connective tissue [1]. It accounts for about 2 - 3 % of bone-derived tumors and usually occurs throughout the skeletons around the body with a predilection for craniomaxillofacial bones [2]. Craniomaxillofacial FD usually begins in childhood and slowly progresses through puberty, resulting in deva-stating facial deformities and functional deficits [3]. These lesions develop not only in single bone (mon-stotic) but also in multiple bones (polystotic), sometimes concomitantly associated with skin pigmentation and endocrine disturbances (McCune-Albright syndrome).

40|$|In vitro {{transcription}} {{reactions were}} performed with isolated ventricular nuclei of adult rats {{to investigate whether}} increased mRNA levels of the inhibitory G protein α-subunit Giα- 2 after prolonged in vivo stimulation with the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline are caused by increased transcription. Rats were treated by a 4 -day subcutaneous infusion of isoprenaline (2. 4 mg/kg per day) or 0. 9 % NaCl as control. To avoid the influence of developmental expression patterns, adult rats were chosen for all experiments. Signals for Giα- 2 and the <b>stimulatory</b> <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> α-subunit Gsα were specific and due to hybridization of nascent mRNA transcripts. In the isoprenaline group the transcriptional activity of Giα- 2 gene increased to 140 % of the control value, whereas gene specific hybridization for Gsα remained unchanged. These results show that increased Giα- 2 mRNA levels after stimulation with isoprenaline are at least partially caused by enhanced transcription of Giα- 2 mRNA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Since recent {{findings}} indicate {{the involvement of}} G-proteins in the mechanism of ischaemic preconditioning (PC), {{the present study was}} aimed to investigate the role of adrenergic mechanisms, such as G-proteins and stimulation of adrenergic receptors, in this phenomenon. For this purpose, isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to regional ischaemia (30 min occlusion of LAD) followed by reperfusion. The effect of PC (a single 5 min occlusion/reperfusion before a long occlusion) on ischaemia- and reperfusion induced arrhythmias was studied in conjunction with an assessment of G-proteins in the myocardial tissue by means of Western blotting and ADP-ribosylation with bacterial toxins. To follow the link between G-proteins and adrenergic receptors, their stimulation by exogenous norepinephrine (NE) was applied to test whether it can mimic the effect of PC on arrhythmias. Thirty min ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion induced high incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). PC significantly reduced a total number of extrasystoles, incidence of VT and abolished VF. It was, however, insufficient to suppress reperfusion-induced sustained VF. Measurement of G-proteins revealed that PC led to a reduction of <b>stimulatory</b> <b>Gs</b> <b>proteins,</b> whereas inhibitory Gi proteins were increased. NE (50 nmol) introduced a manner of similar to PC (5 min infusion, 10 min normal reperfusion) reduced ischaemic arrhythmias in the same way, as PC. In addition, in NE-pretreated hearts reperfusion induced mostly transient VF, which was spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm. A transient increase in heart rate and perfusion pressure during NE infusion completely waned before the onset of ischaemia, indicating that antiarrhythmic effect was not related to haemodynamic changes and to conditions of myocardial perfusion. Conclusion: antiarrhythmic effect of PC may be mediated by a stimulation of adrenergic receptors coupled to appropriate G-proteins. Consequently, the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and reduction in cAMP level, as well as the activation of protein kinase C may be considered as two possible pathways leading to a final response...|$|R
