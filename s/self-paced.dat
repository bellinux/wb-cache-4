When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the physiological responses of construction workers labouring in thermally stressful environments in the UAE using Thermal Work Limit (TWL) as a method of environmental risk assessment. Methods The study was undertaken in May 2006. Aural temperature, fluid intake, and urine specific gravity were recorded and continuous heart rate monitoring was used to assess fatigue. Subjects were monitored over 3 consecutive shifts. TWL and WBGT were used to assess the thermal stress. Results Most subjects commenced work euhydrated and maintained this status over a 12 -hour shift. The average fluid intake was 5. 44 L. There were no changes in core temperature or average heart rate between day 1 and day 3, nor between shift start and finish, despite substantial changes in thermal stress. The results obtained indicated that the workers were not physiologically challenged despite fluctuating harsh environmental conditions. Core body temperatures were not elevated suggesting satisfactory thermoregulation. Conclusion The data demonstrate that people can work, without adverse physiological effects, in hot conditions if they are provided with the appropriate fluids and are allowed to <b>self-pace.</b> The findings suggested that workers will <b>self-pace</b> according to the conditions. The data also demonstrated that the use of WBGT (a widely used risk assessment tool) as a thermal index is inappropriate for use in Gulf conditions, however TWL was found to be a valuable tool in assessing thermal stress. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} in hot environments, to determine safe work-rest regimens based upon heat stress criteria. Is it then a good health policy to rely upon the <b>self-pacing</b> of the workers? To address this question, we observed the spontaneous work-rest cycles of seven masonry workers allocated {{to the maintenance of}} a float-glass furnace and the workers' heart rate and rectal temperature were continuously monitored. Results showed that the regimens adopted by the workers were poorly related to physiological parameters. The duration of each heat exposure was significantly related to the worker aerobic capacity, but not to the heart rate level reached {{at the end of the}} working period. Due to <b>self-pacing</b> of the task, heart rates and rectal temperatures remained within acceptable limits for all workers but one, even though these workers were rather old and had a rather low physical capacity. These favourable results may be ascribed to a spontaneous limitation of the effective working time to about 25 % of the shift duration and to the fact that subjects worked, in pairs alternately, to perform the task. It is concluded that self-regulation of the work-rest cycles can be an effective means to protect the workers exposed to hot conditions from an excessive physiological strain, providing that the task has no urgent character and does not involve productivity incentives, and that the workers are well trained to their job.
