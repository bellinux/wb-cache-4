25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|E

500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian general Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Freiherr (Baron) von Nauendorf, then a rittmeister (captain of cavalry), included only fifty hussars. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf sallied out to engage Wunsch's men. When his small force reached Wunsch's, he greeted the Prussians as friends; {{by the time}} the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand. Wunsch withdrew; the next day, Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, the [...] Empress Maria Theresa [...] wrote: [...] "They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so pleased with Nauendorf, a rookie from Carlstadt or Hungary, who killed seven men, that you gave him twelve ducats." ...|$|E
