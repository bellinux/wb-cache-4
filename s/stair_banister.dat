50|$|Another {{renovation}} and addition by Keyes, the Emory Ford House {{was originally}} built in 1928 by Robert O. Derrick. When Emory M. Ford (the great grandson of John Baptiste Ford {{and part of}} the “Chemical Ford” family) acquired the estate in 1940, Ford hired Keyes to make significant changes. Keyes added “artistic glass and mirror installations, including a <b>stair</b> <b>banister</b> with glass balusters,” as well as an attached conservatory overlooking Lake St. Clair and a mansard roof with parapet. The house sits just down the road from Keyes’s much earlier mansard house Pingree House.|$|E
5000|$|A newel, {{also called}} a central pole or support column, {{is the central}} {{supporting}} pillar of a staircase. It can also (usually as [...] "newel post") refer to an upright post that supports the handrail of a <b>stair</b> <b>banister.</b> In stairs having straight flights it is the principal post {{at the foot of}} the staircase, but it can also be used for the intermediate posts on landings and at the top of a staircase. Although its primary purpose is structural, newels have long been adorned with decorative trim and designed with different architectural styles.|$|E
5000|$|The Sawyer House, {{built in}} Italianate architecture, {{replaced}} the Navarre House {{on the property}} in 1873. Timbers from the original Navarre House were used to create the <b>stair</b> <b>banister</b> in the Sawyer House. While Dr. Sawyer did not {{live in the house}} after 1870, the property remained in his family's ownership. His daughter, Jenny Toll Sawyer, gave the house to the city of Monroe in 1938. [...] The house was used by a variety of organizations, such as the Monroe County Historical Museum, Red Cross, the Camp Fire Girls, and the Boy Scouts. The house stood empty before a group of citizens pooled their private funds and restored the building, and creating an organization whose main reason for existence was the maintenance of the historic structure. Today, the house remains owned by the City of Monroe and is available for public use through the custodial group, called The Sawyer Homestead, a 501(c)3 group who collects rent to fund the house's upkeep.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the scene}} in the {{original}} Toy Story film when the Green Army Men parachute through the <b>stair</b> <b>banisters</b> to investigate Andy's birthday presents, Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop is now easily the most popular attraction in the Playland. Early plans for Disney California Adventure included this ride. Instead, the former attraction, Maliboomer, space-shot attraction was constructed.|$|R

50|$|Although {{built in}} 1839, {{during the period}} when the Greek Revival style was predominant, the Charles Bullis House, like many {{cobblestone}} farmhouses erected before 1840, retains the plan and massing of the Federal style and is refined with both Federal and Greek Revival style details. The house's characteristic Federal elements include the rectangular plan, low pitched roof, symmetrically spaced windows, semi-elliptical louvered fans in the gables, inside rectangular chimneys located at the gable ends, quoins, and window lintels with splayed ends. Although the cornice is narrow, following the Federal style, the moldings are Greek Revival in scale. The doorway is well-proportioned, with sidelights and narrow pilasters, but contains a simply glazed architrave instead of a more elegant Federal style fanlight. Inside the architrave trim moldings {{throughout most of the}} house and the two simple fireplace mantels reflect the Greek Revival influence. The simple, but elegant, <b>stair</b> <b>banister</b> and the molded trim and block corner moldings found in the southeast room on the first floor are also typical Federal details.|$|E
50|$|Dan Ladd is a Northampton, Massachusetts based American {{artist who}} works with trees and gourds. He began experimenting with glass, china, and metal {{inclusions}} in trees in 1977 in Vermont and started planting trees for Extreme Nature in 1978. He became inspired by inosculation he noticed in nature and by the growth of tree trunks around man-made objects such as fences and idle farm equipment. He shapes and grafts trees, including their fruits and their roots, into architectural and geometric forms. Ladd calls human-initiated inosculation 'pleaching' and calls his own work 'tree sculpture'. Ladd binds a variety of objects to trees, for live wood to grow around and be incorporated, including teacups, bicycle wheels, headstones, steel spheres, water piping, and electrical conduit. He guides roots into shapes, such as stairs, using above-ground wooden and concrete forms and even shapes woody, hard-shelled Lagenaria gourds {{by allowing them to}} grow into detailed molds. A current project at the DeCordova and Dana Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts incorporates eleven American Liberty Elm trees grafted next to each other to form a long hillside <b>stair</b> <b>banister.</b> Another of his installations, Three Arches, consists of three pairs of 14-foot sycamore trees, which he grafted into arches to frame different city views, at Frank Curto Park in Pittsburgh.|$|E
5000|$|A Scottie dog Sandy is starving. He {{asks his}} friend, Rover what he's doing in a car. Rover tells {{him how he}} got a master. In a {{flashback}} Rover goes up to Porky's apartment room while he's taking a bath. He puts on a towel and answers it. Rover walks in and says proposes to be Porky's pet. Porky does not want him and kicks him out. Rover bangs {{on the door and}} Porky gets it. Porky is not impressed with Rover's talents, carries him out of his apartment and drops him off the <b>stair</b> <b>banister.</b> He runs back to his room panting along with Rover near him. Then Rover flicks Porky's snout and dresses up like Carmen Miranda and sings Mi Caballero, by M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl. Porky just throws him out. Rover walks back in yelling Porky doesn't want him. He becomes sorrowful and walks over to the window. He pretends to jump to end his life. Porky runs over, but he sees Rover lying on the edge. Porky shuts the window while Rover pretends that he's going to fall. But he actually does fall. Porky runs down the stairs and tries to catch him, but unfortunately misses. Porky weeps for Rover and tries to wake him up. Rover finally wakes up glad to see Porky and kisses him. Then he uses the famous catchphrase of Lou Costello, [...] "I'm a bad boy!".|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s white lead (lead carbonate/lead sulphate) was added in {{substantial}} quantities {{as the main}} white pigment in some paint products intended {{for use as a}} primer or top coat over metal and wood, both internally and externally. Examples of where this type of paint may have been used are skirting boards, doors, door frames, <b>stairs,</b> <b>banisters,</b> window frames and sills, wooden flooring, radiators, and pipes, though it could also have been applied to any other surface at this time e.g. plaster walls.|$|R

50|$|In {{his work}} on door frames, {{scholars}} agree that Day created both sidelights and transoms for interior doors in many homes he worked on. These architectural elements are characterized by the repetitive use of rectangular patterns. Day also often created newel posts for staircases, which he commonly designed utilizing s-curves and elongated scroll shapes, which represented Day’s interpretation of the traditional newel post; Day’s posts were both larger and longer than the classic Greek Revival Style posts, and are emphasized by the simplistic <b>stair</b> <b>banisters</b> that accompany them. As with his furniture, Day took the popular design of the newel post and added his own stylistic flair through his scroll curves. In crafting these newel posts, Day employed four different types of newels: s-shaped, traditional, a fusion of the two, or completely unique designs; today, twenty-five s-shaped newel posts {{have been attributed to}} Day. Day crafted stair brackets to match and complement these newel posts, again employing curvatures and wave motifs that, combined with the newel posts, suggested a tranquil fluidity. The choice to match newel posts and stair brackets appears to be unique to Day’s architectural work. Day’s mantle designs are often characterized by ionic columns topped with serpentine friezes, but some mantle pieces also employed horizontal and vertical linear designs to create a sharpness in his pieces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first home}} of the physics department. [...] The {{building}}, a Renaissance Revival structure, was renovated in 2005 to provide ADA access and to update building systems. Historic features such as <b>stair</b> treads and <b>banisters,</b> paneled doors, arched ceilings and the terra cotta façade were preserved in the renovation. [...] The building is now home to the Freshman Admissions Welcome Center {{as well as the}} College of Liberal Arts language lab.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, Vice President Thomas Marshall {{signed the}} {{constitutional}} amendment bill that would grant nationwide suffrage to women once ratified by the states. On April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry S. Truman was on the House side of the Capitol when he received a telephone call informing him to come immediately to the White House. His biographer records that Truman “ran through the echoing old Crypt, past the Senate barber shop, then {{up a flight of}} <b>stairs</b> with brass <b>banisters</b> to his office—to get his hat.” This marked Truman’s last action as vice president. When he arrived at the White House he learned that Franklin Roosevelt had died.|$|R
6000|$|These {{last words}} he muttered to himself, and walked zigzaging towards his house. [...] "Get out!" [...] he thundered at Ali, who was {{approaching}} timidly with offers of assistance. From afar, scared groups {{of men and}} women watched his devious progress. He dragged himself up the <b>stairs</b> by the <b>banister,</b> and managed to reach a chair into which he fell heavily. He sat for awhile panting with exertion and anger, and looking round vaguely for Nina; then making a threatening gesture towards the compound, where he had heard Babalatchi's voice, he overturned the table with his foot in a great crash of smashed crockery. He muttered yet menacingly to himself, then his head fell on his breast, his eyes closed, and with a deep sigh he fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|The feeble and filthy oil-lamps, {{with which}} the {{staircases}} of the Upper Temple are lighted of nights, were of course not illuminating the stairs by day, and Major Pendennis, having read with difficulty his nephew's name under Mr. Warrington's {{on the wall of}} No. 6, found still greater difficulty in climbing the abominable black <b>stairs,</b> up the <b>banisters</b> of which, which contributed their damp exudations to his gloves, he groped painfully until he came to the third story. A candle was in the passage of one of the two sets of rooms; the doors were open, and the names of Mr. Warrington and Mr. A. Pendennis were very clearly visible to the Major as he went in. An Irish charwoman, with a pail and broom, opened the door for the Major.|$|R
2500|$|To {{continue}} {{providing for}} the family after the fire, Nist and sons established the Queen City Box Manufacturing company and began production in October 1889. The original Queen City Manufacturing facility was next to the Nist family home {{on the shore of}} Lake Union. The company started slowly, and according to the Seattle City Directory three of Nist's sons, Michael, Jacob J., and John were also employed in 1890 by Skookum Manufacturing Company, another local sawmill. The company made millwork, sashes and door frames. The Nists incorporated the company two years into production, in November 1891, with $10,000 capital, 100 shares at $100 each. The company objectives were to [...] "manufacture, buy, sell and deal in all kinds of lumber, sashes, doors, window blinds, molding, stairs, <b>stair</b> rails and <b>banisters,</b> and all kinds of woodwork and finishing material−to operate sawmills, sash and door factories, shingle mills, box factories, and to build houses, deal in timber and own land." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} {{modified}} periodically {{as the family}} grew and their social lives expanded. Edward creatively recycled used materials, incorporating windows, doors, handrails, or other cast-off materials into useful components for his home. A screened porch was eventually enclosed as a cozy den, and the lattice from the porch was re-used to make an entry into the garden. Guggenheimer's Department Store in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia had no more use for some sheets of copper that were in a window display. Edward used the copper to cover, shape, and enhance the recessed paneling below the chair rail of the dining room. Bright, red leather, padded doors, originally part of the all-black Harrison Movie Theater on Fifth Street in Lynchburg, Virginia, were re-used {{in the kitchen and}} led to a side porch. Massive, over-sized <b>banister</b> <b>stair</b> railings were salvaged and re-used in the attic “dormitory room” Edward re-furbished for the visiting grandchildren in later years. He also installed a second bathroom there, which is modestly screened only with a simple hand-drawn curtain.|$|R
40|$|After the Kobe {{earthquake}} in 1995, the Japanese Government introduced {{a series of}} changes to improve the integrity of new homes. Part of the changes included a rating system designed to indicate the potential for formaldehyde off-gassing {{by a variety of}} primary and value-added wood products. Excessive offgassing of formaldehyde has been identified as a contributor to a phenomenon known as “Sick House Syndrome” that has resulted in a large number of home owners having to leave their houses. Referred to as the F Four Star system (F****), the program was designed to cover much more than interior air quality and was not targeted at any particular product or building system. However, it is the interior air quality provision that concerns North American firms looking to export laminated products into Japan. Products covered by the F**** regulation include: • kitchen cabinets, • bathroom cabinets, • finished wood flooring, • engineered wood flooring, • wooden doors, • wall and ceiling paneling, • fixed shelving in cabinets, • wooden stair treads and risers, • wooden countertops and • edge-glued panels. The regulation does not apply to the following products: • lineal wood moulding and millwork, • door and window casings, • wooden windows, • wooden furniture, • removable wood shelving, • wooden <b>stair</b> railings, <b>banisters</b> and stringers, • unfinished solid wood flooring and • finger-jointed lumber. There are three ways to ensure that wood products have been approved for sale in Japan: • the product is on the exempt list shown above; • use only raw materials in a product that are rated F****; or • submit a product for Ministerial Approval in Japan after testing it in the US. Of the two methods related to products that are not listed as being exempt, using F**** raw materials in the manufacture of a product is the easiest and cheapest route for value-added manufacturers to follow. Obtaining Ministerial Approval can cost up to US$ 5, 000. Value-added wood products manufacturers shoul...|$|R
