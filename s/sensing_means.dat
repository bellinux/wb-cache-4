50|$|Both {{approaches}} have their advantages and disadvantages. Without a harness, the ODT user {{is able to}} accelerate away from center of the surface. The system must recognize this {{using a variety of}} <b>sensing</b> <b>means,</b> and gently accelerate the user back towards the center. Keeping the forces that return the user to center below the human sensing threshold is the main challenge with these systems. The larger the active surface, the easier it is to control using this means.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrival of}} remote <b>sensing</b> <b>means,</b> such as radar and satellite, and more rapid {{development}} of the computer, greatly help to fill that gap. For instance, digital radar systems {{made it possible to}} track thunderstorms, providing users with the ability to acquire detailed information of each storm tracked, since the late 1980's. They are first identified by matching precipitation raw data to a set of preprogrammed characteristics into the system, including signs of organization in the horizontal and continuity in the vertical. Once the thunderstorm cell is identified, speed, distance covered, direction, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) are all tracked and recorded to be utilized later.|$|E

50|$|The DCB6Ge tooltip motif, {{initially}} described at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was {{the first}} complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface. Although an early paper gives a predicted placement speed of 1 dimer per second for this tooltip, this limit was imposed by the slow speed of recharging the tool using an inefficient recharging method and {{is not based on}} any inherent limitation in the speed of use of a charged tooltip. Additionally, no <b>sensing</b> <b>means</b> was proposed for discriminating among the three possible outcomes of an attempted dimer placement—deposition at the correct location, deposition at the wrong location, and failure to place the dimer at all—because the initial proposal was to position the tooltip by dead reckoning, with the proper reaction assured by designing appropriate chemical energetics and relative bond strengths for the tooltip-surface interaction.|$|E

The sensing elements are based on the parameters affecting the operation of the MDL, which are the ambient field, the interrogating electromagnetic field and the mechanical action on the magnetic element.
