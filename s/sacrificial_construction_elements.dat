40|$|AbstractThe datum {{reference}} frame (DRF) is an orthogonal coordinate system used {{to locate the}} geometric features in tolerance technology and is a fundamental tool for tolerance analysis, tolerance validation and tolerance inspection. Additionally, establishment of the composition principle for DRF is an essential process for automation of tolerance technology. This paper presents {{the concept of a}} <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> of the DRF and the composition principle of DRF using the <b>construction</b> <b>element.</b> In this approach, the DRF is decomposed into three <b>construction</b> <b>elements,</b> i. e., a point, a line passing through the point, and a plane containing the line, and DRF is established by determining these three <b>construction</b> <b>elements.</b> The rules and algorithms used to determine the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> are established and the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> can be automatically established from the datum feature according to the rules and algorithm. The composition rules of the DRF are defined with the <b>construction</b> <b>elements,</b> and the DRF can be constructed automatically. The notion of and the establishment method for the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> can be used to validate the datum validity and the completeness of the datum system...|$|R

40|$|Building in of <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> {{is a broad}} term in {{the civil}} {{engineering}} that we come up against at every turn. In this thesis, we are only describing <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> for building info the roads. Road construction is considered {{as one of the}} more challenging and complex projects where it is necessary to pay {{a lot of attention to}} choosing the suitable materials, methods of building in and proper <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> that meet the project requirements. We must be aware of the fact that the right selection and correct building of <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> represent basic conditions for safe driving on the roads. In the thesis, we are describing specific <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> for building as well as the right methods of construction. In addition to that, the construction is shown with videos. For the majority of the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> manufacturers already provide adequate documentation in written form or in the form of short video clips. The aim of my thesis is to collect and publish documentation for building in the <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> on the internet and therefore unable updating the material collected by the users of the website. Due to the fact that the video clips are recorded at building sites in different circumstances, it is understandable that all the works are not going according to provisions prescribed by the manufacturers. A Slovenian saying goes: “We learn from our mistakes. ” As a result of this thesis, we have introduced certain errors that commonly occur while building in the elements. I hope that my work will contribute to the right building in of <b>construction</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{technologies}} for low-quantity production of sheet metal components and parts are applied mostly for thin single metal sheets. However, such technologies {{could also be}} applied as an additional procedure in multi-layer <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> production. Such individually produced <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> must correspond to required standards, which are usually applied in serial production. Due to the immense testing work expected by custom-made production, {{it is reasonable to}} develop a methodology that would be capable of predicting the required results of an individually designed and produced construction block quickly, effectively and with minimal costs. In this investigation, a method of predicting the load capacity behavior of individual <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> performed by incremental forming as an additional technology in multi-layer <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> production is presented.

The results obtained using the presented method are identical with the ones obtained using computer programs that use unsteady thermal regime with a plan discretization of the real <b>construction</b> <b>elements.</b> Applications were made for constructive solution used in current building design activity by Romanian structural engineers.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} the <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> position of ship winch drum on the effects of torque transmission by friction in the mechanization welding process.

Based on this examination, the construction of the device that should provide the reliable torque transmission and the movement of the drum in the process of its welding are proposed. This construction is characterized by a high level of flexibility and ability to change the friction torque based on changing drum position in regard to the driving and driven wheels (<b>construction</b> <b>elements).</b> With this new construction, problems related to the movement synchronization are avoided, unlike the all previously known constructions of this type, which lead to the positive impact on the wear intensity of friction gears...|$|R

40|$|A new Swedish {{construction}} classification system, CoClass, is {{now under}} development. CoClass has presented two alternative classifications for review, both based on the standard for construction classification ISO 12006 - 2 : 2015. One alternative also applies the IEC CD 81346 -series for reference designations which includes classification tables for systems and components with function {{as the basis for}} subdivision of classes. A critical analysis shows that the 81346 series subdivision by function only is of limited use in the construction sector, and that the ISO-standard is unclear regarding appropriate tables and principles of specialization. It also shows that in a construction classification system, overall compositional structure, form, should be the basis for subdivision of classes, and that two separate <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> tables must be developed, one for <b>construction</b> <b>elements</b> and another for <b>construction</b> <b>element</b> components.

It can be observed that the tensile strength can reach more than 1000 MPa, in case of flax fiber and vary from about 400 MPa to 800 MPa in case of jute fiber, whereas hemp fiber exhibits a tensile strength of 690 MPa. Furthermore, the ultimate tensile strain varies from 1. 5 % for the jute fiber to 3. 2 % for the flax fiber, whereas hemp fiber presents an ultimate tensile strain of 1. 6 %. Young’s modulus is equal to 26. 5 GPa and 27. 6 GPa for jute and flax fiber, respectively, whereas, according to Dhakal et al. Young’s modulus for hemp fiber varies from 30 GPa to 60 GPa.
