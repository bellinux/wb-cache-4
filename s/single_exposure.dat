5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial {{velocity}} method (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this <b>single</b> <b>exposure.</b> This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} local tone mapping is used {{even though the}} dynamic range of the source image could be {{captured}} on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, {{and the amount of}} shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.|$|E

25|$|In photography, {{dynamic range}} is {{measured}} in exposure value (EV) differences (known as stops). An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling {{of the amount of}} light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a <b>single</b> <b>exposure,</b> due to their low dynamic range.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} {{exposure}} to methylmercury {{and the appearance}} of symptoms in adult poisoning cases is long. The longest recorded latent period is five months after a <b>single</b> <b>exposure,</b> in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. No explanation for this long latent period is known. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure.|$|E
40|$|Insects in {{the field}} are exposed to {{multiple}} bouts of cold, and there is increasing evidence that the fitness consequences of repeated cold exposure differ from the impacts of a <b>single</b> cold <b>exposure.</b> We tested the hypothesis that different kinds of cold exposure (in this case, single short, prolonged and repeated cold exposure) would result in differential gene expression. We exposed 3 day old adult female wild-type Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) to – 0. 5 °C for a <b>single</b> 2 h <b>exposure,</b> a <b>single</b> 10 h <b>exposure,</b> or five 2 h exposures on consecutive days, and extracted RNA after 6 h of recovery. Global gene expression was quantified using an oligonucleotide microarray and validated with real-time PCR using different biological replicates. We identified 76 genes upregulated in response to multiple cold exposure, 69 in response to prolonged cold exposure and 20 genes upregulated in response to a <b>single</b> short cold <b>exposure,</b> {{with a small amount of}} overlap between treatments. Three genes – Turandot A, Hephaestus and CG 11374 – were upregulated in response to all three cold exposure treatments. Key functional groups upregulated include genes associated with muscle structure and function, the immune response, stress response, carbohydrate metabolism and egg production. We conclude that cold exposure has wide-ranging effects on gene expression in D. melanogaster and that increased duration or frequency of cold exposure has impacts different to those of a <b>single</b> short cold <b>exposure.</b> This has important implications for extrapolating laboratory studies of insect overwintering that are based on only a <b>single</b> cold <b>exposure.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the {{interactions}} of Cd and Zn in the freshwater crab Sinopotamon henanense through metallothionein (MT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level measurements. Laboratory acclimated S. henanense were exposed to Cd (50 µg/L, 100 µg/L, 500 µg/L), and Zn (100 µg/L, 1000 µg/L) alone and in combined treatments (100 µg/L Zn+ 50 µg/L Cd, 100 µg/L Zn+ 100 µg/L Cd, 100 µg/L Zn+ 500 µg/L Cd, 1000 µg/L Zn+ 50 µg/L Cd, 1000 µg/L Zn+ 100 µg/L Cd, 1000 µg/L Zn+ 500 µg/L Cd) for 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days. The results demonstrated that the MDA contents increased with exposure time and dose and showed time- and dose-dependence in both gills and hepatopancreas of S. henanense after <b>single</b> Cd <b>exposure,</b> while the changes of MDA levels were not significant with <b>single</b> Zn <b>exposure.</b> The MDA levels decreased when the crabs were exposed to metal mixtures compared to Cd exposure alone, indicating that Zn mediated the cellular toxicity of Cd. MT contents increased after <b>single</b> Cd <b>exposure</b> and also showed a time- and dose-dependence, in a tissue-specific way. Zn showed a limited ability of MT induction both in gills and hepatopancreas of S. henanense. The MT contents represented not a simple addition of <b>single</b> metal <b>exposures</b> but were enhanced at a higher concentration of Zn combined with different Cd concentrations compared to <b>single</b> metal <b>exposure.</b> Whether MT can be used as a biomarker for complex field conditions need to be considered cautiously since different induction patterns of MT were found among single Zn, Cd and combined groups. It is suggested that several biomarkers together as a suite should be used in the monitoring of heavy metal pollution in the aquatic environment...|$|R

25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a <b>single</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds.

25|$|Exposure to a psychoactive {{substance}} can cause {{changes in the}} structure and functioning of neurons, as the nervous system tries to re-establish the homeostasis disrupted {{by the presence of}} the drug (see also, neuroplasticity). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become more responsive to neurotransmitters; this is called sensitization. Conversely, overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called desensitization or tolerance. Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a <b>single</b> <b>exposure.</b> These processes are thought {{to play a role in}} drug dependence and addiction. Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) is often referred to simply as depression, antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.|$|E
500|$|In some diver {{training}} courses for {{these types of}} diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor {{what is called the}} oxygen clock of their dives. This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased oxygen pressure and is set to activate at the maximum <b>single</b> <b>exposure</b> limit recommended in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Diving Manual. For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limits are: 45 minutes at , 120 minutes at , 150 minutes at , 180 minutes at [...] and 210 minutes at , but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur. Many nitrox-capable dive computers calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas or by reducing the time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases with the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the duration of exposure to oxygen-rich gases.|$|E
