40|$|Companies {{that have}} {{listed on the}} Johannesburg Stock Exchange {{by means of a}} public {{offering}} between 1980 and 1991 have subsequently performed poorly. This long run post issue performance is remarkably consistent with the South African evidence for <b>seasoned</b> rights issuing <b>companies</b> and the international evidence for both initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Over the four years post issue, the newly listed companies earned an average return of 18. 0 % as opposed to 81. 5 % for a size-matched sample of <b>seasoned</b> <b>companies.</b> This study adds to the increasing body of international evidence suggesting the IPO under performance 'puzzle' referred to by Ibbotson (1975), Loughran and Ritter (1995) and Spiess and Affleck-Graves (1995) is not simply sample or country specific.
