2500|$|Percival {{requested}} a transfer from the AIF to pilot training with the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and was accepted in November 1916. After going solo in 20 minutes in 1917, Percival {{was assigned to}} No. 60 Squadron, a scout (fighter) unit in France, commanded by the Canadian ace Billy Bishop. Percival was noted for his flying skills and after {{he was promoted to}} Captain, transferred to No. 11 Squadron as one of its founding members. [...] With 11 Sqn he saw service in the Middle East and Greece. In 1918, while serving in Egypt, Percival designed his first powered aircraft, [...] "a <b>special-purpose</b> <b>aircraft</b> based on the Bristol F.2B, with the Rolls-Royce Eagle engine".|$|E
50|$|In 1957, Popular Mechanics {{reported}} that Hiller Helicopters was developing a ducted-fan aircraft {{that would be}} easier to fly than helicopters, and should cost a lot less. Hiller engineers expected that this type of an aircraft would become the basis for a whole family of <b>special-purpose</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The WC-135 Constant Phoenix is a <b>special-purpose</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{derived from}} the Boeing C-135 and used by the United States Air Force. Its mission is to collect samples from the {{atmosphere}} {{for the purpose of}} detecting and identifying nuclear explosions. It is also informally referred to as the [...] "weather bird" [...] or [...] "the sniffer" [...] by workers on the program.|$|E
50|$|A {{proposed}} {{alternative to}} relay satellites is a <b>special-purpose</b> solar-powered ultralight <b>aircraft,</b> which would fly along a circular path above a fixed ground location, operating under autonomous computer control at {{a height of}} approximately 20,000 meters.|$|R
50|$|In November 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{approved}} a secret program {{under the direction}} of the CIA to build and fly a <b>special-purpose</b> high-altitude reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> named Project AQUATONE. Lockheed was chosen to build the reconnaissance plane and in August 1955 the first Lockheed U-2 was test-flown.|$|R
50|$|The Heinkel HD 39 was a <b>special-purpose</b> cargo <b>aircraft</b> {{developed}} in Germany in the 1920s {{to distribute the}} Berlin newspaper B.Z.. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span, and a fuselage that nearly filled the interplane gap. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, and the undercarriage was of fixed, tailskid type with divided main units. The sole example of the type was built after Ernst Heinkel found out, by chance, that B.Z. required such an aircraft and had ordered two machines from Albatros. Heinkel convinced publisher Ullstein-Verlag to purchase a third aircraft from his firm.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Special-purpose</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{were also}} used, {{including}} the American-made twin-engine Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, and the large, four-engine British Short Sunderland flying boats of the [...] Allies. In the Pacific, the Catalina was gradually superseded by the longer-ranged Martin PBM Mariner flying boat. For the Axis Powers, {{there were the}} long-range Japanese Kawanishi H6K and Kawanishi H8K flying boats, and the German Blohm & Voss Bv 138 trimotor flying boat {{as well as the}} Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor landplane.|$|E
50|$|As American {{dominance}} in the Pacific Ocean began to face competition from Japan in the 1930s, the U.S. Navy contracted Consolidated, Martin and Douglas in October 1933 to build competing prototypes for a patrol flying boat. Naval doctrine of the 1930s and 1940s used flying boats {{in a wide variety}} of roles that today are handled by multiple <b>special-purpose</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The U.S. Navy had adopted the Consolidated P2Y and Martin P3M models for this role in 1931, but both aircraft were underpowered and hampered by inadequate range and limited payloads.|$|E

50|$|The Heinkel HD 40 was a <b>special-purpose</b> cargo <b>aircraft</b> {{developed}} in Germany in the 1920s {{to distribute the}} Berlin newspaper B.Z.. The success of Heinkel's previous design for the publisher, the HD 39, led {{to the order of}} a similar aircraft with greater capacity, and Heinkel responded with a machine of similar layout, but considerably enlarged. Like the HD 39, it was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span, and a fuselage that nearly filled the interplane gap. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, and the undercarriage was of fixed, tailskid type with divided main units. The wings were of wooden construction, while the fuselage was built from welded steel tube skinned in plywood.|$|R
