40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of intralesional bleomycin and <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate in treatment of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas. Patients and Methods: Between July 2007 and May 2009, 120 patients, sixty each of peripheral haemangiomas and lymphangiomas, were administered intralesional injection of bleomycin in a dose of 0. 5 - 1 U/kg in children {{less than one year}} of age and 1 to 15 units in children more than one year of age and 1 to 3 ml of 2 % <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate, {{depending on the size of}} the lesion at intervals of 14 days. Patients more than 20 years of age and those with diffuse or visceral lesions were excluded from the study. Results: Complete resolution occurred in 16 patients (53 %) of haemangiomas and 14 patients (47 %) of lymphangiomas treated with bleomycin, while the results were 12 patients (40 %) and 10 patients (33 %), respectively, in <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group. The satisfactory resolution (resolution more than 50 %) occurred in eight patients (27 %) of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas groups treated with bleomycin, while the results were six patients (20 %) and eight patients (27 %), respectively, in <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group. Poor response rate was observed in six patients (20 %) of haemangiomas and eight patients (27 %) of lymphangiomas of bleomycin group and 12 patients (40 %) of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas in <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group.

UFS using 1 % polidocanol (107 limbs), 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> (102 limbs), 3 % <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> (900 limbs) was employed to treat incompetent saphenous trunks. In patients with unilateral varices 1 treatment was required in 43 % of patients and 2 treatments in 48 % of patients to obliterate incompetent saphenous trunks and varices. For bilateral varices 2 treatments were required in 40 % of patients and 3 treatments in 46 % of cases. The clinical outcome and patency of treated veins on duplex ultrasonography was assessed at a mean follow-up interval of 11 months. ResultsA total of 459 limbs were available for assessment at a follow-up interval of 6 months or greater. The CEAP clinical stage was C 0 : 182 limbs, C 1 : 241, C 2 : 22, C 3 : 0, C 4 : 11, C 5 : 2, C 6 : 1. The GSV had remained obliterated in 88 % of limbs and the SSV in 82 % of limbs.

5000|$|A {{commonly}} performed non-surgical {{treatment for}} varicose and [...] "spider" [...] leg veins is sclerotherapy, in which medicine (sclerosant) is {{injected into the}} veins to make them shrink. The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol (POL branded Asclera in the United States, Aethoxysklerol in Australia), <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate (STS), Sclerodex (Canada), Hypertonic Saline, Glycerin and Chromated Glycerin. STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial. Sclerotherapy {{has been used in}} the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years.

The deviation in the slope of the specific conductance/surface tension against surfactant concentration plots indicated the aggregations of surfactants and hence, their CMC. CMC decreases with increase of alkyl chain length due to the increased van der Waals forces. The calculated increment in Gibb's energy per methylene group for cationic and anionic surfactants is about - 6 kJ mol(- 1) and - 4 kJ mol(- 1) respectively.

The ClariVein w catheter was placed through the sheath, the wire was extruded, and the distal tip of the wire positioned 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction under ultrasound guidance. Catheter wire rotation was then activated for 2 – 3 seconds at approximately 3500 rpm. With the wire rotating, infusion of the sclerosant was started simultaneously with catheter pullback. The sclerosant used was 1. 5 % liquid <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate (Sotradecol #, Bioniche Pharma Group, Geneva, Switzerland). Results: Thirty GSVs in 29 patients were treated.

Clotting tests, platelet/plasma turbidity, and microparticle studies were performed. Specimens were mixed with individual factor deficient plasmas and clotting factor activities were studied. ResultsSTS at high concentrations (> 0. 3 %) destroyed platelets, microparticles and the clotting factors V, VII and X. It prolonged all clotting tests including prothrombin time (PT), activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), non-{{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (NAPTT), thrombin time (TT), factor Xa clotting time (XACT) and surface activated clotting time (SACT). Higher concentrations of POL were required to achieve some anticoagulant activity. Low sclerosant concentrations shortened XACT and SACT, and induced release of procoagulant platelet derived microparticles. Increased exposure time resulted in increased procoagulant activity. STS at concentrations higher than 0. 5 % precipitated a complex containing apolipoprotein b and fibrinogen. ConclusionsDetergent sclerosants affect the clotting mechanism by interfering with clotting factor activities, procoagulant phospholipids and platelet derived microparticles.

Materials and methodsProteins C, S and antithrombin (AT) were assayed in normal plasma treated with increasing concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate (STS) and polidocanol (POL). Activated protein C (APC) was investigated by mixing normal plasmas with sclerosants and testing with the activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) and dilute Russell's viper venom time in the presence and absence of APC. The effect on factor Xa (FXa), heparin and enoxaparin was investigated using chromogenic anti-FXa and APTT methods. ResultsHigh concentration (> 0. 6 %) STS significantly destroyed proteins C, S and AT whereas POL only caused a mild reduction in PC and AT and a moderate (60 %) reduction in PS levels. STS potentiated the anticoagulant effect of APC while POL increased APC resistance. STS mimicked AT and demonstrated significant anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity. STS demonstrated a similar anticoagulant profile to heparin but was 1000 × weaker. It also significantly potentiated the anticoagulant effect of heparin while POL had less effect.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the lytic effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate (STS) and polidocanol (POL) on erythrocytes, platelets, endothelial cells and platelet-derived microparticle (PDMP) formation in vitro {{and the potential}} protective effects of serum albumin and agents such as procaine. Materials and methodsThe effects of sclerosants were studied in blood samples obtained from normal individuals. Absorbance densitometry {{was used to assess}} the lytic effects of sclerosants on blood cells and cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) in plasma and in saline. PDMP were quantified by flow cytometry. ResultsHaemolysis occurred in whole blood at sclerosant concentrations greater than 0. 25 % for STS and above 0. 45 % for POL. Similar concentrations of both agents caused platelet and endothelial cell lysis. Both sclerosants released PDMP at low concentrations but destroyed PDMP at higher concentrations. Albumin significantly reduced the lytic effect of both sclerosants on all cells but had a greater inhibitory effect on POL. Protamine at 0. 01 % had a neutralising effect on STS, whereas procaine and lignocaine showed no such activity. ConclusionsSclerosants at therapeutic concentrations lyse blood cells and endothelial cells in vitro. This effect is strongly reduced by serum albumin possibly contributing towards the low incidence of thromboembolic complications of sclerotherapy...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim was {{to explore}} the current {{experience}} and practice of vascular surgeons in the United Kingdom and Ireland regarding foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins. MethodA postal questionnaire was sent to 609 members of the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland. ResultsThere were 281 responses (47 %). Seventy surgeons (25 %) used foam sclerotherapy. Most use it selectively; few (29 %) offer it to all patients. It {{was more likely to}} be used for recurrent varices (71 %), in older patients (61 %) and for smaller non-saphenous varices (67 %). The majority of surgeons (69 %) used <b>sodium</b> <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate and up to a maximum of 10 – 12 ml of foam. The majority used ultrasound guidance (95 %), leg elevation (69 %) and direct pressure over the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction during injection (63 %). Eighty per cent used compression bandaging after treatment, usually for 7 days (44 %). Ninety percent advised compression stockings, usually Class II (64 %) for 14 days (39 %). Serious complications were few, but eleven surgeons had seen a deep vein thrombosis, two had seen a patient with a stroke and one a transient ischaemic attack. ConclusionFoam sclerotherapy was used by a quarter of surgeons who replied to the survey. Aspects of technique varied considerably and studies to determine optimal techniques are needed. Serious complications with the technique were rare...|$|R
