In this study, to evaluate the mutational spectrum of novel <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations,</b> we assessed 41 pairs of tumor-stroma tissues from Chinese patients with CRC, including 29 colon carcinomas and 12 rectal carcinomas. We designed Illumina Custom Amplicon panel to target 43 genes, including genes in the four candidate pathways, {{as well as several}} known oncogenes for other cancers. Candidate mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing, and we further used SIFT and PolyPhen- 2 to assess potentially functional mutations. We discovered 3 new <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> in gene APC, TCF 7 L 2, and PIK 3 CA that had never been reported in the COSMIC or NCI- 60 databases.

25|$|Early {{studies of}} {{colorectal}} tumours found that allelic deletions of segments of chromosome 18q {{occur in a}} very high percentage of colorectal cancers. DCC was initially cloned out {{of the region and}} put forth as a putative tumour suppressor gene, though nothing was known about its function at the time. The DCC gene was examined for the genetic changes found with most other tumour suppressor genes, but it was found to have a comparatively low frequency of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation.</b> Several years later DCC was shown to encode a transmembrane receptor protein that mediated the effects of netrin-1 on axon outgrowth.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{population}} genetics {{focuses on the}} dynamics of frequencies of alleles acquired by mutations on germ-lines, because only such mutations are heritable. Typical genotyping experiments, however, use DNA from some somatic tissues such as blood, which harbors <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> at the current generation in addition to germ-line mutations accumulated since the most recent common ancestor of the sample. This common practice may sometimes cause erroneous interpretations of polymorphism data, unless we properly understand the role of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> in {{population genetics}}. We here introduce a very basic theoretical framework of population genetics with <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> taken into account. It {{is easy to imagine}} that <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> at the current generation simply add individual-specific variations, as errors in mutation detection do. Our theory quantifies this increment under various conditions. We find that the major contribution of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> plus errors is to very rare variants, particularly to singletons. The relative contribution is markedly large when mutations are deleterious. Because negative selection also increases rare variants, it is important to distinguish the roles of these mutually confounding factors when we interpret the data, even after correcting for demography. We apply this theory to human copy number variations (CNVs), for which the composite effect of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> and errors may not be negligible. Using genome-wide CNV data, we demonstrate how the joint action of the two factors, selection and <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> plus errors, shapes the observed pattern of polymorphism...|$|R

25|$|The {{discovery}} of a specific function for DCC {{that seemed to have}} little to do with cell cycle control, the low <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation</b> rate and the absence of cancer predisposition in DCC heterozygotes were fairly discouraging evidence for DCC's putative tumour suppressor status. This caused focus to shift to DCC's role in axon guidance for a time, until one study implicated DCC in regulation of cell death. As the 18q chromosomal deletions were never resolved to be related solely to another gene, DCC was rapidly reaccepted as a candidate. Recent research into the mechanisms of DCC signaling and in-vitro studies of DCC modifications have solidified DCC's tumour suppressor position, and have begun to integrate DCCs divergent functions as both an axon guidance molecule and a tumour suppressor into a single concept.|$|E
25|$|Carcinogenesis, {{also called}} {{oncogenesis}} or tumorigenesis, is {{the formation of}} a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form of apoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues and organs. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation</b> theory, mutations in DNA and epimutations that lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{questioned}} the assumption that cancers result from sequential random mutations as oversimplistic, suggesting instead that cancer results from {{a failure of the}} body to inhibit an innate, programmed proliferative tendency. A related theory developed by astrobiologists suggests that cancer is an atavism, an evolutionary throwback to an earlier form of multicellular life. The genes responsible for uncontrolled cell growth and cooperation between cancer cells are very similar to those that enabled the first multicellular life forms to group together and flourish. These genes still exist within the genome of more complex metazoans, such as humans, although more recently evolved genes keep them in check. When the newer controlling genes fail for whatever reason, the cell can revert to its more primitive programming and reproduce out of control. The theory is an alternative to the notion that cancers begin with rogue cells that undergo evolution within the body. Instead they possess a fixed number of primitive genes that are progressively activated, giving them finite variability. Another evolutionary theory puts the roots of cancer back to the origin of the eukarote (nucleated) cell by massive horizontal gene transfer, when the genomes of infecting viruses were cleaved (and thereby attenuated) by the host, but their fragments integrated into the host genome as immune protection. Cancer now originates when a rare <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation</b> recombines such fragments into a functional driver of cell proliferation.|$|E

25|$|Pinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and {{can arise}} by {{mutation}} of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation</b> {{in either the}} VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation–reversion path is multi-directional therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot moure and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').|$|E

500|$|Box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, {{they form}} colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks. A colony of G.brachycera at Losh Run, Pennsylvania {{was found to}} be [...] long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of [...] per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by Lomatia tasmanica. However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through <b>somatic</b> <b>mutation</b> rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question.|$|E
40|$|The {{large number}} of cell {{divisions}} required to make a human body inevitably leads to the accumulation of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Such mutations cause individuals to be somatic mosaics.

40|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> have {{a central}} role in cancer but their role in other {{diseases}} such as autoimmune disorders is poorly understood. Earlier work has provided indirect evidence of rare <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> in autoreactive T-lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients but such mutations have not been identified thus far. We analysed <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> in blood in 16 patients with relapsing MS and 4 with other neurological autoimmune disease. To facilitate the detection of <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 19 + and CD 4 -/CD 8 -/CD 19 - cell subpopulations were separated. We performed next-generation DNA sequencing targeting 986 immune related genes. <b>Somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> were called by comparing the sequence data of each cell subpopulation to other subpopulations of the same patient and validated by amplicon sequencing. We found non-synonymous <b>somatic</b> <b>mutations</b> in 12 (60 %) patients (10 MS, 1 myasthenia gravis, 1 narcolepsy). There were 27 mutations, all different and mostly novel (67 %). They were discovered at subpopulation-wise allelic fractions of 0. 2 %- 4. 6 % (median 0. 95 %). Multiple mutations were found in 8 patients. The mutations were enriched in CD 8 + cells (85 % of mutations). In follow-up after a median time of 2. 3 years, 96 % of the mutations were still detectable.
