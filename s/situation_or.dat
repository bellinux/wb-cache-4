5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical <b>situation</b> <b>or</b> disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell's Castle is an {{artillery}} tower, built by Sir Robert Blake following the Parliamentary {{invasion of the}} Isles of Scilly in 1651. During the English Civil War between 1642 and 1646, {{the inhabitants of the}} Isles had been Royalist supporters of King Charles I, and rebelled against Parliament in favour of Charles in 1648. Tresco became a base for Royalist privateers and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might exploit the <b>situation,</b> <b>or</b> that Royalist Irish forces might use the islands for an attack on England. In 1651 Parliament sent Robert Blake and a naval force to retake the island, which had been fortified by the Royalists.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Scotland regained its kirk, {{but also}} the bishops. Under the Rescissory Act 1661, {{legislation}} was revoked back to 1633, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars. But an act passed later the same day renewed the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods, suggesting that a compromise was possible. The restoration of episcopacy was proclaimed by the Privy Council of Scotland on 6 September 1661. James Sharp, minister of Crail, who was in London to represent {{the interests of the}} Resolutioners, changed sides and accepted the position of Archbishop of St. Andrews. He was consecrated along with Robert Leighton as Bishop of Dunblane and two other bishops. Soon an entire bench of bishops had been constructed. During the parliamentary session of 1662 the Church of Scotland was restored as the national church and all office-holders were required to renounce the Covenants. Church ministers were forced to accept the new <b>situation</b> <b>or</b> lose their livings. Up to a third, at least 270, of the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|E

5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple <b>situation</b> <b>or</b> feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors.

25|$|The twentieth-century British {{psychoanalyst}} Wilfred Bion elaborated on Keats's term {{to illustrate}} {{an attitude of}} openness of mind which he considered of central importance, {{not only in the}} psychoanalytic session, but in life itself.

His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School, as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.|$|E
