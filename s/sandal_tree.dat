Cassia is an {{unidentified}} fragrant plant; {{the wood of}} the <b>sandal</b> <b>tree</b> is also fragrant; labdanum or ladanum, is a resinous gum of dark color and pungent odor, exuding from various species of the cistus, a plant found around the Mediterranean; aloe-balls are made from a bitter resinous juice extracted from the leaves of aloe-plants; nard is an ointment made from an aromatic plant and used in the East Indies. These substances have long been traditionally associated in literature. In Psalms xlv, 8 we read: [...] "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad." [...] Milton in Paradise Lost, v, 293, speaks of [...] "flowering odors, cassia, nard, and balms." ...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{pathogens}} like ‘Ca. Liberibacter’, phytoplasma, {{viruses and}} viroids cause diseases to almost all economically important plants. A simple and fast sap-mediated {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) method {{for the detection of}} these pathogens infecting various plant hosts is described in the present study. Sap from selected plants was drawn aseptically on parafilm, from the mid-rib of young leaves. Depending on the type of host plant, sap was diluted to optimal concentration before PCR analysis. ‘Ca. Liberibacter’, Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) infecting citrus, and ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ infecting pepper and <b>sandal</b> <b>trees</b> were tested by sap-mediated PCR. The reliability of this procedure was evaluated by comparing the findings with previously described protocols. The sap-mediated nucleic acid template preparation for PCR assay is devoid of laborious nucleic acid extraction and expensive chemicals. Hence the present method is rapid, economical and so can be employed for diagnosis of large number of plant samples...|$|R

50|$|The Manoa Falls Trail {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} Hawaiian trails and it was most likely used for hunting, bathing, {{gathering}} plants, and wood. The wood found on the trails was used by earlier Hawaiians for making canoes, the bark was sometimes used for <b>sandals,</b> and the <b>tree</b> sap was used as a laxative.|$|R
50|$|As {{depicted}} in the Skanda Purana once King Indradyumna stayed near Nilakantheswar temple to make arrangements to perform Ashwamedha Yajna (Horse sacrifice) for one thousand years. On the advice of Sage Narada, King Indradyumna made a Nrusimha image out of black stone and placed the image under black <b>sandal</b> wood <b>tree</b> and worshipped Him. It is believed that {{in front of this}} temple the Ashwamedha Yajna took place and hence He is known as 'Yajna Narasimha'. Devotees will earn more punya if they make a darsana of Sri Nilakantheswar, Yagna Narasimha and Panchamuki Hanuman (Lord Hanuman image with five faced) after the sacred bath in Indradyumna Tank. Festivals like Narasimha Janma, Satapuri Amavasya etc. are observed in Nrusingha temple with great devotion.|$|R
50|$|Marayur is {{a remote}} {{village on the}} eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. The relics of new stone-age {{civilisation}} has been unearthed here. It has ancient stone cabins, called 'Muniyaras', {{and is the only}} place in Kerala having natural growths of <b>sandal</b> wood <b>trees.</b> Marayur has more than 1000 species of flowering plants and is a well known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of Aibizia lathamii, a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar - the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur - has recorded the largest number of reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, {{it is one of the}} richest areas of south India in avian diversity. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, guar, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri thar, common langur, bonnet macaque etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the close}} of the 1831 {{uprising}} in Mysore, and the British takeover on 19 October 1831, the first priority for Cubbon was law and order. Prior to his actions, murders to settle disputes were extremely common in the towns and villages and Cubbon was disturbed by its apparent acceptance in society. Cubbon improved the system of Silladars or native horsemen who would provide services to the government for a fixed monthly charge. He raised their pay to ensure that they could not be corrupted and created a force of about 4000 horses with seven regiments, with a detachment for every taluk. There was no police force until July 1834, when a code or police hukumnama was formulated. This separated the local police from the military force. There was an armed and unarmed section with the armed part having the duty of dealing with prisoners, any field service needing them, killing tigers (with a reward of Rs 10 for adults and Rs 5 for cubs) and to accompany state guests or travellers. They would also prevent thefts, watch key positions and towns and prevent <b>sandal</b> <b>trees</b> from being cut. The unarmed peons or khalihaths (literally [...] "empty hands") were to help in the repair of roads, irrigation tanks and follow other orders. He set up a reporting structure which was almost entirely made up of Indians.There was no code of law in 1834 and Cubbon drew upon and expanded a system described by his uncle Wilks in 1804. Cubbon created a judicial system that became quite popular but it was causing considerable demands on the system and in 1841 they made vexatious suitors liable to fines. Cubbon made himself the superior authority for handling serious crimes. In some cases he intervened and there were some cases where he conflicted with the decisions taken by the courts. The use of a uniform code of law across all classes was novel in the Kingdom of Mysore. Cubbon also reduced the powers of the poligars or local chieftains. They were paid a pension that was calculated {{on the basis of what}} it would take to maintain them in prison. There was considerable friction between communities belonging to different religions and castes. Cubbon resorted to the use of a majority vote to resolve several disputes relating to religious gurus.|$|R
50|$|Nayanagar {{is one of}} the {{important}} panchayats because Nayanagar Durga Sthan is situated at a distance of 11 km from Gwalpara Block HQ as well the same distance from Udakishunganj in the west and at the distance of 35 km from Madhepura Distt. HQ is not only famous for Manokamna Siddhi in Mahdepura but also in its adjacent areas. The devotees pay their floral and Bipatra offering to Goddess Durga for the fulfillment of their Manokamna. It is usually said that whose offering is accepted by Goddess his manokamna is fulfilled. The so-called Bairagana Mela is held on every Monday, Wednesday & Friday and the devotees come to worship and pay their offering to Goddess from distant places. Goddess Durga is sitting on flower ‘Lotus’ in peaceful gesture. Animal sacrifice is being offered to the Goddess Durga on the above said days. It would be seen form religious point of view that the status of Lord Chowmukh Mahadeo. Eleven Ubhay lingas and Sun God are also available in this pious place. Where as from archaeological point of view there are only some damaged idol and stone plates. It is said that during excavations a big stone platen was found. Though there is a legend of 100 years worship and foundation of this religious place. It is also said that Raja Radeo Singh was also a devotee of this place. This pious place is spread over the area of 22 acres of land and a big pond is existing before the main Temple in which the sacrificial animals are being bathed. It is also said that the people whose manokamna is fulfilled by the grace of Goddess they sacrificed the animals before the deity for her pleasure. Some <b>sandal</b> <b>trees</b> are also available there. It is said that such type of sandalwoods is found only in that holy place and that sandal is consumed in the worship of Goddess Durga. Sandalwood is not sold here for commercial purposes. The main Temple has been constructed with contribution cooperation of the common people and a committee has been formed to look after the management of the Temple. But the communication system especially relating to roads is very poor and hazardous for the devotees. Tourism Deptt. Of Govt. is not taking interest in the upliftment of this Temple. Perhaps in has not been taken over by the Govt. as yet. The people are willing the Govt. interest for this place so that it may get proper importance from religious and archeological point of view.|$|R
50|$|Jan Nisar Akhtar Khan {{works as}} a Forest Officer, and {{lives with his wife}} Zakhiya and his {{daughter}} Neelu. One day while on duty he comes across some poachers who were cutting <b>sandal</b> wood <b>trees</b> illegally.

40|$|Legal {{barriers}} {{for growing}} sandal, {{have so far}} prevented private initiatives for domestication/conservation of this prized tree of Indian forests, accelerated its illegal harvesting from natural forests, and admittedly failed to conserve this resource. We attempted to critically examine the sandal conservation efforts in India especially from a policy perspective, through a detailed review of the various Acts framed for conserving this resource and regulating its extraction and trade. Legal constraints that hamper private initiatives in ex situ sandal conservation/domestication and inconsistency in legal provisions related to sandal extraction and trade among the major producer states of southern India viz. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala are the principal focus of this paper. The need for liberalization of the existing policy regime and evolution of a comprehensive management strategy for <b>sandal,</b> focusing on <b>tree</b> domestication and strengthening of in situ conservation measures backed by imaginative participatory management strategies, are highlighted...|$|R
