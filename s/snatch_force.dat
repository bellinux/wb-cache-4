The test parachute was deployed from an instrumented payload {{by means}} of a deployment mortar when the payload was at an altitude of 158, 500 feet (48. 2 kilometers), a Mach number of 2. 72, and a free-stream dynamic pressure of 9. 7 pounds per foot(exp 2) (465 newtons per meter(exp 2)). Suspension line stretch occurred 0. 46 second after mortar firing and the resulting <b>snatch</b> <b>force</b> loading was - 8. lg. The maximum acceleration experienced by the payload due to parachute opening was - 27. 2 g at 0. 50 second after the <b>snatch</b> <b>force</b> peak for a total elapsed time from mortar firing of 0. 96 second. Canopy-shape variations occurred during the higher Mach number portion of the flight test (M greater than 1. 4) and the payload was subjected to large amplitude oscillatory loads. A calculated average nominal axial-force coefficient ranged from about 0. 25 immediately after the first canopy opening to about 0. 50 as the canopy attained a steady inflated shape. One gore of the test parachute was damaged when the deployment bag with mortar lid passed through it from behind approximately 2 seconds after deployment was initiated. Although the canopy damage caused by the deployment bag penetration had no apparent effect on the functional capability of the test parachute, it may have affected parachute performance since the average effective drag coefficient of 0. 48 was 9 percent less than that of a previously tested parachute of the same configuration...|$|E

These lines {{are attached to}} reels at the aircraft that not only provide stowage for the lines but braking during deployment to prevent high <b>snatch</b> <b>forces.</b> They can vary the inflated wings angle attack thereby controlling range and flared landing maneuver. The inflated pressurized wing can carry a larger load than flexible gliding parachutes. A combined aerodynamic-structural analysis is made {{which is based on}} the assumption that the sail is flexible and has freedom to make the shape which the aerodynamic pressure and the internal stresses dictate. Analytical results are obtained for Newtonian impact aerodynamic theory and are compared with results obtained for a rigid idealization of the paraglider wing. The calculations provide a basis for design of paragliders for hypersonic flight. freedom to take the shape which the aerodynamic pressures and the internal stresses dictate. The assumptions are also made that the booms are rigid and straight and that they have small enough cross sections so as not to affect the aerodynamics. The boom are maintained a fixed distance apart by spreader bars, and the dihedral of the leading-edge booms is fixed with respect to the keel boom. The aerodynamic theory used is Newtonian theory, which has sometimes been used to express the aerodynamic pressure-shape relationship for the hypersonic speed range. Numerical results are presented to show effects of variation in dihedral angle (raising or lowering of the leading-edge booms) ...|$|R

The parachute deployment was initiated by the firing of a mortar at a Mach number of 1. 39 and a dynamic pressure of 11. 0 lb/ft(exp 2) (527 newtons/m(exp 2)) at an altitude of 122, 500 feet (37. 3 kilometers).

The parachute inflated in 0. 24 second to the full-open condition for a total elapsed opening time of 0. 71 second. The maximum opening load of 3970 pounds (17, 700 newtons) came at the time the parachute was just fully opened. During the deceleration period, the parachute exhibited an average drag coefficient of 0. 52 and oscillations of the parachute canopy were less than 5 degrees.

The payload was at a Mach number of 1. 91 and the dynamic pressure was 11. 6 pounds per square foot (555 newtons per square meter) at the time the parachute deployment mortar was fired.

The first full inflation occurred at 1. 12 seconds and stable inflation was achieved at approximately 1. 60 seconds.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to verify the influence of pasture in side of agriculture-cattle integration on the physical characteristics of the ground, to evaluate the influence of these parameters and the staggered of a planter (connecting rod and record of cut) on the grain yield of the soy and to quantify the energy performance of the planter in ground submitted to the trampling of animals. An experiment in Oxissol, situated was become fulfilled in the Santa Maria Farm, Santa Tereza do Oeste - PR, {{in the period of}} April of 2003 the April of 2004. The delineation in subdivided parcels "Split Plot" entirely randomized was used. The main treatments had been composed by pasture with the ground humid or wet, pasture with alone dry and without pasture, with a capacity of 26 U. A. haâ 1. The secondary treatments had been composites for the mechanisms staggered of the planter (double connecting rod or records for deposition of the seasoning). Each plot with a area 1600 m 2 (50 x 32 m) and the subparcels had dimensions of 20 x 8 m, with area of 160 m 2. Physical properties of the ground, parameters of performance of the tractor-planter set and grain yield of the soy had been evaluated. The values gotten in the experiments had shown the effect of the cattle trampling in compacting the ground in the layer until the 10 cm initial. The sharp peak in the resistance to the penetration the 5 cm can be indicating that the maximum mobilization of the resistance of the ground occurred at the depth 5 cm. The root of the soy had promoted the decompaction of the ground, showing a trend of return to the initial structural condition of it. The tension-deformation analysis corroborated the results of the assays of compacting in laboratory, as well as the deformation curve revealed consistent with the profiles of resistance to the penetration in the field. The action of the cattle trampling on the ground modified the density conditions and cone index, however was not enough to intervene with the demand of power in the three studied conditions. The planter with staggered of records had exerted minor power and <b>snatch</b> <b>force</b> and the speed of displacement of the set was about 6, 4 % greater in relation to the staggered connecting rod. The grain yield of the soy was not modified significantly by the handling systems, but when the mechanism was used connecting rod in the planter, the production of grains bigger when was compared with the planter equipped with staggered of records. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar a influÃncia do pastejo em Ãrea de integraÃÃo lavoura-pecuÃria sobre as caracterÃsticas fÃsicas do solo, avaliar a influÃncia desses parÃmetros e dos elementos sulcadores de uma semeadora (haste e disco de corte) sobre a produtividade da soja e quantificar o desempenho energÃtico da semeadora em solo submetido ao pisoteio do gado. Realizou-se um experimento em LATOSSOLO VERMELHO EutrofÃrrico, situado na Fazenda Santa Maria, em Santa Tereza do Oeste â PR, no perÃodo de abril de 2003 a abril de 2004. Foi utilizado o delineamento em parcelas subdivididas âSplit Plotâ inteiramente casualizado. Os tratamentos principais foram compostos pelo pastejo com o solo Ãmido ou molhado, pastejo com solo seco e sem pastejo, com uma lotaÃÃo de 26 U. A. haâ 1 (unidade animal por hectare). Os tratamentos secundÃrios foram compostos pelos elementos sulcadores da semeadora (haste ou discos duplo para deposiÃÃo do adubo). Cada parcela com um total de 1600 m 2 (50 x 32 m) e as subparcelas tinham dimensÃes de 20 x 8 m, com total de 160 m 2. Foram avaliadas propriedades fÃsicas do solo, variÃveis de desempenho do conjunto trator-semeadora e rendimentos de grÃos da soja. Os valores obtidos nos experimentos mostraram o efeito do pisoteio do gado em compactar o solo na camada atÃ os 10 cm iniciais. O pico pronunciado na resistÃncia Ã penetraÃÃo a 5 cm pode ser indicador de que a mÃxima mobilizaÃÃo da resistÃncia do solo ocorreu Ã profundidade 5 cm. Os sulcadores de haste promoveram a descompactaÃÃo do solo conciliando assim com o efeito descompactador das raÃzes da aveia e da soja, mostrando uma tendÃncia de retorno Ã condiÃÃo estrutural inicial do mesmo. A anÃlise tensÃo-deformaÃÃo corroborou os resultados dos ensaios de compactaÃÃo em laboratÃrio, assim como a curva de deformaÃÃo mostrou-se consistente com os perfis de resistÃncia Ã penetraÃÃo no campo. A aÃÃo do pisoteio do gado sobre o solo alterou as condiÃÃes de densidade e resistÃncia Ã penetraÃÃo, entretanto nÃo foi suficiente para interferir na demanda de potÃncia nas trÃs condiÃÃes estudadas. A semeadora com sulcadores de discos exigiu menor forÃa de traÃÃo e potÃncia e a velocidade de deslocamento do conjunto foi cerca de 6, 4 % maior em relaÃÃo ao sulcador haste. O rendimentos de grÃos da soja nÃo foi alterado significativamente pelos sistemas de manejo, mas quando foi utilizado o elemento haste na semeadora, a produÃÃo de grÃos foi maior quando comparada com a semeadora equipada com sulcadores de discos...|$|E
