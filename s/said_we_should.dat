500|$|Basically we {{were having}} a laugh at a lot of the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' and, you know, with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was just becoming a joke. So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> see if we can find him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "bomb {{them back}} to the stone age" [...] comment {{received}} significant publicity but LeMay disclaimed the comment, saying in a later interview: “I never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> bomb {{them back to}} the Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it".|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2014 article, he {{recalled}} his {{week as a}} [...] "guest detainee" [...] of the junta. [...] "One Army colonel at the military camp in Ratchaburi province, where a dozen of us ended up under military detention," [...] he wrote, [...] "said it was like handing us a football yellow card but not yet a red card. His boss, the camp's commander, who holds the rank of major-general and who called us 'older brothers', <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> think of the 'stay' {{as a sort of}} 'vacation.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|LeMay {{subsequently}} rejected misquotes of {{the famous}} [...] "Stone Age" [...] quote. [...] Later, in a Washington Post interview LeMay said that [...] "I never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> bomb {{them back to the}} Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it. I want to save lives on both sides". [...] Etymologyst Barry Popik cites multiple sources (including interviews with LeMay) for various versions of both quotes from LeMay Nevertheless, the [...] "should" [...] quote remained part of the LeMay legend, and remains widely attributed to him ever after.|$|E
2500|$|Its initial {{concept was}} based on a poem Jackson had written and found in a notebook. Jackson's {{original}} lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam commented [...] "The lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up." [...] Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. [...] "We ended up with two different choruses," [...] said Jam. [...] "I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'" [...] "The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> put it {{at the end of the}} song." [...] Jackson presented three songs including [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] and an early version of [...] "Feels So Right," [...] later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was a better fit and a [...] "summertime record." [...] A slightly modified version was included on All for You, featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by Rockwilder. The song paved the way for All for You, with Jam stating [...] "All For You" [...] and [...] "Someone to Call My Lover" [...] and all those songs came off the energy of [...] "Doesn’t Really Matter." ...|$|E

6000|$|It may be <b>said,</b> If <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be {{justified}} {{for the sake}} of our inherent righteousness, since that righteousness is the gift of God, will it not follow that boasting is, in the occasion thereof, cut off? ...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{seems to}} follow {{here as a}} natural inquiry, after what has been <b>said,</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ask, How is this to be done, and by what method can the people of England {{increase}} the home consumption of their woollen manufactures? ...|$|R
50|$|Ismail <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{acknowledge}} Jatin-Lalit {{for giving}} us this wonderful song, and incidentally {{he had played}} violin in this particular composition.
