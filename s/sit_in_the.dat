5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} peers {{were those}} peers {{elected by the}} members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader.

If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jump seat in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had.

5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
5|$|Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers {{procured}} {{the right}} to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper House {{with the passage of}} the House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E

5|$|Eight councillors and a mayor {{make up the}} Lethbridge City Council. City voters elect a new {{government}} every four years. The last election was October 21, 2013. Lethbridge {{does not have a}} ward system, so the mayor and all councillors are elected at large. The 2009–2011 operating budget of the City of Lethbridge was C$250–278million, more than half of which came from property tax. One Member of Parliament (MP) representing Lethbridge sits in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and two members of Alberta's legislative assembly (MLAs), representing Lethbridge-East (NDP) and Lethbridge-West (NDP), <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislative assembly in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{car in front of}} a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
