30|$|The control {{variables}} of the encoding scheme are sectionalizing <b>switches</b> and <b>tie</b> <b>switches,</b> which are {{expressed as a}} set of decimal number. The encoding space depends on the number of possible solutions generated from coding scheme. The solution space is composed of all possible combinations of {{control variables}}. The codes of feasible solutions in solution space are named valid codes and the corresponding topologies satisfy the constraints of network reconfiguration. The size of the solution space will be increased as the increasing of candidate solutions. Moreover, the large scale of solution space would be disturbed the optimisation process if one optimal solution is identified from numerical possible solutions. Furthermore, the validity of solutions ensures that a meaningful new solution in each generation is obtained by combining original codes. Evidently, a good encoding scheme has a significant influence on the efficiency and convergence time of optimisation.|$|R

30|$|Distribution network topological {{structure}} plays a {{vital role}} in improving the reliability and efficiency of power system (Narimani et al. 2014). Distribution feeders are connected in a radial structure that is maintained by appropriately altering the status of the switches installed on the distribution networks. There are two types of switches, that is, sectionalizing <b>switches</b> and <b>tie</b> <b>switches.</b> The sectionalizing switches are normally closed switches on connecting the line sections and the <b>tie</b> <b>switches</b> are normally open switches on the tie-lines connecting either two primary feeders. By changing the status of some switches, loads can be transferred from one feeder to an adjacent one to generate a reconfigured network topology. Thus, the switching combinations determine the reconfigured network structures in a distribution system. There are many possible candidate topologies in a distribution network because of the large number of candidate switching combinations. It is a complicated combinatorial optimisation problem to obtain an optimal topology from these candidate topologies. This optimisation aims at finding a radial structure that satisfies operating constraints. The artificial intelligence algorithms have widely used to address the optimisation problem recently (Tang et al. 2014; Rao et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2014; Tolabi et al. 2011; Gupta et al. 2014; Alonso et al. 2015; Golshannavaz et al. 2014). An encoding scheme, as the base of the intelligence optimisation approaches, is to represent the candidate configurations by a series of decimal codes.|$|R
3000|$|In this paper, decimal {{coding scheme}} is introduced. Subpopulations are {{one-to-one}} relevant to spanning trees. The length of chromosome {{is equal to}} the number of tie branches, which {{is equal to the}} number of independent meshes of distribution network. In contrast to conventional binary coding scheme, the proposed decimal coding scheme can greatly shorten the length of chromosome. The value of each gene is a non negative integer, indicating the open switch identity number on corresponding tie branch. The value of each gene is smaller than corresponding component of corresponding base vector. When we talk about a chromosome, we must point out the subpopulation it belongs to. If two chromosomes have the same genes but belong to different subpopulations, they have different meanings. For example, if chromosome ([...] [...] 0 [...] 0 0) [...] belongs to 1 st subpopulation corresponding to 1 st spanning tree in Table  1, it implies the 0 th <b>switch</b> of <b>tie</b> branch ①, ②, ④ are open. Otherwise, if chromosome ([...] [...] 0 [...] 0 0) [...] belongs to 2 nd subpopulation corresponding to 2 nd spanning tree in Table  1, it implies the 0 th <b>switch</b> of <b>tie</b> branch ①, ④, ⑥ are open.|$|R

50|$|Another common {{method is}} to {{alternate}} a knit stitch of yarn A with a purl stitch of yarn B.

30|$|In this paper, a novel genetic {{algorithm}} {{based on all}} spanning trees of undirected graph for distribution network reconfiguration is proposed. Above all, in the graph of distribution network, branches not located on any loop are removed, and adjacent branches whose crossing points have a degree of two is incorporated into one edge. Thus, an undirected simplified graph of distribution network is obtained. All spanning trees of this simplified graph are found with a program using backtracking and a method for detecting bridges based on depth-first search. Tie branches are obtained with spanning tree subtracted from the simplified graph. There is one and only one switch open on each tie branch. Once the <b>switch</b> on each <b>tie</b> branch is open, all other switch must be closed so as to meet the radial and connected constraints for distribution network operation. Which tie branches and which <b>switch</b> on each <b>tie</b> branch is chosen to be open are determined by {{genetic algorithm}}.|$|R
40|$|Radial {{load flow}} (RLF) methods are {{frequently}} used in solving distribution system problems. The conventional Jacobian-based load flow methods (e. g., Newton-Raphson) {{may fail to}} converge in solving distribution system due to high resistance to reactance ratio of distribution lines. RLF methods are based on sweep-based mechanism and require that the line data must be arranged in accordance with network topology. This problem needs special attention particularly in case of solving dynamic power system problems, where topology of the network changes with <b>tie</b> <b>switches</b> position (network reconfiguration problem). This paper has presented an intelligent graph theory-based RLF analysis to solve "dynamic" problems. The proposed algorithm will help in arranging line data for any combination of <b>tie</b> <b>switch</b> positions, to check the radiality {{of the system and}} to ensure that all nodes are connected with the source node. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated by solving 16 -bus and 33 -bus network reconfiguration problem using graph theory-based RLF method...|$|R

30|$|Contrary to the {{structural}} embeddedness hypotheses, within the presently analyzed sample and time frame, more embedded firms were less successful, {{and the whole}} system moved toward less embeddedness. There {{is a limit to}} which strong ties benefit organizational performance (Todo et al. 2016). When a certain limit of embeddedness is crossed, the flow of new knowledge into the network decreases, feelings of obligation override economic considerations, and change becomes difficult (Glasmeier 1991; Uzzi 1996). In such a situation, <b>switching</b> to <b>ties</b> with less mutual obligations enables producers to economically maintain more links scattered across the market among actors who may provide access to new resources and information (Uzzi and Lancaster 2003). The present analysis suggests that Japanese automakers have found themselves on the side of too much embeddedness, corrected for it, and benefited from that.|$|R
30|$|Feeder {{reconfiguration}} is {{the process}} of changing the distribution network topology by changing the status of its switches. There are two kinds of switches based on their open or close conditions: normally open (N.O.) and normally close (N.C.). N.O. switches are considered as <b>tie</b> <b>switches</b> in the network. During a reconfiguration process, the status of these switches will be changed optimally based on the proposed objective function. Opening and closing of these switches can change the amount of power losses.|$|R

3000|$|Relevant {{concepts}} of the directed graph are introduced here to describe the radial structure of the distribution network. The directed graph has two indices: in-degree and out-degree, represented by λ^in (v_i [...]) and λ^out (v_i [...]), respectively. As a special case of the directed graph, the rooted tree can describe the open-loop structure of the distribution network [12]. However, loops may occur in the network when <b>tie</b> <b>switches</b> come into use, which causes the in-degrees of some nodes to exceed 1. In this case, other branches must be disconnected to guarantee the radial operational structure.|$|R
