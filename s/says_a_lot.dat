25|$|Grace was 50 {{years and}} 320 days old {{on the last}} day of the first Test. It <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about The Champion that he was still worth his place as a batsman. But he could no longer bend down, so his fielding was poor, and the Nottinghamshire crowd jeered and heckled him for it every time a ball went past him at point. Grace himself put it to the {{selection}} committee that he should be dropped for the second Test, and after some debate this is what happened. Only one man has played Test cricket at a greater age. He is Wilfred Rhodes, who coincidentally made his debut in the first Test.|$|E

Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to it really <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy.

Nobody knows what went on inside of these guys and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E

It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I just think it <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and joke about it, before heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E

Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign.

It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show [...] "Pre-War Tour." [...] The band were particularly nervous about playing {{the song in}} Belfast, Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated [...] "It's not a rebel song.", attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse ("Broken bottles under children's feet ..."), and added as a final note, [...] "If you don't like it, you let us know." [...] The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that [...] "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that [...] "We {{thought a lot about}} the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think that <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the audience's trust in us." [...] The band remained apprehensive, however.

One of them is Homer, who throws the book into the fireplace after Kent reveals that [...] "Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad." [...] In her book Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy, Bernice Murphy comments that this scene displays some of the most contradictory things about Jackson: [...] "It <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the visibility of Jackson's most notorious tale that more than 50 years after its initial creation it is still famous enough to warrant a mention in the world's most famous sitcom.
