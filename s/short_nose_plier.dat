Compared with whites, Asians tend to have a smaller amount of nasal cartilage, and the cartilage is much less firm. Asians also tend Background: Asians with <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> lack the cartilage needed to extend the length of the nose. A rhinoplasty technique using lower lateral cartilage (LLC) repositioning and ear cartilage grafting allows for sufficient nasal lengthening and nasal tip mobility in the correction of <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> in Asians. Methods: <b>Short</b> <b>nose</b> was classified into 3 subtypes: type I, II, or III. Dur-ing LLC repositioning, the LLC was separated from surrounding retaining structures, except at the footplate. The LLC was approximated medially and advanced with a Medpor strut. A silicone dorsal implant was inserted to suit the newly projected nasal tip. An ear cartilage onlay graft or ear car...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} {{having a}} <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> with a <b>short</b> septal length and/or severe columellar retraction, a septal extension graft {{is a good}} solution, as it allows the dome to move caudally and pushes down the columellar base. Fixing the medial crura of the alar cartilages to a septal extension graft leads to an uncomfortably rigid nasal tip and columella, and results in unnatural facial animation. Further, because of the relatively small and weak septal cartilage in the East Asian population, undercorrection of a <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> is not uncommon. To overcome these shortcomings, we have used the septal extension graft combined with a derotation graft. Among 113 patients who underwent the combined procedure, 82 patients had a <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> deformity alone; the remaining 31 patients had a <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> with columellar retraction. Thirty-two patients complained of nasal tip stiffness caused by a septal extension graft from previous operations. In addition to the septal extension graft, a derotation graft was used for bridging {{the gap between the}} alar cartilages and the septal extension graft for tip lengthening. Satisfactory results were obtained in 102 (90 %) patients. Eleven (10 %) patients required revision surgery. This combination method is a good surgical option for patients who have a <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> with small septal cartilages and do not have sufficient cartilage for tip lengthening by using a septal extension graft alone. It can also overcome the postoperative nasal tip rigidity of a septal extension graft...|$|R

40|$|Background: Asians with <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> {{lack the}} {{cartilage}} needed {{to extend the}} length of the nose. A rhinoplasty technique using lower lateral cartilage (LLC) repositioning and ear cartilage grafting allows for sufficient nasal lengthening and nasal tip mobility in the correction of <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> in Asians. Methods: <b>Short</b> <b>nose</b> was classified into 3 subtypes: type I, II, or III. During LLC repositioning, the LLC was separated from surrounding retaining structures, except at the footplate. The LLC was approximated medially and advanced with a Medpor strut. A silicone dorsal implant was inserted to suit the newly projected nasal tip. An ear cartilage onlay graft or ear cartilage extension graft was applied to further project and enhance the nasal tip and columella. Results: Of the 854 primary rhinoplasty procedures performed on Asian patients between January 2008 and December 2011, 295 were performed on patients with <b>short</b> <b>nose.</b> LLC repositioning and ear cartilage onlay grafting were performed on 228 patients. LLC repositioning and ear cartilage extension grafting with or without ear cartilage onlay grafting were performed on 67 patients. Short nasal tip, alar retraction, and columellar retraction were corrected. Wound dehiscence with marginal necrosis occurred in 7 patients. One patient developed nasal infection. Conclusions: LLC repositioning and ear cartilage grafting aid in the correction of <b>short</b> <b>nose</b> in Asians. With LLC repositioning and ear cartilage grafting, the nasal tip can be positioned in accordance with the patientâ€™s anatomic limits. The entire nasal tip and columella can be lengthened, while the tip maintains its mobility...|$|R
