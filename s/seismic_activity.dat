30|$|This review {{intends to}} provide {{detailed}} {{evidence of the}} reality of <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> in Africa; highlight some of the underlying factors responsible for their occurrence; report the level of intervention by various governments to address the issues of <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> in their domain; and recommend pro-active, cost effective and technically implementable structural design schemes which could be applied within Africa to reduce the effects of earthquakes and other <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> in the continent. The intention is to boost awareness of <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> in Africa, using a language that even non-technical experts can easily comprehend, as from hindsight, such people are better positioned in Africa than earth science experts to influence government commitment and policies to issues related to seismic threats and curtailment. Presently, there are sparsely available comprehensive literatures on the seismicity of Africa which matches the ambition and scope of the present review paper.|$|R

30|$|The {{review on}} the {{seismicity}} of Africa {{has shown that}} Africa is not only prone to <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> but {{the frequency of the}} occurrences has been on the rise {{at the turn of the}} century due to changing tectonic activities and increased human interaction with the earth surface.

40|$|Seismic hazard {{studies in}} regions of low and {{moderate}} <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> often {{resort to the}} use of attenuation relationships developed elsewhere but there are always doubts as to whether these imported relationships are representative of local conditions. Numerous well established stochastic attenuation models have also been developed for applications in Central and Eastern North America. However, such intraplate models could not be generalised across the globe to other regions of low and moderate <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> Modelling the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> can also be thwarted with difficulties because of the paucity of data. This paper presents the experiences of the authors in overcoming these challenges when undertaking seismic hazard studies in different countries. Topics covered in the paper include attenuation modelling and the evaluation of seismic hazards for the determination of the earthquake loading model for engineering design...|$|R
5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of <b>seismic</b> <b>activity,</b> the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high <b>seismic</b> <b>activity,</b> with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{urban areas}} of most {{countries}} in Africa are surrounded with reinforced concrete structures as an improvement to non-engineered structures (Adobe, mud) which {{are susceptible to}} damages from harsh climatic conditions and <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> Studies have however shown that these reinforced concrete buildings do not show total resistance to ground vibrations during earthquakes (Bourahla et al. 2008). In the Africa continent, most of the recent earthquakes {{have been reported to}} cause risks to the citizens ranging from slight to moderate damages to buildings, and this have resulted in temporary/permanent displacements (Manyele 2016). This implies that a great deal of effort is required to improve the seismic response of reinforced concrete buildings in parts of the continent which have shown considerable susceptibility to <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> Efforts have been made by some governments of African countries to publish regulations which would ultimately minimize the impact of the risks associated with <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> Some of these regulations/policies are discussed in the succeeding section.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} part of the MTL is called the MTL fault zone (Chūō Kōzōsen Dansōtai) which is an active fault and considered hazardous. It is separated into six regions defined by the most recent <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> Although the MTL is a less seismically active region than others, earthquakes with magnitudes of 6 to 7 have occurred. The oldest known activity occurred about 3000 years ago, and the most recent in the 16th century. It is expected that the <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> will continue in the future. The boundaries of the regions are still being discussed, so the regions are not well defined.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal <b>seismic</b> <b>activity</b> beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced {{by far the}} strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering {{a large number of}} aftershocks. Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of <b>seismic</b> <b>activity</b> for thousands of years. The event has led to the discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} <b>seismic</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the area}} had begun to increase. Increased {{fumarole}} activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E

Monitoring the activities of Papandayan volcano has been done using various methods both continously and periodically, one of them is deformation method using repeated GPS (Global Positioning System) survey. GPS survey method is basically used to obtain the pattern and speed of the deformation body of the volcano, both in horizontal and vertical directions and also could be used to determined the location and size of the strain source of deformation based on Mogi model. By describing the shallow <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> before and after the eruption, this could show us the correlation of deformation characteristic and its <b>seismic</b> <b>activities.</b> By the result of eight GPS campaigns show that the deformation acceleration is running rapidly, where the fluctuation of shallow <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> are directly followed by inflation and deflation of volcano body. Pressure source movement running up and down to southwest-northeast direction. This correlation will lead us to the more comprehensive phenomena of a volcanic eruption, especially in Papandayan volcano.  </p...|$|R

Both the a- and b-values of the frequency-magnitude distribution model, including the return period of earthquake magnitude {{in the range of}} 5. 0 - 6. 0 Mw, were evaluated spatially in a region that ex­tends 300 km from Laos. Six seismic source zones with different <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> were found. Based on these seismic source zones and a suitable attenuation model, seismic hazards were then analyzed in both deterministic and probabilistic scenarios. The deterministic map showed a possible maximum ground shaking up to 0. 4 g in Northern Laos, whereas the ground shaking calculated from the probabilistic ap­proach was 90, 70 - 90, and 20 - 40 %, respectively, and was higher in the northern part. From these <b>seismic</b> <b>activities</b> and hazard analyses, Laos can be clearly separated into the three hazard zones of north­western, northeastern and southern Laos with a high, medium and low earthquake hazard, respectively.

5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The <b>seismic</b> <b>activity</b> corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of <b>seismic</b> <b>activity</b> near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
