40|$|To {{know the}} {{accurate}} quantity of stored grain, grain density sensors {{must be used}} to measure the grain’s bulk density. However, multi-sensors should be inserted into the storage facility, to quickly collect data during the inventory checking of stored grain.

50|$|Zilog was {{the first}} company entirely {{dedicated}} to microprocessors started by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann in November 1974. F. Faggin was Zilog's President and CEO {{until the end of}} 1980 and he conceived and architected the Z80-CPU and its family of programmable peripheral components. He also co-designed the CPU whose project leader was M.Shima. The Z80-CPU was a major improvement over the 8080, yet it retained software compatibility with it. Much faster and with {{more than twice as many}} registers and instructions of the 8080, it was part of a family of components that included several intelligent peripherals (the Z80-PIO, a programmable parallel input-output controller; the Z80-CTC, a programmable counter-timer; the Z80-SIO, programmable <b>serial</b> <b>communications</b> <b>interface</b> controller, and the Z80-DMA, programmable direct memory access controller). This chip family allowed the design of powerful and low-cost microcomputers with performance comparable to minicomputers. The Z80-CPU had a substantially better bus structure and interrupt structure than the 8080 and could interface directly with dynamic RAM, since it included an internal memory-refresh controller. The Z80 was used in many of the early personal computers as well as in game consoles such as the ColecoVision and Game Boy. The Z80 is still in volume production in 2017 as a core microprocessor in various systems on a chip.|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 This thesis presents {{the design and}} test of a dual-modality cell stimulator. The stimulator generates pulsing electric and magnetic fields at programmable rates and intensities. The target application is the stimulation of bone and muscle cells. While electric and magnetic stimulators have been reported before, {{this is the first}} device that combines both modalities. The ability of the dual stimulation to target bone and muscle tissue simultaneously has the potential to improve the therapeutic treatment of osteoporosis and sarcopenia. The device is fully programmable and easy to use and can run from a battery or a power supply. In-vitro tests show a 4 % increase in protein synthesis 24 hours after the stimulation. These levels are comparable to heat shock stimulation.
