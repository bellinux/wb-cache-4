30|$|In ETO industries, and {{particularly}} in mould-making, the actual practice implies for delivery dates to be negotiated with the customer during quotation. This agreement, later on during the job dispatching phase, will dictate how the due dates for the order will be set.

Deviations in the expected delivery date of a mould can cause perturbations across the value chain and lead to <b>supplying</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> in the subsequent value-added phases of the customer, in the interlinked economy [55]. Therefore, it is utterly important for an SME to provide a customer with a solid estimation of when the mould will be available.

Another budding option is the reactivation of fallow land to grow energy crops and short rotation coppice for energy recovery. In the course of Germany’s bioeconomy program, which will switch the economy from a petro-based to a bio-based society, the prioritized utilization of bio-based resources should always be the hierarchically most valuable. Food and forage production are given preference over material recycling and extracting raw materials. Another driver is the growing consciousness of environmental issues and nature conservation which limits the available cultivatable area by law. As a result, there is a <b>supply</b> <b>bottleneck</b> of economically competitive feedstock for bioenergy. In this context, the interdisciplinary project {{is based on the}} systematic interconnection of applications to create utilization cascades. Methodical corrective measures of ComProSol focus on influencing fuel properties by preconditioning through substrate and additive compound blending, sieving and compacting, and integrating process optimization.

40|$|Background: The {{regeneration}} of cofactors and {{the supply}} of alkane substrate are key considerations for the biocatalytic activation of hydrocarbons by cytochrome P 450 s. This study focused on the biotransformation of n-octane to 1 -octanol using resting Escherichia coli cells expressing the CYP 153 A 6 operon, which includes the electron transport proteins ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase. Glycerol dehydrogenase was co-expressed with the CYP 153 A 6 operon to investigate the effects of boosting cofactor regeneration. In order to overcome the alkane <b>supply</b> <b>bottleneck,</b> various chemical and physical approaches to membrane permeabilisation were tested in strains with or without additional dehydrogenase expression. Results: Dehydrogenase co-expression in whole cells did not improve product formation and reduced {{the stability of the}} system at high cell densities. Chemical permeabilisation resulted in initial hydroxylation rates that were up to two times higher than the whole cell system, but severely impacted biocatalyst stability. Mechanical cell breakage led to improved enzyme stability, but additional dehydrogenase expression was necessary to improve product formation. The best-performing system (in terms of final titres) consisted of mechanically ruptured cells expressing additional dehydrogenase. This system had an initial activity of 1. 67 ± 0. 12 U/gDCW (32 % improvement on whole cells) and attained a product concentration of 34. 8 ± 1. 6 mM after 24 h (22 % improvement on whole cells). Furthermore, the system was able to maintain activity when biotransformation was extended to 72 h, resulting in a final product titre of 60. 9 ± 1. 1 mM. Conclusions: This study suggests that CYP 153 A 6 in whole cells is limited by coupling efficiencies rather than cofactor supply. However, the most significant limitation in the current system is hydrocarbon transport, with substrate import being the main determinant of hydroxylation rates, and product export playing a key role in system stability...|$|R

The five-year-plan first instituted the division of farming communities up into communes The Chinese National Programme for Agricultural Development(NPAD) began to accelerate their drafting plans for the countries industrial and agricultural outputs. The draft plans were initially successful as the Great Leap Forwards divided up the Chinese workforce and production soared (albeit briefly). Eventually the planners developed even more ambitious goals, such as replacing the draft plans for 1962 with those for 1967, and the industries developed <b>supply</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> and could not meet the growth demands. Rapid industrial development came in turn with a swelling of urban populations. In 1959 due to the furthering of collectivization, heavy industry production and the stagnation of the farming industry that did not keep up with the demands of population growth in combination with a year of unfortunate weather in farming areas, only 170 million tons of grain were produced, far below what the population needed. Mass starvation ensued, and was only made worse by 1960, as even less grain was produced at 144 million tons. The government instituted rationing, but between 1958 and 1962 it is thought that around 10 million people died of starvation alone. The famine did not go unnoticed, Mao was fully aware of the major famine sweeping the countryside but rather than try to fix the problem, he blamed it on counterrevolutionaries who were “hiding and dividing grain…” [...] Mao even symbolically decided to abstain from eating meat in honor of those who were suffering.|$|E

An entrepreneurial firm with limited financial resources can then focus on <b>supplying</b> superior <b>bottleneck</b> modules, and while outsourcing and allowing complementors to supply non-bottleneck components. I show that a firm pursuing this strategy will have a higher return on invested capital (ROIC) than competitors with a less modular, closed architecture.

Sir George Buchanan, the engineer who managed the port of Rangoon in Burma visited Basra in late 1915 and described a scene of utter chaos. Buchanan reported to London: [...] "I had never before in my life seen such a hopeless mess and muddle and I wondered whether this was the usual accompaniment of war. It seemed incredible that we should have been in operation of Basra for over a year, yet so little had been done in the intervening time". Basra was not a modern port, but rather an anchorage besides the banks of the Shatt-al-Arab river beyond which was a vast swamp. At any given movement, there was a line of 14 ships waiting to unload their cargos at Basra and it took an average of six weeks for a ship to unload its cargo at Basra in 1915. Buchanan further reported that Nixon was such an utterly inept general that he did not see the inefficient way in which the port of Basra was being run as a problem, and told Buchanan that his expertise at managing the port of Rangoon was not needed here in Basra. It was largely the logistical problems posed by the mismanagement of Basra that doomed the relief expeditions sent out to save Townshend and his men at Kut. In February-March 1916 a number of new divisions arrived at Basra, but the <b>supply</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> at Basra meant the British were unable to deploy them in the relief of Kut. [...] Nixon's efforts to hinder any attempt to build modern port facilities such as cranes for unloading goods off ships were a major reason why he was sacked in early 1916. Furthermore, Nixon was told that the steamers that he needed to transport men and supplies up the Tigris would be available in March 1916 at the earliest.|$|E

40|$|A notable {{development}} {{in recent years}} in Pakistan's economic scene has been the sharp pickup in the rate of inflation. In particular, Pakistan has experienced sustained inflation (changes in the CPI) hovering between 11. 0 to 13. 0 percent range during the last three years (1993 - 94 to 1995 - 96). The persistence of inflation at double-digit rates over the three successive years has attracted considerable attention of academics and policy-makers.

Recent studies on inflation in Pakistan broadly agree on the key factors influencing the rate of inflation, namely, the growth in money supply, the <b>supply</b> side <b>bottlenecks,</b> the adjustment in government-administered prices, the imported inflation (exchange rate adjustment), escalations in indirect taxes, and inflationary expectations.

A comprehensive methodology based on various indicators is {{used to determine the}} EU’s resilience to <b>supply</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> along the complete supply chain – from raw materials to final components manufacturing. The results revealed that, in 2015, the EU had low resilience to <b>supply</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> for dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and graphite, medium resilience to supply of indium, silver, silicon, cobalt and lithium and high resilience to supply of carbon fibre composites. In the worst case scenario where no mitigation measures are adopted, the materials list with supply issues will grow until 2030. Indium, silver, cobalt and lithium will add up to the 2015 list. However, the probability of material supply shortages for these three low-carbon technologies might diminish by 2030 as a result of mitigation measures considered in the present analysis, i. e. increasing the EU raw materials production, adoption of recycling and substitution.

The government has designed several fiscal policies, including reducing the fuel subsidy. The study objective is to analyse the impact of reducing fuel subsidy on macroeconomic variables, agricultural sector, and income distribution. The modification on the basic model, which is a recursive-dynamic CGE model, is made in this study. The data used in the model is of the Indonesian I-O Table 2000, The Indonesian Social Accounting Matrix 2000, National Household Survey data and parameter from some other sources. The {{results show that the}} reduction in fuel price subsidy tends to increase prices of industrial outputs that highly depend on fuel, such as transportation and fishery sectors. In contrast, the change in fuel price does not influence the price of paddy. Wage of skilled labor, land rent, and capital rent decline steadily in response to the change in fuel price. Households will lose their income following the reduction in fuel subsidy, which then decreases the welfare of households. Incomes are not evenly distributed within the society (household groups). An increased fuel price at consumer level declines the Indonesian real GDP. The government should give the compensation of reducing the fuel subsidy directly to the poor people.

The recent surge in the GCC countries’ inflation rates that coincided with depreciation of the currencies of these countries due to the depreciation of the US dollar, has led to increasing public pressure for an upward revaluation or even a de-peg from the US dollar to an exchange rate regime that will ensure higher price stability. Accordingly, this thesis was put forth to provide a scientific opinion of the viability of the existing US dollar peg in the GCC countries, by focusing on the link between changes in exchange rate and inflation. To this end, the study attempted to assess the risk to the domestic inflation rates of the GCC countries arising from fluctuations of the US dollar against the currencies of the major trading partners of these economies. Based on a thorough review of the relevant literature, some empirical estimations were carried out using some econometric methods, and it was discovered that the amount of pass-through or impact from changes in exchange rates to inflation rates in the GCC economies is incomplete and moderate, with an average of around 23 % in the long-run. Furthermore, an average long-run pass-through of around 23 % does not signify a high risk from fluctuations in the foreign exchange market for domestic prices in the GCC countries. In other words, the volatility of exchange rates of the currencies of the GCC countries does not necessitate the adjustment of the money supply in these economies. These findings lent further support to the relevancy of the existing fixed exchange rate regime for maintaining stable inflation in the economies of the GCC countries. The findings were also supported by the performance of the GCC economies over the past two decades, despite some periods of dollar fluctuations. A retrospective analysis indicates that on average, inflation has been stable in the region over the past two decades. The study provided evidence for the important role of the fiscal policies of the GCC countries in affecting the recent impact from exchange rate to inflation rate in these economies, which suggests that these policies form a key macroeconomic tool in these countries, particularly ii given the lost independence of the monetary policy under the existing pegged exchange rate regimes. Moreover, the study suggests lowering the influence of fiscal policies on the link between exchange rate and domestic prices, or inflation in general, in the GCC countries by pursuing gradual steps toward domestic development in the economy, particularly given the limited absorptive capacity of these economies due to the shortage in <b>supply</b> <b>bottleneck.</b> The study was also extended to identify the potential alternative exchange rate regime if the GCC changed their focus from inflation to other, evolving, national objectives like international competitiveness. Based on the existing literature and the optimum currency theory, the study suggests that the GCC countries should consider moving gradually from their current single peg toward a more flexible exchange rate in order to avoid abrupt change that would disturb the existing market credibility. As an initial step, the study recommends moving toward a basket peg of two currencies, namely the US dollar and the Euro, that account for a large share of the GCC economies’ international trade and non-trade financial transactions. Finally, the study also concluded that an upward revaluation as a remedy for the recent inflationary development is an unsatisfactory solution, particularly if the same set of circumstances continued into the future. If this was the case, then the process would have to be repeated again, thus triggering the possibility of speculation attack...|$|R
