5000|$|An <b>order</b> to <b>show</b> <b>cause,</b> {{is a type}} {{of court}} order that {{requires}} {{one or more of the}} parties to a case to justify, explain, or prove something to the court. Courts commonly use <b>orders</b> to <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> when the judge needs more information before deciding whether or not to issue an order requested by one of the parties. For example, if a party requests that the court find another party in contempt of an existing court order, the judge will typically issue an [...] "Order to <b>Show</b> <b>Cause</b> Re Contempt" [...] to the party accused of being in contempt of court. At the hearing on the <b>order</b> to <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> concerning contempt the judge will take evidence from both sides concerning the alleged failure to comply with the court order. Appellate courts often issue <b>orders</b> to <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> to lower courts requesting that the lower court explain why the appellant should not be granted the relief requested by the writ or appeal. An <b>order</b> to <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> is always an interim order (because it is never the first nor the final action in a legal action).|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a very small amount of Ga into Au contact metallization on InP is shown {{to have a significant}} effect on both the metallurgical and electrical behavior of that contact system. Ga atoms in the interstices of the Au lattice are shown to be effective in preventing the solid state reactions that normally take place between Au and InP during contact sintering. In addition to suppressing the metallurgical interaction, the presence of small amounts of Ga is <b>shown</b> to <b>cause</b> an <b>order</b> of magnitude reduction in the specific contact resistivity. Evidence is presented that the reactions of GaP and GaAs with Au contacts are also drastically affected by the presence of Ga. The sintering behavior of the Au-GaP and the Au-GaAs systems (as contrasted with that of the Au-InP system) is explained as due to the presence of interstitial Ga in the contact metallization. Finally the large, two-to-three order of magnitude drop in the contact resistance that occurs in the Au-InP system upon sintering at 400 degrees Centigrade is shown to be a result of the formation of an Au (sub 2) P (sub 3) layer at the metal-semiconductor interface. Contact resistivities in the 10 (sup - 6) ohm square centimeter range are obtained for as-deposited Au on InP when a thin (20 Angstrom) layer of Au (sub 2) P (sub 3) is introduced between the InP and the Au contacts...|$|R

On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.|$|E
5000|$|The GSIS-Meralco {{case is a}} {{political}} controversy and pending legal case being heard by the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

50|$|In 1942 the New York Court of Appeals {{affirmed the}} {{convictions}} of the notorious Louis Buchalter {{and his two}} associates Emanuel Weiss and Louis Capone under a sharply divided decision of the judges, who filed four opinions. The death sentences were upheld {{by a vote of}} 4-3. (People v.

In 1943 the United States Supreme Court granted Buchalter's petition to review the case and in a full opinion affirmed the conviction, 7-0, with two justices abstaining. (319 U.S. 427 (1943)) Finally, Judge Lehman signed a <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> <b>order</b> in 1944 because the counsel for the trio had appeared before Governor Thomas E. Dewey in a clemency plea, and Lehman eventually delayed the execution of the condemned men. Even so, the clemency plea was denied by Governor Dewey.

5000|$|Additionally, in {{particularly}} egregious {{cases of}} rules violations, coaches, athletic directors, and athletic support staff can {{be barred from}} working for any NCAA member school without permission from the NCAA.

Theoretically, a school can hire someone with a [...] "show cause" [...] on their record during the time the <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> <b>order</b> is in effect only with permission from the NCAA Infractions Committee. The school assumes the risks and stigma of hiring such a person. It may then end up being sanctioned by the NCAA and the Infractions Committee for their choice, possibly losing athletic scholarships, revenue from schools who would not want to compete with that other school, and the ability for their games to be televised, along with restrictions on recruitment and practicing times.

5000|$|The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide {{employees}} {{claimed to}} have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.

Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.

5000|$|On April 15, 2014 Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, his {{response}} to <b>show</b> <b>cause</b> <b>order</b> for Cornealious Anderson v.

Koster wrote in the legal filing that [...] "The United States Supreme Court has upheld much more severe sentences for much less serious crimes" [...] and suggested that Anderson should instead file a petition with the Missouri Department of Corrections for 11.5 years credit for {{the time he was}} not in prison: Anderson is in the wrong form of action and the wrong venue for the relief granted in Anderson v. Crawford. Rule 91 habeas corpus actions are generally limited to suits seeking immediate discharge from confinement, and the director of a department may only be sued in Cole County. But if Anderson re-files this matter as a declaratory judgment action and names the Director as the defendant, the Director consents to venue in this Court. If this Court accepts the facts as set out in this pleading, the Director takes no position on whether this Court should declare Anderson entitled to credit on his sentence from the time the opinion issued in his direct appeal. If the Court grants time served from the issuance of the opinion in 2002, Anderson would have served his 11.5-year mandatory-minimum prison term under Mo. Rev. Stat. 558.019 and 571.015 and be immediately eligible for parole consideration. pp. 5-6 [...] Patrick Megaro, Anderson's attorney, replied that what is cruel and unusual is not the length of the sentence but delay in implementing the sentence due to errors by the Missouri Department of Corrections. Megaro also didn't [...] "think that’s a legally viable optionKoster's suggest legal course of action ...The law is very clear, you don’t get credit for time served in jail when you’re out on bail." ...|$|E
