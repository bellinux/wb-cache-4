5|$|Sewage {{treatment}} works depend {{for their}} ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. Respiration may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow <b>sand</b> <b>filter.</b> Anaerobic digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative sewage {{treatment}} processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing methane gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow <b>sand</b> <b>filter,</b> employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main types; rapid (gravity) <b>sand</b> <b>filters,</b> upward flow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> and slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters.</b> All three methods are used {{extensively}} in the water industry throughout the world. The first two {{require the use of}} flocculant chemicals to work effectively while slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> can produce very high quality water free from pathogens, taste and odour without the need for chemical aids. <b>Sand</b> <b>filters</b> can, apart from being used in water treatment plants, be used for water purification in singular households as they use materials which are available for most people.|$|R

25|$|Permanent water {{chlorination}} began in 1905, when a faulty slow <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> and a contaminated water supply {{led to a}} serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England. Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.|$|E
25|$|The first {{experiments}} {{into water}} filtration {{were made in}} the 17th century. Sir Francis Bacon attempted to desalinate sea water by passing the flow through a <b>sand</b> <b>filter.</b> Although his experiment did not succeed, it marked {{the beginning of a new}} interest in the field. The fathers of microscopy, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke, used the newly invented microscope to observe for the first time small material particles that lay suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} piped water system in Japan was {{completed}} in 1887 in the port city Yokohama, using surface water treated by a <b>sand</b> <b>filter.</b> By 1900, seven cities had piped water supply and by 1940 about {{one third of the}} population was connected to piped water systems. The incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid remained high until after the Second World War when disinfection was introduced by the Americans and became mandatory in 1957. Through the increase of piped water supply, disinfection and sanitation the incidence of waterborne diseases dropped sharply during the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other {{filtration}} methods, slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> use {{biological processes}} {{to clean the}} water, and are non-pressurized systems. Slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> do not require chemicals or electricity to operate.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of raw water {{treatment}} {{for use in the}} petrochemical industry, {{one of the most important}} treatments is the filtration process with process <b>sand</b> <b>filters.</b> A by-product of the filtration process of raw water is wastewater. The wastewater results from the technological process of backwashing process <b>sand</b> <b>filters.</b> Wastewater from backwashing <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> is unsuitable for further use, since it is contaminated with residual suspended matter and chemical compounds that are added in {{the process of}} raw water clarification. To reduce the environmental impact of such wastewater and improve overall system processing of raw water, this paper presents the technological treatment of wastewater from backwashing process <b>sand</b> <b>filters.</b> The selected technological process with subsequent sedimentation of suspended matter from the wastewater enables it to be returned into the process stream. This paper also presents a wastewater treatment system, which consists of a concrete sedimentation tank, pumps, pipelines, and flocculator for the final acceptance of the wastewater. The treatment system of wastewater from backwashing process <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> includes the wastewater from backwashing <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> for the filtration of the clarified water after clarification of the raw water, <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> for the filtration of the cooling water and <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> for filtration of clarified water prior to ion decarbonatisation. The overall technological process is efficiently sized and fully automated. The treatment of wastewater from backwashing process <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> allows the successful and continuous return of the water in a volume flow, Q, from 80 m 3 h - 1 to 85 m 3 h - 1, with no negative impact on the clarification of raw water. The constructed technological solution resulted in 12 -percent less use of raw water from the Pakra accumulation lake, as well as 50 -percent less discharge of the wastewater into natural watercourses...|$|R
50|$|These <b>filters</b> use <b>sand</b> as the <b>filtering</b> medium. <b>Sand</b> <b>filters</b> {{look like}} large balls and they hold hundred {{of pounds of}} sterile sand. Water flows {{into the top of}} the filter housing and makes its way down through the sand bed where the sharp edges of the sand catch the particulates. On a micron-to-micron comparison, <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> remove the least amount of dirt - {{particles}} as small as 20 to 25 microns. However, <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> certainly are efficient enough to keep just about any pool clean.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} type of filter is a rapid <b>sand</b> <b>filter.</b> Water moves {{vertically}} through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.|$|E

2500|$|A {{specific}} [...] "large-scale" [...] form of slow <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> is {{the process}} of bank filtration, in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration.

2500|$|The {{location}} {{of this building}} {{is directly related to}} the river from which it pumped water. [...] A simple filter was built into the East Fork of the White River in 1903 and directed water into a cistern 10 feet in diameter and 35 feet deep.

2500|$|Slow {{sand filters}} {{may be used}} where there is {{sufficient}} land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.|$|E
