However, her stay in the city was short because of the {{allergic}} reaction and she moved back to Los Angeles. While performing in musicals, Gaven had to be protective of her vocal cords and this affected her personal life. She told Miller in 1997 that [...] "you have to give up so much of your life", and gave the example that when [...] "somebody coughs behind me [...] I immediately <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> husband, 'We may have to move.'" [...] She also had to avoid shouting. Gaven is currently married to Seth Gaven who owns AV Squad, a film marketing company.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2000, Stern's last live {{radio show}} of the year, he {{announced}} the signing of his new contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue his show for five years after four months of negotiations. Forbes estimated his new earnings ranged between $17 million and $20 million a year. Stern spoke at The Concert for New York City in October 2001 in a hazmat suit with his buttocks exposed {{in a similar fashion}} to his 1992 MTV Music Video Awards appearance. In November 2001, Stern's production company had begun development on a weekly television sitcom titled Kane for CBS, originally intended to replace The Howard Stern Radio Show following its cancellation, with Ron Zimmerman as the writer of its pilot episode. Its premise followed [...] "an oddball southern family and its strong-willed patriarch. The lead character's life is altered when his previously long-lost wife returns home to him and their group of eccentric children". The project was cancelled before the filming stage. In late 2002, Stern acquired the rights to the comedy films Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) and Porky's (1982) with Arclight Films. He expressed a wish to use a remake of the former as a launchpad for an unknown band. Under the deal, Stern was served as executive producer and was allowed to place [...] "Howard Stern Presents" [...] in the titles. He reasoned, [...] "If I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> ... <b>my</b> audience, this is 'Howard Stern Presents', it means something to them ... it's going to be crazy. It means that it's going to be different, and they know I'm not going to be giving them any schlock." [...] Development for Porky's came to a halt in 2011 following legal action regarding the ownership of the film's rights.|$|E
