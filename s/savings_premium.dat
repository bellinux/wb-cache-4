We analyse real decisions on retirement savings by using qualitative data. This allows us to examine how different, perceived decision-making criteria have led to actual investment decisions by {{taking into account the}} context in which such decisions are made. Our main results are as follows. We find evidence that taxes do not matter much. Financial planning for retirement consists of saving discretionary income instead of the required <b>savings</b> <b>premium</b> and choosing a secure type of investment which yields more than a savings book. Savers do not base their decisions on calculating and comparing rates of return or tax benefits. Instead, we find strong influences of relatively unqualified relatives, bank clerks and the desire for security. Thus, the financial outcome is strongly linked with the decision-making context and decision-making processes.

40|$|Purpose – Research to {{date has}} {{reported}} ambiguous results {{on the influence of}} tax concessions on retirement savings decisions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the influence of tax concessions on private retirement investment decisions by analyzing actual retirement decision processes and the rationales behind these decisions in-depth. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative semi-structured interviews on actual retirement savings decisions were conducted with private investors (17) and their respective bank advisors (5). Decision-making rationales are analysed by means of semantic and causal coding of verbal data as well as by highlighting the complexities of decision processes represented in individual investment narratives. Findings – Results indicate that taxes do not matter much, neither during the decision to join a private retirement plan, nor when choosing a specific investment product. Financial planning for retirement consists of saving disposable income instead of the required <b>savings</b> <b>premium</b> and choosing a secure type of investment which yields more than a savings account. Savers do not base their decisions on calculating and comparing rates of return or tax benefits. Instead, comparatively unqualified relatives as well as bank advisors and the desire for trust and security are of major relevance. Research limitations/implications – The generalization of results is limited in so far as they refer to a relatively small interview sample. The study shall thus prompt further research that takes the decision-making context and the interrelation between several context factors systematically into account. Originality/value – The study is of value in that it highlights the difficulties private investors' experience when making actual – rather than hypothetical – retirement savings decisions and the rationales behind seemingly “imperfect” decisions. It shows that retirement savings decisions are heavily linked with the social decision-making context. These results are closely linked to the recent debate on “responsibilization”, critical perspectives on the tendency of states to hold individuals increasingly accountable for aspects of market governance and social security.

Insurance is reciprocal {{settlement of}} many subjects endangered {{in the same}} way, whilst the endargement is random by its character and can be evaluated. The very essence of the insurance is to form money fund consisting of payments and premiums of the risk community partners and pay out the insuree the premium or the agreed sum for the damage suffered. Life insurance is {{a special kind of}} insurance with particular characteristics not shared with other insurances. Only life insurance is longterm and economical, whereas the insured sum of money gets always paid out to the insurance holder. Therefore the insurance policy is as valuable as securities, and may also have the guarantee function. Also, the life insurance is an important source for investments with signifi cant profit. The insurance company place out the financial means of the people, which represent the <b>savings</b> <b>premium,</b> and that is mathematical reserve, onto the financial market. Mathematical reserve are temporarily free means of the risk community, insurer means, managed by the insurance company. This obliges insurer to form investment portfolio which will realize added contributions. That is why the strategy for managing mathematical reserve is crucial factor in managing, creating stability and survival of the insurance company. Namely, all insurance companies have the same terms of management and parameter values for net premium calculation and insurance cost price. This means that business results of {{each and every one of}} them derive from the quality of the mathematical reserve investment portfolio. Marketing mix is a modern tool of business policy of an insurance company that functions within market conditions. This strategy is particularly important for the management of the companies that belong to the full competition market activity. All this makes the marketing mix strategy unavoidable in insurance business, especially that of life insurance. It is less essential and needed in compulsory insurance, such as, liability insurance, for instance. In theory and practice the marketing mix strategy includes a product price, promotion and distribution channels. We state and conclude: in life insurance business the added and equally important element of the marketing mix is to invest temporarily free financial means, that is, mathematical reserve of life insurance. Profit, out of these investments, increases the life insurance risk community funds. This provides for the decrease of prices, premiums, insurance, thus increasing competitiveness on the life insurance market. The investment quality, and investment model which is used to optimize the investment portfolio, significantly influence the premium competitiveness and total insurance company business, as well as its survival on the life insurance market. This conclusion is supported by the investigation results of the Croatia osiguranje d. d., Ljubuški business. The data shows a remarkable business competitiveness of this insurer on the life insurance market, secured by its qualitative management of the mathematical reserve...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes two dynamic capital allocation {{methods of}} hedging foreign exchange risks of payables denominated in foreign currencies. One strategy is synthetic call option strategy based on currency pricing formula; the other strategy is constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategy based on linear rule. Monte Carlo simulation {{is used to}} test the performance of the strategies. For synthetic call option strategy, the effect of changing initial wealth on saving performance and hedging performance is revealed. I find that increasing initial wealth can improve both saving performance and hedging performance of synthetic call option strategy. For CPPI strategy, extensive combinations of initial wealth cases and multiples are tested. I find that different multiples change the distribution pattern of CPPI strategy dramatically. In general, bigger multiples will reduce the hedging performance but as long as the multiple is smaller than 21, the floor level can always be protected. Because of effect of changing multiples on saving performance of CPPI is complicated, I propose <b>saving</b> <b>premium</b> at risk and minimum saving ratio to seek the optimal multiple for each initial wealth case. The performance comparisons between synthetic call option strategy and CPPI strategy show that CPPI strategy dominates the competitor in terms of hedging performance while synthetic call option strategy has better saving performance on average. I find that the CPPI strategy is more attractive to hedgers if foreign currency is expected to appreciate while the synthetic call option strategy is more attractive if foreign currency is expected to depreciate. I propose a method to improve the hedging performance of synthetic call option strategy and find that it cannot be used if initial wealth is not sufficient enough...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Considering the {{popularity}} of the <b>premium</b> <b>savings</b> certificate (PSC) of the National Savings Bank of Malaysia (Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN)) the paper aims to justify the Shari'ah compliancy of this product by analyzing its underlying contracts and to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate, if the current practice is invalid in the Shari'ah. Design/methodology/approach – Inductive methodology is first used to obtain a basic understanding of this product and the characteristics of Shari'ah approved contracts as well as the views of the jurists. Interviewing method is also used to acquire first-hand information when the inductive method is not sufficient. Afterwards, an analytical approach is adopted to justify the validity of this contract with the Shari'ah principles. Finally, an innovative methodology is used to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate. Findings – The paper argues that the underlying contract used in PSC violates the conditions of wadi'ah contract, as in wadi'ah, the bank is not allowed to spend the money for investment, but in practice, BSN uses the money for investment. Therefore, the underlying contract in PSC turns into qard (loan) contract. Since the scholars unanimously declare that giving any kind of benefit like prizes to the creditor is riba, then PSC is considered as invalid according to the Shari'ah. On the other hand, although PSC might seem like gambling, it is different from gambling as the prizes given to PSC are from a third party. The paper proposes implementing mudarabah contract in PSC where the bank is allowed to invest according to its interest and the depositors share the profit and loss but the huge fluctuation of profit and loss could be shrunk by a special fund method. Originality/value – In particular, it attracts the attention of BSN management to change their product's features. In general, it discovers a non-Shari'ah compliant feature of savings certificates and outlines the feature of a Shari'ah compliant saving certificate for the practitioners of Islamic banking all over the world.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine if the return is higher for active savers than fornon-active savers in the Swedish premium pension system. The {{timeframe}} {{of the study is}} 2001 – 2009 and it is presumed that the pension saver only makes one choice of funds in the Swedish premium pension system and then keeps these. No regard has been taken to the different fees associated with funds and the management of them.

The study was conductedby comparing the average return of the Swedish <b>premium</b> <b>savings</b> fund with the average return of three different fund portfolios with different risk levels recommended by Morningstar. The study shows that those who place their savings in the recommended fund portfolios receive a higher return in two out of three fund portfolios.

40|$|Current crop {{insurance}} {{is designed to}} mitigate monetary fluctuations resulting from yield losses for a specific year. However, yield realization tendency can vary {{from year to year}} and may depend on the correlation of yield realizations across years. When the current sin-gle-year Yield Protection (YP) and Area Risk Protection Insurance (ARPI) contracts are extended to multiple periods, actuarially fair premium rate is expected to decrease as poor yield realizations in a year can be offset by another year’s better yield realizations. In this study, we first use simulations to demonstrate how significant <b>premium</b> <b>savings</b> are possible when coverage is based on the sum of yields across years rather than on a year-by-year basis. We then describe the design of a multi-year framework of {{crop insurance}} and model the insurance using a copula approach. Insurance terms are extended to {{more than a year and}} the premium, liability, and indemnity are determined by a multi-year term. Moreover, partial payment is provided at the end of each term to offset the possibility of significant loss in a single term. County-level data obtained from the U. S.

The proposed multi-year plan would benefit farmers by offering insurance guarantees across years for significantly lower costs...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is {{a common}} and very costly chronic disease. There is broad-based {{agreement}} on how to manage diabetes, yet less than 40 % of adults with diabetes achieve guideline-recommended levels of medical care. We investigate {{the reasons for this}} phenomenon by examining the business case for improved diabetes care {{from the perspective of a}} single health plan (HealthPartners of Minnesota). The potential benefits accruing to a health plan from diabetes disease management include medical care cost <b>savings</b> and higher <b>premiums.</b> The potential costs to the health plan derive from disease management program costs and adverse selection. We find that the implemen-tation of diabetes disease management coincided with large health improvements. For a defined population of diabetes patients, medical care cost savings over several years were small in the closed panel medical group but moderate for the health plan overall. We find evidence that adverse selection and the timing of cost and benefits worsen the health plan business case. In addition, the payment systems, from purchaser to health plan and health plan to provider, are very weakly con-nected to the quality of diabetes care, further weakening the business case. Finally, overlapping provider networks create a public goods externality that limits the health plan’s ability to privatel...|$|R

Majority of MFI borrowers are poor and illiterate and they are not expected to understand and realise various financial jargons used by MFIs and their effective cost.

Hiding effective interest rate to poor and illiterate borrowers by using “creative ” accounting practices is highly unethical. Many MFIs simply state that they charge only 15 % flat rate of interest.

40|$|This paper {{estimated}} {{the effects of}} tort law and insurer investment returns on physician malpractice insurance premiums. Data were collected on tort law from 1991 through 2004, and multivariate regression models, including fixed effects for state and year, were used to estimate the effect of changes in tort law on medical malpractice premiums. The premium consequences of national policy changes were simulated. The analysis found that {{the introduction of a}} new damage cap lowered malpractice premiums for internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology by 17. 3 %, 20. 7 %, and 25. 5 %, respectively. Lowering damage caps by $ 100, 000 reduced premiums by 4 %. Statutes of repose also resulted in lower premiums. No other tort law changes had the effect of lowering premiums.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{probabilistic}} protocol (COKE) to allow two wireless communicating parties to commit over-the-air (OTA) on a shared secret, even {{in the presence of}} a globally eavesdropping adversary. The proposed solution leverages no crypto but just plaintext message exchange. Indeed, the security of the solution relies on the difficulty for the adversary to correctly identify, for each one-bit transmission, the sender of that bit—not its value, which is indeed exchanged in cleartext. Due to the low requirements of COKE (essentially, the capability to send a few wireless messages), it is particularly suited to resource constrained wireless devices (e. g. WNSs, wireless embedded systems), as well as for those scenarios where just energy <b>saving</b> is at <b>premium,</b> such as smartphones. For instance—under a security challenging setting—it is possible for the two parties to commit, with a probability greater than (1 − 2 − 48), on a 128 secret bits key exchanging as few as 1, 300 one-bit messages. Under less stressing conditions, establishing a 128 secret bits key with the same probability requires just as few as 300 one-bit messages. The security parameters (that is, secret-key length and its establishment probability) are adjustable: they can be agreed between the two parties for each key establishment session. A thorough analysis characterizing the security of the protocol, its robustness to packet loss, and energy consumption is provided. Finally, extensive simulations results support the quality and viability of the proposal. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal per$ormance {{evaluation}} scheme of a supervisor who monitors a worker {{in a setting}} where the worker can collude with the supervisor. We study the setting where the supervisor’s incentive problem results from collusion, not from work aversion. In the owner-supervisor-worker structure, the supervisor monitors the worker’s effort and reports to the owner. The owner evaluates the worker based on the supervisor’s report and imposes less risk on the worker, <b>saving</b> the risk <b>premium</b> to him. To prevent collusion between the supervisor and the worker, the owner must hold the supervisor responsible for the worker’s peiformance, paying risk premium to the supervisor. Examples show that the owner prefers the owner-supervisor-worker structure to the owner-worker structure when the worker is very risk averse relative to the su-pervisor. Examples also show that if the supervisor and the worker can make side transfers for risk sharing {{as well as for}} collusion, the owner might prefer the owner-supervisor-worker structure only when the super-visor’s risk aversion is neither too great nor too small. When the super-visor is close to risk neutral, either his limited liability or high reservation utility makes it too costly to hire him. The subcontracting structure where the supervisor is delegated to contract with the worker is shown to be pe~ormance quivalent to the owner-supervisor-worker structure. In the subcontracting, the supervisor’s direct control on the worker’s compen-sation plays the same role that the supervisor’s report does in the three-tier hierarchy. 1...|$|R
40|$|Air filter {{manufacturers}} have recently begun marketing premium air filters that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops. This is accomplished with proprietary filter designs incorporating {{at least twice}} the media surface area of traditional filters. 1 The increased media reduces the initial pressure drop of air filters while dramatically increasing their dust holding capacity. In addition, their useful lives are extended and prefilter use may be eliminated. Physical principals governing airflow in fan systems predict available energy <b>savings</b> from using <b>premium</b> air filters. This energy savings may offset the additional cost of the premium filters. In fact, premium filter investments can payback in six months to three years depending on airflow and number of hours of fan operation.

40|$|HSA CONTRIBUTION LIMITS: Health savings {{accounts}} (HSAs) are often {{touted as a}} vehicle for funding future retiree health care costs. However, statutory contribution limits mean that they are unlikely to play more than a minor part in savings for health care costs in retirement. POSSIBLE ACCUMULATIONS AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES: If an individual age 55 in 2009 were to contribute $ 3, 000 to his or her HSA and also contribute the $ 1, 000 catch-up contribution each year for 10 years, $ 48, 300 would be in the account after 10 years at a 2 percent interest rate. And if the interest rates was 5 percent, $ 55, 100 would be accumulated at the end of 10 years. NEEDED HEALTH SAVINGS: Such savings levels by themselves are inadequate to cover health costs in retirement. A man age 55 in 2009 would need between $ 144, 000 –$ 290, 000 {{by the time he reached}} age 65 in 2019 (depending upon his use of prescription drugs in retirement) to have a 50 percent chance of being able to cover premiums and out-ofpocket expenses for Medigap and Medicare Part D. Thus, a 55 -year-old man would be able to use an HSA to accumulate between 16 – 32 percent of needed <b>savings</b> for insurance <b>premiums</b> and out-of-pocket expenses in retirement for a 50 − 50 chance of having enough savings.

40|$|The {{sum insured}} of insured assets {{is one of}} the basic {{significant}} characteristics of insurance policy quality and is the ceiling amount of insurance benefit {{in the case of an}} insured loss. It {{is one of the}} parameters specified in the policy and affects the premium amount. The sum insured relates to the insured value of the asset. It is the highest possible loss which can occur to an insured loss and it is decisive for determining the sum insured. The policy holder determines the sum insured so that it corresponds to the insured value of the insured asset at the time of insurance policy signing. The policy holder is fully liable for setting the sum insured. The aim of this paper was to analyze the quality of the underwritten insurance according to the determined sum insured. Source data for the paper included critical analysis of literature based on valid Czech legislation and on general terms and conditions of insurance of individual insurance companies. The paper contains an analysis and comparison of types of insured values of assets for insurance needs on the Czech insurance market. An induction method applied to a real-life insurance case was used for explanation of the relationship between the sum insured and paid-out insurance benefit. The paper clarifies the significance and characteristics of the sum insured in the Czech Republic. The conclusion is that viewing insurance only from the angle of the premium amount is completely incorrect. <b>Savings</b> on the <b>premium</b> at the expense of reduction of the sum insured implies a risk of not renewing company operations or a living in a family house in case of an insured loss. ...|$|R

40|$|The Agricultural Risk Protection Act (ARPA) {{has largely}} met its {{objectives}} of inducing farmers {{to increase their}} use of the crop insurance program. Both insured acreage and coverage levels have increased dramatically in response to ARPA 2 ̆ 7 s large increase in premium subsidies. An unintended consequence of the larger subsidies is a dramatic increase in the incentive for farmers to insure their crops under optional units, that is, insurance at the field level rather than at the farm or crop level. The expected rate of return to farmers who choose to invest additional premium dollars to move to optional unit coverage ranges from a low of 61 percent at the 85 percent coverage level to 144 percent at the 65 percent coverage level. This explains why the majority of farmers choose optional unit coverage even though the alternative unit structures provide identical insurance guarantees at a substantially lower cost. We consider two policy options to eliminate the unintended consequences of ARPA subsidies. The first would simply eliminate the ability of farmers to insure their crops under optional units. This change would save taxpayers more than 300 million (if 90 percent of current acreage is insured under optional units) and would not decrease the insurance guarantee of any farmer. However, transfers to farmers, crop insurance companies, and crop insurance agents would all fall under this policy option, decreasing its political attractiveness. The second alternative would decouple per-acre premium subsidies from a farmer 2 ̆ 7 s choice of unit coverage. Farmers would benefit from the ability to capture all the <b>premium</b> <b>savings</b> that would occur as they move to other unit structures. It is likely that there is a level of decoupled subsidy that would make both farm groups and taxpayers better off. Splitting farm groups off the blocking coalition increases the likelihood of acceptance of this proposal. Program integrity would be increased by dramatically increasing the incremental cost of farmers insuring their crops under optional units...|$|R

40|$|In 2000, Congress {{decided to}} move away from a fixed-dollar-per-acre premium subsidy to a subsidy {{percentage}} that applies to any crop insurance product offered. This change reduced the cost to farmers of moving from yield insurance to revenue insurance by more than 50 %. In addition, Congress decided to pay {{a large proportion of the}} additional premium for higher coverage levels, paying for more than half the cost of moving from the 65 % to the 75 % coverage level and about 25 % of the additional cost of moving from 75 % to 80 % coverage. Not surprisingly, farmers responded to these lower costs by moving to more expensive revenue insurance policies and higher coverage levels. This response is part of the reason why the Congressional Budget Office projects that the cost of the crop insurance program exceeds $ 7 billion per year. The changes to the premium subsidy structure were made in an era of projected budget surpluses. Does this change still make sense now that federal deficits and overall debt levels are so high? How much could spending be reduced if the premium subsidy structure were changed back? This policy briefing paper provides insights into these questions. Congress has demonstrated repeatedly that it wants a large proportion of acres to be enrolled in the crop insurance program. The proven way to expand insured acreage is to subsidize farmers’ crop insurance premiums with either a “lump sum” subsidy that gives farmers a set amount to participate in the program or a proportional subsidy that pays a set fraction of a farmer’s premium. The added benefit to the crop insurance industry of a proportional subsidy is that it incentivizes farmers to buy higher coverage levels and more expensive revenue insurance. If Congress had decided in 2010 {{to move away from}} the current system of proportional subsidies to the amount of premium subsidy available for yield insurance, then the 2011 projected cost of the crop insurance program would have declined by about $ 1. 4 billion from the direct <b>savings</b> in <b>premium</b> subsidies, and by another $ 300 million in lower underwriting gains as farmers moved away from expensive revenue insurance. Further savings would accrue if premium subsidies were fixed at a set dollar amount because this would remove the incentive for farmers to buy more crop insurance than they would buy if they were spending their own money rather than taxpayer dollars. Total savings approaching $ 2 billion would likely accrue by simply returning to the premium structure that we had before the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. Farmers would respond to this policy change by buying less revenue insurance and lower coverage levels. This would also reduce their out-of-pocket expenditures. Farm groups would undoubtedly oppose this change, but such opposition would be tempered if the choice were between this change and a reduction in a more valued program, such as direct payments. Underwriting gains to crop insurance companies would decline significantly. Both companies and agents would have the most to lose from this policy change so they would be expected to oppose it strongly. But in an era of tight budgets, the tax dollars spent on subsidies that incentivize farmers to buy more and different types of crop insurance than they would buy with their own dollars could fall under intense scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technologies of wireless communications systems {{have led to}} an increasing desire for several antennas performing diverse functions at different frequencies to be integrated into a common radiating aperture. This {{gives rise to the}} so-called multifunction antenna, which affords the <b>saving</b> of scarce <b>premium</b> real estate and can alleviate problems arising from excessive antenna protrusions in aspects such as aerodynamics, aesthetics, and stealth capability in military applications. Where rapid and simultaneous operations are required, electronically phased-steered array antennas using waveguide elements offer an effective and viable solution. This is in virtue of the excellent isolation which waveguides can provide when operated below the fundamental modal cutoff. Miniaturized waveguide elements are thus needed for realizing multi-frequency interlaced arrays. Although to entirely fill waveguides with dielectric material to realize compact waveguides is feasible, the increased attenuation losses and weight may cause problems. An alternative approach is the partially-filled sidewall loaded rectangular waveguide. The advantages of this waveguide include having lower dielectric losses and being lighter than its entirely filled counterpart. These advantages, however, are still trivial. The prominent property which this alternative waveguide possess is that when operated at the so-called TEM frequency, the fundamental mode of this structure displays TEM plane wave properties, i. e. uniform aperture field distribution over the empty region with clean linear polarization, and exhibiting a modal propagation constant that is equal to that of a uniform plane wave in freespace. Therefore, these are called quasi-TEM hard waveguides. Intuitively, these attributes may provide good radiation performance when the waveguides are terminated as open-ended radiating elemental apertures of a planar array antenna. However, they may be advantageous only for broadside array scan and when the radiating aperture entirely fills the unit cell. The latter aspect is certainly violated in interlaced arrays requiring miniaturized waveguide elements. It is then a primary objective of this thesis to investigate the complete and true effects of the TEM modal plane wave property of the hard waveguide elements on the array performance. Results have shown that, even when operated at the TEM condition under broadside array scan, miniaturized apertures of the quasi-TEM hard waveguides lead to poor array transmission. Nevertheless, miniaturization in E-plane is found to be more facilitated than in H-plane. The performance at the TEM condition is optimal for a particular aperture size, this being a crucial finding. When an internal homogeneous dielectric layer is incorporated into each waveguide element to serve as a matching section, very good array transmission can be obtained even for highly miniaturized apertures under a specific set of operating conditions, e. g. matched for broadside array scan and at the TEM frequency. However, the matching is narrowband. Nonetheless, this provides good isolation from other frequencies and allows closely separated bands to be operated simultaneously. Moreover, the matching is fairly well maintained even when the array is scanned off broadside in both principal E and H planes. It is also learnt that the bandwidth of the matching degrades more rapidly when the aperture is miniaturized in H-plane than in E-plane. Although the waveguide elements of the array operating at the lower frequency band are unable to interfere with those of the higher frequency bands, the converse is not true. This may be solved if the waveguides of the lower frequency band have, in addition to a usual lower cutoff frequency, an upper one as well. Novel waveguides with such a feature can be realized by loading the internal walls with metamaterials. This thesis has studied one such structure comprising an array of metallic strip dipoles imprinted on the surfaces of the two dielectric sidewall loadings of a rectangular waveguide. This structure serves as a waveguide filter, displaying a passband within which the lower frequency band can be operated, and an upper stopband in which the higher frequency band may reside. The thesis concludes with a final investigation on the prospect of using an array of open-ended waveguide apertures as a focal plane array feed for reflector antennas. The goal {{of the study was to}} ascertain the effects of mutual coupling on radiation efficiency. Although an active uniformly illuminated and linearly phase steered array only has reflection losses but no coupled losses, an array feed whose aperture is synthesized to match the focal plane fields of a reflector antenna has both reflection and coupled losses. Hence, although a desired feed radiation pattern may be synthesized to achieve high feed efficiency, the radiation efficiency has often been neglected. This work elucidates the importance of the latter aspect...|$|R

La seconde partie traite principalement des conséquences du chômage sur les niveaux de vie, la sécurité, les besoins et les aspirations de la famille du salarié. Cet article fait partie d'une étude plus vaste sur les conditions de vie des travailleurs salariées de la Province de Québec. Cette étude est entreprise par le Centre de Recherches sociales de l'Université Laval, en collaboration avec la Fédération des Caisses Populaires Desjardins et l'Assurance-Vie Des jardins. The authors-wish {{to express}} their thanks to the Commission's staff who translated their original brief. An edited version appears here. Unemployment is a phenomenon which has been analyzed mostly in macro-economic terms. In the more usual studies an attempt is made to determine {{the size of the}} number of unemployed in relation to the total labour force, as well as the general causes of the increase in the percentage of unemployed. While we do not deny the importance of this approach, there remain a large number of micro-economic and sociological aspects which have received much less attention from the researchers, but which are also of great importance for economic planning. In the course of the study on living conditions of French-Canadian families we gathered data which enables us to examine unemployment among the workers of Quebec from certain angles. The research program is not centered on the unemployment problem, but rather on the living conditions of wage-earners, on the structure of the family budget, and on the needs and aspirations of families. For the purposes of the study, 1, 460 families distributed throughout the Province of Quebec were interviewed during the summer of 1959. The questionnaire used for those interviews furnished data on the family budget during one year (from the summer of 1958 until the summer of 1959). The population studied comprises all the complete families (married at least one year), of French origin that are families of wage-earners in the Province of Quebec. The sample was stratified according to the characteristics of the municipality in which the families live. Six different groups of families were formed in this way: (1) wage-earning families in the metropolitan centres (Montreal and Quebec); (2) families in towns with a population of over 30, 000; (3) families in towns with a population of between 5, 000 and 30, 000; (4) families living in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is prosperous; (5) families in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is average; (6) families in villages of municipalities where agriculture is poor. Before commenting at greater length on the implications of the high percentage of unemployed in rural areas, it is necessary to define the yardstick which we use to measure unemployment. This method {{is quite different from the}} measurement used by the government agencies. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics, as well as the Federal Unemployment Insurance Commission, measures the intensity of unemployment by calculating the percentage of the labour force that is without work at a given moment. Thus, we find that in November 1960, 6 per cent of the Canadian labour force was without work, whereas in October 1960, that percentage was 5 &. Those rates do not enable us to determine whether the workers who were unemployed in November had also been unemployed in October, nor the average duration of unemployment. The measurement which we use is different in two respects. Firstly, instead of taking the whole labour force into account, undifferentiated, we consider only those unemployed persons who are heads of families, that is, the workers whose instability of employment affects a large number of dependents. Secondly, we take into account the number of families whose heads have been unemployed at any time during the year between the summer of 1958 and the summer of 1959. Thus if it is found in our study that 29 per cent of French-Canadian wage-earning families were exposed to unemployment at some time during the year while the maximum monthly rate of unemployment (as compiled by the government agencies) was 5 per cent during that period, it can be deduced that the heads of families who were questioned were unemployed at different periods of the year. The average duration of unemployment per family (19 weeks) underlines the plausibility of this distribution of the phenomenon in terms of time. This method of measuring unemployment makes it possible to grasp more clearly the importance of under-employment in the Province of Quebec by laying bare certain phenomena that have been concealed by the other measurements. Thus, during the year 1958 - 1959, more than one-quarter of the wage-earning families of our sample were affected by unemployment at one time or other. That is a much larger proportion than one would gather from the official statistics. Furthermore, in the rural communities, unemployment affects between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the families. The importance of unemployment is no doubt connected with the structure of occupation in the various communities. We can only present here a brief analysis of the characteristics of various industries and occupations in the urban and rural communities. A more thorough study would be necessary in order to situate the unemployment problem in its total context. DISTRIBUTION OF UNEMPLOYMENTThe percentage of families affected by unemployment increases as we move away from the large urban centres. The same relationship exists when we consider the percentage of families who have drawn unemployment insurance during the year. Even if it is the big cities which have the largest absolute number of unemployed, as the official statistics indicate, it is in those centres where their relative number is the smallest. In terms of probability, the urban worker is therefore less exposed to unemployment than his opposite number in the remote rural areas. The average length of the period of unemployment varies very little from one place to another. It is about four months. It is therefore not the duration of unemployment which varies from one community to the other, but rather the probability of becoming unemployed. The place of present residence is the chief factor associated with unemployment. Whatever his place of birth, the worker living in the rural community is more exposed to unemployment than the one living in the city. Moreover, the worker born in the urban community is less exposed to unemployment than the one who is born in the country. There is therefore reason to believe that the worker of city origin is better prepared to find steady employment. Finally, workers of rural origins, considerably decrease the probability of being unemployed by migrating to the city. It would seem important to verify this relationship with wider samples before accepting it absolutely. However, a brief analysis of the occupational structure in rural and urban communities may make it possible to explain in part the lower rate of unemployment that is characteristic of the urban community. We must bear in mind, first of all, that unemployment affects primarily the unskilled workers. This tendency has been shown by al! the studies on unemployment in Canada. In our population 90 per cent of the workers who were unemployed during the year were semi-skilled workers or labourers. It must also be remembered that in Canada seasonal unemployment is one of the main forms, if not the main form of unemployment. Moreover, the seasonal industries employ a very large number of unskilled workers (stevedores, lumber-cutters, construction labourers, transport labourers, etc.). The level of qualification of the rural workers is lower than that of the urban workers. That may be explained by their lower level of education, but also by the nature of the jobs which they can find in their community. The great majority of rural jobs are seasonal (bush work, transportation, construction work, road building, mining etc.) and require few qualifications. Moreover, the rural worker has difficulty finding a job in his locality. At least half of the rural workers must travel to their place of work. Quite often those journeys are so great that the worker is obliged to spend several days and even several weeks away from his home. Once he is out of work, the rural worker may therefore prefer to remain at home and draw unemployment insurance benefits before exiling himself once more in order to look for work. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCESThe consequences of unemployment at the level of family life are fairly easy to predict. It is perhaps for that reason that few researchers have attempted to analyze them in terms of concrete examples. The systematic analysis of those consequences is, however, important if we wish to know the exact nature of this social evil, unemployment. The standard of living of families subject to unemployment is lower than that of other families. The available income per unit of consumption is decidedly lower. Half of the families where the head is out of work have an annual income of less than $ 900 per unit of consumption. The possession of the personal property common to French-Canadian homes is measured by an index. Families where there is unemployment own fewer house hold goods than other families. Thus, not only is current income lower, but the total investment in goods is lower too. From that it can be assumed that the precariousness of the economic situation is not a recent, accidental phenomenon, but a state which lasts for some time. It is perhaps in regard to the steps taken to insure the security of the family that the destitution of the unemployed is most pronounced. We built a security index: the items comprising that index are the possession of life insurance, health insurance, a pension plan, etc. Nearly half the families of unemployed workers have no guarantee of security in case of family disaster, while 74 per cent of the other families have an acceptable combination of insurance plans in case of unforeseen emergencies. The family of the unemployed worker therefore has to suffer not only from the hardships due to the lack of work, but is also vulnerable to all unforeseen calamities which may strike it. Another important point is, that the unemployed predict that owing to lack of money they will not be able to give their children the minimum of education which they consider necessary in our modern society. If this prediction comes true, the children, for lack of adequate preparation, will have to be employed as labourers or semi-skilled workers when they begin their careers. The probability of their becoming unemployed in their turn will therefore be fairly great (especially if we consider the future progress of automation). Unemployment may therefore easily become a heritage that is perpetuated from generation to generation. The fact that the unemployed have less chance to provide a sufficient income for their families in case of emergencies or illness is one indication of the difficulty they have in <b>saving.</b> Actually, the <b>premiums</b> of the various forms of insurance necessary for security of the family are savings which the unemployed person does not succeed in making. We find this inability to save when it comes to savings in the form of bank deposits or purchases of bonds. When the family exposed to unemployment does succeed in saving, it does so in order to provide against contingencies that are likely to occur soon. The families whose heads have a steady job ordinarily save for a more or less indefinite and remote purpose. The unemployed person who manages to save usually has to withdraw his savings to meet the necessities of daily life. For all the families exposed to unemployment, the indebtedness during a year is greater than the savings. ConclusionsThese few considerations on the geographical distribution of unemployment and on the socio-economic condition of the unemployed worker's family pose more problems, in fact, than they enable us to solve. Unemployment is a major economic and sociological problem. The politicians who seek to find a solution to it should, in our opinion, base themselves on research centred on two main poles. After defining the various types of unemployment (seasonal, structural, etc.,) they should determine the incidence of those types according to the economic regions, urban and rural communities, etc. This analysis should be accompanied by a structure-functional analysis of the regional economies. There no doubt exist some large-scale economic remedies for unemployment (increased exports, deficit budgeting, etc.). But to be really effective, most of those measures need an organic adaptation to the local situation. No doubt such measures also demand some co-ordination between the various sectors of industry and various levels of government. However, unemployment does not only have causes, it also has effects on the life of society, on family life and on the life of the individual. Our observations have enabled us to show that the whole phenomenon of unemployment does not strike just any workers, but rather particular classes of workers. Among heads of families, unemployment appears to be a more or less hereditary phenomenon in the less favoured environments. This is not an accident in the career of an individual, but rather a more or less permanent state peculiar to certain individuals. This permanence of unemployment at the individual level, is creating among us a real proletariat characterized by a very low standard of living, the total absence of security in case of emergencies, and the impossibility of aspiring to a better lot for future generations. It is important that this first analysis of the problem should be supplemented by an analysis of the effects of unemployment on the single worker. Likewise, it would be important to determine the implications both for the family and for the single person of various types of unemployment. Such research would make it possible not only to prepare programs of economic expansion and of co-ordination of industries, but also to ensure greater economic and social security through the adoption of measures proportionate to the needs of the various types of workers. Thus, it would be possible, we hope, to nip this emerging proletariat in the bud...|$|R
