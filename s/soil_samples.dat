5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{has been}} noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A.rubescens, although {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B.edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.|$|E

40|$|An Automated Electro-Pneumatic <b>Soil</b> <b>Sampling</b> (EP) method {{based on}} {{pressurized}} air for real time soil analysis {{was developed and}} tested in laboratory conditions. Pressurized air was applied for 36 milliseconds across a 3 cm diameter cylinder to cut a soil column and convey soil along a delivery pipe into a container. An electro-pneumatic regulator valve was used to regulate the air pressure at 550, 690, and 830 kPa using an analog electrical signal. A two-position solenoid valve controlled by a stand-alone microprocessor was used to control pulse duration. The effects of air pressure level, soil moisture content, soil compaction, and soil type on the quantity of <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> obtained were investigated. Moisture content and pressure level {{were found to be}} the most significant factors, while compaction was not significant in terms of mass of soil obtained. Laboratory test results showed that pressurized air was effective in cutting and transporting <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> for all different soils and different soil conditions studied in the experiment. The electro-pneumatic method was also capable of obtaining a consistent amount of <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> in a short time period (36 ms) with a coefficient of variation of less than 30 %.;A shank as <b>soil</b> <b>sampling</b> arm was designed and constructed.

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation.

One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May.

5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in <b>soil</b> <b>samples)</b> and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|The {{biology is}} poorly known; {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} castes were described {{for the first time in}} 2012. The genus is known mainly from isolated workers found in Winkler or Berlese samples. Tatuidris workers have peculiar mandibular brushes and a powerful sting, which led Brown & Kempf to speculate that Tatuidris might be specialist predators of active or slippery arthropod prey. Until 2011, no observations of live specimens were registered. Details of a first collection event of a small live colony (3 workers and 4 gynes) by Thibaut Delsinne in a mid-elevation forest in southeastern Ecuador suggest that Tatuidris may well be a highly specialized predator, as colonies kept in captivity did not accept any food item offered to them. Food items rejected by the ants included live and dead termites, millipedes, mites, various insect parts, sugar water, tuna, biscuits, live and dead fruit flies (Drosophila), live springtails, live myriapods (Chilopoda and Diplopoda), live and dead Diplura, small live spiders, small live pseudoscorpions, one small snail, uncooked hen egg (i.e. piece of cotton wool soaked with fresh whisked hen egg), ant larvae (Gnamptogenys sp.), and live ant workers (Cyphomyrmex sp., Brachymyrmex sp.).

40|$|Many {{problems}} remain unsolved as {{to sandy}} soils which show different physical and mechanical properties of their own. It {{is known that}} the physical and mechanical properties of sandy soils are considerably {{different from those of}} clay soils. This study was practised to obtain fundamental data on the improvement of sandy soils. The authors investigated the coefficient of water permeability, pF-soil moisture characteristic, removing of fine particles from the <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> during percolation and the changes of consistency limit of sandy soils with clay dressing under laboratory condition. The conclusions obtained are summarized as follows; 1. In the permeability test, the coefficient of water permeability of sandy soils with clay dressing decreased with increasing in clay content and the decreasing ratio of the coefficient is larger in a state of lower clay content. 2. The coefficient of removing fine particles from the <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> during percolation decreased with increasing of clay content and the decreasing ratio of the coefficient is large in a state of lower clay content. Moreover, the supressing effect on the removing fine particles from the <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> during percolation becomes very large by adding silt fractions to the <b>soil</b> <b>sample.</b> 3. The flow curves and the flow index increased when content of clay in <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> was increased. When content of clay in <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> is under about 30 per cent, the <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> is nonplastic and we cannot obtain the properties above mentioned. 砂粒子のような粗粒分が主要構成分となっている砂質土は粘質土とは多くの点で相違がある. 砂質上の改良には, 粘土のような細粒分を客土することが一般に考えられることであるが, 実際にはそれほど単純ではない. すなわち. 施工時の水分状態, 原土および客入土の粒度組成, 原土の構造性並びに締固めエネルギーの大きさなど施工条件によって改良効果に大きな差が生じる. こうした現状を踏まえて, 本報では, 透水試験, 細粒分の洗脱試験およびコンシステンシー測定など, 混合系の基本的問題について検討した. 得られた結果は以下のとおりである. 1. 透水試験においては, 混合試料中の粘土含有率の小さい段階で透水抑制作用に著しい効果がみられる. 2. 細粒分の洗脱試験では, 粘土含有率が増えるにしたがって洗脱率は減少するが, 減少の度合は粘土含有率の小さい初期の段階で大きい. また, シルト分の混入による洗脱抑制効果はかなり大きい. 3. 砂・粘土混合試料のコンシステンシーについては, 粘土含有率が増えるにしたがって流動曲線は上昇し, 流動指数は増大するが, 粘土含有率が 30 %以下では非塑性状態を呈するため, こうした関係を求めることが困難である...|$|R
