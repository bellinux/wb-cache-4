5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, <b>sweating,</b> <b>and</b> anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have {{disruption}} of the autonomic nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired <b>sweating,</b> <b>and</b> orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{variant of}} the vertebrate toxin found in the redback was cloned and sequenced in 2012, and {{was found to be}} a sequence of 1180 amino acids, with a strong similarity to the equivalent molecule across the Latrodectus mactans clade. The syndromes caused by bites from any spiders of the Latrodectus genus have similarities; there is some evidence there is a higher incidence of <b>sweating,</b> <b>and</b> local and radiating pain with the redback, while black widow envenomation results in more back and abdominal pain, and abdominal rigidity is a feature common with bites from the west coast button spider (Latrodectus indistinctus) of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E

5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, <b>sweating,</b> <b>and</b> vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, <b>sweating,</b> <b>and</b> other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys â€“ when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. <b>Sweating</b> <b>and</b> anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E

25|$|Progression of {{symptoms}}: {{the first}} symptoms of aconitine poisoning appear approximately 20 minutes to 2 hours after oral intake and include paraesthesia, <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> nausea.
