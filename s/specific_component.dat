25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{performed}} on {{the components of the}} DNA translation mechanism. One desire of scientists creating synthetic biological circuits {{is to be able to}} control the translation of synthetic DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One study tested the adjustability of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes. Researchers were able to mutate zinc fingers, the DNA <b>specific</b> <b>component</b> of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for DNA, and thus decreasing the amount of translation. They were also able to use the zinc fingers as components of complex forming sTFs, which are the eukaryotic translation mechanisms.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} methods of obtaining blood from a donor. [...] The most {{frequent}} is to simply take the blood from a vein as whole blood. [...] This blood is typically separated into parts, usually red blood cells and plasma, since most recipients need only a <b>specific</b> <b>component</b> for transfusions. [...] A typical donation is 450 millilitres (or approximately one U.S. pint) of whole blood, though 500 millilitre donations are also common.

2500|$|Aristotle's Prior Analytics did not, however, {{incorporate}} such {{a comprehensive}} theory on the [...] "modal syllogism"—a syllogism that {{has at least}} one modalized premise (that is, a premise containing the modal words 'necessarily', 'possibly', or 'contingently'). [...] Aristotle's terminology in this aspect of his theory was deemed vague and in many cases unclear, even contradicting some of his statements from On Interpretation. [...] His original assertions on this <b>specific</b> <b>component</b> of the theory were left up to a considerable amount of conversation, resulting in a wide array of solutions put forth by commentators of the day. [...] The system for modal syllogisms laid forth by Aristotle would ultimately be deemed unfit for practical use, and would be replaced by new distinctions and new theories altogether.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether prosocial, social, and psychological development in {{children are more}} strongly associated with an overall understanding of emotions, or whether certain aspects of development are associated with <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of emotion understanding. 38 children aged between 6 and 9 years old were administered the Test of Emotion Comprehension and the Kusche Affective Interview-Revised.

Overall emotion understanding {{was found to be}} associated with conduct problems. <b>Specific</b> <b>components</b> of emotion understanding were associated with peer and emotional problems and inattention-hyperactivity. Prosocial behaviour was not significantly associated with emotion understanding. Results suggest that social and psychological development are primarily associated with <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of emotion understanding rather than overall understanding...|$|R

To {{determine}} if the validated Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ), developed to assess efficacy in female sexual dysfunction (FSD) clinical trials, may also have utility in identifying target populations for such studies. Methods. Data from five clinical trials and two general population surveys were {{used to analyze the}} utility of the SFQ as a tool to discriminate between the presence of <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of FSD (i. e., hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder, female orgasmic disorder, and dyspareunia).

Sensitivity/specificity analysis and logistic regression analysis, using data from all five clinical studies and the general population surveys, confirmed that the SFQ domains have utility in detecting the presence of <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of FSD and provide scores indicative of the presence of a specific sexual disorder. Conclusions. The SFQ is a valuable new tool for detecting the presence of FSD and identifying the <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of sexual functions affected (desire, arousal, orgasm, or dyspareunia) ...|$|R
