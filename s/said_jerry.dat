2500|$|In October 2009, a {{deal was}} brokered, for the Nets {{to play at}} the Prudential Center for two seasons, {{beginning}} in the 2010–11 NBA season. The deal also included a partnership with the Prudential Center hosting sporting events (Devils, Nets, Seton Hall), and the Izod Center handling concerts and family shows. The two arenas proposed a joint venture, Jersey Presents LLC, to wrestle leverage from promoters who had been playing the two against each other. [...] "You can’t have two venues that close together fighting each other and have that be productive for the state", <b>said</b> <b>Jerry</b> Zaro, economic czar to former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who brokered the deal. [...] The Nets' agreement to play the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons in Newark was finalized on February 18, 2010. On April 12, 2010 the Nets played their final game at the Izod Center, a 105–95 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats, with Terrence Williams making the final basket scored on the court.|$|E

6000|$|... "Lesher {{must have}} told 'em some putty strong stories," [...] <b>said</b> old <b>Jerry.</b> [...] "Otherwise the men wouldn't be so dead set ag'in ye, cap'n." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Begin at the beginning," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jerry</b> Muskrat. [...] "Your home {{is somewhere}} {{way up in}} the Northland where Honker the Goose lives, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's in luck {{she is to}} git {{into the}} Downs before the gale breaks, and it's to be hoped she has good ground-tackle," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jerry.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What a pity! then he lost it?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jerry,</b> looking {{with some}} anxiety at a decayed branch, {{to which the}} {{flickering}} flame gave apparent motion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{a sailor}} {{and will do}} my full share," [...] <b>said</b> old <b>Jerry.</b> But {{he did not like}} the {{situation}} any better than did the Rovers.|$|R
