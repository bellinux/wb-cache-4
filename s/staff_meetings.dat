5|$|In Dahomeyan coups in 1963 and 1965, Alley urged General Christophe Soglo {{to seize}} power. After the 1965 coup, Soglo {{promoted}} Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Alley made known his disagreements with Soglo on several occasions, though he remained loyal nonetheless. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley's chef de cabinet in 1967 and his frequent opposition to Alley during <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> {{helped to create}} factions in the Dahomeyan Army.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion as inevitable and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|E
5|$|To Heart 2 {{development}} originally {{began as}} a collaborative effort for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus.

Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E

25|$|<b>Staff</b> <b>meetings</b> {{to adjust}} command {{structure}} were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, {{if only for a}} short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As there had been no definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E
25|$|<b>Staff</b> <b>meetings</b> {{were always}} held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967.

When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his tenure, Gude had private {{pupils in}} {{addition}} to his normal classes. As a professor Gude taught six hours of class, held two hours of office hours, took turns with other professors supervising the nude drawing class and attended <b>staff</b> <b>meetings.</b> In 1857 Gude handed in his resignation, officially citing family considerations and failing health as his reasons for resigning, although in his memoirs he blamed opposition and backbiting from two of his pupils. The landscape painting professorship was the bottom of the pay scale at the Academy, and Gude {{was one of the few}} professors to be refused a raise when others received them in 1855. Others have suggested that Gude wished to leave the Academy for fear for becoming stuck in a rut artistically. Gude received better treatment from the Academy after he turned in his resignation, and it would take him a full five years to finally leave Düsseldorf. Although professors at the Academy complained that their teaching prevented them from undertaking more lucrative endeavors, Gude was able to sell enough works to afford a modest house in Düsseldorf which stood in what is now Hofgarten.|$|E

25|$|Squadron Leader, the Honourable Clive Dempster DFC (David Griffin) (Series 6–9) Entertainment Manager – The aristocratic {{war hero}} {{replaced}} Jeffrey Fairbrother as Entertainment Manager {{at the start}} of the 1960 season. He was the complete opposite to Jeffrey – a maverick ladies' man who enjoyed cheating the campers and the staff. He was reckless with the money his family occasionally sent him, drank cocktails rather than beer, provided champagne at <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> and drove a red MG TC convertible. Clive was born in 1924, the only son of William, Lord Dempster, and Lady Dempster (née Helen Mary Waverston). He grew up in Cambridgeshire at the family estate of Dempster Hall, where his father's unmarried siblings also resided. During the Second World War he served in the RAF and rose to the rank of Squadron Leader, led numerous night-time raids over Germany, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). He found life difficult upon demobilisation and spent several years drifting. He briefly became manager of a country club but was robbed by his business partner and left with a large debt to pay. He then joined Maplins as entertainment manager, and ran the camp in a far more laid-back way than his predecessor, Jeffrey Fairbrother. Unlike Fairbrother, Clive got involved with Ted's money-making schemes, the most memorable being when they drugged several campers in order to search their chalets for a stolen necklace. It was revealed that Joe Maplin gave Clive the job because he desired a knighthood, and he believed Clive's connection to the aristocracy could help him acquire this. Clive began a relationship with Gladys shortly after arriving at Maplins, and eventually married her (against his family's wishes) at the end of the 1960 season. They emigrated to Australia, where he had been offered a job flying commercial aircraft by his former RAF Wing Commander.|$|E

Kate Betts, seen as Wintour's likely successor, had broadened the magazine's reach by {{commissioning}} stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the [...] "Index" [...] section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine.

500|$|Motohiro {{wanted the}} series to counter {{concurrent}} anime trends. The use of moe (slang) was banned at <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> because they appreciated dramas like Mobile Suit Gundam and Patlabor {{that focus on}} conflicts between male characters. As the series was [...] "anti-moe", the team decided to avoid having the female lead character Akane remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because {{the conflict between the}} male characters appeared to attract the shonen ai genre fans. Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans. The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.|$|E
500|$|United States Battleship Division Nine was a {{division}} of four, later five, dreadnought battleships of the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet that constituted the American contribution to the British Grand Fleet during World War I. Although the U.S. entered the war on 6 April 1917, hesitation among senior officers of the U.S. Navy as to the wisdom of dividing the American [...] prevented the immediate dispatch of any capital ships for service in the war zone. Following a direct request from the British Admiralty {{and a series of}} high level <b>staff</b> <b>meetings,</b> American opinion changed, and Battleship Division Nine joined the Grand Fleet on 7 December 1917.

500|$|Second Sons {{premise is}} built from {{the ending of}} Infamous 2 that sees protagonist Cole MacGrath {{sacrifice}} himself to save humanity. They looked at Trophy data and found the majority (78%) of Infamous 2 players chose this ending, and concurred with the popular choice. This allowed them to create the new protagonist, Delsin, from scratch. [...] "Moving forward onto , we said 'Alright, Cole's dead. People have voted for this. Let's make a new hero'", Fox explained. Griesemer felt that taking the Infamous series to the PS4 signified a new era, and that departing from the story of previous games would help them reach new audiences. [...] "We needed a new entry point, and Delsin {{was the first step}} for that", he explained. The idea to move away from Cole's story came about during pre-production <b>staff</b> <b>meetings,</b> and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with Sony Computer Entertainment.

500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling <b>staff</b> <b>meetings</b> and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, Apple press officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries on like this, all of us will be broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E
