The original 218 interstate instrumentalities were signed in the 1950s. All states have a Section 218 agreement with the federal government's Social Security Administration. For more information see Chapter 10 of this Social Security Handbook. This July 8, 2004 Social Security Handbook chapter 10, section 1002.1 defines what is an [...] "interstate instrumentality".The provisions of Section 218 of the Social Security Act and the instrumentalities agreement and subsequent modifications determine Social Security and Medicare benefits or Medicare-only coverage for {{state and local}} government employees enrolled in {{state and local government}} retirement systems. To learn more about 218 status or inquire about it from an official verifiable <b>source,</b> <b>contact</b> the Social Security office or representative nearest to the request, or visit the official Social Security website. Also the national [...] "1-800" [...] line, 1-800-772-1213 can help to direct one to information. A list of physical Social Security offices and administrators is maintained on-line at http://www.ssa.gov.All state and local government employees hired since 1986, or whom are covered by Section 218 Agreements, participate in Medicare even if not covered by Social Security financial benefits. To see how state and local government employees are covered by Social Security and Medicare see the Federal-State reference guide appendix.Other local and state employees were brought into coverage under a 1991 Social Security law that required these employees to join Social Security if their employer did not provide them with a pension plan.Some state and local governments continue to maintain pension plans and have not executed Section 218 agreements; if so, those workers may not participate in Social Security taxation.

In these structures, p(+) substrate contact rings are used to improve the cross-talk isolation, appropriately doped TFSOI layers are used for high-Q inductors, and <b>source</b> <b>contacts</b> connected to the substrate are used to minimize the self-heating problem. The p+ substrate contact rings provide - 57 dB isolation (typically characterized for a device spacing of 100 jam) at 10 GHz, {{which is the best}} ever reported in TFSOI technology. A maximum Q-factor of 10. 4 is obtained for TFSOI-layer shielded on-chip inductors. The inductor-to-inductor isolation is - 62 dB (for a spacing of 100 mum) at 10 GHz, which is close to the ideal isolation of the open probes. The <b>source</b> <b>contacts</b> connected to the substrate improves the self-heating by 16 %.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{laboratory}} studies to examine behavioural {{effects of a}} new pheromone-based control system for stored product moths, Exosex™ SPTab auto-confusion, on virgin male Plodia interpunctella. The SPTab comprises a compressed electrostatic powder tablet, containing the female sex pheromone (Z,E) - 9, 12 -Tetradecadienyl acetate; designed to be an attractive source to males and disrupt the mate finding ability of several stored moth pest species. Our aims were {{to examine the effects}} of SPTab contact on male ability to locate females and to be attractive sources to other males. Observations of behavioural effects were made in a moth flight tunnel. Virgin male P. interpunctella were treated on SPTabs weathered from 1 - 8 weeks. After treatment, males were either immediately released downwind of calling females in the upwind section of the flight tunnel, or caged individually for 1 to 48 h before release. The ability of treated males to act as false lures for other males was measured by treating males on different age SPTabs as before, caging them and then placing them upwind of untreated males. In all studies males were scored on making <b>source</b> <b>contact.</b> Males treated on the SPTab and immediately released downwind of calling females showed a 96. 7 % reduction in their ability to contact the females. Males held for 48 h before release still showed a significant reduction in <b>source</b> <b>contact</b> compared to untreated controls. Treated males tested after 3 h, were as attractive as calling females with > 75 % of flights resulting in <b>source</b> <b>contact.</b> Significant reduction in female <b>source</b> <b>contact</b> was still evident when males were treated on SPTab weathered for 4 weeks. Males treated on SPTabs weathered for up to 8 weeks were significantly attractive to untreated males, and equal to calling females.

These males could increase the confusion effect by becoming competitive attractive point sources for other males. The Exosex SPTab has novel methods of causing mating disruption...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a channel {{backscattering}} {{model in which}} increased carrier temperature {{at the top of}} the potential energy barrier in the channel is taken into account. This model represents an extension of a previous model by the same authors which highlighted the importance of considering the partially ballistic transport between the <b>source</b> <b>contact</b> and the top of the potential energy barrier in the channel. The increase of carrier temperature is precisely due to energy dissipation between the <b>source</b> <b>contact</b> and the top of the barrier caused by the high saturation current. To support our discussion, accurate 2 D full band Monte Carlo device simulations with quantum correction have been performed in double gate nMOSFETs for different geometries (gate length down to 10 nm), biases and lattice temperatures.

40|$|The charge {{injection}} {{barriers in}} organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) {{seem to be}} far less critical as compared to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Counter intuitively, we show that the origin is image-force lowering of the barrier due to the gate bias at the <b>source</b> <b>contact,</b> although the corresponding gate field is perpendicular to the channel current. In coplanar OFETs, injection barriers up to 1 eV can be surmounted by increasing the gate bias, enabling extraction of bulk transport parameters in this regime. For staggered transistors, however, the injection is gate-assisted only until the gate bias is screened by the accumulation channel opposite to the <b>source</b> <b>contact.</b> The gate-assisted injection is supported by two-dimensional numerical charge transport simulations that reproduce the gate-bias dependence of the contact resistance and the typical S-shaped output curves as observed for OFETs with high injection barriers.
