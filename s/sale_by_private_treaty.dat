50|$|In September 2006, London {{auctioneer}} Bonhams {{announced that}} it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>private</b> <b>treaty</b> or by auction at a future date. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education and Culture of Hungary, which still claims the treasure, said it had informed British authorities that the treasure must not be sold. On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its admission to the European Union in 2004. Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition of the Sevso Treasure on 17 October 2006.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1850s and 60s, when the Fenian Brotherhood was being organised, {{a large number}} of Irishmen who were {{soldiers}} in the British Army all over Ireland, were 'sworn in' as members of the Fenian movement. This is what happened in Templemore in a big way. As a result of this in December 1885, the 11th Depot Battalion which had been stationed here for a long time, was broken up and transferred to Newry and Enniskillen. It was then replaced by the 59th Regiment from Glasgow. The reason was published at the time in the Nenagh Guardian which reported: The reason assigned for the transfer of the 11th Depot Battalion from Templemore is that it was that it was strongly suspected that those troops were tainted with Fenianism. Templemore is the Headquarters of a Depot Battn. And the majority of those soldiers are recruits drafted from several parts of Ireland, but Tipperary-men predominate. Several of these soldiers were constantly entering public houses and associating with persons whose feeling of loyalty was not strong. The officers knew this, and the Commanding Officer - Colonel W. Irwin - spoke to the men on the subject, but his words had no effect. Those troops are now being replaced by an English Battalion. The people of the town very much regret the change. In addition it may be mentioned that the 11th Battn hunted its own pack of hounds, and when leaving, the officers offered for <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>private</b> <b>treaty</b> [...] "30 dogs, 27 horses, and a large amount of leather equipment for same".|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the conventional auction method of cattle marketing, some alternative marketing arrangements include <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>private</b> <b>treaty,</b> video auction, retained ownership, and use of strategic alliances. This study finds that 91 % of Louisiana producers use conventional auctions, while 39 % use other types of marketing arrangements. The most heavily used alternative marketing arrangement is private treaty, at 26 %. Those producers using alternative marketing arrangements tend to be larger, have heavier weaning weights, have more diverse farming operations, be younger, have greater contact with their county extension agents, and depend less on income from off-farm sources. cattle marketing, conventional auction, private treaty, strategic alliance, video auction, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|E
