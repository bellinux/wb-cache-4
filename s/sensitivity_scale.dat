Fundamental noise sources include the quantum projection noise and the photon shot-noise. For measurement times much {{shorter than the}} spin-relaxation time divided by âˆš(N), the optimal sensitivity of the magnetometer scales as N^- 3 / 4, so an advantage over the usual <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scaling</b> as N^- 1 / 2 can be achieved, as demonstrated in a recent experiment by J.

If strongly squeezed probe light is used, the Heisenberg uncertainty limit may, in principle, be reached for very short measurement times.

More specifically, it involves building a trusting relationship with the student and responding to his or her perceived needs, establishing moral meaning for decisions made, expressing a moral motivation to act {{in the best interest of}} the student, and modifying the student's autonomy when necessary. The purpose of this article is to explore the meaning of the concept of moral sensitivity based on a review of the professional literature of selected disciplines and examined moral sensitivity of lower secondary school students with Moral <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>Scale.</b> Thai Moral <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>Scale</b> is based on Narvaez operationalization of moral sensitivity (2001) : (1) Reading and expressing emotions, (2) taking the perspectives of others, (3) caring by connecting to others, (4) working with interpersonal and group differences, (5) preventing social bias, (6) generating interpretations and options and (7) identifying the consequences of actions and options.

We obtain the theoretical lower bound on the uncertainty in the estimate of the parameter. For arbitrary initial states, the lower bound scales as 1 /n^k, and for initial product states, it scales as 1 /n^(k- 1 / 2). We show that the latter scaling can be achieved using simple, separable measurements. We analyze in detail {{the case of a}} quadratic Hamiltonian (k = 2), implementable with Bose-Einstein condensates. We formulate a simple model, based on the evolution of angular-momentum coherent states, which explains the O(n^(- 3 / 2)) scaling for k = 2; the model shows that the entanglement generated by the quadratic Hamiltonian does not {{play a role in the}} enhanced <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scaling.</b> We show that phase decoherence does not affect the O(n^(- 3 / 2)) <b>sensitivity</b> <b>scaling</b> for initial product states.

In 2002, 327 individuals (166 men, 161 women; age range 45 - 66 years) from the Finnish Twin Cohort answered a questionnaire on noise-related and MCS items. Somatic, psychological, and lifestyle factors were obtained through earlier questionnaires for the same individuals. Both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses (CFA and EFA) of the questionnaire items on the Weinsteinâ€²s Noise <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>Scale</b> and QEESIâ€²s Chemical Intolerance Subscale indicated the presence of three factors - Noise Sensitivity, Chemical Sensitivity, and Ability to Concentrate factors - arising from the forming of two factors from the items of the Weinsteinâ€²s scale.

Using menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) as a case study, this exploratory study assesses the <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>scale</b> of WTP to change in health status as measured by a condition-specific measure, MMAS, which includes both health and non-health benefits. The relationship between EQ- 5 D and change in health status is also assessed. Methods: Baseline EQ- 5 D and MMAS values were collected from women taking part in a randomized controlled trial for pharmaceutical treatment of menorrhagia. Following treatment, these measures were administered along with a WTP exercise. The relationship between the measures was assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis, and the <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>scale</b> of WTP was measured by identifying differences in WTP alongside differences in MMAS and EQ 5 D values. Results: Our exploratory findings indicated that WTP, and not EQ- 5 D, was significantly positively correlated with change in MMAS, providing some evidence for convergent validity. These findings suggest that WTP is capturing the non-health benefits within the MMAS measure. Mean WTP also increased with percentage improvements in MMAS, suggesting <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>scale.</b> Conclusion: When compared to quality of life measured using the condition-specific MMAS measure, the convergent validity and <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>scale</b> of WTP is indicated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of effective environmental management plans and policies requires a sound {{understanding of the}} driving forces involved in shaping and altering the structure and function of ecosystems. However, driving forces, especially anthropogenic ones, are defined and operate at multiple administrative levels, which do not always match ecological scales. This paper presents an innovative methodology of analysing drivers of change by developing a typology of <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of drivers that classifies and describes the way they operate across multiple administrative levels. <b>Scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> varies considerably among drivers, which can be classified into five broad categories depending on the response of â€˜evennessâ€™ and â€˜intensity changeâ€™ when moving across administrative levels. Indirect drivers tend to show low <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> whereas direct drivers show high <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> as they operate in a non-linear way across the administrative scale. Thus policies addressing direct drivers of change, in particular, need to take scale into consideration during their formulation. Moreover, such policies must have a strong spatial focus, which can be achieved either by encouraging localâ€“regional policy making or by introducing high flexibility in (inter) national policies to accommodate increased differentiation at lower administrative levels. High quality data is available for several drivers, however, the availability of consistent data at all levels for non-anthropogenic drivers is a major constraint to mapping and assessing their <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This lack of data may hinder effective policy making for environmental management, since it restricts the ability to fully account for <b>scale</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of natural drivers in policy design...|$|R
