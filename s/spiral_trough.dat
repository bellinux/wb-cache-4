The study is based on Eulerian approach and RING K-E turbulence modelin. The results focus on particulate-flow characteristics such as velocity, and distribution and concentration of particulates on the <b>spiral</b> <b>trough.</b> The predicted results are compared with the experimentalin case LD 9 coal spiral.

40|$|Coal spirals {{are widely}} used in coal {{preparation}} plants {{around the world to}} clean fine coal, typically in the 1 x 0. 15 mm size range. Despite their popularity and the trend toward increased automation in modern coal preparation plants, adjustments to the critical process variable for coal spirals, i. e., product splitter position, continue to be done manually. Since spiral feed in a plant tends to fluctuate on a regular basis, timely manual adjustment of splitter position in tens or hundreds of spirals operating in a plant is nearly impossible. As a result, the clean coal yield from a spiral and also the overall plant suffers on a regular basis. The main goal {{of this study was to}} develop a suitable sensor and control system to adjust the product splitter position of a full-scale spiral. Some of the basic properties of coal slurry were thoroughly investigated for their on-line measurability and for their correlations with the density of the constituent solid particles. After experimenting with electrical capacitance- and conductivity- (i. e., reciprocal of resistivity) based sensing techniques, a conductivity-based tube sensor was developed for measuring density of solid particles in the <b>spiral</b> <b>trough.</b> Two sensors were used to establish a density gradient in the critical region across the <b>spiral</b> <b>trough</b> at the discharge end. Based on this continuously monitored density gradient, a PIC 24 microcontroller was programmed to send a signal to a DC gear motor that would move the splitter arm in the appropriate direction when sufficient variation in conductivity was detected. Currently, a cycle time of 5 minutes is used for the spiral control system; however, in a commercial application, the cycle time could be lengthened to 30 or 60 minutes. The automation system has been validated by examining the performance of a full-scale spiral while deliberately changing factors like feed solid content, feed washability characteristics, and feed slurry ionic concentration. With a full-scale compound spiral programmed to achieve a specific gravity of separation at 1. 65 by an automatic adjustment of the splitter position, the actual D 50 values achieved for two separate tests were 1. 64 and 1. 73. The close proximity of target and actual D 50 values is indicative of the effectiveness of the developed system. The next step in near-term commercialization of this proprietary spiral control system will be a longer term (several months) in-plant demonstration.

40|$|International audienceWe combine {{observations}} of stratigraphy, morphology, and atmospheric processes {{to relate the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> on Mars' polar layered deposits to a class of features known as cyclic steps. Cyclic steps are quasi-stable, repeating, and upstream-migrating bed forms that have been studied in terrestrial and submarine environments. The repeating pattern is bounded by hydraulic jumps, which act to stabilize the form. We use radar stratigraphy from the Shallow Radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to examine trough evolution and constrain lateral transport. We examine visible images from the Thermal Emission Imaging System and observe low-altitude clouds that we interpret {{to be the result}} of katabatic jumps, i. e., the Aeolian counterpart of hydraulic jumps in open channel flow. We then devise a theoretical framework for understanding the origin of the <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> that agree with 10 criteria that should be explained for any scenario to satisfactorily model the <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs.</b> Finally, we use Froude and geometrical analysis to estimate the rate of upstream migration caused by katabatic winds for the <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs...</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> {{in the ice}} cap {{are formed}} by {{katabatic}} winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the troughs, likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} theory {{to study the}} origin of large-scale <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> on the Mars residual polar caps, starting with the hypothesis that atmospheric circulation governs the planform of the troughs via an instability that operates in the flow direction of surface winds. This concept can explain why the <b>troughs</b> <b>spiral</b> at each pole in an opposite sense to that expected for Coriolis-deflected winds. The instability arises from interactions on water ice, assumed to contain dust, and depends on how the exchange of atmospheric dust and moisture (H 2 O) with the polar cap surface controls its albedo and mass and energy balance. Our model predicts spatial patterns to form when moisture is carried by wind over the surface, owing to unstable coupling between the albedo and the H 2 O-vapor pressure. The resulting albedo pattern causes an alternating "accumulation-ablation'' mass balance, so that an undulating topography develops which resembles the (dark) troughs and their adjacent (bright) smooth terrains on the polar caps. Because the albedo patterning process is fast, whereas topographic evolution is slow, we suggest that an ancient imprint in the surface albedo preconditions today's trough morphology...|$|R

40|$|The 1 : 500 K-scale {{geologic}} map of MTM 85200 - the Olympia Cavi region of Mars - has been submitted for peer review [1]. Physiographically, the quadrangle includes portions of Olympia Rupes, {{a set of}} sinuous scarps which elevate Planum Boreum ~ 800 meters above Olympia Planum. The region includes the high-standing, <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> of Boreales Scopuli, the rugged and deep depressions of Olympia Cavi, and the vast dune fields of Olympia Undae. Geologically, the mapped units and landforms reflect {{the recent history of}} repeated accumulation and degradation. The widespread occurrence of both weakly and strongly stratified units implicates the drape-like accumulation of ice, dust, and sand through climatic variations. Similarly, the occurrence of layer truncations, particularly at unit boundaries, implicates punctuated periods of both localized and regional erosion and surface deflation whereby underlying units were exhumed and their material transported and re-deposited. Herein, we focus on the iterative mapping approaches that allowed not only the accommodation of the burgeoning variety and volume of data sets, but also facilitated the efficient presentation of map information. Unit characteristics and their geologic history are detailed in past abstracts [2 - 3]...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMartian polar regions host active {{regional}} wind circulations, {{such as the}} downslope katabatic winds which develop {{owing to}} near-surface radiative cooling and sloped topography. Many observations (stratigraphy from radar profiling, frost streaks, spectral analysis of ices) concur to show that aeolian processes {{play a key role}} in glacial processes in Martian polar regions. A spectacular manifestation of this resides in elongated clouds that forms within the polar <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs,</b> a series of geological depressions in Mars’ polar caps. Here we report mesoscale atmospheric modeling in Martian polar regions making use of five nested domains operating a model downscaling from horizontal resolutions of twenty kilometers to 200  m in a typical polar trough. We show that strong katabatic jumps form at the bottom of polar troughs with an horizontal morphology and location similar to trough clouds, large vertical velocity (up to + 3  m/s) and temperature perturbations (up to 20 K) propitious to cloud formation. This strongly suggests that trough clouds on Mars are caused by katabatic jumps forming within polar troughs. This phenomena is analogous to the terrestrial Loewe phenomena over Antarctica’s slopes and coastlines, resulting in a distinctive “wall of snow” during katabatic events. Our mesoscale modeling results thereby suggest that trough clouds might be present manifestations of the ice migration processes that yielded the internal cap structure discovered by radar observations, as part of a “cyclic step” process. This has important implications for the stability and possible migration over geological timescales of water ice surface reservoirs—and, overall, for the evolution of Mars’ polar caps over geological timescales...|$|R
40|$|Boundary waves often form at the {{interface}} between ice and fluid flowing adjacent to it, such as ripples under river ice covers, and steps on the bed of supraglacial meltwater channels. They may also be formed by wind, such as the megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet. <b>Spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> on the polar ice caps of Mars have been interpreted to be cyclic steps formed by katabatic wind blowing over ice. Cyclic steps are relatives of upstream-migrating antidunes. Cyclic step formation on ice {{is not only a}} mechanical but also a thermodynamic process. There have been very few studies on the formation of either cyclic steps or upstream-migrating antidunes on ice. In this study, we performed flume experiments to reproduce cyclic steps on ice by flowing water, and found that trains of steps form when the Froude number is larger than unity. The features of those steps allow them to be identified as ice-bed analogs of cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers. We performed a linear stability analysis and obtained a physical explanation of the formation of upstream-migrating antidunes, i. e., precursors of cyclic steps. We compared the results of experiments with the predictions of the analysis and found the observed steps fall in the range where the analysis predicts interfacial instability. We also found that short antidune-like undulations formed as a precursor to the appearance of well-defined steps. This fact suggests that such antidune-like undulations correspond to the instability predicted by the analysis and are precursors of cyclic steps...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of the Martian north and south polar residual caps are marked by unusual ice features: dark spiralesque troughs up to 1 km deep, 10 km wide and 300 km long appear on both ice caps, and circular pits {{that make up the}} “Swiss-cheese” terrain appear on the south polar cap. Both types of features are of interest to researchers as a potential means of understanding ice composition and flow rates. Some glaciers of the McMurdo Dry Valleys have surface features unknown elsewhere on terrestrial glaciers, including canyons over 6 km long, 100 m wide, and tens of meters deep, and basins up to 100 m across. High sublimation, dust accumulation, and very little melting, is key to their origin. These processes and ice landforms are suggested as terrestrial analogs for the sublimation behavior of Martian icecaps, where dust accumulation and sublimation are significant, but surface melting is absent. We have developed a solar radiation model of canyon formation and have applied it to the Martian polar caps. The modeled processes do well to describe direct and reflected radiation within V-grooves, a process that may be significant {{in the development of the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>troughs</b> and Swiss cheese terrain. The model fails to reproduce the low observed slopes of the Martian troughs. The grooves are too shallow, with opening angles ~ 165 °, compared to model predictions of ~ 90 °. The reason for the failure may be that we have not included creep closure, which should flatten their slopes...|$|R
