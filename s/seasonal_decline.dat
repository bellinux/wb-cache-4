We tested a combination of experimental and observational predictions to evaluate ten hypotheses, representing both evolutionary and proximate mechanisms proposed to explain <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in avian clutch size. In line with long held life-history theory, we found strong support for both an evolved and proximate response to food availability for young. We also found evidence consistent with predictions that proximate level experiential nest predation influences <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in clutch size. Finally, older females appear to invest more in reproduction (initiate nests earlier and lay larger clutches) and choose better territories than younger females.

Due to the tropical climate of Southeast Asia, conditions for migration and absconding are possible year round, though predation pressure is severe in many areas.

5000|$|Cow Island {{was used}} as a {{steamboat}} landing from about the early 1860s to late 1880s. During this approximately 20-year period, freight was transported to the Montana gold fields by Missouri River steamboat. [...] The destination of the steamboats was Fort Benton at the upper limit of steamboat navigation on the Missouri. In mid to late summer river volumes went into <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline.</b> The river became shallower, and heavier draft steamboats could not pass a series of rapids above Cow Island, specifically the Dauphine Rapids, and thus steamboats could not reach the upriver port of Fort Benton. Steamboats had to offload their freight at a downstream landing in the Missouri Breaks. A common landing site in the breaks was at Cow Island, because the offloaded freight could then be taken overland to Fort Benton using a travel route up Cow Creek. Cow Creek {{was one of the few}} routes by which freight wagons could get from the river, up through the breaks, to the plains. Using Cow Creek as a travel route, freight could be moved overland from Cow Island landing on the river through the Missouri breaks onto the Montana prairie and on to Fort Benton.|$|E
40|$|In birds, {{the period}} spent {{brooding}} or guarding young chicks is highly variable, but such variation has seldom been studied. Previous single-year studies of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica and grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma revealed a pronounced <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in brood-guarding duration and {{gave rise to}} the ‘synchronisation hypothesis’, which suggests that some of the variation in the length of the brood-guarding stage is related to predictable seasonal changes in the risk of chick predation. We tested the predictions of this and three other hypotheses in a two-site, four-year study of the black-browed albatross T. melanophris. The existence of a pronounced <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in brood-guarding duration was apparent at both sites, and in years of contrasting food availability, providing further support for the ‘synchronisation hypothesis’. Alternative explanations for this pattern are that short brood-guarding periods for late-hatched chicks result from a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in food availability or from the fact that early nesting birds are of higher individual quality. However, these explanations are at odds with the absence of a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in early chick growth or in probability of chick survival. Furthermore, adult quality (measured as past reproductive performance) had a weak and inconsistent effect on the duration of brood-guarding.

50|$|Some avian species do {{not conform}} to the general clutch-latitude {{relationship}} where clutch size and latitude are proportional to one another (i.e. as latitude increases, clutch size increases). A field study was performed on a single-brooded hole nesting bird by examining 228 Jackdaw (Corvus monedula) nests. The data were collected between 1979 and 1983 in Hoya de Guadix (a region that is north of the province Granada in Spain). The study found that the Jackdaw was an exception to the general clutch size-latitude trend. In fact, they found that increases in latitude decreased the clutch size of this bird species. However, the accuracy of this study can be questioned as the results were observed in one small region (i.e. Hoya de Guadix). Another study looked at seven widespread single-brooded British birds at numerous localities across Britain. The study found that <b>seasonal</b> clutch size <b>declines</b> were not related to latitudinal gradients. However, the researchers found strong <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in clutch size. Moreover, of the three environmental variables that they analyzed (daylight, plant productivity and seasonality), they found that daylight had the most influence on clutch size. The study found little evidence for the direct proportionality between clutch size and latitude.|$|R

To find out which of the explanations apply in Tree SwallowsTachycineta bicolor, we assessed whether replacement clutch size in this species isaffected by an individual female’s ability to lay a certain number of eggs. To do this, wemeasured the decline in clutch size as a function of laying date between first and replacementclutches in individuals that re-nested following natural failure, and compared thiswith the rate of decline in clutch size with laying date for Tree Swallows that laid only asingle clutch in that season. Additionally, we assessed whether the clutch size and therate of its <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> varied across years. We accounted for the truncated andunder-dispersed nature of clutch size data by using a Bayesian approach in the analysis. We found little variation in the rate of clutch size decline across years at our breedingsite. Accounting for this <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in clutch size, mean clutch size was similarbetween single-time breeding females and those that laid replacement clutches, implyingthat the number of eggs laid on the second attempt by female Tree Swallows is determinedby laying date, rather than by the female’s physical ability to produce a clutch ofa certain size. ...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in reproductive success {{is a common}} feature of most organisms. To understand the evolution of breeding seasons and reproductive strategies of individual animals, {{it is necessary to}} assess the extent to which seasonal {{variation in}} reproductive success is causally related to seasonal variation in the environment ('timing' hypothesis), to differences in quality between early and late breeders or their territories ('quality' hypothesis), or to a combination of both. We manipulated timing of breeding in the Great Tit Parus major, a small passerine, to test these hypotheses. A group of experimentally delayed birds was created by removing first clutches, inducing birds to lay a replacement clutch. Reproductive success of delayed pairs was compared with control pairs that bred early and with pairs that bred late. We conclude that seasonal declines in reproductive success at the nestling stage and survival of adult females were caused by differences in quality between early and late breeders. Recruitment of fledglings into the breeding population and the occurrence of second clutches were causally related to the timing of breeding. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in clutch size was caused by a combination of timing and quality effects. We attempted to assess the relative importance of timing and quality in the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in reproductive success, expressed as lifetime production of recruits. We tentatively conclude that 87 % of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in lifetime reproductive success could be attributed to a timing effect per se, whereas quality differences between early and late breeders accounted for the remaining 13 %. ...|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} how free-ranging wild herbivores adjust their food intake rate and nutrient gains {{during the dry}} season. Our study focused on the largest extant grazer, the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum Burchell 1817). Field measurements were made on changes in bite mass, bite rate and nutrient concentrations of food eaten during the dry season. 2. As the dry season progressed, the quality and availability of food resources declined. During this time white rhinos foraged mainly in high-quality short and woodland grasslands. Late in the dry season they also used flushes of green grass in previously burnt Themeda grasslands. 3. Bite mass increased linearly with increasing sward height, while bite rate declined. Intake rate was determined primarily by bite mass and thus tended to increase linearly with sward height. Maximum bite mass and intake rate was obtained in swards > 20 cm. 4. White rhinos did not compensate for <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in food quality by adjusting their food intake rate or diet breadth.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{micronutrient}} pigments {{produced by}} plants that may convey immunological benefits to consumers. Animals {{with high levels}} of carotenoid intake may have improved health and higher survival. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) from broods hatched early in the breeding season are more likely to survive and return to the breeding population than birds hatched later in the season. We hypothesized that breeding adults and nestlings may be affected by seasonal patterns in primary productivity that lead to changes in prey quality and availability; therefore affecting carotenoid intake. We collected blood samples from American Kestrels breeding in nestboxes south of Boise, Idaho and measured carotenoid concentrations via spectrophotometry. Our results supported our hypothesis that there are seasonal patterns in carotenoid availability, but trends did not match our predictions. Adult birds did show <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in carotenoids, while nestlings showed seasonal increases. Further, adult carotenoid levels did not predict nestling levels and there was high annual variation in carotenoid concentrations.

In this study we present the seasonal impacts irrigation practices can have on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region, where the average annual rain/PET ratio is 1. 0. In this system the irrigation expansion is solely supported by groundwater pumping, but despite this only 5 boreholes are monitored for hydraulic head data. In this study, we compensate the scarce hydrophysical dataset by incorporating environmental tracers (major ions, δ 18 O, δ 2 H and δ 13 C) and dating tracers (3 H, CFC, SF 6 and 14 C). Results indicate that at 9 of the 15 irrigation sites investigated, groundwater pumping for irrigation has induced the mixing of recent groundwater (up to 20 years). The changes in flow pathways, induced by irrigation, also results in <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in groundwater NO 3 concentrations due to mixing with older waters. In temperate humid areas, such evaluations of the seasonal evolution of water residence time, mixing process, and agrochemical contaminants are an important contribution to real water resources management in irrigated catchments...|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} heterogeneity in relative fitness of competing species {{is a key}} factor affecting the structure of communities. However, it is not intuitive why species that are ecologically similar should differ in their response to environmental changes.

The fitness of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), which are dominant in interference competition, is more sensitive than the fitness of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in environmental conditions. In order to control {{for the possibility that}} this pattern arises solely from differences in microhabitat use (i. e. a local niche differentiation), we performed a partial cross-fostering experiment of young between the two species (i. e. resulting in nests containing young of both species). Our results show that the growth of nestling pied flycatchers is less influenced by the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in environmental conditions. We suggest that a life-history trade-off between interference competitive ability and robustness to harsh environment promotes a regional coexistence of the two species...|$|E
40|$|In {{seasonally}} fluctuating environments, {{timing of}} reproduction {{is a crucial}} determinant of fitness. Studies of birds show that late breeding attempts generally result in offspring of lower reproductive value, with lower recruitment and long-term survival prospects. Several proximate mechanisms, including a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> of immune system functioning, {{may lead to a}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> of offspring fitness. We investigated seasonal variation in offspring quality by subjecting first- and second-brood chicks of a sexually size dimorphic species, the European starling Sturnus vulgaris, to an immune challenge with a bacterial endotoxin (LPS), and evaluated their growth and physiological response in terms of total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC), concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites and hematocrit. LPS challenge did not affect chick growth or oxidative status. However, hematocrit of second-brood chicks was higher in LPS chicks compared to controls. Body mass halfway through the rearing period (days 8 - 9 post-hatching), TAC and hematocrit were lower among second- vs. first-brood chicks. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism in body mass at days 8 - 9 post-hatching markedly differed between broods, first-brood males being 4. 7 % and second-brood males 22. 7 % heavier than their sisters, respectively. Pre-fledging mortality occurred among second-brood chicks only and was strongly female-biased. Our findings suggest that starling chicks, even if in poor conditions, are little affected by a bacterial challenge, at least in the short-term. Moreover, our study indicates that sex differences in body size, possibly mediated by sex-specific maternal investment in egg size, may heavily impact on pre-fledging survival in a different way {{in the course of the}} breeding season, resulting in sex-specific <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> of offspring fitness. Finally, we suggest that levels of circulating antioxidants should be regarded among the proximate causes of the association between timing of fledging and long-term survival in avian species...|$|E
40|$|Age-specific {{reproductive}} parameters, including reproductive success, {{of young}} (four and five-year old) and older (> 7 years old) breeding Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) were compared on a colony at Coats Island, N. W. T. in 1990 and 1991. Young birds laid smaller eggs {{later in the}} season than older birds. Older birds had higher hatching and reproductive success than young birds, but fledging success did not differ. The chicks of young birds at 14 days were lighter and smaller than those of older birds. There was a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in hatching and reproductive success in both years for the total sample, but no <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in fledging success. Most losses occurred during the incubation period, with a decreasing likelihood of laying a replacement egg as the season progressed. Age-related improvement in breeding success may have been due in part to breeding experience. Second time breeders laid earlier than in their first year, and improved their reproductive success. Five-year olds breeding for the second time bred earlier and more successfully than five-year olds breeding for the first time. Differential survival in relation to reproductive success was not observed. Birds which performed poorly in their first year were not less likely to return to breed in the next year than birds which performed well in their first year. Different proportions of young and older birds breeding throughout the season affected the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in reproductive success of the overall colony. Young and older birds separately showed no seasonal changes (except a slight decline in reproductive success in older birds in one year), but when combined they had a similar <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in hatching and reproductive success as the total sample. In order to control for differences in timing of laying between young and older birds, a sample of early laying, presumably older breeders were experimentally delayed c. 14 days. Age, rather than timing of laying influenced the decline in reproductive success. Young birds had significantly lower hatching and reproductive success than experimental breeders. Although the chicks of younger birds were significantly smaller than experimental chicks, there was no decline in food availability detected {{at the end of the}} season, suggesting that young birds were not able to provision their chicks as well as more experienced breeders. Breeding site characteristics had some effect on the reproductive success of young and older breeders. Older birds were more successful on sites which had neighbours. Site characteristics did not affect the success of young birds in 1990, but birds nesting on sites with neighbours and walls showed improved success in 1991. Young birds were less successful than older birds on all types of sites, and more likely to be found on suboptimal sites. The lack of decline in reproductive success with date when age was controlled, and the high reproductive success of experimentally delayed birds suggest that it is the competence of young breeders, rather than the date at which they lay, that determines their reproductive success. The high proportion of young Thick-billed Murres that lay {{later in the season}} may be the main cause of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in reproductive success for the colony as a whole...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Fertility, hatchability, {{and their}} {{relationships}} to age of dam, egg components, embryo growth, and embryo lipid transfer were studied in a broiler breeder line segregating at the sex-linked feathering locus. Early-season increases in hatchability of eggs {{were due to}} a reduction in embryo deaths between Day 1 and 7 of incubation. No late <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in either fertility or hatchability were observed. Although less proficient in young dams, embryo lipid transfer was not directly associated with the lower hatchability of then-eggs. Egg weight, weights of 18 -day embryos, and embryo:egg ratios increased with parental age. Also with age, there were increases in shell, albumen, and yolk weights. Heavier albumen weight was due to increased moisture content, and those for shell and yolk were due to dry matter accumulation. Changes in yoUc albumen ratios reflected large increases in relative yolk weight, on a wet and dry weight basis, that were associated with age of dam. Eggs from late-feathering dams were heavier than those from early-feathering ones. Heavier embryos by 18 days of incubation were attributed to the transfer of albumen from the egg to the embryo. {Key words: age of dam, egg components, embryo lipid transfer, hatchability, chickens...|$|R

We investigated nitrogen relations and photosynthesis of several dominant species at shallow groundwater sites in Owens Valley, California. We measured soil nitrogen (N) availability, leaf N and isotopes, water isotopes, and gas exchange of dominant shrub species Atriplex torreyi and Ericameria nauseosa and grass species Distichlis spicata throughout the summer season in three sites that had similar watertable depths, but that varied in community composition and N availability. Surface soil inorganic N was greatest at the grassland site and declined from June to September at all sites. Leaf N declined throughout the season in all species, and was correlated with soil inorganic N. Photosynthesis of A. torreyi remained relatively constant throughout the season. In contrast, D. spicata and E. nauseosa experienced <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in photosynthesis at sites with greater inorganic N availability.

40|$|Transgenic crops {{producing}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins {{are used}} worldwide to control major pests {{of corn and}} cotton. Development of strategies to delay the evolution of pest resistance to Bt crops requires an understanding of factors affecting responses to natural selection, which include variation in survival on Bt crops, heritability of resistance, and fitness advantages associated with resistance mutations. The two main strategies adopted for delaying resistance are the refuge and pyramid strategies. Both can reduce heritability of resistance, but pyramids can also delay resistance by reducing genetic variation for resistance. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in the concentration of Bt toxins in transgenic cultivars, however, can increase the heritability of resistance. The fitness advantages associated with resistance mutations can be reduced by agronomic practices, including increasing refuge size, manipulating refuges to increase fitness costs, and manipulating Bt cultivars to reduce fitness of resistant individuals. Manipulating costs and fitness of resistant individuals on transgenic insecticidal crops may be especially important for thwarting evolution of resistance in haplodiploid and parthenogenetic pests. Field-evolved resistance to Bt crops in only five pests during the last 14 years suggests that the refuge strategy has successfully delayed resistance, but the accumulation of resistant pests could accelerate...|$|R
40|$|We use a game-theoretic {{framework}} {{to investigate the}} reproductive phenology of female kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). As in the other semelparous species of Pacific salmon, females construct nests in gravel, spawn with males, bury their fertilized eggs, and defend their nest sites until they die several days later. Later-breeding females may reuse previous nest sites, and their digging behavior is thought to subject previously buried eggs to mortality. Using game-theoretic models, we show that females can reduce this risk by allocating resources to longevity (the period between arrival and death) as opposed to eggs. Waiting before territory settlement is also expected if it allows females to conserve energy and delay senescence. The models demonstrate how these costs and benefits interact to select for a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in longevity, a well-known phenomenon in the salmonid literature, and a <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in wait duration.

Experiments with model eggs showed that over this 12 -year period there was a marked decline in host rejection of non-mimetic eggs, from rejection at 75 % of reed warbler nests in 1985 to 1986 to 25 %, nests in 1997. Calculations suggest that this decline in host defences is too rapid to reflect only genetic change, and {{is more likely to be}} the outcome of adaptive phenotypic flexibility.

Second, although rejection did not vary with proximity to a naturally parasitized nest within the 3. 4 km 2 of Wicken Fen and its surrounds, there was no rejection at a small unparasitized population 11 km away.

A questionnaire was sent by mail to all producers; information on management factors that would potentially influence parasite burdens in the herds was obtained from 239 farms. Data on annual milk production, summer milk production (July-September) and <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in milk production {{were obtained from}} the Animal Productivity and Health Information Network (APHIN) database. Associations between management practices and ODs, and between ODs and milk-production parameters were studied. Some management practices known to be associated with parasite burdens had expected directions of association with the ODs, giving supporting evidence that the ELISA is a reasonable measure of parasite burden. Most notably, ODs were increased with greater exposure of heifers or milking cows to pasture. ODs were not associated with either annual milk production or <b>seasonal</b> <b>decline</b> in milk production. However, there was a substantial relationship between the herd OD value and the level of milk production during the summer. An increase in the OD from 0. 58 to 0. 83 (the interquartile range of ODs) was associated with a reduction in production of 1. 25 kg/cow/day.

40|$|Pathogens are {{considered}} to drive ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant populations, but we lack data measuring the population-level consequences of infection in wild plant-pathogen interactions. Moreover, while it is often assumed that offseason environmental conditions drive <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in pathogen population size, {{little is known about}} how offseason environmental conditions impact the survival of pathogen resting stages, and how critical the offseason is for the next season's epidemic. The fungal pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis persists as a dynamic metapopulation in the large network of Plantago lanceolata host populations. Here, we analyze long-term data to measure the spatial synchrony of epidemics and consequences of infection for over 4000 host populations. Using a theoretical model, we study whether large-scale environmental change could synchronize disease occurrence across the metapopulation. During 2001 - 2013 exposure to freezing decreased, while pathogen extinction-colonization-persistence rates became more synchronized. Simulations of a theoretical model suggest that increasingly favorable winter conditions for pathogen survival could drive such synchronization. Our data also show that infection decreases host population growth. These results confirm that mild winter conditions increase pathogen overwintering success and thus increase disease prevalence across the metapopulation. Further, we conclude that the pathogen can drive host population growth in the Plantago-Podosphaera system...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{sequential}} size-based hydroacoustic {{surveys conducted}} with a 200 kHz split-beam transducer during the summers of 2011 and 2012 {{were used to}} quantify <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in fish abundance in a boreal reservoir in Manitoba, Canada. Fish densities were sufficiently low to enable single target resolution and tracking. Target strengths converted to log 2 -based size-classes indicated that smaller fish were consistently more abundant than larger fish {{by a factor of}} approximately 3 for each halving of length. For all size classes, in both years, abundance (natural log) declined linearly over the summer at rates that varied from - 0. 067 x day(- 1) for the smallest fish to - 0. 016 x day(- 1) for the largest (R 2 = 0. 24 - 0. 97). Inter-annual comparisons of size-based abundance suggested that for larger fish (> 16 cm), mean winter decline rates were an order of magnitude lower (- 0. 001 x day(- 1)) and overall survival higher (71 %) than in the main summer fishing season (mean loss rate - 0. 038 x day(- 1); survival 33 %). We conclude that size-based acoustic survey methods have the potential to assess within-season fish abundance dynamics, and may prove useful in long-term monitoring of productivity and hence management of boreal aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Size-selective {{predation}} by fish {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a primary driver of <b>seasonal</b> <b>declines</b> in large-bodied Daphnia populations. However, large Daphnia commonly exhibit midsummer extinctions in ponds lacking plank-tivorous fish. A number of empirical and theoretical studies suggest that resource competition and its interaction with nutrient enrichment may determine variable dominance by large Daphnia. Low resource levels may favor competitive dominance by small-bodied taxa while large Daphnia may be favored under high resource conditions or following a nutrient/productivity pulse. Nutrient enrichment may also influence the strength of invertebrate predation on Daphnia by affecting how long vulnerable juveniles are exposed to predation. We investigated these hypotheses using an in situ mesocosm experiment in a permanent fishless pond that exhibited seasonal losses of Daphnia pulex. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment, Daphnia plus a diverse assemblage of small-bodied zooplankton were exposed to three levels of enrichment (low, medium, and high). To explore the interaction between nutrient enrichment and invertebrate predation, we crossed the presence/absence of Notonecta undulata with low and high nutrient manipulations. We found no evidence of competitive reversals or shifts in dominance among nutrient levels, Daphnia performed poorly regardless of enrichment. This may have been due to shifts in algal composition to dominance by large filamentous green algae. Notonecta had significant negative effects o...|$|R
