40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In {{the paper}} are shown selective elements of chassis of {{open cast mining}} machines: control <b>steering</b> <b>track</b> and caterpillar tracks of open cast mining machines. Loads on each element are defined in accordance with current standard requirements norms. After setting boundary conditions, stress analysis was done. Results of analysis are shown in the table. Indication of the most endangered places {{was based on the}} results of analysis. Strain gauges measurements were also performed in 9 measuring points: 6 points on track's supports, 2 on caterpillar’s support and one on steering control. The measurements were taken by multichannel recorder during the driving of the conveyor. The measurements were taken for many settings of the body and the chassis with different angles of steering set. After examination of the measurement results some figures were obtained that show turning of caterpillar sets, increasing and decreasing steering force and track force on caterpillar during driving and turning...|$|E

50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or rear-wheel <b>steering.</b> <b>Tracked</b> vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering — that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using clutches and brakes, to bring about a change of course or direction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative learning control (ILC) {{design for a}} vehicle Steer-by-Wire (SbW) system. First, the SbW system is modeled as a second-order system from the steering motor input voltage to the front wheel angle. For simplicity, the self-aligning torque and the friction between the tires and various road surfaces are treated as unknown external disturbance imposed at the SbW system input. Next, a discretetime ILC is designed for the SbW system under the scenario that the steering reference command is periodic. The ILC is essentially a feedforward control approach which utilizes past information of the control loop to further reduce the tracking error in each iteration. Finally, simulation is carried out to validate {{the performance of the}} ILC design. It is shown that the <b>steering</b> <b>tracking</b> error achieved by the ILC is much smaller than a conventional PD controller...|$|R

50|$|All {{vehicles}} {{are susceptible to}} rollovers to various extents. Generally, rollover tendency increases with {{the height of the}} center of mass, narrowness of the axle <b>track,</b> <b>steering</b> sensitivity, and increased speed.|$|R
50|$|Tractors can be {{generally}} classified by {{number of axles}} or wheels, with main categories of two-wheel tractors (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are two-wheel drive (usually at the rear); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, four-wheel drive (often with articulated <b>steering),</b> or <b>track</b> tractors (with steel or rubber tracks).|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{excavator}} follows requirements of machines for demolition work. The excavator is equipped with an innovative type of under carriage, which not only increases mobility over the demolition sites but also the visibility from the driver’s cabin. The components of the excavator, that improve the demolition work, are special types of tracks, suspensions and articulated <b>steering.</b> <b>Tracks</b> can change their shape to increase the stability and also {{to adapt to the}} diff erent types of ground. The suspensions with tracks are able to adapt to the terrain thereby they lighten the asperity. Suspension can also tilt or even raise the excavator and thereby increase the angle of visibility from the cabin. This function is necessary mainly when taking down higher constructions. Articulated steering is a new function that has never been used for excavators. This steering was chosen due to fl exible movement over demolition sites. The main aim of the project is to create a new {{design of the}} excavator, but more importantly to distinguish the excavator from the excavators already on the market, with regards to its esthetics and under carriage innovation...|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after the}} launch of the Mk2F, another {{sporting}} model was added to the range — {{a new version of the}} supercharged G40, now as a full production model in all markets, rather than the limited batch of Mk2 G40s. Engine and gearbox aside, mechanical differences between the G40 and similar looking GT included 20 mm lower suspension, 239 mm vented front brake discs and rose-jointed <b>steering</b> and <b>track</b> control arms. The G40 was also marked out by its Le Mans check interior trim, roof-mounted 'bee-sting' aerial and BBS 5.5Jx13 cross-spoke alloy wheels, while the speedometer topped out at 160 mph (compared to 120 mph on the GT).|$|R
50|$|The SAME 3R/10, a {{universal}} small tractor {{powered by a}} single cylinder 10 HP petrol engine, was presented in 1948. This machine had two driving wheels and a single <b>steering</b> wheel, variable <b>track</b> and reversible drive. The tractor was awarded the gold medal by the Turin Agricultural Academy. On 24 October 1948, the “Giornale dell’Agricoltura” described it as “a gem of Italian industry”.|$|R
50|$|An {{operational}} vehicle can {{be driven}} on-board {{under its own}} power. This is a delicate operation, particularly with tracks, as their precise steering is limited.

40|$|Determining {{the spatial}} {{position}} of a speaker finds a growing interest in video conference scenario where automated camera <b>steering</b> and <b>tracking</b> are required. As a preliminary step for the localization, microphone array {{can be used to}} extract the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the speech signal. The direction of arrival of the speech signal is then determined by the relative time delay between each, spatially separated, microphone pairs. In this work we present novel, frequency domain, approaches for TDOA calculation in a reverberant and noisy environment. Our methods are based on the speech quasi-stationarity property, and {{on the fact that the}} speech and the noise are uncorrelated. The proposed methods are supported by an extensive experimental study. ...|$|R
50|$|A new {{active safety}} feature called the Driver Monitoring System debuted on the LS 600h L sedan.

25|$|One {{solution}} to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one <b>track.</b> <b>Steering</b> is accomplished by changing gears on one and not the other. This maintains power to both <b>tracks</b> while <b>steering,</b> produces {{a wide range of}} turning circles, and even allows one track to be reversed while the other moves forward, allowing the tank to turn in place. This may be combined with brakes to further control the steering radius.|$|R
30|$|Our robot was {{fabricated}} from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), {{which has}} a low elastic modulus and a high Poisson ratio. Because it is highly deformable, the robot can be readily steered through various vessel branches using a low-level magnetic field. A permanent magnet placed {{at the end of}} the PDMS beam is used for steering. To verify robot deformation and effective steering, we used a mathematical model based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam and a finite element model (FEM) to predict the deformation angles of the microrobot tip. We compared the results of the mathematical model, the FEM simulation, and the experimental values. To demonstrate its practical utility, we performed <b>steering</b> and <b>tracking</b> using a complex two-dimensional phantom. To demonstrate the potential of the robot, we performed biocompatibility testing using human colorectal cancer (HCT 116) cells.|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at {{improving}} traction control characteristics for wheel loaders and haulers. At present, drivers of these machines can choose between open or closed differentials but often they prefer to lock the differentials, thus distributing the torque equally between the wheels and thereby almost always avoiding wheel slip. However, locked differentials cause increased wear of the driveline, increased fuel consumption and greater tyre wear. Therefore it is worthwhile to investigate other solutions such as limited slip differentials or differentials with a clutch where the torque is distributed as necessary among the driving wheels.

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{innovative}} front wheel drive, an idiosyncratic feature {{at the front}} of the Taunus P4 involved the front suspension arms which were connected to the engine/gearbox block, thereby fulfilling an unconventional supporting function. Above them, the transversely mounted leaf-springs were linked to a cross-member which was attached to the floor pan, and thereby part of the monocoque bodyshell. In the autumn of 1964 the various elements were rearranged and it became possible to soften the front suspension significantly: after this it was reported that the level of engine vibration reaching the driver was much reduced. However, these rearrangements also incorporated a weakening of the anti-roll control {{at the front of}} the car which now was in danger of leaning excessively when cornering. This effect was countered by the substitution of more firmly set up shock absorbers while two additional support connections were added at the front in order to make the <b>steering</b> and <b>tracking</b> more precisely controllable.|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the spatial}} {{position}} of a speaker finds a growing interest in video conference scenario where automated camera <b>steering</b> and <b>tracking</b> are required. Speaker localization can be achieved with a dual step approach. In the preliminary stage microphone array is used to extract the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the speech signal. These readings are then used by the second stage for the actual localization. Since speaker trajectory must be smooth, estimates of close speaker positions {{might be used to}} improve the current position estimate. However, many methods, although exploiting the spatial information obtained by different microphone pairs, do not exploit this temporal information. In this contribution we present two localization schemes, which exploit the temporal information. The first is the well known extended Kalman filter (EKF). The second is a recursive form of a Gauss method, which we denote Recursive Gauss (RG). Experimental study supports the potential of the proposed methods. ...|$|R
