30|$|Let us have {{a closer}} look on how an {{externally}} reported vulnerability in a shipped software version is fixed: First, an external reporter (e.g., customer or independent security researcher) contacts the security response team, which assigns a case manager. The case manager is responsible for driving the decision if a reported problem is a security vulnerability {{that needs to be}} fixed, and for ensuring that the confirmed vulnerability is fixed and that a patch is released. After vulnerability is confirmed, the case manager contacts the development team and often also a dedicated maintenance team (called IMS) to ensure that a fix is developed and back-ported to all necessary older releases (according to SAP’s support and maintenance contracts). The developed fixes are subject to a special security test by the security validation team and, moreover, the response teams reviews the SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Note.</b> If the technical fix as well as the resulting <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> passes the quality checks, the <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> is made available to customers individually and/or {{in the form of a}} support package (usually on the first Tuesday of a month). Support packages are functional updates that also contain the latest <b>security</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|R

30|$|Fixing {{vulnerabilities}} in released code {{requires the}} involvement of yet more teams within SAP, as well as additional steps, e.g., for back-porting fixes to older releases and providing patches (called SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Notes)</b> to customers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{security}} vulnerability in TREX {{was first}} identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> 2234226)https://www.scmagazineuk.com/bugs-in-sap-hana-allowed-remote-code-execution/article/530856/. The vulnerability occurred {{due to lack}} of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality.|$|R

Like any pattern-recognition technology, live-tissue verifiers will have their own false-reject probability and will therefore further reduce the overall probability that a legitimate user is accepted by the sensor.|$|R
50|$|Later on, ERPScan head {{of threat}} {{intelligence}} Mathieu Geli {{continued to look}} into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable https://erpscan.com/press-center/press-release/critical-vulnerability-affects-sap-hana-dozen-sap-applications/. Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/13/sap_trex_patch/. The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> 2419592.|$|R

50|$|The latest {{versions}} of FSB use the compression function Whirlpool to further compress the hash output.

50|$|In total, {{the vendor}} has {{released}} 25 security patches (aka SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Notes).</b> One {{of the most}} notorious vulnerabilities was closed among the set of fixes released in March 2017.

Also, researchers who identified the security issues pointed out that the vulnerability allows an attacker to download ransomware on the SAP server that would be automatically installed on every workstation within a company.|$|R

Despite singer Axl Rose's requests that the crowd {{move away from the}} stage, two fans were trampled to death. Media largely blamed Guns N' Roses for the tragedy, and reported that the band had continued playing despite the dangerous crowd conditions. However, the venue's head of <b>security</b> <b>noted</b> that the band had not been aware of the extent of fan injuries, had immediately halted their set when requested to do so, and had attempted to calm the crowd.|$|R

5000|$|Based on Win's evidence, Robert Kelley, {{a former}} weapons inspector, said he {{believed}} Burma [...] "has the intent to go nuclear and it is... expending huge resources along the way." [...] But as of 2010, experts said that Burma {{was a long way}} from succeeding, given the poor quality of their current materials. Despite Kelley's analysis, some experts are uncertain that a nuclear weapons programme exists; for example, the Institute for Science and International <b>Security</b> <b>notes</b> ambiguity as to whether certain equipment is used for uranium production, or for innocently producing [...] "rare earth metals or metals such as titanium or vanadium." [...] The U.S. expressed concern in 2011 about possible NPT violations, but by 2012 stated that its concerns had been [...] "partially allayed." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2016, Ars Technica IT editor Sean Gallagher {{reviewed}} the publicly available evidence, and wrote that attribution of the DNC hacks to Russian intelligence {{was based on}} clues from attack methods and similarity to other cases, as the hacking was tracked in real time since May 2016 by CrowdStrike's monitoring tools. Cybersecurity analyst Jeffrey Carr stated that CrowdStrike's inferences pointing at the Russian intelligence services were baseless because the incriminated X-Agent tool was freely available for anyone to download. Wordfence and Errata <b>Security</b> <b>noted</b> that the PHP malware referenced in the Joint Analysis Report was an out-of-date version [...] "used by hundreds if not thousands of hackers, mostly associated with Russia, but also {{throughout the rest of}} the world." ...|$|R
