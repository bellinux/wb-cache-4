50|$|Iron-deficiency anemia {{is mainly}} caused by blood loss, such as may occur during menses or {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage. This often results in a depapilled, atrophic glossitis, giving the tongue a bald and shiny appearance, along with pallor (paleness) of the lips and other mucous membranes a tendency towards recurrent oral ulceration, and cheilosis (swelling of the lips). The appearance of the tongue in iron deficiency anemia {{has been described as}} diffuse or patchy atrophy with tenderness or burning.

5000|$|Some {{systemic}} {{disorders are}} involved in angular cheilitis {{by virtue of their}} association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. [...] Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores {{at the corner of the}} mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, or <b>sideropenic</b> <b>dysphagia</b> (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).|$|E
40|$|Plummer-Vinson {{syndrome}} presents as {{a classical}} triad of dysphagia, {{iron deficiency anemia}} and upper esophageal web(s). The syndrome usually occurs in adults, and is rare in childhood. We report a case of this syndrome occurring in a 15 -year-old boy. He presented with dysphagia and anemia. Radiological examination showed the presence of webs at the cervical esophagus. The boy was treated with endoscopic balloon dilation and iron supplementation and remains in good general condition {{six months after the}} treatment.

40|$|Plummer-Vinson {{syndrome}} (<b>sideropenic</b> <b>dysphagia)</b> {{is characterized}} by dysphagia due to an upper esophageal or hypopharyngeal web in patients with chronic iron deficiency anemia.

This syndrome is thought to be precancerous because squamous cell carcinoma of hypopharynx, oral cavity or esophagus takes place in 10 % of those patients suffering from this malady, but it is even more unusual that Plummer-Vinson syndrome should be accompanied by gastric cancer.

40|$|Abstract - Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} is {{a potent}} pre-cancerous condition which occurs almost exclusively in Indians but cases have been reported from sevurdl countries. The definite aetiology of OSMF is still unknown {{and there is no}} known treatment for it. Chillies, tobacco use, vitamin deficiencies and betel quid chewing have been implicated. Ramanathan is of the view that OSMF seems to be the Asian version of <b>sideropenic</b> <b>dysphagia.</b> He suggests that OSMF appears to be an altered oral mucosa following a prolonged period of chronic deficiency of iron and/or vitamin "B" complex especially folic acid. This changed state of the oral mucosa subsequently appears to develop more easily a hypersensitivity to oral irritants such as spices especially chillies and to the betel quid. We hold that,the hypersensitivity caused by local irritants and the resultant persistant juxta epithelial inflammatory response noted in OSMF (in a host' system already primed by an intrinsic genetic defect) act as the initiating factor leading to a defective inflammatory = reparative response, culminating in fibrotic healing. The role of iron and "B" complex together with others may be contributory (promotor) to this pre-existing pathologic response of the lamina propria.
