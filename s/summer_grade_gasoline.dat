40|$|This paper uses a {{data set}} of daily sales {{at a single}} {{gasoline}} station over a seven year period to determine if consumers respond to relative price changes among the three <b>grades</b> of <b>gasoline.</b> Based on the reasoning of Alchian and Allen (1964) and Barzel (1976), market shares of higher quality gasoline should increase {{at the expense of}} regular <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> when overall gasoline prices increase. The empirical results do not conform to this expectation. We find instead that the consumers in this sample responded to higher gasoline prices by switching to mid <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> from premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> leaving the market share of regular gasoline unchanged.

50|$|In {{order to}} be {{certified}} as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their <b>grades</b> of <b>gasoline</b> meet these standards. However, premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain {{two to three times}} the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than a cent per gallon. In addition to the detergent additive requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{production}} MKS {{rides on}} Ford's D3 platform. The MKS features an independent suspension with MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a 26 mm stabilizer {{bar in the}} front and a multilink coil over shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear; [...] "Lincoln Drive Control" [...] with continuously controlled damping (CCD) available as optional feature. The car features four-wheel antilock disc brakes (12.25 in rotors {{in the front and}} 12.75 in rotors in the rear) with standard AdvanceTrac traction control and Roll Stability Control (RSC). Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4 L Ford/Yamaha V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7 L Duratec DOHC V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's Cyclone engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular <b>grade,</b> 87 octane <b>gasoline</b> or premium <b>grade,</b> 91 octane <b>gasoline.</b> Using regular <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline,</b> the 3.7 L V6 produces 273 hp (204 kW) at 6250 rpm and 270 lb·ft (366 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Using premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> results in a small boost in output to 275 hp (205 kW) at 6250 rpm and 276 lb·ft (374 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Power from the MKS' V6 is transmitted to the wheels via Ford's 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is equipped with SelectShift which simulates the operation of a manual transmission. A road test by Car and Driver magazine of an AWD-equipped MKS recorded acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and a quarter-mile in 15.7 seconds at 90 mi/h km/h. Testers noted the MKS' heavy weight of over 4300 lbs. Ford introduced its EcoBoost V6, an all-aluminum, twin-turbocharged, direct injection 3.5 L DOHC V6, in the 2010 MKS arriving in showrooms in the summer of 2009.|$|R

State Administrative Manual Section (SAM) 4101 establishes the need to comply with minimum preventative maintenance standards listed in the Automobile Maintenance Record, STD. 271. This includes prescribed services and mechanical inspections that promote state vehicle efficiency and achieve optimum fuel mileage.

50|$|Additional unseen {{changes were}} related to Federal Emission Standards and the {{requirement}} that ALL 1971 cars run on unleaded regular <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Compression ratios on all engines were reduced to ~8.5:1. For just this year, engine power and torque specifications were advertised using both the familiar SAE gross rating method (for the last time), and SAE net rating method, which remains the standard today. (Net ratings are more representative of engine output as-installed since they measure output when the engine is fully “dressed” with production intake and exhaust plumbing, cooling system, and accessory loads in place.) Revised ratings for Town and Country engines were: 383 cu. In. 2-BBL V8: 275 (190 net) hp with 375 (305 net) lb-ft; 383 cu. In. 4-BBL V8: 300 (240 net) hp with 410 (310 net) lb-ft; 440 cu.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} numerical and experimental studies to find correlations of octane rating with fuel properties. This thesis {{was based on}} the hypothesis that quenching characteristics at ignition locations impact the flame development. Conversely, determination of quenching characteristics might serve as an effective measure to determine the fuel mixture octane number. This hypothesis was tested with premixed flame experiments using primary reference fuels (iso-octane and n-heptane) and commercial <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Premixed flame experiments were conducted on a flat flame burner. Primary reference fuels of different ratios were taken and correlated to their respective thermal quenching condition by introducing co-flowing inert gasses at room temperature with fuel-air mixture. The inert gasses that were used in the experiment are nitrogen and helium and the results are analyzed using a camera and an imaging spectrometer. The experimental results support the hypothesis that flame quenching can be correlated to fuel mixture octane number, and holds potential as an alternative method to determine the octane number...|$|R
