40|$|Two primary {{detection}} techniques (optical and RF) have {{a proven}} capability for detecting lightning from low earth orbit. However, the lightning processes that generate the optical and RF signals are vastly different providing significantly different information content from each sensor type. Because of the intervening ionosphere, low frequency RF components do not reach satellite altitudes. As a consequence, {{many of the}} processes associated with the major energy release of a lightning event (i. e. return strokes, k-changes, recoil streamers, etc), in all likelihood contribute little to the RF signal arriving at the satellite. The optical output from lighting, on the other hand, {{has been shown to}} be highly correlated with the energetic, charge-transferring processes mentioned above. On the down side, the optical energy, while essentially unaffected by the atmosphere once it emerges from the cloud, is heavily scattered within the cloud. While there is little absorption by the cloud, the great optical depth makes the total light energy emerging from the cloud to be dependent on where in the cloud the lightning occurred. Analyses suggest that when lightning is confined to the lowest regions of the cloud, the light is strongly attenuated and detection becomes problematic. Fortunately, the vast majority of lightning flashes are comprised of channels that propagate through the middle of the cloud and higher. These flashes produce bright signals at the top of a cloud and are readily detectable. Presently, we have two optical instruments in orbit. The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) has been orbiting the earth since April, 1995, while the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was launched on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in November of 1997.

The macroscale fraction of metallic iron varies subtly (0 – 10 %) in quantity and in grain size (60 – 100 μm). Color properties also vary across the inter-ridge regions, indicating variations in regolith maturity. Comparisons of near-infrared ratio-reflectance suggest changes in regolith maturity that are different from those seen on the lunar surface and asteroid 433 Eros, commensurate with Gaspra's higher olivine content. Visible to near-infrared slopes compared to near-ultraviolet to visible slopes are indicative of a nanophase iron content of 0. 01 %– 0. 1 %. Spectral mixing modeling studies of the SSI color spectra show results consistent with the presence of both microphase (> 50 nm) and nanophase (< 50 nm) size iron particulates.

40|$|Introduction: We {{report on}} the {{analysis}} of the Galileo SSI's observations of the volcanic activity at Tvashtar Catena, Io as discussed by Milazzo et al. Galileo's <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Imager</b> (SSI) observed Tvashtar Catena (63 deg N, 120 deg W) four times between November 1999 and October 2001, providing a unique look at the distinctive high latitude volcanism on Io. The November 1999 observation spatially resolved, for the first time, an active extraterrestrial fissure eruption. The brightness temperature of the lavas at the November 1999 fissure eruption was 1300 K. The second observation (orbit I 27, February 2000) showed a large (approx. 500 sq km) region with many, small spots of hot, active lava. The third observation was taken in conjunction with a Cassini observation in December 2000 and showed a Pele-like plume deposition ring, while the Cassini images revealed a 400 km high Pele-type plume above the Catena. The final Galileo SSI observation of Tvashtar was acquired in October 2001, and all obvious (to SSI) activity had ceased, although data from Galileo's Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) indicated that there was still significant thermal emission from the Tvashtar region. We have concentrated on analyzing the style of eruption during orbit I 27 (February 2000). Comparison with a lava flow cooling model indicates that the behavior of the Tvashtar eruption during I 27 does not match that of "simple" advancing lava flows. Instead, it may be an active lava lake or a complex set of lava flows with episodic, overlapping (in time and space) eruptions...|$|E
40|$|In October and November of 1997 the Galileo <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Imager</b> (SSI) {{detected}} lightning from 26 storms on {{the night}} side of Jupiter. More than half the surface area of the planet was surveyed. The data include images of lightning against moonlit clouds (illuminated by light from Io) and images of the same storm on {{the day and night}} sides. The spatial resolution ranged from 23 to 134 km per pixel, while the storms ranged in size up to ∼ 1500 km. Most storms were imaged more than once, and they typically exhibit many flashes per minute. The storms occur only in areas of cyclonic shear and near the centers of westward jets. Latitudes near 50 ° in both hemispheres are particularly active, although the northern hemisphere has more lightning overall. The greatest optical energy observed in a single flash was 1. 6 × 10 ^(10) J, which is several times larger than terrestrial superbolts. The average optical power per unit area is 3 × 10 ^(− 7) W m^(− 2), which is close to the terrestrial value. The limited color information is consistent with line and continuum emission from atomic hydrogen and helium. The intensity profiles of resolved lightning strikes are bell-shaped, with the half-width at half-maximum ranging from ∼ 45 to 80 km. We used these widths to infer the depth of the strikes, assuming that the appearance of each is the result of light scattering from a point source below the cloudtops. We conclude that lightning must be occurring within or below the jovian water cloud. The occurrence of lightning in regions of cyclonic shear has important implications for the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The cloud {{structure}} of the jovian atmosphere at pressures less than 2 bars has previously been estimated using near-infrared observations such as those by both the <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Imager</b> (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) instruments on board the Galileo spacecraft. Unfortunately, complete near-infrared spectra, such as those measured by NIMS, {{take a long time}} to be analyzed with multiple-scattering radiative transfer models and thus it has until now been rather difficult to use these data to produce wide-area cloud maps. In this paper we show how principal component analysis may be employed to isolate a small number of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) from spectra of Jupiter made by Galileo/NIMS. These EOFs may be used to represent the variance of real NIMS spectra to a high degree of accuracy and with good noise and "drop-out" discrimination. Because of this, a small set of representative spectra may then be calculated using these EOFs and input into a retrieval model that generates a table of fitted cloud profiles for each case. This approach avoids the long times required for analyzing a large number of spectra with full multiple-scattering radiative transfer models and allows us to represent the variability of the 3000 spectra contained in the observations of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) used in this study with only 75 representative spectra. The cloud structures fitted to these representative spectra were interpolated for the spectra found at individual locations in the measured NIMS data set to produce maps of cloud opacity and mean particle size. We find that the dominant opacity variation, anticorrelated with 5 -μm brightness, exists in the 1 - 2 bar pressure range. The distribution of the cloud at 0. 72 bars is mapped and found to be more zonally diffuse than the lower clouds. We find at least one 2000 -km-sized deep convective cloud in the NEB vertically extending to all the pressure levels that can be sensed by NIMS. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) ...|$|E
