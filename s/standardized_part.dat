The instrument developed in this study contains 31 questions about different aspects of the physical housing environment. Answers are given on a 7 -point rating scale. Content validity was established by the use of an expert panel and pilot testing, followed by a test-retest study. Internal consistency of the instrument was good (Cronbach's alpha 0. 96), and very good to moderate agreement between the two ratings was found on all items (mean weighted kappa, Kw 0. 71) indicating good reliability.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} an {{incidence}} of mental stress of college students. The thesis {{is not only}} focused on the present, {{but also on the}} degree of mental stress and the factors that affect the degree of stress. The first objective is to analyse the incidence and impact of mental stress at students of the faculty. A partial objective is to describe the relation of physical activity and mental load, as many authors state that physically active individuals are mentally more resistant. Furthermore, to determine how many students suffer from a particular degree of depression and whether students sought professional help. The practical part deals with the analysis of individual questions from the questionnaire, which are graphically presented in the form of graphs. In this section it is also stated the evaluation of <b>standardized</b> <b>part</b> of the questionnaire, the division of students into groups according to the SDS index and evaluation of hypotheses using statistical processing by method of multiple regression analysis by using the freely available Gretl program. For the purposes of the research two hypotheses were formulated: H 1 : Mental stress is present at the first-year students of bachelor's degree. H 2 : The degree of mental load varies among physically active and inactive students. These hypotheses were statistically evaluated using multiple regression analysis in freely available Gretl program and according to the results they were confirmed or disproved. The results of this thesis can be used for the needs of the faculty, which can obtain a comprehensive view on the impact of the faculty environment on the students' mental status.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) {{have found}} wide {{adoption}} in various applications, be they military, civilian or commercial. The susceptibility of GNSS to radio-frequency interference can, thus, be very disruptive, even for emergency services, therefore threatening people's lives. An early prototype {{of a system}} providing relatively cheap widescale GNSS jamming detection, called J 911, is explored in this thesis. J 911 is smartphone-based crowdsourcing of GNSS observations, most interesting of which are carrier-to-noise-density ratio () and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) voltage. To implement the prototype, an Android application to provide the measurements, a backend to parse and store the measurements, and a frontend to visualize the measurements were developed. In real-world use, the thesis argues, the J 911 system would best be implemented over existing Enhanced 9 - 1 - 1 (E 911) infrastructure, becoming a <b>standardized</b> <b>part</b> of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The Android application, running on a smartphone, would periodically construct messages {{to be sent to}} the backend over an Internet connection. The messages would include: current location from all location providers available in Android OS, observed satellites from all supported constellations, the satellites', and a timestamp. Once a message is received on the backend, the data would be extracted and stored in a database. The frontend would query the database and produce a map with the collected datapoints overlaid on top of it, whose color indicates received signal strength at that point. When a jammer gets close enough to a few smartphones, they will all be jammed, which is easily observed on the map. On top of that, if enough samples are gathered, a Power Difference of Arrival localization algorithm can be used to localize the jammer. The smartphones that the system was planned to be tested with did not support AGC level readings, therefore in order to obtain AGC levels over time, a few SiGe GN 3 S Samplers, which are radio-frequency frontends, were used. In eastern Idaho, United States, over three nights in July 2017, an exercise, named 2017 DHS JamX, was performed {{with the help of the}} US Department of Homeland Security.

40|$|Purpose: Governments create {{large amounts}} of data. However, the {{publication}} of open data is often cumbersome {{and there are no}} standard procedures and processes for opening data. This blocks the easy publication of government data. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to derive design principles for improving the open data publishing process of public organizations. · Design/methodology/approach: Action Design Research (ADR) was employed to derive design principles. The literature was used as a foundation, and discussion sessions with civil servants were used to evaluate the usefulness of the principles. · Findings: Barriers preventing easy and low-cost publication of open data were identified and connected to design principles, which can be used to guide the design of an open data publishing process. Five new principles are 1) start thinking about the opening of data at the beginning of the process, 2) develop guidelines, especially about privacy and policy sensitivity of data, 3) provide decision support by integrating insight in the activities of other actors involved in the publishing process, 4) make data publication an integral, well-defined and <b>standardized</b> <b>part</b> of daily procedures and routines, 5) monitor how the published data are reused. · Research limitations/implications: The principles are derived using ADR in a single case. A next step can be to investigate multiple comparative case studies and detail the principles further. We recommend using these principles to develop a reference architecture. · Practical implications: The design principles can be used by public organizations to improve their open data publishing processes. The design principles are derived from practice and discussed with practitioners. The discussions showed that the principles could improve the publication process. · Social implications: Decreasing the barriers for publishing open government data could result in the publication of more open data. These open data can then be used and stimulate various public values, such as transparency, accountability, innovation, economic growth and informed decision and policy-making. · Originality/value: Publishing data by public organizations is a complex and ill-understood activity. The lack of suitable business processes and the unclear division of responsibilities blocks publication of open data. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting design principles which can be used to improve the open data publishing process of public sector organizations.

40|$|Off-highway vehicle (OHV) {{refers to}} a {{category}} of motorized vehicles meant to travel off of paved roadways. These include motorcycles, quads, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and four-wheel drive vehicles. In a report in August 2005, the United States Forest Service recognized OHV use {{as one of the}} fastest growing outdoor activities on its lands. Despite the increase in popularity of OHV use, regulations have not been <b>standardized.</b> <b>Part</b> of the issue stems from land use; control of OHV areas is often divided between federal, state, and local departments, and recreation occurs on both public and private land. OHV use can also be controversial. There are recreational benefits that accompany increased OHV use, but these benefits must be weighed against environmental damage, health risks, and competing uses of the land. Committed groups argue for both sides as they pursue legislation and file court cases. This study has two main goals. First, it looks at official OHV policies of California???s public lands and counties. The Bureau of Land Management and United States Forest Service oversee much of the OHV activity that occurs on public lands, and both agencies have developed guidelines for such use. Of 58 counties in California, seven do not have public lands open to OHV use. Despite widespread OHV activity in the state, only eleven counties address OHV use in some form in their general plans. The majority of counties do not take an active role in creating policy for OHV use within their boundaries; some counties rely upon federal and state land use rules, and other counties have developed policies outside of their general plans. Second, the project presents a summary of geographic data on current OHV use in Nevada County through the use of maps. This county experiences major OHV use, both legal and illegal. While some sites are controlled by the United States Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management, private parcels fall under county planning and zoning regulations. Much of the recreation involves individuals or small groups, but local events draw as many as 600 people to participate on area trails. With this level of use comes a need for clear policy about land use and where OHV activity can best be supported and where it should be disallowed within the county. Currently, Nevada County???s General Plan only provides a vague policy to ???encourage the location and development of motorized off-road facilities??? and does not outline how this will be implemented. Using a series of maps as the basis of this analysis, OHV use in Nevada County is analyzed to determine which areas are most affected by OHV use as well as which stakeholders who are most affected by such activity. This information will direct attention of policymakers to specific areas that need regulation of environmental damage, safety, and noise. This project provides a preliminary staff report to the Planning Director that synthesizes information about OHV issues and concerns, outlines the background of OHV use in Nevada County, presents maps, identifies stakeholders who should be included in the decision-making process, and recommends future action. The Planning Director will use the project as a summary of pertinent information when pursuing the development of more specific OHV policies in Nevada County. CSU, Chic...|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore patients’ {{experiences}} of undergoing surgery, including their perceptions of quality of care and recovery. A mixed methods design was used, and studies with qualitativemethods (I, II) and quantitative methods (III, IV, V) were performed. Data were collected through interviews with ten patients after gastric bypass surgery (I) and nine patients after lower limb fracture surgery (II) and weresubjected to qualitative content analysis. Data were also collected using two standardized questionnaires; The Quality from Patient’s Perspective (III) and Postoperative Recovery Profile (IV, V). A total of 170 orthopedicand general surgery patients participated in study III. In study IV and V, 180 patients participated. Accordingly, 170 of patients were the same in study III, IV and V. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (III, IV, V) and a manifest content analysis of the free-text answers (III) {{as well as with}} analytical statistics (IV, V). Prior to surgery, patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery (I) described a sense of inferiority related to their obesity. In the post-anesthesia care unit, patients felt both omitted and safe in the unknown environment and expressed needs to have the staff close by. Despite the information provided prior to surgery it was difficult toimagine one’s situation after homecoming, thus it was worth it so far and visions of a new life were described. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery (II) described feelings of helplessness when realizing the seriousness oftheir injury. The wait prior to surgery was strain, and patients needed orientation for the future. They remained awake during surgery and expressed feelings of vulnerability during this procedure. In the post-anesthesia careunit, patients expressed a need to have control and to feel safe in their new environment. Mobilizing and regaining their autonomy were struggles, and patients stated that their recovery was extended. The quality of theperioperative care was assessed as quite good (III). While undergoing a surgical procedure (III), the areas identified for improvement were information and participation. Patients preferred to hand over the decisionmakingto staff and indicated that having personalized information about their surgery was important. However, too detailed information before surgery could cause increased anxiety (III). After surgery, orthopedic patientswere substantially less recovered than general surgery patients (IV, V). Approximately two-thirds of orthopedic patients and half of general surgery patients perceived severe or moderate pain in the first occasion (day 1 - 4 after surgery) (IV). Both the orthopedic and general surgery group showed a significant systematic change at a group level towards higher levels of recovery after one month compared with day 1 - 4 after surgery. The same patterns occurred regarding acute and elective surgery (V). Patients overall recovered better (IV, V) after a gastric bypass, than after other surgeries. Compared with the period prior to surgery; certain Gastric bypass patients felt after one month that they had improved (IV). The orthopedic groups assessed their psychologicalfunction as being impaired after one month compared with the first occasion (IV, V). The overall view of patients’ experiences of undergoing surgery (I-V) can be understood as a trajectory, from vulnerability towards recovery, including a new, altered life. Patients’ experiences and perceptions of the caregiven (I, II, III) are embedded within this trajectory. As a thread in this thesis, through all studies, patients expressed vulnerability in numerous ways. A progress towards recovery with regards to regaining preoperativelevels of dependence/independence could be concluded. Thus, for patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery, a view of a new, altered life after surgery was also discernible. While undergoing surgery, satisfaction with theprovision of information not necessarily include receiving as much and the most detailed information as possible; nevertheless, the need for information to a great extent is personal. The recovery-period for orthopedic patients is strain, and the support must be improved. In conclusion, the perioperative support may contain a <b>standardized</b> <b>part,</b> made-to-order to the general procedure commonly for all patients, such as information about the stay in the post anesthesia care unit. Moreover, the support should be person-centered, accounting for the patients’ expectations about the future but also tailored to the specific surgical procedure; with its limitations and possibilities. Then, patients in a realistic way would be strengthened towards recovery, including a new, altered life.
