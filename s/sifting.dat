The proposed encoder compresses an input image by <b>SIFT</b> descriptors rather than pixel values. It separates the <b>SIFT</b> descriptors of the image into two groups, a visual description which is a significantly subsampled image with key <b>SIFT</b> descriptors embedded and a set of differential <b>SIFT</b> descriptors, to reduce the coding bits.
