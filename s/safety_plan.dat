Delays {{in the development of}} a <b>safety</b> <b>plan</b> and a high estimated cost (mainly due to liability insurance), led A president Ray Bowen to postpone Bonfire indefinitely. Despite the university's refusal to allow Bonfire to take place on campus, since 2002 a non-university sanctioned Bonfire has burned annually. Known as Student Bonfire, the off-campus event draws between 8,000 and 15,000 fans.|$|E

A report in 1999 by Société Générale de Surveillance concluded that Del Monte did not allow workers freedom to join trade unions, and union workers {{were not allowed to}} communicate with employees. The report also found that the company routinely threatened shop stewards with termination. Additional findings were that Del Monte did not have a <b>safety</b> <b>plan</b> {{in the event of an}} emergency, did not make first aid kits available to employees, did not provide ear protection to workers in high decibel environments and did not provide gas masks to employees using chemical sprays.|$|E

50|$|Fire <b>safety</b> <b>plans</b> are {{a useful}} tool for fire fighters to have because they allow them to know {{critical}} information about a building that they may have to go into. Using this, fire fighters can locate and avoid potential dangers such as hazardous material (hazmat) storage areas and flammable chemicals. In addition to this, fire <b>safety</b> <b>plans</b> can also provide specialized information that, {{in the case of a}} hospital fire, can provide information about the location of things like the nuclear medicine ward. In addition to this, fire <b>safety</b> <b>plans</b> also greatly improve the safety of fire fighters. According to FEMA, 16 percent of all fire fighter deaths in 2002 occurred due to a structural collapse or because the fire fighter got lost. Fire <b>safety</b> <b>plans</b> can outline any possible structural hazards, as well as give the fire fighter knowledge of where he is in the building.|$|R
500|$|If an {{occupier}} allows {{an extremely}} dangerous activity {{to take place}} on his land without taking precautions to ensure the contractor has liability insurance and a <b>safety</b> <b>plan,</b> he may be held liable. In Bottomley v Todmorden Cricket Club [...] the Court of Appeal held that, where the defendant had allowed an independent contractor {{to set up a}} pyrotechnic display on their land without checking for public liability insurance, they were liable for the injuries suffered by the claimant. The extent to which one has to check for public liability insurance is weak; in Gwilliam v West Hertfordshire Hospital NHS Trust [...] the Court of Appeal held that where the contractor's insurance had expired {{a few days before the}} event, the occupier was not liable. In Naylor v Payling the occupier was not liable for failing to check public liability, since he had checked the contractor was accredited under the police and local government schemes required, and the contractor had been employed for 18 months before the case during which there were no reasons to doubt his competency. The Court of Appeal also held that, except in special circumstances, there was no [...] "free-standing duty" [...] to take reasonable steps to ensure an independent contractor was insured.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of myths about suicide. [...] It is not usually unpredictable; in 75-80% of cases, the suicidal person has given some sort of warning sign. [...] A key myth to dispel is that talking to someone about suicide {{increases}} the risk of suicide. [...] This is simply not true. [...] If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, he/she should be encouraged to seek mental health treatment. [...] Friends and family can provide supportive listening, empathy, and encouragement to develop a <b>safety</b> <b>plan.</b> [...] Serious warning signs of imminent suicidal risk include [...] the intent to commit suicide and a specific plan with access to lethal means.

Water supply to 37% of households was interrupted for at least one day in 2003. Customers did not and often still do not trust that drinking water quality is adequate. This is why the Department of Water Affairs introduced in 2008 a so-called [...] "blue drop" [...] incentive-based water quality regulation strategy. Under the strategy municipal service providers are certified with a [...] "blue drop" [...] if they fulfill certain requirements.

40|$|Safety is an {{important}} element of project successes. In the conventional project management, <b>safety</b> <b>planning,</b> as a function, is separated from other functions, such as planning/scheduling function. This separation creates difficulties for engineers to analyze what, when, why and where a safety measure is needed to prevent accidents in a construction activity. Another problem occurs due to the conventional practice of representing project designs using two-dimensional (2 D) drawings. In this practice, a user (e. g. an engineer) has to convert the 2 D drawings into three-dimensional (3 D) mental pictures, and this is a tedious task. If only converting this 2 D drawing is a tedious task, combining these 2 D drawings with <b>safety</b> <b>planning</b> creates more difficult tasks. In order to address the problems, this paper discusses our research in integrating construction scheduling and <b>safety</b> <b>planning</b> in a 4 D environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} systematic evaluation of road safety needs – the Safety Needs Identification Package (SNIP) and a concept called SNIP 2 – an expansion that can match identified safety needs with safety interventions at the regional and city levels. SNIP and SNIP 2 {{can be used by}} agencies involved in <b>safety</b> <b>planning</b> and management. This paper presents the SNIP concept and its implementation for <b>safety</b> <b>planning</b> on Indiana roads. SNIP utilizes GIS road and crash databases to help identify road locations that experience safety problems such as night crashes, right-angle crashes at signalized intersections, etc. It can also be applied to user-related safety needs such as drunken driving, motorcycle crashes, speeding, or young driver safety. SNIP 2 involves two new key components: (1) a catalog of safety improvement programs and (2) a safety improvement program builder that identifies the most cost-effective safety improvement programs to address the safety needs identified with SNIP. The novelty of the proposed approach is in developing the <b>safety</b> improvement <b>plan</b> based on specific needs already identified for various locations, thereby providing a realistic approach to <b>safety</b> <b>planning.</b> The known <b>safety</b> effectiveness of the considered safety improvement programs and their unit costs allow planners to control the level of spending. To make the optimization problem tractable for large regions with multiple alternative safety interventions, an approximate greedy search is applied to the knapsack problem to optimize recurring annualized benefits and costs. This simplified approach fits well the long-term transportation planning where a long-term “static” solution is sough while providing identification of focus areas more realistic than the current practice of developing strategic <b>safety</b> <b>plans.</b> The paper presents the details of the catalog of safety improvements preliminarily developed for Indiana and formulation of the optimization program for selecting improvement programs. It discusses the implementation issues and the expected benefits from coordinating the development of the strategic <b>safety</b> <b>plans</b> by state agencies...|$|R
