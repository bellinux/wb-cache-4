30|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) has the unique {{ability to provide}} functional images of biological tissues in vivo. As {{is the case with}} positron emission tomography (PET), corrections for attenuation and scatter are important. Previous studies have demonstrated improvements in diagnostic accuracy when applying corrections for both attenuation and scatter [1]. Attenuation correction has been widely carried out by means of transmission computed tomography (TCT) scanning, with several mechanical configurations such as rotating rod <b>sources</b> fitted <b>with</b> parallel-beam <b>collimator</b> systems, and a single rod source placed at the focal line of a symmetrical fan-beam collimator [2 – 4]. It has been demonstrated that TCT data can also be used for scatter correction [5], and that when coupled with kinetic analysis, the overall accuracy of reconstructed SPECT images is sufficiently high for quantitation of various physiological functions in the thoracic region [6 – 8] and also in the brain [9]. Several dedicated TCT systems developed by various manufacturers have resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy. It has also been reported that when using optimally designed TCT equipment, reconstructed images are accurate and applicable to quantitative studies in the thoracic region [10].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In SPECT the {{collimator}} is {{a crucial}} element of the imaging chain and controls the noise resolution tradeoff of the collected data. The detection of photons in SPECT is seriously affected by collisions of the photons with atoms inside the patient (photon attenuation and scatter), and the inevitable inaccuracy of the collimator used (collimator blurring). The images are also severely degraded because of noise, {{partly due to the}} Poisson nature of the photon emission. Accordingly, {{it is very difficult to}} obtain high quality and quantitative accurate SPECT images. The lead x-rays, collimator scatter and partial energy deposition in the detector crystal are the effects that contribute to the 99 mTc camera down-scatter in the energy range of 100 &plusmn; 10 %keV or 72 &plusmn; 10 %. The current study is an evaluation of the effects of low energy high resolution collimator thickness, commonly used in SPECT, on tomographic spatial resolution. Methods: SIMIND Monte Carlo program was used for simulation of a Siemen's dual-head variable angle scintillation gamma camera and also a related Low Energy High Resolution (LEHR) collimator. For this study a point source of 99 mTc and also an acrylic cylindric Jaszczack phantom, with cold spheres and rods, and a NCAT phantom were used. Quantitative and qualitative studies were performed for obtained acquired projections and also reconstructed images. Results: Results for calculated detector parameters, contribution of Compton scattering, photoelectric reactions, and also peak to Compton (P/C) area in the obtained energy spectrums from scanning of the <b>sources</b> <b>with</b> 11 <b>collimator</b> thickness, ranged from 0. 400 to 0. 410 cm, were tabulated.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} collimator rotation in IMRT planning {{with respect to the}} target coverage and dose to critical structures. In addition, the delivery efficiency of desired fluence <b>with</b> <b>collimator</b> rotation is assessed. Methods : The computed tomography (CT) datasets of 5 patients with parotid cancer were employed for this study. Dynamic IMRT plans were generated with a dose prescription of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. IMRT plans were generated with five unilateral fields using 6 MV X-rays. Four different plans were generated for each patient by keeping the collimator angle at 0, 30, 60, and 90 degree. All plans were analyzed using dose volume histogram. Conformity index (CI) and heterogeneity index (HI) were calculated. The total monitor units (MU) required to deliver one fraction were noted and compared. To verify the delivery efficiency; the measured fluence on IBA I’mRT MatriXX ionization chamber array detector was compared with the TPS dose plan with 2 D gamma evaluation. Results: There is not much difference in the PTV Dmax and Dmean with respect to the different collimator angles. The PTV coverage is best at collimator angle of 0 degree. A slight reduction in CI was observed with plans at other collimator angles as compared to 0 degree. The HI values were almost similar for plans <b>with</b> <b>collimator</b> angle 0, 30, and 60 degree. The plan <b>with</b> 90 degree <b>collimator</b> showed a slightly higher heterogeneity for the PTV. A slight reduction in the average Dmax to spinal cord was observed for the plan <b>with</b> <b>collimator</b> angle 30 degree as compared to other angles whereas maximum value of Dmax to spinal cord was at collimator angle 60 degree. No clinically relevant difference was observed among the plans with respect to brainstem and mandible Dmax. An increase in average of oral cavity Dmax and Dmean was observed for collimator angle 60 and 90 degree as compared to collimator angle 0 and 30 degree. Not much difference was observed with respect to Dmax and Dmean for contralateral parotid and cochlea with plans at different collimator angles. A decrease in MU required to deliver a fraction was observed for the plan <b>with</b> <b>collimator</b> angle 30 degree as compared to other angles. The plan <b>with</b> 90 degree <b>collimator</b> required maximum MU. The 2 D γ index evaluation of planned and delivered fluence showed almost similar results for plans <b>with</b> different <b>collimator</b> angles. Conclusion: An individual case-specific collimator rotation may aid in achieving the desired dose distribution and relative sparing of critical structures in IMRT.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) {{ratio in}} a planar image {{has been used}} for {{practical}} quantification in 123 I- metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging, standardization of the parameter is not yet established. We hypothesized that the value of the H/M ratio could be standardized to the various camera-collimator combinations. Methods and results: Standard phantoms consisting of the heart and mediastinum were made. A low-energy high-resolution (LEHR) collimator and a medium-energy (ME) collimator were used. We examined multi-window correction methods with 123 I- dual-window (IDW) acquisition, and planar images were obtained with IDW correction and the LEHR collimator. The images were obtained using the following gamma camera systems: GCA 9300 A (Toshiba, Tokyo), E. CAM Signature (Toshiba/Siemens, Tokyo) and Varicam (GE, Tokyo). Cardiac phantom studies demonstrated that contamination of the H/M count ratio was greater <b>with</b> the LEHR <b>collimator</b> and least <b>with</b> the ME <b>collimator.</b> The corrected H/M ratio <b>with</b> the LEHR <b>collimator</b> was similar to that <b>with</b> ME <b>collimators.</b> The uncorrected H/M ratio <b>with</b> the ME <b>collimator</b> was linearly related to the H/M ratio with IDW correction <b>with</b> the LEHR <b>collimator.</b> The relationship between the uncorrected H/M ratios determined with the LEHR (E. CAM) and the ME collimators was y = 0. 56 x + 0. 49, where y = H/M ratio with the E. CAM and x = H/M ratio <b>with</b> the ME <b>collimator.</b> The average normal values for the low-energy collimator (n= 18) were 2. 2 ± 0. 2 (initial H/M ratio) and 2. 42 ± 0. 2 (delayed H/M ratio), and for the low/medium-energy (LME) collimator (n= 14) were 2. 63 ± 0. 25 (initial H/M ratio) and 2. 87 ± 0. 19 (delayed H/M ratio). H/M ratios in previous clinical studies using LEHR collimators are comparable to those <b>with</b> ME <b>collimators.</b> Conclusion: The IDW-corrected H/M ratios determined <b>with</b> the LEHR <b>collimator</b> were similar to those determined <b>with</b> the ME <b>collimator.</b> This finding could make it possible to standardize the H/M ratio in planar imaging among various collimators in the clinical setting. © 2008 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to work out standard parameters for the optimization of prostate cancer. Methods For ten patients with localized prostate cancer plans for simultaneous integrated boost were optimized, varying systematically the number of arcs, collimator angle, the maximum delivery time, and the gantry spacing. Homogeneity in clinical target volume, minimum dose in planning target volume, median dose in the organs at risk, maximum dose in the posterior part of the rectum, and number of monitor units were evaluated using student’s test for statistical analysis. Measurements were performed with a 2 D-array, taking the delivery time, and compared to the calculation by the gamma method.

Single arc resulted in higher minimum dose in the planning target volume, but also higher dose values to the organs at risk, requiring less monitor units per fraction dose than dual arc. Single arc needs a higher value (per arc) for the maximum delivery time parameter than dual arc, but as only one arc is needed, the measured delivery time was shorter and stayed below 2. 5 [*]min versus 3 to 5 [*]min. Balancing plan quality, dosimetric results and calculation time, a gantry spacing of 4 ° led to optimal results.
