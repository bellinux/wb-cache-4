25|$|The Cuban Jazz Band {{was founded}} in 1922 by Jaime Prats in Havana. The {{personnel}} included his son Rodrigo Prats on violin, the great flautist Alberto Socarrás on flute and saxophone and Pucho Jiménez on <b>slide</b> <b>trombone.</b> The line-up would probably have included double bass, kit drum, banjo, cornet at least. Earlier works cited this as the first jazz band in Cuba, but evidently there were earlier groups.|$|E
25|$|Trills, though {{generally}} simple with valves, {{are difficult}} on the <b>slide</b> <b>trombone.</b> Trills {{tend to be}} easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B3/C4 is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B4/C5) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave {{and a half of}} the tenor's range. Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson's {{work in the}} 1940s and 1950s {{demonstrated}} that the <b>slide</b> <b>trombone</b> could be played in the bebop style; as trombonist Steve Turre has summarized, [...] "J. J. did for the trombone what Charlie Parker did for the saxophone. And {{all of us that}} are playing today wouldn't be playing the way we're playing if it wasn't for what he did. And not only, of course, is he the master of the trombone—the definitive master of this century—but, as a composer and arranger, he is in the top shelf as well." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{trombone}} has {{a limited}} history concerning literature and technique development. A {{turning point for}} {{the literature of the}} trombone was with John Cage 2 ̆ 7 s Solo for <b>Sliding</b> <b>Trombone.</b> This composition brought about new techniques that would permeate throughout subsequent literature. These new techniques would also impact trombone pedagogy and accepted technique.

2500|$|F4 {{marks the}} sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes {{on the next}} partial, for example A4 (a minor third higher) in first position, tend {{to be out of}} tune in regards to the twelve-tone equal {{temperament}} scale. A4 in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh. [...] On the <b>slide</b> <b>trombone,</b> such deviations from intonation are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position. It should be noted that though much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have just intonation (see harmonic seventh as well for A4).|$|E
50|$|The valve {{trombone}} has definite advantages over {{the more common}} <b>slide</b> <b>trombone,</b> such as taking up less room in a seated orchestra. Verdi, for example, composed passages {{that would have been}} impossible on a normal <b>slide</b> <b>trombone.</b>|$|E

50|$|From the {{standpoint}} of musical acoustics and scientific terminology, some instruments, such as <b>slide</b> <b>trombones,</b> unfretted bowed-string instruments, guitars played with slides and, of course, slide whistles, can change the frequency of their notes continuously, while others, notably acoustic keyboard instruments, are restricted to quantized (stepped) changes in pitch. (The clavichord's Bebung is the one exception, but that is essentially ornamentation of a single pitch, not a glide.) Some instruments, such as the clarinet and saxophone, can produce a continuous pitch (frequency) change, although their characteristic design is to provide distinct pitches.|$|R

25|$|A superbone uses a {{full set}} of valves and a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some <b>slide</b> <b>trombones</b> have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves {{operated}} by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the F attachment, which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A buccin is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.|$|R

50|$|The Superbone can {{be played}} as a <b>slide</b> <b>trombone,</b> a valve trombone, or in combination. Extending the slide in order to {{transpose}} pitches downward causes tuning problems with the valves. Using the valves in this manner requires slide positions to be adjusted, just as when using the trigger of an F-trigger or bass trombone. Alternate slide positions are available when valves are depressed.|$|E
