40|$|Energy {{balance is}} {{relevant}} to diverse issues in ecology, physiology, and evolution. To determine whether lizards are generally in positive energy balance, we synthesized a massive data set on the proportion of individual lizards (N = 18223) with empty <b>stomachs</b> (127 species), representing nine families distributed on four continents, primarily in temperate zone deserts {{but also in the}} neotropics. The average percentage of individuals with empty <b>stomachs</b> is low (13. 2 %) across all species, even among desert lizards, suggesting that most lizards are in positive energy balance. Nevertheless, species vary substantially in this regard (among all species, 0 % to 66 % of individuals have empty <b>stomachs).</b> Several patterns are detectable among species with unusually high frequencies of empty <b>stomachs.</b> In particular, nocturnal lizards “run on empty” more often on average than do diurnal species (24. 1 % vs. 10. 5 %); and this pattern holds even for nocturnal vs. diurnal geckos (21. 2 % vs. 7. 2 %, respectively). Several (but not all) top predators have a higher frequency of empty <b>stomachs</b> than do species that feed at lower trophic levels. Diet breadth and body size appear unrelated to frequency of empty <b>stomachs.</b> Widely foraging species sometimes have a high frequency of empty <b>stomachs</b> relative to sit-and-wait species, but patterns vary among continents and appear to be confounded by phylogeny and trophic level. Ant-eating specialists have uniformly low frequencies of empty <b>stomachs.</b> Diurnal termite specialists also have low frequencies of empty <b>stomachs,</b> but nocturnal ones have high frequencies. Lizards from certain families (Gekkonidae [including Pygopodidae], Gymnophthlamidae, and Varanidae) {{are more likely to have}} empty <b>stomachs</b> than are those of other families (Agamidae, Iguanidae, Lacertidae, Scincidae, and Teiidae) ...|$|R

40|$|The Na +/H + ion-exchange {{property}} of human gastric mucus {{and its relationship}} to age has been studied. Mucus was collected from 40 postmortem human <b>stomachs</b> (age range, 21 - 83 years) within 24 h of traumatic death. Twenty-one <b>stomachs</b> (age range, 21 - 76 years) were free of Campylobacter pylori infection and histologic gastritis. Mucus from these <b>stomachs</b> was consistently a cation exchanger at pH 6 in an in vitro system. The cation-exchange capacity of mucus from seven <b>stomachs</b> within the age range 55 - 70 years was 50 % less than the cation-exchange capacity of mucus from eight <b>stomachs</b> within the age range 20 - 35 years. This study shows that human gastric mucus at pH 6 is a cation exchanger and that the ion-exchange capacity decreases with age. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the <b>stomach.</b> In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the <b>stomach.</b> Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the <b>stomach,</b> and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the <b>stomach,</b> which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the <b>stomach</b> and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the <b>stomach</b> makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E

50|$|Nile {{crocodiles}} are apex predators {{throughout their}} range. In the water, this species is an agile and rapid hunter relying on both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to present itself inside {{or near the}} waterfront. Out of water, however, the Nile crocodile can only rely on its limbs, as it gallops on solid ground, to chase prey. No matter where they attack prey, this and other crocodilians take practically all of their food by ambush, needing to grab their prey {{in a matter of}} seconds in order to succeed. They have an ectothermic metabolism, so can survive for long periods between meals—though when they do eat, they can eat up to half their body weight at a time. However, for such large animals, their <b>stomachs</b> are relatively small, not much larger than a basketball in an average-sized adult, so as a rule they are anything but voracious eaters. Young crocodiles feed more actively than their elders according to studies in Uganda and Zambia. In general, at the smallest sizes (0.3 - 1 m), Nile crocodiles were most likely to have full <b>stomachs</b> (17.4% full per Cott); adults at 3 - 4 m in length were most likely to have empty <b>stomachs</b> (20.2%). Interestingly, in the largest size range studied by Cott, 4 - 5 m, they were the second most likely to either have full <b>stomachs</b> (10%) or empty <b>stomachs</b> (20%). Other studies have also shown a large number of adult Nile crocodiles with empty <b>stomachs.</b> For example, in Lake Turkana, Kenya, 48.4% of crocodiles had empty <b>stomachs.</b> The <b>stomachs</b> of brooding females are always empty, meaning that they can survive several months without food.|$|R

Three methods are assayed {{to extract the}} pepsin from swine <b>stomachs.</b> Method 1, where the pepsin extraction is made by dissolution in water of the pepsinogen contained in fundus, has the highest extraction yield. Methods 2, that also considers a pepsinogen concentration step by coagulation, and Method 3, that also considers a lyophilisation process, leads to lower amounts of pepsin, but with a higher purity. This study could be useful to optimize the industrial extraction of pepsin from swine <b>stomachs...</b>|$|R
40|$|During 1992 – 93, an {{extensive}} collection program of seal <b>stomachs</b> was conducted {{as a part}} of the Multi-Species Research program of the Marine Research Institute in Iceland which commenced in 1991. The aim of the seal part of the program was to investigate their food and feeding habits and role as top-predators. In total 1 059 <b>stomachs</b> from grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) (737 had food remains), 799 <b>stomachs</b> from common seals (Phoca vitulina) (493 had food remains), 62 <b>stomachs</b> from hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) (47 had food remains) and 72 <b>stomachs</b> from harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) (39 had food-remains) were obtained. The main food species of grey seals in Icelandic waters ordered in percentage by weight, were cod (Gadus morhua), sand eels (Ammoditdae), catfish (Anarhichas lupus), saithe (Pollachius virens) and lumpsucker (Cyclopterus lumpus). Seasonal and geographic variation observed during the period January to September, showed sand eel was the domi-nant food of grey seals off the south-coast of Iceland, but cod, catfish, saithe and lumpsucker in other areas.

5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the <b>stomach</b> in which absorption takes place.

5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac <b>stomach</b> can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its <b>stomach,</b> which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The <b>stomach</b> and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric <b>stomach,</b> which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac <b>stomach</b> is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
