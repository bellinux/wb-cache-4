40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} to everyone who supported me so that I could complete this work. In the first place, thanks are due to the senior researchers who <b>supervised</b> <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> Thomas Straubhaar, Carsten Hefeker and Axel Michaelowa-all affiliated with the Hamburg Institute of International Economics. Without the intensive discussions we had I {{would not have been}} able to progress the way I did. My colleagues at the Department of World Economy contributed in a similar way. Acknowledgements are also due to a number of PhD-students from all over Europe who came (and still come 9 together in a series of PhD-workshops on climate policy. The sharing of the ups and downs during the time of research and the discussions on various issues inspired not only my work but also helped to improve my awareness and understanding of the complexity of international climate policy. I will be failing if I do not thank my family- and my parents in particular- for making this thesis possible.

40|$|When I {{started my}} master in Information Security, my main {{motivation}} for this choice {{was the fact}} that formal methods, and logic in particular, form a large part in this field: you cannot be sure that a computer system is secure, unless you prove it.

We present an alternative representation of the equations of motion of the system in terms of Lax pairs and subsequently dis-cuss the R operator associated with the Lax operator. We discuss the Hamiltonian reduction procedure and show how it {{can be applied to the}} cotangent bundle of the group of nxn matrices to get the Lax operator of the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and its associated r-matrix, solve its equation of motion and construct the integrals of motion. We verify explicitly that the integrals of motion are in in-volution. We conclude by giving a summary of what is done in the thesis...|$|R

We focus in particular on the intuitionistic modal mu-calculus. We enhance the ALBA algorithm [26] for the elimination of monadic second order variables so that mu-formulas can be treated in which all the variables occur inside the scope of fixpoint binders. We prove that this enhancement is sound thanks to the order-theoretic properties of the interpretation of fixpoint binders in the algebraic semantics for intuitionistic mu-calculus.

Dr. Jeffrey Agar has provided me an extraordinary opportunity by letting me join his group and opened the doors of science by pushing <b>me</b> harder <b>to</b> succeed and be better on every project I worked on. I would especially like to thank Jared Auclair and Joseph Salisbury for their efforts in training me, mentoring me on a daily basis, and supporting me with various ways throughout my senior thesis. I would also like to thank all the members of Petsko-Ringe Lab for the use of their instruments and their thoughtful discussions during the preparation of my thesis defense. I {{would like to}} thank Dr. Rebecca Chafel and Liam Putney for all the work they have done at the Foster Lab to ensure the maintenance and ongoing of our mice colony, training and <b>supervising</b> <b>me</b> throughout our in vivo experiments...|$|R
