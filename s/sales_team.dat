40|$|This study offers {{insight into}} the {{perceived}} leadership behaviour of sales managers in a pharmaceutical organisation in South Africa. The study specifically investigated {{the extent of the}} relationship between leadership behaviour of sales managers and motivation of <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> during the implementation of strategic alliances. The study followed a mixed methods approach and had a correlational research design. The population in this study was the fifty four (54) sales representatives and their respective sales managers of the six <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> identified, who are directly responsible for implementing strategic alliances. The population was demarcated into six (6) <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> with each team reporting to a separate sales manager. Inferential and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. The quantitative data were analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The qualitative component was analysed using a content analysis. The findings of the correlation analysis suggest that an overall positive and moderate relationship exist between autocratic leadership behaviour of sales managers and the motivation of <b>sales</b> <b>teams.</b> A similar relationship exists between team leadership and extrinsic motivation. A positive and weak relationship exists between directive and supportive leadership and motivation. Similarly, a positive and weak relationship exists between team leadership and intrinsic motivation. However, {{the extent to which these}} relationships exist varies between the <b>sales</b> <b>teams.</b> The findings of the content analysis indicate that task-oriented leadership behaviour may exert the strongest motivator for <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> when implementing strategic alliances.

Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective <b>sales</b> <b>team,</b> while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E

40|$|All {{new homes}} in the UK will be {{required}} to be zero carbon from 2016. Housing sector bodies and individual housing developers are championing a transition from traditional marketing to green marketing approaches to raise consumer awareness of the benefits of low and zero carbon homes. On-site <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> on housing developments form a central interface between the developer and potential buyers. These teams, then, have a critical role in the success or otherwise of the developers’ green marketing strategies. However, there is a dearth of empirical research that explores the actual attitudes and practices of these teams. An exploratory case study approach was adopted. The data collection consisted of reviewing relevant company documentation and semi-structure interviews with the on-site <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> from six housing developments. The findings from two case studies suggest that the <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> do have potential to forge a bridge between the design / production and consumption spheres in the way that consumers understand and appreciate, but further work is required. The sales teams’ practices were constrained by the incumbent, traditional marketing logic that rotates around issues such as location and selling price. The <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> appeared to adopt a strategy of a restriction of information about the benefits of low and zero carbon homes to not disturb the prevailing logic. Further, the <b>sales</b> <b>teams</b> justify this insulating mechanism by the argument that consumers are not interested in those benefits. This rhetoric may be driving a real wedge between the design / production and consumption spheres {{to the detriment of the}} consumer and, in the longer term, the house builder itself...|$|R
