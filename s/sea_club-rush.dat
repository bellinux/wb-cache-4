5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush,</b> sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
500|$|Common cord-grass (Spartina anglica) {{was planted}} {{in the area in}} the 1990s. It can now be found on {{surrounding}} marshes where it has invaded the fronting mudflats. The Spartina is generally shorter in the bay than at other sites due to the high tides and the turbidity of the water, reaching around [...] as opposed to [...] elsewhere. On higher ground common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima) can be found along with sea aster (Aster tripolium). Where the land is ungrazed, common reed (Phragmites australis) often forms a zone above the sea aster. Where the upper marsh is grazed by cattle red fescue (Festuca rubra) and creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera) are found. The area of marsh furthest from the sea supports Sea couch (Agropyron pungens) and <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Scirpus maritimus).|$|E
50|$|The best {{remaining}} saltmarsh {{is at the}} eastern, seaward end of the reedbeds {{and these}} support locally rare saltmarsh plants including <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> Bolboschoenus maritimus, grey bulrush Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and common saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima.|$|E
5000|$|The pools on {{the reserve}} are {{surrounded}} by reedmace, <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush,</b> grey club-rush, soft rush and hard rush. Areas of damp grassland contain marsh foxtail, floating sweet-grass, creeping bent and soft rush. Wild flowers include marsh marigold and fleabane. Whilst wild orchids such as southern marsh orchid {{can be found in}} abundance, bee orchids are also present ...|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> indicate brackish water.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{important}} for wintering waders and wildfowl which feed on the mudflats. Reed warblers, sedge warblers and bearded tits breed on reed beds in the lagoon, and teals and grey herons roost on the shallow waters and grassy islands. Stone Ness saltings is a large area of salt marsh dominated by <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush.</b> The conservation charity Buglife fought to prevent development of the site, and succeeded in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The ditches {{often have}} a range of salinity, {{depending}} on how close to the sea wall they are. The more saline ditches host specialist brackish-water plants and animals. These include, for example, the rare brackish amphipod Gammarus insensibilis and <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Bolboschoenus maritimus). Fresher ditches may support rare animals, such as the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus) and the great raft spider (Dolomedes plantarius), and a wide range of pondweeds (Potamogeton and relatives).|$|E
50|$|The seaward {{fringe of}} the site is {{dominated}} by common cord-grass (Spartina anglica), with patches of common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima), common glasswort (Salicornia europaea), sea aster (Aster tripolium) and annual sea-blite (Suaeda maritima). Mid and upper marsh communities are composed of sea aster, common saltmarsh-grass, sea rush (Juncus maritimus) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) together with sea plantain (Plantago maritima), sea arrowgrass (Triglochin maritimum), sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima) and English scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). Less grazed areas, such as Laugharne and Ginst Point have stands of sea-purslane (Atriplex portulacoides). Swampy areas have <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Bolboschoenus maritimus) or the common reed (Phragmites australis).|$|E

50|$|Over {{one third}} of the area of St Agnes is {{designated}} as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). In the south of the island Wingletang Down is noted for its heath, dune grassland and rocky coast and is the only site in Britain where the fern least adder's-tongue (Ophioglossum lusitanicum) grows. Other rare plants include the orchid autumn lady’s-tresses (Spiranthes spiralis) and early meadow-grass (Poa infirma). The only freshwater pools on St Agnes are Big Pool and Little Pool in the north-west of the island which are part of the Big Pool and Browarth Point SSSI. Big Pool shows evidence for inundation by the 1775 Lisbon tsunami that was caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The vegetation has some brackish influence because of occasional influx of the sea during winter storms with rushes such as saltmarsh rush (Juncus gerardi) and <b>sea</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Scirpus maritimus). The surrounding grassland, which is also a cricket pitch, is notable for the clovers amongst its flora including western clover (Trifolium occidentale), suffocated clover (T. suffocatum) and subterranean clover (T. subterraneum). Other plants include adder’s-tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum) and small adder’s-tongue (O. azoricum).|$|E

The rabbits were bred for food but they were wiped out by myxomatosis in the 1950s. The Atlantic puffin colony on Craigleith, once {{one of the largest in}} Britain with 28,000 pairs, became endangered from 1999 onwards, due to an invasion of the non-endemic plant tree mallow, which choked the puffins' burrows, preventing them from rearing their chicks, or [...] "pufflings". A five-year project, SOS Puffin, led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick, was launched early in 2007. Since then, hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem, ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months, when the puffins are at sea. There are signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed. Fidra, Inchmickery and Eyebroughy are RSPB reserves, the last being noted for its cormorants. Over 240 species of bird and 60 varieties of seaweed have been recorded on the Isle of May.|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comA constructed urban wetland in Adelaide was surveyed 18 months and 10 years after construction to see how shoreline vegetation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), texture and pH changed over time and to provide data for future site management. Multivariate analysis detected four plant associations at 18 months: salt-tolerant taxa on conductive clays; a weed-dominated community on lower EC soil; and two smaller waterlogged, low EC clusters dominated by Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and <b>Sea</b> <b>Club-Rush</b> (Bolboschoenus caldwellii), respectively. At 10 years, site cover and heterogeneity was higher, with the margins dominated by Phragmites and salt-tolerant species. EC was much lower and more uniform, and the soils were heavier and more alkaline. Managed storm water flushing apparently lowered soil EC, but possibly also disturbed the shoreline. However, weeds were still common, {{and the potential for}} domination by Phragmites {{at the expense of other}} native shoreline species means that ongoing monitoring and hydrological and vegetation management are essential to maintain site habitat diversity.

40|$|The {{colonisation}} by Greylag Geese Anser anser {{of a new}} autumn migration {{staging area}} was studied {{on the island of}} Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands. Over 500 Greylag Geese first visited the island in 1991. During subsequent years, peak numbers rose to 700 - 900 birds. The geese most likely originated from the neighbouring staging area on the mainland, the Lauwersmeer, where goose numbers had levelled off since 1985. Because of the time-lag between saturation of the source population and colonisation of the island, changes on the island itself were investigated as a possible trigger for the arrival of the geese. Potential food availability on the island had increased for the geese as a result of vegetation succession. Two food-plants, <b>Sea</b> <b>Club-rush</b> Scirpus maritimus and Common Cord-grass Spartina anglica have increased over the last four decades. Greylag Geese fed mostly on Scirpus tubers and Spartina rhizomes. The soluble-carbohydrate content of the latter two food items did not differ significantly, and was approximately 25 % on a dry weight basis. Negative effects of grubbing by Greylag Geese on stands of both Scirpus and Spartina appeared limited during the study period. Although Greylag Geese now spend most of the year in agricultural areas, our study indicates that natural habitats are still of importance for migrating Greylag Geese as staging areas...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{services}} provided by coastal ecosystems is wave attenuation by vegetation, and subsequent reduction of wave loads on flood defense structures. Therefore, stability of vegetation under wave forcing {{is an important factor}} to consider. This paper presents a model which determines the wave load that plant stems can withstand before they break or fold. This occurs when wave-induced bending stresses exceed the flexural strength of stems. Flexural strength was determined by means of three-point-bending tests, which were carried out for two common salt marsh species: Spartina anglica (common cord-grass) and Scirpus maritimus (<b>sea</b> <b>club-rush),</b> at different stages in the seasonal cycle. Plant stability is expressed in terms of a critical orbital velocity, which combines factors that contribute to stability: high flexural strength, large stem diameter, low vegetation height, high flexibility and a low drag coefficient. In order to include stem breakage in the computation of wave attenuation by vegetation, the stem breakage model was implemented in a wave energy balance. A model parameter was calibrated so that the predicted stem breakage corresponded with the wave-induced loss of biomass that occurred in the field. The stability of Spartina is significantly higher than that of Scirpus, because of its higher strength, shorter stems, and greater flexibility. The model is validated by applying wave flume tests of Elymus athericus (sea couch), which produced reasonable results with regards to the threshold of folding and overall stem breakage percentage, despite the high flexibility of this species. Application of the stem breakage model will lead to a more realistic assessment of the role of vegetation for coastal protection...|$|E
40|$|Saltmarshes {{are highly}} valued {{habitats}} {{but the majority}} of the Eden Estuary’s saltmarsh was buried under sea defences and ad hoc rubbish dumps during the last century. Without saltmarsh, the degraded shoreline may be even more vulnerable to rising sea levels and increased wave and tidal energy. This study investigated planting native saltmarsh species, common in the estuaries of Eastern Scotland, to restore saltmarsh development and sedimentation to the Eden Estuary’s shoreline. The survival and growth of the sedge Bolboschoenus maritimus (<b>Sea</b> <b>Club-rush)</b> and the grasses Phragmites australis (Common Reed) and Puccinellia maritima (Common Saltmarsh Grass) were compared in planting trials. These were seeded or transplanted onto unvegetated upper mudflats in front of eroded P. maritima saltmarsh and a disused rubbish dump. The longer term sustainability of this practice was assessed by comparing sediment deposition and surface elevation in the transplant sites, natural saltmarsh and upper unvegetated mudflats. B. maritimus outperformed P. australis and P. maritima. Springtime, high density planting was successful, whereas seeds, planting in autumn and low density planting failed. Growth in the transplanted B. maritimus sites was relatively slow for the first three years but subsequently overtook growth of the seaward edge of natural B. maritimus marsh. Sediment was not deposited on natural P. maritima and was low on upper unvegetated mudflats and in young transplant sites. Most deposition occurred in four year old sites of B. maritimus. Sediment surface elevation in natural P. maritima remained constant throughout the year, but increased in all the other sites during the summer. The upper mudflat was the only site to erode during winter. A significant, positive association was found between tide height and sediment deposition, while winds from the south-east were associated with significantly more deposition than winds from the south-west. The direct planting of saltmarsh vegetation has restored a valuable and rapidly disappearing habitat to the degraded shoreline of the Eden Estuary. The low-cost and simplicity of this restoration practice give it great potential as a sustainable coastal management option that should be explored in other Scottish estuaries. This form of restoration could help to increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of degraded shorelines to climate change and rising sea levels...|$|E
