25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished {{all she had to}} do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E

60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to?</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a {{place called}} Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MSN TV News, when asked what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life after Megan Wants a Millionaire, she stated, [...] "Married life...I want to have my little babies and I want to become an expert tennis player.

2500|$|After two years, {{in which}} she earned a master's degree in sports administration, she applied for the head {{coaching}} position at Idaho. In her interview, when asked what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to be successful, she responded [...] "work". When they asked her to elaborate, she responded, [...] "hard work". She got the job. When she arrived at Idaho, the team had only one winning season in their first four years. Under VanDerveer, the team improved to 17–8 in the first year. The team won {{the first game of}} the season, beating the Northern Montana Skylights 80–78, which represented the first of VanDerveer's wins. The following year, the team improved to 25–6, which earned the team an invitation to the [...] AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament (the precursor to the NCAA National Championships).|$|E

60|$|Simply {{absurd to}} wait. She poured her own cup of tea. She sat {{and stared at}} it. What was it <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now? Oh yes; how idiotic; take a lump of sugar.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{certain that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive to Seattle.

She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.|$|E
60|$|What bothered Frederick in Polly {{was that}} she {{attracted}} him as well as repelled him. His own daughter had never interested him in that way.

6000|$|On the Friday {{morning there}} was a little {{conversation}} between the two sisters, just before Georgiana's departure to the railway station, which was almost touching.
