As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that <b>Simon</b> <b>and</b> Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to <b>Simon</b> <b>and</b> The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E
