40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} technical-economic analysis of a solar power system for a residential consumer. One of the main objectives is to design an optimal power system based on solar energy resources for a chosen power consumer. The power consumer re{{presents the}} starting point of the analysis, contains both AC and DC users and, before the design process, the type and variety of the electrical loads has to be well known. This aspect is important in designing the power system topology, to be more economical and compatible with all the power consumers. The aim of the paper is to present the design and functionality of the solar power system, determining the energy production and consumption for the proposed system. Also an important aspect of the paper is the analysis of the system from technical and economical point of view, to present the overall results. The approach is to study the power system, starting from the solar radiation data, which is a known parameter, to calculate the system equipment sizes and power losses and to find an optimal energy production/consumption ratio. To fulfill this task the proposed research methodology is to configure the optimal system structure (<b>solar</b> panels, <b>chargers,</b> inverters), to gather information about the value of the equipment and to deduct the payback period of the system, under normal functioning conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{renewable}} energy sources {{is on the rise}} because of the acute energy crisis in the world today. India plans to produce 20 Gigawatts of Solar power by the year 2020, whereas we have only realized less than half a Gigawatt of our potential as of March 2010. Solar energy is a vital untapped resource in a tropical country like ours. The main hindrance for the penetration and reach of solar PV systems is their low efficiency and high capital cost. To maximize a photovoltaic (PV) system's output power, continuously tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of the system is necessary. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique that grid tie inverters, <b>solar</b> battery <b>chargers</b> and similar devices use to get the maximum possible power from one or more solar panels. Solar cells have a complex relationship between solar irradiation, temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency known as the I-V curve. It is the purpose of the MPPT system to sample the output of the cells and apply the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power for any given environmental conditions. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms provide the theoretical means to achieve the MPP of solar panels; these algorithms can be realized in many different forms of hardware and software...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the many forms of {{renewable}} energy on earth. This energy can be harnessed by using a solar cell or photovoltaic cell which converts sunlight directly into electricity. Solar power can also be used in many small electrical devices such as battery chargers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an electronic power system for the CubeSTAR satellite. The main task of the power system is to supply continuous power to the satellite in orbit. The power system consists of several parts: <b>Solar</b> cells, battery <b>chargers,</b> battery pack, power distribution bus, sensors monitoring {{different parts of the}} system and a microcontroller used to control the system. The solar cells are used to generate power to the satellite and charge the battery pack. The battery charging system is based on the SPV 1040 charger with embedded maximum power point tracking. A charger efficiency of 90 % has been achieved. The battery pack is made of six lithium iron phosphate battery cells connected in parallel. It has been decided to distribute unregulated power. This leaves each subsystem responsible for regulating the power with respect to their requirements. From the estimated power budget, the total average power consumption of the satellite should be below 2 W. The electronic power system itself uses an average power of 66 mW. A microcontroller is used to control the power system and it is a slave unit receiving commands from the satellite main processor. The microcontroller gathers all sensor data and prepares the data for transmission to the ground station. There are various voltage, current and temperature sensors implemented for monitoring the power system...|$|R
40|$|Access {{to light}} {{is a serious}} {{development}} issue for those living at the Base of the Pyramid (. i. e., those who live on less than $ 5 per day), especially for individuals living in rural areas. The aim of this project {{is to develop a}} scalable, financially sustainable business model that a microfinance institution can implement in extremely poor rural areas. When implemented, this model will not only allow households to obtain light, but also create a new, viable business {{in the form of a}} micro-utility. In order to generate our recommendation, we decided to focus our research on a specific village in India—Bhudapada Village near Sambalpur, Orissa. Bhudapada was chosen due to its relationship with the Baharat Integrated Social Welfare Agency, a microfinance institution. Bhudapada represents the “worst case scenario” in rural villages across India. Most of the residents earn their living as daily agricultural laborers, surviving on an average per capita income of USD$ 1 per day. However, the village also has some points of development, namely the existence of a self-help group, a self-organized group of local entrepreneurs that support each other in financial savings and risk diversification, and runs a small soap business and grocery store. BISWA has an established network of almost 15, 000 self-help groups, which this project’s recommendations were designed to leverage, maximizing the speed at which it could be scaled up following a pilot implementation. This strategy also enables a rapid expansion of the income generating and development activities this model will create within the self-help groups themselves and the villages they operate in. With greater availability of light, the self-help groups will be able to expand their business activities into the evenings and also to generate income from a new enterprise, the provision of light to their neighbors. With light, villagers will be able to expand their own participation in cottage industries such as craft making, benefiting from the additional income opportunities this presents, as well as the opportunities for non-income generating activities such as education and safety this light will provide. Our recommended business plan involves three partners: the Baharat Integrated Social Welfare Agency, product manufacturers, and the villagers. The Baharat Integrated Social Welfare Agency will lend money to the self-help groups that will start and manage the micro-enterprise, which is consistent with their current operations. Self-help groups will purchase LED lights and <b>solar</b> battery <b>chargers</b> with rechargeable batteries of different sizes. The self-help group will then function as a micro-utility and will provide the light to villagers using financing options suitable to their level of income...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} grid has substantially changed {{in recent years}} due to the integration of several disruptive load and generation technologies into low-voltage distribution networks, which are meant to smarten it and improve its efficiency. These technologies have subjected the grid to unprecedented amounts of variability and uncertainty that threaten its reliability and could reduce its efficiency. Even a low penetration of these disruptive technologies may cause equipment overloads, voltage deviations beyond permissible operating thresholds, and bidirectional power flows in distribution networks. The smart grid will comprise {{a vast number of}} active end-nodes, including electric vehicle <b>chargers,</b> <b>solar</b> inverters, storage systems, and other elastic loads, that can be quickly controlled to adjust their real and reactive power contributions. Given the availability of inexpensive measurement devices and a broadband communication network that connects measurement devices to controllers, it is possible to incorporate potentially disruptive technologies into distribution networks while maintaining service reliability, using some novel control mechanisms, which are the focus of this thesis. In this thesis, we propose a new paradigm for the control of active end-nodes at scale. This control paradigm relies on real-time measurements of the states of the distribution network and the end-nodes rather than long-term predictions. We use an optimal control framework to design mechanisms that balance a set of system-level and user-level objectives. We study control of active end-nodes in two different contexts: a radial distribution system and a grid-connected public electric vehicle charging station powered by on-site solar generation. We develop both a feedback controller and an open-loop controller, and propose centralized and distributed algorithms for solving optimal control problems. We implement and validate these control mechanisms using extensive numerical simulations and power flow analysis on a standard test system...|$|R
