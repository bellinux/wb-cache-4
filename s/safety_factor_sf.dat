40|$|In casing design, {{the casing}} is {{required}} to withstand all loads it is exposed to during the well life. These loads are normally modeled in an industry leading software (ILS), which determines whether the casing can withstand the loads. The well cement is also subjected to the operational loads. However, the cement strength {{is not included in}} the ILS. Other complementary softwares are available, but are not always included as standard practice. In this thesis, a cement sheath mechanical model has been developed in order to investigate the necessity of considering the cement. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> (<b>SF)</b> for the cement resulting from the model, and for the casing resulting from the ILS have been compared. This is done in order to determine if the cement fails before the casing fails in some scenarios. Through this comparison, the necessity of an additional feature in the ILS have been determined. The model have been developed by the use of axisymmetric thick-walled cylinder theory, considering three cylinders; one for the casing, one for the cement and one for the formation. By considering this theory, the stresses through a cross-section of the cylinders have been calculated, and further, failure criteria have been applied to the stresses. Three failure modes have been considered; debonding of the cement at the casing and formation interfaces, radial cracks and shear failure in the bulk cement. In order to thoroughly investigate how the cement SFs change with variable cement mechanical properties, sensitivity analyses have been performed at various pressure and temperature changes. For one load case, the worst- and the best-case combinations of mechanical properties for each failure mode have been identified, and included in the comparison with the ILS. This has been done to achieve a broad knowledge, and to more effectively conclude whether complementing the ILS is necessary. The results indicated that debonding was likely at well pressure decreases, while radial cracks mostly occurred at pressure increases. Shear failure occurred at both large pressure increases and pressure decreases. When the worst-case burst and collapse loads, for typical casing and cement properties, were considered, the cement failed in tension before the casing failed. However, the results were less prominent when the worst- and best-case of mechanical properties of the cement and formation were considered. The cement was mostly exposed to lose its integrity through debonding, due to several combinations of mechanical properties resulting in debonding for a worst-case collapse load. It was therefore concluded that it could be beneficial to include an additional feature to the ILS, which analyzes the cement integrity when performing casing design...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBPâs Skarv {{field is}} a stacked three layer {{reservoir}} structure. The field development plan involves drilling deviated and horizontal wells into the uppermost reservoir layer, Garn, and the lowermost reservoir layer, Tilje. Above Garn {{is a high}} pressure zone, that requires 1. 59 sg mud weight to be drilled. When Garn {{have proven to be}} a strong formation, the overburden and Garn is drilled as one section in Skarv drilling phase 1 to reach Tilje. A 9 7 / 8 â shoe is set in top Tilje and the reservoir section in Tilje is drilled with an 8 Â½â bit and left open hole and completed with gravel pack. The drainage strategy involves pressure support in Tilje, hence Garn will deplete with a faster rate. In phase 2 Garn will have depleted to an extent that drilling with 1. 59 mud will become a to large overbalance regarding differential sticking issues. The 9 7 / 8 â shoe must therefore be set in top Garn. Due to the low pressure in Garn, Garn must be sealed off before drilling Tilje to avoid crossflow from Tilje into Garn. Garn and Ile, the middle sand, will be drilled with an 8 Â½â bit. Traditionally a 7 â liner will be set between top Garn and top Tilje. This will give a slim hole solution in the Tilje reservoir section which can lead to insufficient gravel packing resulting in hole collapse. It was proposed that expandable liner could be the solution to maintain an 8 Â½â hole in Tilje. Available solutions for Skarv have been identified and Expandable liners from two vendors, Enventure GTâs SETÂ® open hole liner and Baker Hughes linEXXâ¢ monobore liner have been analyzed in StressCheck for installation, drilling and production loads an expandable liner could possible need to endure through the life off the well. Skarvâs J- 4 well, Skarv basis of design, Skarv casing design, NORSOK and BP internal regulations are used to set up a model in StressCheck. Expandables are special tubulars that are expanded down hole by mechanically or hydraulically pushing or pulling a cone or mandrel through the tubular. beyond the yield point, permanently deforming the pipe. When undergoing such expansion the mechanical properties of the pipes are changed. To gain a complete picture of what load scenarios the expandable must endure, the expandables were modeled both as pre- and post expanded. The analysis includes five different pressure regimes and four different mud weights as drilling and displacement fluids. Pressure regimes were calculated based on the expected depletion rate in Garn and mud weight were calculated based on minimum required mud weight in relation to well stability. Output from the analysis are <b>safety</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>SF.</b> For Skarv, minimum required SF for burst and collapse loads are 1. 10 and 1. 00 for collapse. In general, the limiting factor for an expandable is the collapse strength. The results however show that the limiting factors for depleted Garn is related to the burst loading, when the liners internal pressure which is the weight of the mud and the applied surface pressure, as in a pressure test, will exceed the low external reservoir pressure. For the 7. 625 X 9 7 / 8 â SETÂ® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 93 for burst and 2. 35 for collapse. For the 8. 625 X 10 3 / 4 â SETÂ® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 88 for burst and 2. 02 for collapse. For linEXXâ¢ liner was 0. 73 for burst and 1. 32 for collapse. For all cases it was the high test pressure and injection pressures that casued the low SF. The internal pressure in a well is the pressure that can be controlled, which propose that expandables are a god solution for depleted reservoirs. By designing the well parameters to ensure the liners burst limit will not be exceeded, by e. g. tailor making the mud weight, expandable liner can be installed in Skarv wells. The expandables are not easily modeled in StressCheck when it proved challenging to ensure the correct properties are input for the pre- and post-expanded pipes and combining the two. For StressCheck to be a reliable tool for expandables, vendor should supply exact numbers or a range for both the pre-and post-expansion properties as the input variables required in StressCheck.

In the present work, we have studied the sensitivity of the SF defined by Shaw and Rudy to the integration interval (II) using computer simulations, and then defined and evaluated a new and simplified method to calculate SF (SFm). Our results reveal that the sensitivity of the SF to the II is negligible outside the depolarization phase, delimited by the instant when membrane potential derivative (dV/dt) reaches 1 % of its maximum (t 1 %) and the instant when membrane potential is maximum (tVmax), so we have computed the SF considering this II. Our SFm shows a desirable behaviour as a) it drops below unity when propagation failure occurs and b) the SFm registered during normoxia decreases when membrane excitability is reduced, and increases when high cell uncoupling is forced. This computational simplification could facilitate the use of the SF in heterogeneous 2 D and 3 D tissues...|$|E

The mean and standard deviation define this distribution, which then can be integrated numerically from 0 to 1 to obtain the probability of sliding, PS (portion of the SF distribution where SF < 1. 0). The overall probability of failure, PF, for the potential slope failure mass is the joint probability that the rock discontinuities are long enough to allow kinematic failure (PL) and that sliding occurs along the rock discontinuities (PS); that is, PF = PSPL. This method for estimating the probability of sliding is extremely efficient computationally, and thus, expedites slope stability simulation routines used by NIOSH software to stochastically describe rock slope behavior and assist the engineer in designing catch benches for large rock slopes.

The results from the remote surveys: (i) GBInSAR monitoring revealed permanent displacements coupled to cyclic daily displacements, these last ones detected in certain sectors of the cliff wall; (ii) the thermal images allowed us to identify anomalies that correspond well to the main joints and to the slope material released due to recent collapses...|$|E
40|$|There {{is about}} 18000 km of dikes in The Netherlands. Their use {{is to prevent}} the lowlands, where the {{inhabitants}} live, from flooding. Flooding is a typical high-consequence low-probability event. To study the failure probability of a dike, one of the numerical methods available, derived from the Level III probabilistic methods, is the so-called Monte Carlo simulation (MCs). The Finite Element Method (FEM) program PLAXIS is widely used to study dike stability. This dike stability can be quantified {{by means of the}} <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> (<b>SF).</b> However, estimating the failure probability of a dike with PLAXIS is at present not possible and even if the MCs will be installed, the calculation will be time consuming. In order to overcome this problem, an easy and quick method is needed to estimate the failure probability of a dike. This project uses a study case described by a circular slip failure surface of a dike with three independent layers. Each layer is defined by its undrained shear strength with a normal distribution function. Besides MCs, an analytical solution for the SF of a slope, which is a linear combination of the soil strength for a fixed slip circle, was developed. The project compares the failure probability value obtained by both the MCs and the analytical solution. Finally, using the analytical solution, the failure probability estimation of a slope is presented by a quick and easy procedure to use with FEM. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

This road crosses the Bawakaraeng Moutain in which suffer easily with slope failure particulary in rainy season. To {{understand}} the slope condition, it was studied to develop new design for the slope to meet standard of safety factor. A field study have been done to observed actual slope at present condition. The slope consist of volcanic tuff with mechanical properties of unit weight (??) is 20. 336 kN/m 3; cohesion (c) is 4. 089 kN/m 2; and internal friction is (??) 34. 314 o. The slope stability analysis was performed by using finite element method of Phase 2 - 6. 0 software. Simulation result showed the estimated of <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>SF)</b> in actual slope without considering the groundwater influence is 0. 503 and by considering of groundwater level became 0. 473. This simulated result shows that factor of safety actual slope indicated the slope in unstable condition. In order to overcome the problem, redesign of slope geometry is needed. A new design of slope was proposed consisting 4 benches with bench height is 8. 5 meters, bench width is 6 meters, overall slope is 37 O and single slope is 53 O. Simulation without considering the groundwater level estimated SF of 1. 396 and 1. 268 for 500 and 1, 500 element respectively, whereas by considering groundwater level resulted SF of 1. 343 and 1. 250. This simulation was also figure out distribution of mean stress, maximum shear strain, and total displacemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{quantitative}} evolutionary design uses evolutionary reasoning (in terms {{of natural selection}} and ultimate causation) to understand the magnitudes of biological reserve capacities, i. e. excesses of capacities over natural loads. Ratios of capacities to loads, defined as <b>safety</b> <b>factors,</b> fall in the range 1. 2 - 10 for most engineered and biological components, even though engineered <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> are specified intentionally by humans while biological <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> arise through natural selection. Familiar examples of engineered <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> include those of buildings, bridges and elevators (lifts), while biological examples include factors of bones and other structural elements, of enzymes and transporters, and of organ metabolic performances. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> serve to minimize the overlap zone (resulting in performance failure) between the low tail of capacity distributions and the high tail of load distributions. <b>Safety</b> <b>factors</b> increase with coefficients of variation of load and capacity, with capacity deterioration with time, and with cost of failure, and decrease with costs of initial construction, maintenance, operation, and opportunity. Adaptive regulation of many biological systems involves capacity increases with increasing load; several quantitative examples suggest sublinear increases, such that <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> decrease towards 1. 0. Unsolved questions include <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> of series systems, parallel or branched pathways, elements with multiple functions, enzyme reaction chains, and equilibrium enzymes. The modest sizes of <b>safety</b> <b>factors</b> imply the existence of costs that penalize excess capacities. Those costs are likely to involve wasted energy or space for large or expensive components, but opportunity costs of wasted space {{at the molecular level}} for minor components...|$|R

The design factor is what the item is required to be able to withstand (second [...] "use"). The design factor is defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory code or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> in unsaturated pyroclastic slope instru- mented at Monteforte Irpino in southern Italy. Suction and volumetric water content data from different depths {{over a five-year period}} and mechanical soil properties from laboratory tests have been used to esti- mate <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor.</b> First, a brief description of test site with geotechnical soil properties is reported and in situ data monitoring used for the estimation of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> are introduced. Then, in order to analyse the effect of the seasonal trend of pore pressure on the <b>Safety</b> <b>factor</b> of the slope, a limit equilibrium analysis is performed by modelling the slope at the test site as an infinite one. In the analysis Bishopâs effective stress approach is used. In particular the <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> over five years is plotted and the effects of matrix suction on the slope stability is examined. Profiles of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> at fixed days during wet period are also shown to locate the critical sliding surface. Moreover parametric analyses were carried out, in particular the suction values on the sliding surface assumed at 2. 00 meters from the ground surface were calculated varying the slope angle of the monitored infinite slope keeping constant the value of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor...</b>|$|R
