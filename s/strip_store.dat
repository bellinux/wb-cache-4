40|$|View-dependent {{simplification}} {{has emerged}} as a powerful tool for graphics acceleration in visualization of complex environments. However, view-dependent simplification techniques {{have not been able to}} take full advantage of the underlying graphics hardware. Specifically, triangle strips are a widely used hardware-supported mechanism to compactly represent and efficiently render static triangle meshes. However, in a view-dependent framework, the triangle mesh connectivity changes at every frame making it difficult to use triangle strips. In this paper we present a novel data-structure, Skip Strip, that efficiently maintains triangle strips during such view-dependent changes. A Skip <b>Strip</b> <b>stores</b> the vertex hierarchy nodes in a skip-list-like manner with path compression. We anticipate that Skip Strips will provide a road-map to combine rendering acceleration techniques for static datasets, typical of retained-mode graphics applications, with those for dynamic datasets found in immediate-mode applications...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} observing transverse beam profiles by using synchrotron light emission from the 100 GeV/nucleon heavy-ion gold beam in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Synchrotron radiation experiences a shift towards higher photon energy when the magnetic field {{at the end of}} a dipole varies rapidly over a short distance. Synchrotron light signals from high energy (larger than 400 GeV) proton beams have already been routinely used to observe the transverse beam profiles at the SPS in CERN and at the TEVATRON at Fermilab. Because of the modest relativistic factor of the fully <b>stripped</b> <b>stored</b> gold ions in RHIC this ''push'' towards higher critical energy is not large enough to place the synchrotron light within the visible region of the spectrum. The critical wavelength remains within the infrared region. A 77 K cooled infrared array detector with 160 elements, made of PbSe (Lead salt) could be used for beam profile detection. It would cover the wavelength range between 1 and 6 microns, with maximum sensitivity at a wavelength of 4. 5 microns...|$|R
40|$|Triangle strips are {{a widely}} used hardware-supported data-structure to compactly {{represent}} and efficiently render polygonal meshes. In this paper we survey the efficient generation of triangle strips {{as well as}} their variants. We present efficient algorithms for partitioning polygonal meshes into triangle strips. Triangle strips have traditionally used a buffer size of two vertices. In this paper we also study the impact of larger buffer sizes and various queuing disciplines on the effectiveness of triangle strips. View-dependent simplification has emerged as a powerful tool for graphics acceleration in visualization of complex environments. However, in a view-dependent framework the triangle mesh connectivity changes at every frame making it difficult to use triangle strips.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultrasound}} (US) (40 kHz, 200 W, 3 min), blanching (85 °C, 3. 5 min), {{and the combination}} of both methods was evaluated {{on the quality of}} vacuum-packaged potato <b>strips</b> <b>stored</b> at 3 ± 1 °C for up to 10 days. For this study, two cultivars of potatoes were assessed. For blanched Agata samples, the lightness (L*) decreased over 12 % (p < 0. 05). Moreover, their hue increased up to 100, obtaining lesser yellow potato strips. In contrast, US did not affect the hue values. The losses of firmness of blanched potato strips were notable (35 % for Agata and 51 % for Agria), whereas US did not change this property (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, {{no significant differences were found}} in the total starch content at 10 days. Agata and Agria showed different metabolic behaviors of sucrose in the refrigerated storage. Therefore, Agria cultivar retained better color after frying. These results suggest that US had less impact on color and improve the firmness in vacuum-packaged potato strips with no added chemicals.

40|$|Meat is an {{excellent}} source of many essential nutrients and makes an important contribution to a balanced diet. Vacuum frying is the technique of deep frying foods under vacuum, and is essentially a dehydration process that develops the desirable sensory properties of traditional fried foods. Vacuum frying has been demonstrated to great effect on fruits and vegetables, but has been used only rarely with animal products and, until now, not with beef. In this study, strips of marinated beef were vacuum fried and stored in two different packaging materials {{in order to determine the}} effects on lipid quality of packaging and storage. The packaging types were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and aluminium foil laminate. Vacuum fried beef samples were stored at 11 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C and 39 °C for 3, 5, 10, 15 and 17 weeks and the samples and extracted oil was analysed. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to analyse the responses and the equations generated were also used to predict responses during storage up to 32 weeks at 15, 20 and 25 °C. Moisture content and water activity (aw) were only affected following storage in PET packaging. Lipid decomposition was evidenced by significant increases in free fatty acids (FFAs) for both packaging types and Totox value with PET packaging, though these changes were considered to be minor with FFAs reaching only 4. 0 (% oleic acid) during 17 weeks of storage and predicted to increase to over 8 % after 32 weeks of storage and Totox value not exceeding 32 even after 32 weeks of storage. There were no significant changes in the unsaturated fatty acid content but the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids decreased during 17 weeks of storage, and average levels were higher in the aluminium foil packaging, indicating that less oxidation had occurred. The tocopherol content decreased significantly from initial concentrations and mean levels were higher in the oil from vacuum fried beef <b>strips</b> <b>stored</b> in aluminium foil laminate packaging, but the response could not be satisfactorily modelled by RSM. Sterol oxidation products (SOPs) were also measured but were unable to be modelled, although higher average levels were found in the oil from vacuum fried beef <b>strips</b> <b>stored</b> in PET packaging. The results of this experiment suggest that vacuum fried beef <b>strips</b> can be <b>stored</b> for up to 32 weeks at temperatures 15 - 25 °C without significant lipid deterioration. Aluminium foil laminate packaging reduced most of the changes that occurred due to lower oxygen and water vapour transmission rates. Future research into the shelf-life of vacuum fried beef strips should concentrate on the use of antioxidants to reduce oxidative changes, SOPs formation and a sensory analysis to determine the acceptability of the products after storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevailing}} lack of transportation, {{port and}} intermodal facilities {{is one of}} the major hurdles for the development of the Indian Logistics sector and causes congestion at various points in the supply chain. The UK port industry has also been facing many challenges in the recent past. The congestion challenges in UK ports have eased to a certain extent in recent times due to investment and new government and private sector initiatives. One example of this has been the adoption of a “Port-Centric-Logistics” strategy by some UK ports to attract direct callers in these ports. This strategy will try to replace/reduce the feedering that is going on between the continent and UK, and improve the efficiency and productivity in the whole supply chain up to the end user. Teesport has taken the lead in this exercise and set up a fully-fledged distribution centre which provides facilities such as container <b>stripping,</b> <b>storing,</b> repacking at the port already, in collaboration with ASDA.

We tested {{the potential of}} real-time polymerase chain reaction to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) from cerebrospinal fluid impregnated on filter paper strips. Methods: Pnc and Hib genome equivalents were blindly quantified by polymerase chain reaction from 129 liquid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples–the standard–and <b>strips</b> <b>stored</b> {{at room temperature for}} months. Genome counts were compared by simple regression. Results: The strips showed a sensitivity and specificity of 92 % and 99 % for Pnc, and of 70 % and 100 % for Hib, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 94 % and 97 % for Pnc, and 100 % and 89 % for Hib, respectively. For Pnc, the positive and negative likelihood ratio was 92 and 0. 08, and the overall accuracy 98 %, whereas for Hib they were 70 and 0. 30, and 91 %, respectively. Genome counting showed good correlation between the filter paper and liquid CSF samples, r 2 being 0. 87 for Pnc and 0. 68 for Hib (P 0. 0001 for both). Conclusion: Although not replacing bacterial culture, filter paper strips offer an easy way to collect and store CSF samples for later bacteriology.
