What the country could not earn from exports or gold sales it borrowed through its banks in London, Frankfurt, Vienna, Paris, and Luxembourg. Large grain imports pushed the Soviet debt quite high in 1981. Better harvests and lower import requirements redressed this imbalance in subsequent years. By late 1985, however, a decrease in oil revenues nearly returned the Soviet debt to its 1981 level. At {{the end of that}} same year the Soviet Union owed US$31 billion (gross) to Western creditors, mostly commercial banks and other private sources.|$|E

This article extends that model to include measures of work engagement, using experimental data originally reported by Newsham, Veitch, Arsenault, and Duval. Structural equation modeling showed strong fit to a model in which lighting appraisals indirectly influenced work engagement through aesthetic judgments and mood. This evidence that providing a satis-factory work environment can contribute to employee effectiveness merits further study by environmental and organizational psychologists...|$|E

40|$|Nursing is at {{the cusp}} of a truly revolutionary {{time in its history}} with the {{emergence}} of electronic health (eHealth) technologies to <b>support</b> <b>client</b> care. However, technology itself will not transform healthcare without skilled practitioners who have the informatics background to practice in this new paradigm of client care. Nurse educators have been slow to react to the matter of the necessary knowledge, skills, and practice competencies required for nurses to function as eHealth practitioners. Specifically, undergraduate nursing education must take a proactive stance towards curriculum development in the areas of eHealth and informatics. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to propose recommendations about the review and redesign of nursing curricula in relation to nursing informatics. Recommendations include increased information literacy education, interdisciplinary collaboration, and client-centred technologies. Recommendations for faculty development in nursing informatics are also provided...|$|E

Nó// operating system has been conceived under a client/server philosophy, so the nucleus functionality restrains to <b>support</b> <b>client</b> and server processes. The {{other parts of the}} operating system, like file systems, object management and interface are up to server process. In this context, Nó// process management strategies are described, including the way process are carried out, from its creation to its termination, scheduled and synchronized. The text first gives an overview of the whole project (many parts of the project have already been presented to international community). Then the process concept is depicted to demonstrate how combination of threads and tasks can be used to achieve high performance computation. After that, process manager implementation is presented [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} findings from a qualitative study of 14 individuals residing in extended-stay hotels after housing displacement. Framed in ecosystems and structuration theory, {{the purpose of}} this study was to understand social service barriers experienced by help-seeking residents. Participants were engaged in in-depth interviews and asked about challenges faced when they reached out for assistance to prepare for stable housing. Reported barriers included negative interactions with social service personnel, cumbersome agency processes, and insufficient/inappropriate resources. Hotel residents identified guidance, compassion, and advocacy as interventions practitioners can use to <b>support</b> <b>client</b> transitions to stable housing. Implications for Practice Client-practitioner interactions must be improved to support homeless adult transitions to stable housing. Study findings point to empowering strategies to improve case management approaches with helpseeking homeless clients.

40|$|While {{dependence}} {{is seen as}} a {{major risk}} in IS outsourcing relationships, to date little {{attention has been paid to}} fully and unambiguously capturing the complex nature of this phenomenon and specifying how to measure it. Research in reference disciplines has shown that dependence is a dyadic concept, i. e., studies should assess both the client’s and the supplier’s dependence in order to draw adequate conclusions. Hence, to provide a thorough basis for future IS outsourcing studies, this research-in-progress paper follows a multi-method approach (extensive literature review, case study interviews, Q-sorting, questionnaire pretests, two-sided pre-study with 44 responses from 367 companies) to develop two multidimensional “dependence ” constructs, reflecting both sides of an IS outsourcing dyad, i. e., client and supplier dependence. Our research efforts aim to contribute to and extend inter-organizational IS studies and to <b>support</b> <b>client</b> and supplier firms in monitoring and influencing dyadic dependence structures...|$|E

On the other hand, An example of a system that supports both server and client fault tolerance over DSM is TRIPS system. TRIPS protocols are suitable to be integrated in JavaSpaces to supply it with server fault tolerance capabilities. In this study, a server Failures Enabled Javaspaces Service (FTJS) is introduced. FTJS is based on the dynamic failure detection and recovery mechanisms implemented by TRIPS. However, FTJS is able to handle both client and server side failures. The analysis, design and implementation issues of FTJS are introduced...|$|E

To address this issue, this study developed and validated the Career Maturity Inventory: A Korean Form based on the Career Maturity Inventory - Counseling Form C (Savickas 2 ̆ 6 Porfeli, 2011). Using Korean high students, this study validated the Korean version of the Career Maturity Inventory by translating it from English into Korean and then back from Korean into English.
