Cut it short, Pyg! interrupt him from all sides]. You will see their bearing presently. I promise you I will not detain you long. We know, we children of science, {{that the universe is}} full of forces and powers and energies of one kind and another. The <b>sap</b> <b>rising</b> in a tree, the stone holding together in a definite crystalline structure, the thought of a philosopher holding his brain in form and operation with an inconceivably powerful grip, the urge of evolution: all these forces can be used by us. For instance, I use the force of gravitation when I put a stone on my tunic to prevent it being blown away when I am bathing. By substituting appropriate machines for the stone we have made not only gravitation our slave, but also electricity and magnetism, atomic attraction, repulsion, polarization, and so forth. But hitherto the vital force has eluded us; so it has had to create machinery for itself. It has created and developed bony structures of the requisite strength, and clothed them with cellular tissue of such amazing sensitiveness that the organs it forms will adapt their action to all the normal variations in the air they breathe, the food they digest, and the circumstances about which they have to think. Yet, as these live bodies, as we call them, are only machines after all, it must be possible to construct them mechanically.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps most {{emblematic of}} the nexus of Judaism and the {{environment}} is {{the growth of the}} primary Jewish environmental event to which most Jews have been exposed, the aforementioned Tu biSh’vat seder, often labeled “Jewish Earth Day” and sometimes called tongue-in-cheek [...] "Tree B'Earthday". Falling in the early spring two full moons before Passover, Tu biSh’vat (“the 15th of the month of Sh’vat”) generally coincides with the first <b>sap</b> <b>rising</b> in the fruit trees in the land of Israel. Because in rabbinic Judaism this day was labeled the “New Year for the Tree,” 17th century mystics created a ritual meal or seder of fruit and nuts for the day that celebrated the “Tree of Life” that sustains the universe. The Jewish National Fund (JNF) applied these motifs to in the 1950s to championing Tu biSh’vat as a day for planting trees in the land of Israel.|$|E

The preparations for our departure, which had been suspended during my illness, were renewed. I did not revive to doubtful convalescence; health spent her treasures upon me; as the tree in spring may feel from its wrinkled limbs the fresh green break forth, and the living <b>sap</b> <b>rise</b> and circulate, so did the renewed vigour of my frame, the cheerful current of my blood, the new-born elasticity of my limbs, influence my mind to cheerful endurance and pleasurable thoughts.

40|$|Homeotic mutants, that is, mutants with {{a normal}} organ {{in a place where}} an organ of another type is {{typically}} found, were first recognized in plants. The earliest descriptions of mutants in which petals replace stamens, giving double flowers, go back to ancient Greece and Rome. Similar accounts {{can be found in the}} botanical literature of China more than a thousand years ago, and in the books of the herbalists of Renaissance Europe (Meyerowitz et al., 1989). The use of such mutants (and similar but noninherited developmental abnormalities) to understand developmental processes in plants is more recent, dating from Linnaeus in the mid-eighteenth century (see Cullen and Stevens, 1990), and from Goethe (1790), who derived the ideas of organ homology and homological comparison from plants showing what was then called abnormal metamorphosis. Our term homeosis dates from Bateson’s work (1894) on organismal variation, in which he expanded Masters’treatment (1889) of abnormal metamorphosis in plants to animals and introduced the term homoeosis as a replacement for the older term. Goethe (1790) used homeotic variation in plants as the basis for a specific model explaining the developmental origin of different organ types in flowers. In his view, the four types of floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels) are all modified leaves. As <b>sap</b> <b>rises</b> through developing flowers it is progressively refined, thereby inducing different organ types in different positions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} method of {{propagating}} fruit trees, suitable {{for nearly all}} species, is grafting onto rootstocks. This in essence involves physically joining part of a shoot of a hybrid cultivar onto the roots of a different but closely related species or cultivar, so that the two parts grow together as one plant. The process of joining the two varieties must ensure maximum contact between the cambium (the layer just below the bark) of each, so that they grow together successfully. Grafting is a preferred method because it not only propagates a new plant of the desired hybrid cultivar, it usually also confers extra advantages {{as a result of}} the characteristics of the rootstocks (or stocks), which are selected for characteristics such as their vigour of growth, hardiness and soil tolerance, as well as compatibility with the desired variety that will form the aerial part of the plant (called the scion). For example, grape rootstocks descended from North American grapes allow European grapes to be grown in areas infested with Phylloxera, a soil-dwelling insect that attacks and kills European grapes when grown on their own roots. Two of the most common grafting techniques are [...] "whip and tongue", carried out in spring as the <b>sap</b> <b>rises,</b> and [...] "budding", which is performed around the end of summer.|$|R

40|$|This {{relates to}} early stage {{research}} {{that aims to}} build an integrated toolbox of instruments {{that can be used}} for environmental modeling tasks. The application area described is grape growing and wine production. A comparative study including data gathered in both New Zealand and Chile is described. Using both passive and sensor technology data is gathered from atmosphere, vines, and soil. Human sensory perceptions relating to wine taste and quality is also gathered. The project proposes a synthesizer which collects and analyzes data in real time. Computational neural network modeling methods and geographic information systems are used for result depiction. This convergence of computational techniques and information processing methods is proposed as being an example of software and systems collaboration. The project called Eno-Humanas is so named because of the bled of the precise enological data and less qualitative human perception data. It is expected that the discrete input elements of the architecture here will be demonstrably dependency-related and derived from correlation values once data gathering instruments and analytical software have been developed. At this stage of the project, these tools and methods are being built and tested. This is the first stage of the project and the proposed research that will come from it in order to answer wide questions such as the ordinal set of data values necessarily present to predict climate conditions, the relationship between vine <b>sap</b> <b>rise</b> and dew point calibrations, towards addressing the popular question of ‘what makes for a good year for wine’. In addition to the bringing together of various technologies, methods and kinds of data, (geo-referential, climatic, atmospheric, terrain, plant biological and qualitative sensory expressions), the paper also describes an international research collaboration and its parameters...|$|R

The lower Yukon, up to where the Stewart flowed into it, must first break and move on. Until then the ice of the Stewart could only rise higher and higher on the increasing flood beneath. When the Yukon would break was problematical. Two thousand miles away it flowed into Bering Sea, and it was the ice conditions of Bering Sea that would determine when the Yukon could rid itself of the millions of tons of ice that cluttered its breast.|$|R
