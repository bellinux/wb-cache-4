40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is {{a planned}} {{geologic}} repository for permanent disposal of transuranic waste generated by US government defense programs. Located near Carlsbad in southeastern New Mexico, the facility`s disposal regions are mined from the bedded salt of the Salado Formation {{at a depth}} of approximately 652 m. Four shafts service the operational needs of the facility for air intake, exhaust, waste handling and salt handling. These shafts range in diameter from 3. 5 to 6. 1 m and extend from the ground surface to the repository. During repository closure, following an operational life of approximately 50 years, these shafts will be sealed in accordance with an acceptable design.

40|$|As {{part of the}} postclosure safety {{assessment}} undertaken for the proposed Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for Low and Intermediate Level Waste (L&ILW) at the Bruce nuclear site, calculations were undertaken to evaluate the repository’s potential postclosure impacts. Impacts were evaluated for a Normal Evolution Scenario, describing the expected long term evolution of the repository and site following closure, and for several Disruptive Scenarios, which consider events {{that could lead to}} possible penetration of barriers, abnormal degradation, and/or loss of containment. The postclosure modelling was conducted using both detailed models with three-dimensional representation of the repository geometry, and with an overall (system) assessment-level model. The purpose of the detailed modelling described in this paper was to evaluate postclosure performance in terms of repository pressures, repository resaturation levels, mass flow rates of gas at various levels in the shaft, groundwater flow and radionuclide transport through the saturated geosphere and shaft seals, and capture rates of radionuclides by a hypothetical water supply well. The results of the detailed modelling were used to inform overall assessment-level (system) modelling that was performed using the compartmental modelling code AMBER and which is described in a companion paper. Two separate detailed modelling studies were undertaken: 1) generation of gas in the repository, repository resaturation, and transport of gas through the geosphere and <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>system</b> was simulated using T 2 GGM, {{a modified version of the}} TOUGH 2 gas transport code with coupled gas generation, and 2) transport of groundwater and radionuclides through the saturated geosphere and shaft seals was simulated with FRAC 3 DVS-OPG. The gas generation model (GGM) incorporated within T 2 GGM was developed expressly for the L&ILW waste that will be present at the DGR. GGM calculates generation and consumption of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulphide and nitrogen from degradation of the various organic and metallic waste streams. Results from the Normal Evolution Scenario groundwater model show that radionuclide transport is diffusion dominated and very slow, with virtually no transport beyond the immediate vicinity of the repository. Results from gas modelling indicate that the repository will take hundreds of thousands of years to resaturate, and that there will be no gas flow within the shaft for the Reference Case and most Normal Evolution sensitivity cases. In the few cases where gas flow in the shaft does occur, it is restricted to lower portions of the shaft. No gas enters the shallow groundwater system. The gas modelling also indicates that in most cases, repository pressures will equilibrate near the expected steady-state in-situ pressure. In no cases do the gas pressures exceed the lithostatic pressure...|$|E
40|$|On January 27, 2010 the City of North Little Rock, Arkansas {{received}} {{notification of}} {{the awarding of}} a Department of Energy (DOE) grant totaling $ 450, 000 in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) under the Project Title: Recovery Act: Hydroelectric Facility Improvement Project – Automated Intake Clearing Equipment and Materials Management. The purpose of the grant was for improvements to be made at the City’s hydroelectric generating facility located on the Arkansas River. Improvements were to be made through the installation of an intake maintenance device (IMD) and {{the purchase of a}} large capacity wood grinder. The wood grinder was purchased in order to receive the tree limbs, tree trunks, and other organic debris that collects at the intake of the plant during high flow. The wood grinder eliminates the periodic burning of the waste material that is cleared from the intake and reduces any additional air pollution to the area. The resulting organic mulch has been made available to the public at no charge. Design discussion and planning began immediately and the wood grinder was purchased in July of 2010 and immediately put to work mulching debris that was gathered regularly from the intake of the facility. The mulch is currently available to the public for free. A large majority of the design process was spent in discussion with the Corps of Engineers to obtain approval for drawings, documents, and permits that were required in order to make changes to the structure of the powerhouse. In April of 2011, the City’s Project Engineer, who had overseen the application, resigned and left the City’s employ. A new Systems Mechanical Engineer was hired and tasked with overseeing the project. The transfer of responsibility led to a re-examination of the original assumptions and research upon which the grant proposal was based. At that point, the project went under review and a trip was booked for July 2011 to visit facilities that currently had an IMD installed. This further study of facilities revealed that the implementation of the project as originally described, while proving the benefits described in the original grant application, would likely intensify sand intake. Increased sand intake would lead to an increase in required shutdowns for maintenance and more rapid depreciation of key equipment which would result in a loss of generation capacity. A better solution to the problem, one that continued to meet the criteria for the original grant and ARRA standards, was developed. A supporting day trip was planned to visit other facilities located on the Arkansas River to determine how they were coping with the same strong amounts of sand, silt, and debris. Upon returning from the trip to other Arkansas River facilities it was extremely clear what direction to go in order to most efficiently address the issue of generator capacity and efficiency. Of the plants visited on the Arkansas River, every one of them was running what is called a rope packing <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>system</b> as opposed to mechanical shaft seals, which the facility was running. Rope packing is a time proven sealing method that has been around for centuries. It has proved to perform very well in dirty water situations just like that of the Arkansas River. In April of 2012 a scope change proposal was submitted to the DOE for approval. In August of 2012 the City received word that the change of scope had been approved. Plans were immediately set in motion to begin the conversion from mechanical seals to a packing box at the facility. Contractors arrived on October 1 st, 2012 and the project team began unwatering the unit for disassembly. The seal conversion was completed on February 29 th, 2013 with start-up of the unit.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of careful considerations on the surface facilities at {{one of the most promising}} CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) candidate sites in Japan in regards to process, economy and energy consumption. This site has been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS total system in which CO 2 is captured from natural gas processing plants, transported to the injection site (100  km away from the plants), and then stored in the saline aquifers underneath the seabed of the Japan Sea. Four technical issues have been reviewed for the surface facilities, namely CO 2 transportation, removal of impurities in the CO 2 gas, the liquefied CO 2 heater models and the <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> for CO 2 pumps. As for the CO 2 transportation method, tanker trucks transportation is selected compared to pipelines because of the merits in a construction period, economy, and local citizen’s understanding and acceptance which are crucial for the realization of the project. Concerning process building, removal of impurities contained in the CO 2 gas has been considered first. CO 2 gas separated from natural gas contains hydrogen sulfide, mercury, and BTX in addition to water. These impurities must be eliminated prior to liquefaction of CO 2 because they could interfere with the process as well as for environmental considerations. The adsorption method is found to be effective for removing all these impurities. However, it is also found that adsorbent consumption rate depends largely on the process sequence with which the impurities are eliminated. After reviewing the results, it is found that the most economical sequence to eliminate these impurities is in the order of mercury, hydrogen sulfide, BTX, then water. Liquefied CO 2 heater models have been considered to reduce CO 2 emission. After transportation to the injection site, the liquefied CO 2 is pressurized and heated from − 10  °C to a super critical state of 40  °C in order to avoid phase transition inside the injection tube. Using a heat pump to utilize the heat in the air to improve the energy efficiency, CO 2 emission is substantially reduced by approximately 70 % compared to the conventional method using hot water from a boiler that uses heavy fuel oil. A centrifugal pump will be selected for CO 2 pumps because it can handle large volumes. An effective <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> is the tandem formation using vapor-liquid seal and dry gas seal for the first and the second stages respectively.

Some {{of the test}} results are described along with analysis performed to verify sealing performance on pusher and nonpusher seals in flashing and nonflashing hydrocarbons conducted per API Standard 682,? <b>Shaft</b> <b>Sealing</b> <b>Systems</b> for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,? testing requirements. API Standard 682 ?s mission {{was to create a}} specification for seals that would have a good probability of meeting emission regulations and have a life of at least three years. These testing requirements are set up to simulate refinery pump operation that entails continuous duty, pump shutoffs, fluid vaporization, or low pressure operation and to run the seals without a flush. While there are no pass/fail criteria established, the seals are expected to perform within regulated emission limits and demonstrate a minimum three year life. Testing seals to meet this standard required some face material evaluation and some optimization of the seal design parameters to improve performance. The testing was verified with finite element analysis to establish proper guidelines, in order to maintain design integrity with intermediate seal sizes. Two classes of mechanical seals were studied: *Process or liquid lubricated seals *Gas barrier lubricated seals. Both single and dual liquid lubricated, or contacting face seals, were tested to the standard?s requirements. In addition, tests were conducted to verify seal performance limits and to demonstrate stable operation, while being exposed to varying steady state pressures. API 682 does not currently cover the application of noncontacting gas barrier, seal designs.

The high level of modular construction employed in integrally geared turbomachines (IGTMs) allows for {{a high degree of}} standardization; the resulting building block system makes it possible to adapt the machine concept to each field of application and, in particular, to the customer's own requirements. Of prime importance here are the definition and geometry of the interfaces between the individual modules and equipment units, such as compressor and expansion stages, gear case, pinion <b>shafts,</b> <b>seal</b> <b>systems,</b> etc. The integrally geared centrifugal compressor has conquered many ranges of application in the process industry starting with compressors operated purely on air, followed by nitrogen and then carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, chlorine, hydrocarbons, acetylenexide, and isobutyric aldehyde, and so forth. A recent success involving the compressing of high purity oxygen to high discharge pressures using integrally geared centrifugal compressors deserves special mention. It had been thought that this could only be achieved using single shaft compressors. This means that for oxygen, too, the advantages of integrally geared centrifugal compressors such as efficiency and very broad operating ranges can be used, {{as in the case of}} variable oxygen supply systems (varox) in air separation plants. Energy recovery in the process industry has presented integrally geared centrifugal compressors with a new task. Tail gases often have high energy contents which can be returned directly to a compression process in the same machine through addition of expander stages. In its original concept, the integrally geared centrifugal compressor is primarily suitable for the use of low-speed drive units. By using "free" pinion shaft extensions or additional pinion shafts, high speed drive units without an external intermediate gear can also be used. This aspect, together with the integration of expander stages already mentioned, leads to a very interesting and economical application of integrally geared centrifugal compressors: alongside compression and expansion functions, IGTMs can be used for mechanical output power distribution in sophisticated process equipment such as dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and pure terephthalic acid (PTA systems) ...|$|R
