5|$|A multi-year field <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} R.emetica {{production}} in a scots pine plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms per hectare per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460kg per hectare per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms {{was estimated to}} be 4–7 days. In a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal species in a Sitka spruce forest, R.emetica was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, R.emetica was most prolific in the latter.|$|E

5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
