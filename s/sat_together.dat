5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> in Mission Control, {{reflecting}} on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 U.S. Open Cup Final {{was played}} on September 2 at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. A total of 17,329 fans {{attended}} the match, 38% of the stadium's available capacity. Approximately 200 Sounders FC fans <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> {{in the upper}} deck. Both the travel distance and the mid-week scheduling {{made it difficult for}} Seattle fans to attend. Live television coverage was provided nationally by Fox Soccer Channel.|$|E

5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> to view it.|$|E
5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E

Before the game, players and coaches on both teams engated in a flag ceremony. Castro greeted the Orioles on the field, and gave his Cuban team a pep talk. Cuban baseball legend Conrado Marrero threw out the first pitch.|$|E

25|$|The green room, {{where the}} artists rested after their performances, was altered from {{previous}} contests. Instead of competing artists and composers sitting together at tables, artists <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> on sofas beside the stage, while composers <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> {{in the front}} rows of the audience.|$|E
25|$|The meeting itself {{took place}} on 21 July 1858, with a first four-hour session {{starting}} at 11.00 and a second session running from 16.00 till 20.00. It was a Tuesday. The venue was a moving one: the two men <b>sat</b> <b>together,</b> without support staff, in a small horse-drawn carriage as it undertook a slow passage round and round the little town.|$|E
25|$|In 1918 {{the whole}} of Ireland {{was a part of}} the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and was {{represented}} in the British Parliament by 105 MPs. Whereas in Great Britain most elected politicians were members of either the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party, from the early 1880s most Irish MPs were Irish nationalists, who <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> in the British House of Commons as the Irish Parliamentary Party.|$|E

25|$|Orr jokingly {{founded the}} R.G.H., or Republican Governors' Husbands, which he {{referred}} to as the most exclusive club in the U.S., since he was the only member. (First Gentleman Kunin of Vermont was a Democrat). He and Kunin often <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> at meetings of Governors or Governors' spouses. Orr met Denis Thatcher, husband of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, at dinner at the White House, and told him of his admiration {{for his role in the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The company {{commander}} of C Company, (Newry), 3 UDR, was the former {{commander of the}} TA unit and {{was pleased to see}} that virtually all of his TA soldiers were on parade, in the TA Centre, in exactly the same drill hall as they had previously used, for the first night of the new regiment. He noted there were some former B Specials in the room and observed they did not initially associate with the others – not on the grounds of religion but because the former TA soldiers all knew each other socially and <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> on canteen breaks whereas the former specials kept to their group of comrades, but within a week both had melded together.|$|E
60|$|After exchanging hearty greetings, Walter led {{him away}} from the group, and the two <b>sat</b> down <b>together</b> on a bank.|$|R

25|$|The mass {{demonstrations of}} the 1960s were {{initiated}} {{with the arrival}} of more than 300 Freedom Riders on May 24, 1961. They were arrested in Jackson for disturbing the peace after they disembarked from their interstate buses. The interracial teams rode the buses from Washington, D.C. and <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> to demonstrate against segregation on public transportation, as the Constitution provides for unrestricted public transportation. Although the Freedom Riders had intended New Orleans as their final destination, Jackson was the farthest that any managed to travel. New participants kept joining the movement, as they intended to fill the jails in Jackson with their protest. The riders had encountered extreme violence along the way, including a bus burning and physical assaults. They attracted national media attention to the struggle for constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of the Zohar and the Kabbalah in Yemen, where it {{was introduced in the}} 17th century, contributed to the formation of the Dor Deah movement, led by Rabbi Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ in the later part of the 19th century, whose adherents believed that the core beliefs of Judaism were rapidly diminishing in favor of the mysticism of the Kabbalah. Among its objects was the opposition of the {{influence of}} the Zohar and subsequent developments in modern Kabbalah, which were then pervasive in Yemenite Jewish life, restoration of what they believed to be a rationalistic approach to Judaism rooted in authentic sources, and safeguardal of the older ("Baladi") tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance that preceded the Kabbalah. Especially controversial were the views of the Dor Daim on the Zohar, as presented in Milhamoth Hashem (Wars of the Lord), written by Rabbi Qafeḥ. A group of Jerusalem rabbis published an attack on Rabbi Qafeḥ under the title of Emunat Hashem (Faith of the Lord), taking measures to ostracize members of the movement; notwithstanding, not even the Yemenite rabbis who opposed the dardaim heeded this ostracization. Instead, they intermarried, <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> in batei midrash, and continued to sit with Rabbi Qafeḥ in beth din.|$|E

500|$|While {{searching for}} a {{permanent}} location, the congregation continued to meet and hold services at Granada Hall. Men and women <b>sat</b> <b>together,</b> unlike the traditional separate seating, and services were conducted in German and Hebrew. Within a few months, the former Calvary Protestant Episcopal church on Pearl Street, between Nasau and Concord, was purchased for $5,100 (today $) and renovated for another $2,000 (today $). [...] The new building was dedicated on March 30, 1862, and the congregation became known as [...] "the Pearl street synagogue". By 1868, membership had increased to 103, and by 1869, almost 100 students attended the Sunday school.|$|E
500|$|At Jena High School, about 10% of {{students}} are black and roughly 90% are white, reflecting {{the population of the}} town of Jena, which has about 3,000people. Some early reporting indicated that students of different races seldom <b>sat</b> <b>together,</b> for instance in the cafeteria, although this has been disputed. [...] According to early reports of the school environment, black students when outside typically sat on bleachers near the auditorium, while white students sat under a large tree {{in the center of the}} school courtyard, referred to as the [...] "white tree" [...] or [...] "prep tree". According to some of the school's teachers and administrators, the tree in question was not a [...] "white tree," [...] and students of all races had sat under it at one time or another.|$|E
500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran {{up the stairs and}} came in. Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I <b>sat</b> <b>together</b> and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E
