Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there still remains large premium variations within cantons. This indicates that competition {{has not been able}} so far to lead to a single price, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of the supplementary insurance. Our aim is to analyse two decisions (switching decision in basic insurance, subscription to supplementary insurance contracts). We use survey data on health plan choice and import some market data related to the sickness funds (number of enrollees, premiums). The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract</b> are estimated both separately and jointly. The results suggest that holding a supplementary insurance contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However the impact of supplementary insurance is not significant when the individual assesses his/her health as "very good"; to the contrary, holding a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract</b> significantly reduces the propensity to switch when the indivual's subjective health status deteriorates. Futhermore, the switching decision is positively influenced by the expected gain of switching. In comparison with the range of the premium difference, the limitations to switch due to the supplementary insurance is moderate, though non negligible. As for the decision to subscribe a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract,</b> the results show that the income level has a direct positive influence on the propensity to buy a supplementary insurance. Our results suggest that a major mechanism is going on in relation to supplementary insurance: holding a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract</b> might stop individuals from switching when the individual thinks that she/he could be regarded as a bad risk due to the selection practices that are allowed in supplementary insurance markets. This result bears major policy implications concerning the regulation of basic and supplementary insurance markets. competition in health insurance; switching behaviour; premium convergence; influence of supplementary insurance...|$|E

Cet article étudie le comportement de changement de caisse d'assurance maladie en Suisse. Malgré la loi de 1996 qui visait à promouvoir la concurrence entre caisses pour l'assurance maladie de base, de grandes différences de primes subsistent au sein de chaque canton. Ceci indique que la concurrence n'a pas conduit à un prix unique et montre une certaine inertie des consommateurs. Nous analysons une barrière potentielle au comportement de mobilité des consommateurs, à savoir l'impact de l'assurance complémentaire. L'analyse empirique porte sur des données d'enquête sur le choix d'assurance maladie. Les résultats suggèrent que détenir une assurance complémentaire diminue sensiblement la propention à changer de caisse, sauf lorsque l'état de santé est très bon. En outre, le gain potentiel à changer de caisse augmente la probabilité de changer. Le revenu est un élément déterminant du choix de souscrire une assurance complémentaire. Nos résultats indiquent qu'un mauvais état de santé peut entraîner un individu à hésiter à changer de caisse, ignorant s'il sera encore possible de souscrire une assurance complémentaire auprès du nouvel assureur. Dans tous les cas, la demande pour l'assurance de base et pour l'assurance complémentaire étant liées, la régulation de chacun de ces marchés ne peut être faite isolément de l'autre...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This article {{outlines}} {{the evolution of}} a community pharmacy-based supervised consumption of methadone program in Grater Glasgow. The formalization of this program in 1994 promoted full patient compliance with the methadone regimen and reduced seepage of the drug to the illicit market. 184 of the area's 215 community pharmacies now dispense methadone for the treatment of opiate dependence. Of these, 173 have a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract</b> with the local health board to supervise the consumption of methadone on their premises. In addition 15 of "methadone" pharmacists are involved in the provision of a pharmacy based needle exchange scheme. This {{has been shown to be}} the most efficient and cost effective method of delivering clean injecting equipment to injecting drug users in the Greater Glasgow area. Glasgow's pharmacists' have now been involved in the methadone and needle exchange programs for more than ten years. The support needed by pharmacists and the steps that have been put in place to provide this level of commitment are described. The development of the Glasgow pharmacy based services to drug users has had a major impact on practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom. </p...|$|E
40|$|Like {{many other}} countries, the Netherlands has a health {{insurance}} system that combines mandatory basic insurance with voluntary supplementary insurance. Both types of insurance are founded on different principles. Since basic and supplementary insurance are {{sold by the}} same health insurers, both markets may interact. This paper examines to what extent basic and supplementary insurance are linked {{to each other and}} whether these links generate spillover effects of supplementary on basic insurance. Our analysis is based on an investigation into <b>supplementary</b> health insurance <b>contracts,</b> underwriting procedures and annual surveys among 1, 700 - 2, 100 respondents over the period 2006 - 2009. We find that health insurers increasingly use a variety of strategies to enforce a joint purchase of basic and supplementary health insurance. Despite incentives for health insurers to use supplementary insurance as a tool for risk selection in basic insurance, we find limited evidence of supplementary insurance being used this way. Only a minority of health insurers uses health questionnaires when people apply for supplementary coverage. Nevertheless, we find that an increasing proportion of high-risk individuals believe that insurers would not be willing to offer them another <b>supplementary</b> insurance <b>contract.</b> We discuss several strategies to prevent or to counteract the observed negative spillover effects of supplementary insurance...|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Includes <b>supplementary</b> materialContingency <b>contracting</b> {{is the process}} where vital supplies and services needed to maintain deployed forces are obtained {{on behalf of the}} United States Government. These actions are used for emergencies, such as, disaster relief from hurricanes or from terrorist activities that occur within the United States or for actions that occur outside of the United States in order to support the deployed units. Due to the current trend in the DoD to contract out more products and services on the battlefield, an increase demand has been placed on contingency contract personnel. The purpose of this MBA Project is to develop and publish a Contingency Contracting MCI to assist the Marine Corps in training its contract personnel in preparation for deployment to a contingency operation. Currently there is not a requirement for the contracting specialist to attend a formal school prior to supporting a contingency operation. Furthermore, there are limited spaces for Marines to attend CON 234. The Contingency Contracting MCI will aid the contracting personnel with the training needed to be successful in a contingency environment and efficiently and effectively support Marine Corps units abroad. This project was sponsored by Headquarters Marine Corps, Installation and Logistics, Logistics Branch in conjunction with the Marine Corps Institute (MCI). The MBA Report has identified several problems in the current ability of the Marine Corps to train contracting personnel in contingency contracting and provides recommendations for further study. A draft Contingency Contracting MCI is included in the report. Captain, United States Marine CorpsMajor, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of enrolees in the Swiss basic health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there is limited evidence of premium convergence within cantons. This indicates that competition has not been effective so far, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of supplementary insurance. We use survey data on health plan choice (a sample of 1943 individuals whose switching behaviours were observed between 1997 and 2000) as well as administrative data relative to all insurance companies that operated in the 26 Swiss cantons between 1996 and 2005. The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract</b> are jointly estimated. Our findings show that holding a supplementary insurance contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However, there is no negative impact of supplementary insurance on switching when the individual assesses his/her health as 'very good'. Our results give empirical support to one possible mechanism through which supplementary insurance might influence switching decisions: given that subscribing to basic and supplementary contracts with two different insurers may induce some administrative costs for the subscriber, holding supplementary insurance acts {{as a barrier to}} switch if customers who consider themselves 'bad risks' also believe that insurers reject applications for supplementary insurance on these grounds. In comparison with previous research, our main contribution is to offer a possible explanation for consumer inertia. Our analysis illustrates how consumer choice for one's basic health plan interacts with the decision to subscribe to supplementary insurance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of sickness fund enrollees in the Swiss health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers, there still remains large premium variations within cantons. This indicates that competition {{has not been able}} so far to lead to a single price, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of the supplementary insurance on the choice for basic insurance plan in Switzerland, which has not been studied so far. Our aim is to analyse the two decisions (choice of health plan, subscription to supplementary insurance contracts). We use the data of the OFAS survey conducted in 2000 on health plan choice and import some additional data on the sickness funds (number of enrollees, premiums). The decision to switch is estimated by both logit and a fixed-effects logit models; two main explanatory variables are studied: premiums (for basic insurance contracts) and supplementary insurance. The results suggest that holding a supplementary insurance contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. The switching decision is positively influenced by the expected gain of switching, measured by the premium differential. The expected gain of switching is higher for switchers with no supplementary insurance (CHF 19. 44) than for switchers with supplementary insurance (CHF 13. 06). The income level has a direct positive influence on the propensity to buy a supplementary insurance. This finding suggests that the purchase of supplementary insurance is influenced, not only by risk aversion, but also by the willingness to pay for the goods covered by the supplementary insurance, which would be higher for rich people. Bad health has a negative influence on the subscription to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contract,</b> but is no longer significant when the income is introduced into the specification. All the information about health is captured by the income level, a low income being strongly correlated with a bad health status. Income and a supplementary insurance contract are observable by the insurance company, and can be used as tools for selection. Health Insurance, Private Sector...|$|E
