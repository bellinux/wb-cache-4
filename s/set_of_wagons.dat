50|$|Overpack was a wheelwright in Manistee, Michigan around 1875, {{when he was}} {{approached}} by a farmer to build a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 8 ft <b>wagon</b> wheels. He built these unusually large wagon wheels and sold them to the local farmer. Time passed and later this same farmer returned asking Overpack for an even larger <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> wheels. Overpack was very curious by this time. He asked the farmer {{what he was doing}} with such large wagon wheels. The farmer replied he was using them to skid logs.|$|R

50|$|In May 1989, {{locomotive}} 2109 was repainted in turquoise to haul a matched <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> for the Technorame train. This {{train was}} sponsored by the regional government of Wallonie and traveled around French-speaking Belgium displaying various high-tech items to the public for several months. At the end of this contract it re-entered regular service on both freight and passenger trains while still wearing its special colors. This continued for at least two months before it was repainted in the normal colors for the class.|$|E
5000|$|The Sjursøya train {{accident}} was a railway accident that occurred on 24 March 2010 at around 13:15 local time, when {{a set of}} 16 freight cars began to roll uncontrollably during shunting on Alnabru, north in Oslo. The train dispatcher central chose to lead the runaway train {{in the direction of}} Sjursøya, along the Loenga-Alnabru Line, where it derailed and rolled through a Statoil building in the terminal area at Sjursøya, a peninsula {{which is part of the}} Oslo ports facilities. The line leading to the container and petroleum port at Sjursøya is a branch of Østfold Line, and is only used at low speeds. However, the empty carriages crashed into the harbour terminal at an estimated speed of more than 100 km/h (62 mph). At the most, the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> had a speed of 90-140 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The yard has eleven arrival tracks, two hump {{tracks and}} 40 {{classification}} tracks up to 920 m long. The freight <b>wagons</b> or <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> are run {{over the hump}} and then retarded {{by a series of}} automatic retarders and finally pushed together for coupling. The wagons are then coupled together with their brake hoses and the brakes are tested by a remote-controlled brake test system. The entire marshalling operation is automatically controlled by a central electronic interlocking. Intervention by the signallers is only required if there is a fault.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quarries}} at Stanhope are at {{an altitude}} of 796 ft above sea level. The railway left the quarry sidings and turned north up the hillside, by rope worked inclines. From Stanhope to the Crawley engine was half a mile long on gradients of 1 in 8 and 1 in 12, passing through Hog Hill tunnel, about [...] long. At the Crawley engine (1,223 ft above sea level) the ropes were changed and the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> were drawn up to the Weatherhill engine, over a mile away, over gradients of 1 in 21 and 1 in 13.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a railway {{optimization}} problem {{known as the}} Train Unit Assignment Problem. A train unit consists of a self-contained train with an engine and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> with passenger seats. Given a set of timetabled train trips, each with a required number of passenger seats, {{and a set of}} train units, each with a given number of available seats, the problem calls for the best assignment of the train units to the trips, possibly combining more than one train unit for a given trip, that fulfills the seat requests. We propose a heuristic algorithm based on the computation of a lower bound obtained by solving an Integer Linear Programming model that gives the optimal solution in a "peak period" of the day. The performance of the heuristic algorithm is computationally evaluated on real-world instances provided by a regional Italian Train Operator. The results are compared with those of existing methods from the literature, showing that the new method is able to obtain solutions of good quality in much shorter computing times...|$|E

50|$|It {{is highly}} likely that men also {{travelled}} the line unofficially, riding on wagons. In February 1892 this practice became formalised - quarrybound {{before the first}} shift on a Monday morning and homebound after the last shift on a Saturday; expressly at the rider's own risk. These trains consisted of around thirty transporter wagons with a full <b>set</b> <b>of</b> slate <b>wagons</b> on top, on which the men sat back to back, facing outwards.|$|R
50|$|Michigan logging wheels, {{also known}} as big wheels, high wheels, logging wheels, logger wheels, lumbering wheels, bummer carts, {{katydids}} or nibs, are a type of skidder. It extended the season in which the logging industry could extract timber from the North Woods of Michigan, by removing the need for icy ground to travel over. The logging wheels were a specially designed large <b>set</b> <b>of</b> wooden <b>wagon</b> wheels that could carry logs that were up to 100 feet in length, several at a time.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the railway}} superstructure is mainly influenced by its quality, by the operational technical conditions, climatic phenomena {{and above all}} by the dynamic load by the pair of wheels of the rail vehicles and also {{by the quality of}} railway subgrade. Simultaneously, the dynamic parameters also depend on the speed of rail vehicles, on the arrangement of axles, their spring mounting and on the spring mounting of the body casing or on the weight acting on the axle, and last but not least, also {{on the quality of the}} running surface of the wheel tyre. The dynamic effects <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> are transferred through the rails to the rail pads below the base of the rails, then to the sleepers or bearers and fastening system, then to the ballast bed and also to the superstructure construction. This fact applies especially for turnout structures. In turnout rigidity is changed and also there is a place where the wheel passes over a gap (in case of fixed crossings). In particular of above mentioned reasons, turnout is a place where high dynamic effects occurre and that is why often defects occurre. Dissertation thesis will be focused on measurement and analysis of the dynamic effects on turnout. The point of the thesis will be updating recent system (observing of the geometrical parameters and wear of the rails in turnouts) for dynamic effect observe. Methodology of the measurement and convenient mathematical apparatus for analysing dynamic effect will be proposed...|$|R
500|$|A {{different}} {{group of}} about 300 men, called the Totenjuden ("Jews of death"), {{lived and worked in}} Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. For the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after gold teeth had been extracted. Once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal. Each trainload of [...] "deportees" [...] brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily guarded wagons. They were divided into three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the Sonderkommandos to be exchanged for the next <b>set</b> <b>of</b> twenty <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hownes Gill defile {{presented}} a major constraint on mineral and passenger traffic. Some relief {{was obtained from}} 1853 when it was found possible to run <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> three <b>wagons</b> down the very steep inclines and up the other side on their own wheels, but finished iron products on wagons were liable to shift on the descent. At length in December 1856 the Stockton and Darlington Railway (as interim operators of the line) decided to substitute a viaduct for the inclines; the viaduct was designed by Thomas Bouch. The viaduct of twelve arches was opened on 1 July 1858. It was 730 feet long and 150 feet high. It {{was one of the}} most spectacular viaducts in the north east of England, constructed of firebrick, constructed for a single line.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} brakesmen on the goods train; however, both men {{dismounted}} {{to take part}} in the shunting operations. The wagons did not have their own brakes applied, and so were held solely by the brake van - on a gradient of as much as 1 in 100, falling towards Abergele. The next <b>set</b> <b>of</b> loaded <b>wagons</b> were 'loose shunted' into the original wagons with such force as to jostle the brake van and release its own unsecured brake, and the wagons moved off in the direction of Abergele. The brake van was unoccupied, and no-one was able to catch up with it in order to board it and reapply the brake; the runaway <b>wagons</b> disappeared out <b>of</b> sight around a curve in the line. The next thought was to reverse the engine towards Abergele and retrieve the wagons, but this intention was quickly overtaken by the succeeding events.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the output}} of the {{committees}} have been lost but where they still exist there is a clear link to the new regulations and manuals that started to be issued in 1921. By 1923, the major outputs of this work were completed and the results show up in new manuals issued from that time which demonstrate a high level of tactical thought. Experience from World War I was incorporated as seen in the new infantry regulation of October 1922 where 10-12 squads included a light machine gun with the rifle section and fluid fire-and-manoeuvre stormtroop tactics are endorsed. It is also {{important to note that the}} manuals do not limit themselves to the armaments allowed by the Versailles Treaty envisaging tactics using forbidden infantry cannons for example. It is here that we see explicit strategic capabilities being built into the new unified doctrines, so such things as cross-training requirements being built into regulations; e.g. transport troops being required to train a <b>set</b> number <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> drivers as cannon gunners and as engineers specialising in bridges.|$|R
50|$|The long-distance train - APO was {{originally}} tasked with finding a suitable train for long-distance traffic. However, {{it was later}} rumoured that the lyntog-concept might be re-introduced within a few years, {{and so it was}} decided to find a suitable design for that concept. Several requirements were made: primarily to use air-conditioning for cooling and heating of passenger areas, and be able to use either electric or diesel propulsion. The second requirement were due to the fact, that the Danish politicians had yet {{to decide whether or not}} to fund a proposed electrification of the mainlines of the Danish railroads.At the time, no such train were available, so the group designed one themselves. In order to avoid propulsion units in the train (and thus reducing variants and development costs), it were designed to use a locomotive to haul it, and equip the end wagons with driver cabins. The train were designed a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 5 <b>wagons,</b> with a service wagon in the middle (containing a small kiosk, and other facilities) and 4 passenger wagons.|$|R
