Wine tourism is a hybrid activity that integrates wine and tourism industries. Many wine regions and <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> promote their <b>wine</b> through visitations of wineries. Wine, wine region and <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> are main elements of wine tourism product. A successful wine tourism experience depends on point of view of producers on visitation to wineries as well as quality of wine and regional attractiveness.

The regional products have started to be more demanded from Chilean customers and there was a need to find out if regional products can be connected to branding. There was analysed literature review, corresponding researches and studies. There was also created the pilot online survey about the Chilean customer's preferences. The pilot online survey is limited with the sample size and hence the sample is not representative. Therefore, the main focus is to find out how the consumers understand the questions and what should be the main improvements for the future research to avoid misunderstanding. The survey fulfilled 80 respondents and there was found out that 71, 25 % of respondents decide to buy bottle of wine according to brand or name of the winery. The main attributes such as brand, name of winery, year and origin place was found out as the most important attributes for respondents. There was applied recommendation for future research to apply also qualitative research in form of in-depth interview or focus groups as there can be easily misunderstood the visual meaning.

40|$|Distribution can {{be defined}} as a way of goods from {{producer}} to consumer. In wine production industry there exist several distribution channels, through which wine is distributed to the final consumer. Aim {{of this paper is to}} identify and compare advantages and disadvantages of particular distribution channels for wine sales related to a small wine-producer. Distribution of wine to the final consumer is done through dealers represented by retail chains, specialized wine-shops, hotels, and restaurants. In a smaller scale it is done through internet sales, own outlets and wine auctions. According to the research of Focus agency, Marketing & Social Research, done in 2009, customers buy wine mostly in retail chains and decide on sort and quality of wine directly at the moment of purchase. Selection is based except wine quality also on the shape of the bottle, etiquette, and also cork (consumers explicitly prefer cork, and the screw top rather discourages). Certain part of customers – specifically those, who are more acquainted with wine – buy wine in special wine-shops. The research shows a decrease of direct wine-sales. When using services of independent trade organizations, producers have to control the intensity of commercial activities and knowledge of technical characteristics of products. <b>Small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers,</b> though, do not have to use this distribution channel, and can focus only on direct sales. For some <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers,</b> specifically those operating in the areas with an extended possibility for wine-tourism, this channel can be more suitable and effective than using retail chains. This way of distribution does not require extensive start-up investments, it is directly dependent on producers own effort, and can be done as a supplementary activity to the main source of income. Regardless the particular choice of a distribution channel by a small wine producer it is necessary to be judged not only from the viewpoint of its advantages and disadvantages, but also by a detailed analy­sis of costs of sales...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to understand}} why French <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> venture into direct sale to customers instead of selling bulk wine to wine companies. The empirical tests on the French Farm Census confirm the value of both Resource-Based Perspective and Transaction Cost Economics in understanding organizational choices in agriculture and food markets. Because asset specificity in wine trade is low on average, large <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> have an advantage over smaller ones and so {{are more likely to}} venture into direct sale of generic <b>wines.</b> By contrast <b>smaller</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> are more likely to rely on the bulk wine market, which is less risky for them. In addition our model helps us to understand the effect of the State-sponsored certification of grape and wine quality, the Protected Designation of Origin system. All other things being equal, producers with vineyards of high reputation (PDO) {{are also more likely to}} bottle and sell their wines; we guess this is because they wish to capture the value of the PDO reputation, the collective brand name capital owned by the farmers. Finally, saving on transaction cost is only one side of the coin: the most educated <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> can profitably reinvest their knowledge and capabilities into new activities. These choices have important consequence on the French Wine Supply Chain governance...|$|R

It shows that foreign tourists helped these firms to expand internationally: they identified business opportunities, suggested firms to contact importers, contacted importers themselves {{to get access to}} the same wine in their home country or provided foreign market knowledge. Thus, <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> should pay more attention to attracting tourists and creating network relationship with them.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 2 decades, wine {{sales of the}} leading {{traditional}} wine producing countries (France, Italy and Spain) have faced increasing international competition. Sales have been eroded by encroachment from other beverages, changing lifestyles, demography, increased production of other European producers and the economic crisis. Conversely, French wine export has begun to increase with estimates for 2013 at 7, 835 million Euros (OIV, 2014; XERFI 700, 2014). This is due to wine consumption increasing in the USA and China, two of the main export markets for France (De La Chesnais, 2013; Julien, 2013). Business strategies appropriate of large scale wine producers from France, Italy and Spain, have been much studied and written about.

50|$|A micro-winery is a <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producer</b> {{that does}} not have its own vineyard, and instead sources its grape product from outside suppliers. The concept is similar to a microbrewery, in that small batches of product are made {{primarily}} for local consumption. The concept of the micro-winery is not as easily accepted as that of the microbrewery, however, as the general public has been conditioned to associate a winery as having a vineyard. A winery uses similar wine-making equipment as a major commercial winery, just on a smaller scale. Glass carboys and sanitary plastic pails are often seen in the facilities of a micro-winery. Typically, each batch of wine yields 23 Liters (6 US gallons).One of the primary differences of a micro-winery as compared to a typical winery is that a micro-winery is typically able to offer a wider range of wines; as it is not tied to the grapes it grows. New York State provides a specific micro-winery license that requires the microwinery to purchase local ingredients.|$|R

40|$|International audienceArgentina, {{a country}} which {{produces}} foods for the world, is currently in a paradoxical situation: theexportation of commodities is ever increasing, but poverty rates are also increasing. Agricultural policies have not yet solved the conflict arising from such a contradiction. They arecentered on an exclusively agricultural treatment {{of the situation and}} based on programs aiming atthe enhancement of production and productivity of those products which generate currency income,disregarding the fact that rural affairs involve other very significant dimensions. In this highly critical context, the Faculty of Agrarian and Forest Sciences of the National University ofLa Plata carried out a project with <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> from Berisso -a city 70 km away from theCity of Buenos Aires-, based on the activation of a typical product: the wine of Berisso coast. Theinvestigation project was developed from 1999 to 2009 and it allowed constructivist learning and the recovery of know-how and the territorial identity of traditional producers, by means of the recognition of their practices and the product's anchorage to a specific territory. Innovation was generated by the different actors, adapting their ways of producing and marketing to a successfulvaluation scheme agreed by consensus. This case is interesting to outline a methodology of activation of Localized Agroalimentary Systems(SIAL), defined as "organizations of production and services (agricultural production units, agroalimentary companies, service companies, gastronomic companies [...] .) associated, by their characteristics and functioning, to a specific territory. Means, products, people, institutions, know¬how, alimentary behavior and relationship networks are combined into a form of agroalimentaryorganization in a given geographical space" (Muchnik J., Sautier D., Cirad-SAD, 1998). Localized agroalimentary systems take the specificity of the local and its interaction with the global asa starting point. The common objective of such contributions is to foster territorial developmentthrough the valuation of local products, especially food. The concept of system implies the interaction of different elements. The SIAL approach consists, in thefirst place, in the delimitation of such systems and the identification of their components, in order toensure an adequate methodological tool for the coordination of the elements and the stability andefficiency of the systems. SIAL include a wide variety of situations, from productions destined forlocal markets or self-consumption to productions destined for exportation (Muchnik, J. 2008).

40|$|Mestrado em Viticultura e Enologia - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Ciências - Universidade do PortoIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a sharp {{increase}} in the number of wine brands that appear in the market, making it essential for producers to know the process of consumer buying in order to setup an adequate marketing strategy that can differentiate its brand among the competitors. In Portugal, the most part of wine producers are small producers, which due to their small dimension and to the lack of investment in marketing strategies, base their selling strategies on common sense. This dissertation aims to identify and analyse the habits and the underlying criteria on the decision taking by the consumers upon the wine bought, with the final objective of setting up an effective marketing strategy on the internal market for <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producers.</b> After the bibliographic review, we have identified five consumption occasions (―Daily consumption, at home‖, ―On a special occasion, at home‖, ―Daily consumption, away from home‖, ―On a special occasion, away from home‖ and ―To offer‖), nine points of purchase, twenty two criteria on bought decision, five price levels and nine sources of information. We have elaborated a conceptual framework that identifies and analyses the four Ps of Marketing Mix (Placement, Product, Price and Promotion), being it tested by the hypotheses of the investigation. The three hypotheses for the empiric investigation are:  Hypothesis 1 : Different type of consumers imply different consumption occasions.  Hypothesis 2 : Different consumption occasions imply different points of purchase.  Hypothesis 3 : Different points of purchase imply different shopping criteria. With the purpose of testing the investigation hypothesis, it was defined a two phase empiric investigation methodology: exploratory phase, where we conducted low structured enquires to wine consumers, wine sellers and to a general manager of wine-growing farm; quantitative phase, based on a questionnaire made to a sample of consumers (over 16 years-old) residents on the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. After the data treatment we confirmed the validity of the hypothesis and the empiric evaluation of the model and we were able to identify sixteen different types of consumers, segmented based on the gender, age, occupation and purchasing attitude. The main results are presented as follows:  The penetration level of the consumption occasion differs from type of consumer, however there is a general trend for the consumption on special occasions.  The Hypotheses 2 is only relevant for the ―Take Home‖ consumption, as the ―Restaurant‖ is always the main point of purchase when the consumption is made right away. For theoccasion ―Take Home‖, the ―Hypermarket‖ –in absolute terms- worth more than any other point of purchase, even though there are differences when considering relative values.  Even though the five main purchase criteria are very similar when we analyse and compare by point of purchase and by occasion of consumption, crossing the i) consumption occasion with the point of purchase and crossing ii) occasion of consumption with the type of consumer, the average values differ and the remaining attributes vary its influence level.  The price paid by bottle depends on the occasion of consumption, on the point of purchase and on the type of consumer. We may conclude that the small producers must differentiate themselves from competitors based on the purchase criteria with greater influence on buyers to gain a competitive edge against other competitors. The target segment where small producers should have as its main focus on marketing strategy is the ―Experts‖. For this type of consumers the pricing strategy is critical; they are quite well informed about the market offer and so the producer must set the price so its product could be value for money...|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper analyze export and {{competitiveness}} of wine export from the Republic of Serbia. Main goal of the research reflects in perceiving basic features of export and competitiveness of wine export from the Republic of Serbia on international market. The analysis encloses time period 2004 - 2007. The amount of wine export is very modest and, in observed period, was realized average export of 8, 6 million litres, which value amounts 9, 6 million USD. Only 5 % of total domestic production is exported. In export structure dominate CEFTA agreement signatory countries. Export price of wine from Serbia is doubly less in regard to average world price, and thrice {{in regard to the}} biggest world exporter – Italy. Average export price of wine produced in Serbia is on the level of 1, 11 USD per litre. The export structure is very unfavourable, i. e. dominates wine in bulk (90 %), while only 10 % of total export makes wine in bottles, which, for sure, reflects to attained export price. The authors quote that main limitation factors of Serbian <b>wine</b> export are <b>small</b> surfaces under grapevine, inappropriate structure of production, i. e. lack of qualitative and top-class (famous) wines. The wines which produce in Serbia, on international market, are competitive by price. However, low quality represents limitation factor of competitiveness increase. Unfavourable production structure and wine export represents one more limitation factor of competitiveness increase. In total wine production in Serbia, top-class wines participate with less than 15 %, participation of qualitative wines is 20 %, while the higher participation, more than 65 %, have table wines, and more produces white (64 %) than rose wines (36 %). Previously mentioned is in opposition with demand trends on international market. Along with quality increase and change of production and export structure, there can be expected also increase of Serbian wine prices on international market. Analyzing the world turnover of wine, the authors resolve that leading exporters of wine have developed production and long tradition in wine export. Besides, there are series of governmental stimulations, aiming at export increase, which is significant from aspect of competitiveness increase. The European Union has increased wine export quota from 55 to 63 thousand hectolitres to the Republic of Serbia for duty free export, and mentioned decision on export quotas increase represents an incentive for faster development of viticulture and wine production in Serbia. As an imperative, the authors quote increase of high-quality wines participation in export, which have higher price in regard to table wines. They find that own chance for export must not be looked-for in quantity, because Serbia is relatively <b>small</b> <b>wine</b> <b>producer,</b> concerning high quality according to selected market segments, but also that Serbia must leave the path of industrial wines and produces only high-quality wines. In this paper has been pointed out to necessary measures, aiming at more dynamic export and competitiveness increase of wine export from Serbia. The Authors find that main focus should be on intellectual capital, which means permanent education of producers, in order to get wines of the highest quality which will find their consumers in a competitive world market. wine, export, competitiveness, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

To fill this gap, we assess perspectives of <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> and residents regarding CES provided by vineyards in two wine regions: Southeast England, an emerging wine area, and the counties of Sonoma and Napa, California (hereafter: Sonoma and Napa), a more traditional wine area. We used Q-methodology to reveal the perspectives expressed by participants from both areas, each of whom ranked 44 Q-statements. We found that <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> and local residents have different perceptions. In Southeast England, <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> are more positive about vineyard landscapes than residents. <b>Wine</b> <b>producers</b> in Sonoma and Napa value CES directly connected with wine production, while residents emphasize CES that benefit nature conservation or entertainment. Comparing the regions, we conclude that Southeast England vineyards represent sometimes unwelcome development to residents, while in Sonoma and Napa they represent conservation of nature and tradition. Our findings show that perspectives on CES are experience- and context-dependent, as the perspectives on vineyards of residents and <b>wine</b> <b>producers</b> are strongly held but vary widely. Understanding these perspectives will help land use planners and regional politicians make better decisions for optimizing available CES...|$|R
