40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration's Integrated Noise Model (INM) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} tools for land use {{planning}} around airports. The INM currently calculates airplane noise lateral attenuation using the methods contained in the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automotive</b> <b>Engineer's</b> Aerospace Information Report No. 1751 (SAE AIR 1751). Researchers have noted that improved lateral attenuation algorithms may improve airplane noise prediction. The authors of SAE AIR 1751 based existing methods on empirical data collected from flight tests using 1960 s-technology airplanes with tail-mounted engines. To determine whether the SAE AIR 1751 methods are applicable for predicting the engine installation component of lateral attenuation for airplanes with wing-mounted engines, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sponsored a series of flight tests during September 2000 at their Wallops Flight Facility. Four airplanes, a Boeing 767 - 400, a Douglas DC- 9, a Dassault Falcon 2000, and a Beech KingAir, were flown through a 20 microphone array. The airplanes were flown through the array at various power settings, flap settings, and altitudes to simulate take-off and arrival configurations.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} at the AneCom AeroTest facility in Wildau, Germany {{to determine the effects}} of inlet total pressure distortions, representative of those expected for an inlet to a supersonic business jet, on fan performance. A Rolls-Royce fan, similar to one that would be used for a supersonic business jet engine, was tested with several different inlet total pressure distortions. The distortions were designed to capture the effects of an inlet cone, struts associated with the cone, endwall boundary layers, and wind gusts. Following industry best practice procedures, the change in performance and inlet flow characteristics are described based on the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automotive</b> <b>Engineer</b> (SAE) documents: AIR- 1419 and ARP- 1420. The fan was found to be very sensitive to tip radial distortion, where alteration of the flow condition at the tip was seen to either enhance or deteriorate the fan stability, especially when the fan instability is rotating stall or surge. Circumferential distortion was found to have the most impact when the fan instability is flutter. Using correlation method recommended by SAE, radial distortion was successfully correlated to surge margin loss. ^ Additionally, lessons learned from wire-gauze screen design work done at the Purdue Compressor/Pre-Diffuser/Combustor (CPC) Research facility were documented. The single stage facility models the last stage of a high pressure compressor, and to create the proper inlet flow, multiple screens with partial spanwise coverage were used. The effect of changing screen porosity, screen spanwise coverage, and the addition or removal of gear rack (blockage generator) at the tip and hub to the inlet total pressure profile was documented. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper reports ongoing {{research}} {{in which we}} are developing tests and procedures to evaluate quality of digital map databases for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. One of our frames of reference is the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automotive</b> <b>Engineer's</b> standard entitled, Truth-in-Labeling Standard for Navigation Map Databases (SAE J 1663, issued August 1995). Broader issues of database standards, interoperability across regions, and between ITS products are also involved. Digital map databases are representations of entities in the real world in which locational references, attributes and relationships are preserved. The representations must meet accuracy and functional requirements which, in turn, depend upon the type of applications. We are developing methods for identifying and separating different types of errors on a vendor map by comparing segments of the vendor map with the corresponding portion of a reference map of greater positional accuracy. So far our work has focused on positional and topological measures of errors in a digital map intended for use for motor vehicle navigation. Errors of displacement, omission and commission are identified by these procedures. We have found that when discrepancies of definition/representation and currency exist with respect to the two sources, the discrepancies cannot be distinguished from errors due to interdependencies, hence the pressing need for data standards. We have tried to automate the error testing procedures leaving human interpretation and ground verification to a minimum in order to keep costs of quality checking at some feasible level. We have found that the positional errors are not just randomly distributed but have associated systematic errors, and possess high spatial variability. Further study of the spatial structure of this distribution is required in order to develop an appropriate sampling strategy...|$|R

25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>Automotive</b> <b>Engineers</b> identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E
