40|$|A Global 40 -year {{simulation}} from 1980 to 2019 {{was performed}} with the FinROSE chemistry-transport model based {{on the use of}} coupled chemistry GCM-data. The main focus of our analysis is on climatological-scale processes in high latitudes. The resulting trend estimates for the past period (1980 &ndash; 1999) agree well with observation-based trend estimates. The results for the future period (2000 &ndash; 2019) suggest that the extent of <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> over both northern and southern high-latitudes has likely reached its maximum. Furthermore, while climate change is expected to cool the stratosphere, this cooling is unlikely to accelerate significantly high latitude ozone depletion. However, the recovery of seasonal high latitude ozone losses will not take place during the next 15 years...|$|E

These changes are likely to alter plant distribution, biodiversity and morphology, which may have knockon effects for microbially driven biogeochemical cycling and other soil processes. Our study examined the transmission of solar UV radiation through arctic tundra plants using a portable UV radiometer and the DLR-biofilm biological UV dosimeter. A strong negative correlation was found between vegetation cover and UV transmission to the soil surface. Penetration of UV to the soil beneath tundra plants varied depending upon plant morphology, being greater through low creeping plants than cushion plants, grasses or mosses.

Photodecomposition of CFCl 3 on an ice surface grown on Ru(001) is studied in connection with the formation of chlorine reservoir in ozone hole chemistry. We have evidenced that the photolysis of CFCl 3 on the ice surface leaves anionic chlorine are coordinated to the free OH species. This enables high concentration storage of chlorine on the ice surface. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> above the Antarctic has been of particular interest because it has suffered extensive damage: this is well known “ozone hole”. 1) The ozone layer over the Antarctic becomes a catastrophically damaged in spring;in winter, however, the hole is closed. The theory that accounts for seasonal depletion of ozone considers thereservoirs. 2) Less reactive compounds such as HCl or ClONO 2 are considered as the reservoirs. These molecules are thought to be produced by the quenching reaction between chlorine radicals and CH 4 or NO 2 molecules. A heterogeneous reaction between reservoir...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic {{polar vortex}} in winter {{is known to}} be {{chemically}} primed for <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion,</b> yet it does not exhibit the large <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> decrease that characterizes its southern counterpart. This difference may be due in part to a net flux of ozone-rich air through the Arctic vortex, which can mask ozone loss. But by using a chemically conserved tracer as a reference, significant ozone loss can be identified. This loss is found to be correlated with high levels of chlorine monoxide, suggesting that much of the decrease in ozone is caused by anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons...|$|R
5000|$|The {{chemistry}} of the Antarctic polar vortex has created severe <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion.</b> The nitric acid in polar stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine, which catalyzes the photochemical destruction of ozone. Chlorine concentrations build {{up during the}} polar winter, and the consequent ozone destruction is greatest when the sunlight returns in spring. These clouds can only form at temperatures below about -80 C. Since there is greater air exchange between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes, <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> at the north pole is much less severe than at the south. Accordingly, the <b>seasonal</b> reduction of <b>ozone</b> levels over the Arctic is usually characterized as an [...] "ozone dent", whereas the more severe <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> over the Antarctic is considered an [...] "ozone hole". This said, chemical ozone destruction in the 2011 Arctic polar vortex attained, for the first time, a level clearly identifiable as an Arctic [...] "ozone hole".|$|R

40|$|The sudden {{onset of}} catastrophic ozone losses over Antarctica {{a decade ago}} evokes the {{response}} of a feedback system under a steady perturbation. In this paper an explicit feedback mechanism is proposed and incorporated into a kinetic model that mimics observable trends for major variables. The essence of the proposal is that the extent and time profile of <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> actually imply the coupling of [O_ 3], radiative heating, cloud persistence and heterogeneous regeneration of photochemically active chlorine species. The model seeks insight into the phenomenon as a paradigm of unanticipated amplification of human activity, strives for clarity and relevance and complies with fundamental principles and with global constraints such as ozone levels and decay rates, chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and cloud sightings. Two main conclusions emerge: 1) the local regeneration of active chlorine mediated by nitrogen dioxide on ice clouds after sunrise is a key factor, and 2) local ozone losses become highly sensitive to initial conditions, and to slight perturbations of the catalytic activity of clouds, above critical levels of active chlorine...|$|E
40|$|We use the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) {{chemistry}} and transport model with Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological fields to quantify heterogeneous chemical ozone loss in Arctic winters 2005 - 2015. Comparisons to Aura Microwave Limb Sounder N 2 O and O 3 observations show the GMI simulation credibly represents the transport processes and net heterogeneous chemical loss necessary to simulate Arctic ozone. We {{find that the}} maximum <b>seasonal</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> varies linearly {{with the number of}} cold days and with wave driving (eddy heat flux) calculated from MERRA fields. We use this relationship and MERRA temperatures to estimate seasonal ozone loss from 1993 to 2004 when inorganic chlorine levels were in the same range as during the Aura period. Using these loss estimates and the observed March mean 63 - 90 N column O 3, we quantify the sensitivity of the ozone dynamical resupply to wave driving, separating it from the sensitivity of ozone depletion to wave driving. The results show that about 2 / 3 of the deviation of the observed March Arctic O 3 from an assumed climatological mean is due to variations in O 3 resupply and 13 is due to depletion. Winters with a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) before mid-February have about 1 / 3 the depletion of winters without one and export less depletion to the midlatitudes. However, a larger effect on the spring midlatitude ozone comes from dynamical differences between warm and cold Arctic winters, which can mask or add to the impact of exported depletion...|$|E

50|$|Electron {{precipitation}} {{can lead}} to a substantial, short-term loss of ozone (capping out at around 90%). However, this phenomenon also correlates to some long term <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> as well. Studies have revealed that 60 major electron precipitation events occurred from 2002 to 2012. Different measurement tools (see below) read different <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> averages ranging from 5-90%. However, some of the tools (specifically the ones that reported lower averages) did not take accurate readings or missed a couple of years. Typically, <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> resulting from electron precipitation is more common during the winter season. The largest EEP event from the studies during 2002 to 2012 was recorded in October 2003. This event caused an <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> of up to 92%. It lasted for 15 days and the ozone layer was fully restored a couple of days afterwards.

Stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> peaks in October November, whereas tropospheric trends are largest in December-January, concurrent with maximum ozone changes close to the tropopause.

In this study the climate response to <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> exclusively below 164 hPa is simulated using HadSM 3 -L 64, and compared with simulations in which <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> is prescribed exclusively above 164 hPa.

40|$|On a hemispheric scale, it is {{now well}} {{established}} that stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> has been the principal driver of externally forced atmospheric circulation changes south of the Equator in the last decades of the 20 th Century. The impact of <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> has been felt over the entire hemisphere, {{as reflected in the}} poleward drift of the midlatitude jet, the southward expansion of the summertime Hadley cell and accompanying precipitation trends deep into the subtropics. On a regional scale, however, surface impacts directly attributable to <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> have yet to be identified. In this paper we focus on South Eastern South America (SESA), a region that has exhibited one of the largest wetting trends during the 20 th Century. We study the impact of <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> on SESA precipitation using output from 6 different climate models, spanning a wide range of complexity. In all cases we contrast pairs of model integrations with and without <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion,</b> but with all other forcings identically specified. This allows for unambiguous attribution of the computed precipitation trends. All 6 climate models consistently reveal that stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> results in a significant wetting of SESA over the period 1960 – 1999.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the parameterisation {{of chemical and}} dynamical processes in the Antarctic stratosphere. Statistical models for the inter- and intra-annual variability in Antarctic stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> were developed based on theory {{and an understanding of}} the coupling of dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere. It was confirmed that the primary driver of the long-term trend in the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole is halogen loading in the stratosphere. The year-to-year variability in ozone mass deficit, a measure of the severity of Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion,</b> could be described by a linear combination of South Pole temperatures and midlatitude wave activity. A time lag of two weeks between wave activity effects and <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> indicates the predictive capability of meteorological parameters for seasonal projections of the severity of the Antarctic ozone hole. The statistical model describing the inter-annual variability in ozone mass deficit was regressed against observations from 1979 to 2004. The resulting regression coefficients were applied to South Pole temperature and wave activity fields from 28 chemistry-climate models. This analysis indicates a slight increase in the year-to-year variability in the severity of Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion.</b> As a prelude to analysing the seasonal evolution of Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion,</b> an improved <b>ozone</b> mass deficit measure was derived by replacing the constant 220 DU threshold with a seasonal varying pre-ozone hole background which leads to better capturing the true extent of the depleted ozone. Furthermore, it was shown that the new measure represents the chemical ozone loss within the Antarctic vortex provided that no mixing occurs through the vortex boundary. This new measure has many advantages over previous stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> indices. The conventional ozone mass deficit omits large amounts of depleted mass of ozone, and the onset of <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> does not coincide with the timing of when sunlight first reaches areas of polar stratospheric clouds as expected from theory. Chemical ozone loss derived with a tracer-tracer correlation technique depends on ozone and passive tracer profile measurements which are not as readily available as the total column ozone fields required for the new ozone mass deficit presented in this thesis. As such, the new <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> measure combines the simplicity of the old ozone mass deficit index with higher accuracy of the actual amount of chemically depleted stratospheric ozone. Furthermore, when applying the new definition of ozone mass deficit to chemistry-climate model outputs, model intercomparisons should become easier to interpret because biases in the models can be avoided. Based on theory and understanding of the coupling of chemistry and dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere, two semi-empirical models were developed to describe the intra-seasonal evolution of chlorine activation and <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion.</b> Regression of the models against chlorine monoxide and ozone mass deficit from observations results in coefficients that capture key sensitivities in the real atmosphere. The <b>seasonal</b> evolution of <b>ozone</b> mass deficit can be described with these coefficients and readily available meteorological fields (temperature and wind fields). The predictive capability of these models was demonstrated for 2005 and 2006. Given temperature and wind fields, which for example can be obtained from general circulation models, these models can predict the size and depth of the Antarctic ozone hole. Important applications of the semi-empirical models could be chemistry-climate model validation by comparing the sensitivities from observations and models which may provide new insights into potential sources of differences in chemistry-climate model projections of Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion.</b> Furthermore, projection of the inter-annual and intra-seasonal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole into the future can help to assess the potential recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|R
