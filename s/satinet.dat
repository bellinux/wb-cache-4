50|$|Many early textile centers {{developed}} {{as part of}} the American Industrial Revolution. Among them, the Blackstone Valley became a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. The town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts became an early textile center in the Blackstone Valley, which was known for the manufacture of cashmere wool and <b>satinets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hockanum Mill in Rockville / Vernon CT was {{originally}} constructed in 1814 by Bingham & Nash. They became a leading manufacturer of <b>satinet.</b> The Hockum Mills in Connecticut {{was formed in}} 1836 and constructed a larger mill to produce <b>satinet,</b> a finely woven fabric that resembles satin but is made from wool. They continued to produce <b>satinet</b> until 1869. <b>Satinet</b> was also an important commodity {{for the people of}} West Tisbury, MA, on the island of Martha's Vineyard Ma. The Old Mill Pond property in that town was purchased by David Look in 1809 and he converted what was once a grain mill to textile mill. He installed a carding machine to produce woolen yarn and looms for weaving that wool into fabrics called kersey and <b>Satinet.</b> Needing more power than the river itself could provide, Look installed a dam to raise the pond’s water level. His mill produced Satinet; a waterproof fabric used in whaling and sea-going outerwear. Thomas Bradley bought the property in 1845 and erected a new textile mill which prospered until the 1860s, largely due to the popularity of Satinet’s use in waterproofing Civil War military uniforms. That mill building, now headquarters for the Martha's Vineyard Garden Club, still stands today.|$|E

5000|$|Seth Reed's 1777 {{gristmill}} at Uxbridge Center {{served in}} the 1880s as a gun factory known as [...] "Bay State Arms". John Capron's first ever power looms for woolens made the first cashmere <b>satinets</b> in America beginning in 1820. Ironstone village, in south Uxbridge, had Benjamin Taft's 1734 forge which let Caleb Handy make tools, scythes and guns. William Arnold's 1815 mill Ironstone mill housing remains there today. The village of Hecla had American Woolen, Daniel Day's 1810 woolen mill, and Hilena Lowell's shoe factory. At Wheelockville, the Waucantuck Mill manufactured the first [...] "wash and wear" [...] fabrics. Calumet's (Central Woolen) ran 24/7 making Civil War cloth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Satinet</b> is {{a finely}} woven fabric with a finish {{resembling}} satin, but made partly or wholly from cotton or synthetic fiber. The process developed in Mesopotamia around 5000BC. The fibers may be natural (as with cotton, woolens or cashmere wool) or synthetic.|$|E
50|$|In 1825, {{the stone}} <b>Satinet</b> Mill was erected. It was partly {{occupied}} by the first calico printing business in Fall River, set up by Andrew Robeson. The south half was occupied by John and Jesse Eddy for the manufacture of satinets. It was made 3-5 story building made of Fall River granite. It was demolished in 1846 for construction of the new Pocasset Mill #1.|$|E
5000|$|In 1847, the Pocasset Mill #1 {{commenced}} running. Built on {{the site}} of the <b>Satinet</b> Mill, it was a five story stone building that was 208 ft long and 75 feet wide. It was the first of the so-called [...] "wide" [...] mills and contained 20,352 spindles and 422 looms. The machinery was run by three turbine wheels, which were later supplemented by a Corliss engine fed by a steam plant with eighteen condensers. The building had its own fire apparatus including pumps and sprinklers. The Pocasset Mill made sheetings and shirtings.|$|E
5000|$|John Sr., Effingham and John W. Capron's mill pioneered US <b>satinets</b> and woolen power looms. Charles A. Root, Edward Bachman, and Harold Walter {{expanded}} Bachman-Uxbridge, {{and exhibited}} leadership in women's fashion. The company manufactured US Army uniforms for the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the nurse corps, {{and the first}} Air Force dress uniforms, dubbed [...] "Uxbridge Blue". Time magazine covered Uxbridge Worsted's proposed a buyout to be the top US woolen company. The largest plant {{of one of the}} largest US yarn companies, Bernat Yarn, was located here from the 1960s to the 1980s. A historic company called Information Services operated from Uxbridge, and managed subscription services for The New Republic, among other publications, in the later 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|Benjamin Taft {{started the}} first iron forge in the Ironstone section of Uxbridge in 1734 There was good quality [...] "bog iron ore" [...] here. Caleb Handy added a triphammer, and scythes and guns were {{manufactured}} here before 1800. The Taft family {{continued to be}} instrumental in the early industrialization of the Blackstone Valley including mills built by a 4th generation descendent of Robert Taft I, the son of Deborah Taft, Daniel Day in 1810, and his son in law, Luke Taft (1825) and Luke's son, Moses Taft in (1852). These woolen mills, {{some of the first}} to use power looms, and <b>satinets,</b> ran 24/7 during the Civil War producing cloth for U.S. military uniforms. The 1814 Rivulet Mill Complex was established at North Uxbridge by Chandler Taft. In 1855, 2.5 Million yards of cloth was produced in the mills of Uxbridge. Uxbridge is the center of the Blackstone Valley, the earliest industrialized region in the United States. It is part of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. Samuel Slater, who built his mill in (1790), at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, on the Blackstone River, was credited by President Andrew Jackson as the father of America's industrial revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The American Taft {{family first}} settled in what later became Uxbridge in the 17th Century. [...] A descendant, Luke Taft {{became one of}} the {{earliest}} industrial pioneers here.) Luke Taft was the son in law of Daniel Day, and married his daughter Nancy. In 1809, Daniel Day had started the first woolen mill in Uxbridge and the Blackstone River Valley, one of the first woolen mills in the US(third), a little bit downstream. The Wheelocks, (descended from the Rev. Ralph Wheelock, the pioneer of American public education), also settled in Uxbridge, in the 18th Century. Lt. Simeon Wheelock, a Revolutionary War soldier, fought and died in Shays' Rebellion. His son Jerry, {{became one of the}} earliest textile pioneers in Uxbridge, and worked with Luke Taft. Luke and Nancy (Day) Taft had a son, Moses, who born in January 1812. Jerry Wheelock's daughter, Sylvia A Wheelock, then married Moses Taft in 1834. Luke Taft established a mill at the site in 1833, and Moses Taft, (Luke's son and Daniel Day's grandson) established what later became the larger Stanley Mill in 1852. Uxbridge was an early industrial center that played key roles in the early textile industry in America, pioneering <b>satinets,</b> cashmeres, blended fabrics, and power looms for woolens. Stanley Woolen Mill later would become a legacy of both the Taft and Wheelock families, continuing woolen and textile innovations of Uxbridge, begun by Jerry, Luke and their contemporaries. Stanley Woolen Mill became the first mill to offer complete vertical integration from raw materials to clothing. Stanley Woolen Mill, was a continuously operating family business, from 1833 at the present site, and from 1809, with its connections to Daniel Day.|$|R
5000|$|In 1711, Stephen Gates {{was granted}} 14 {{acres of land}} which lies within the state park limits. Gates {{constructed}} a gristmill and sawmill at the natural falls along the Pachaug River. In 1818, Elizah Abel purchased the mill privilege and built a woolen mill at the site. Later, John Slater purchased the three mills and constructed a <b>satinet</b> mill and named it [...] "Hope Mill". The village of Hopeville derived {{its name from the}} mill and would also carry it through to the Hopeville Pond and the Hopeville Pond State Park name. The natural falls of the mill sites are no longer visible as they are now underwater.|$|E
50|$|The Blackstone Valley {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to the American Industrial Revolution. Large scale industrial development began at Uxbridge as early as 1775. Richard Mowry, an Uxbridge farmer, built and marketed equipment to manufacture woolen, linen or cotton cloth, {{around the time of the}} Revolution. Uxbridge, an early mill town, had industries, gristmills, sawmills, forges, distilleries, and more than 20 local textile mills. In 1855, 560 local workers made 2.5 million yards of cloth. Entrepreneurs here innovated the first power looms for woolens, <b>satinet,</b> wool-nylon serge, and other wool synthetic blends, 'wash and wear' fabrics, and latch hook yarn kits. Local factories further refined manufacturing processes and efficiencies which kept textiles alive and thriving, well beyond the great depression period.|$|E
50|$|Saw mills, grist {{mills and}} a forge were {{established}} {{on the banks}} of the Wynants kill at an early date, increasing in numbers as the demand warranted it. In 1800 a forge and saw mill were built by Thomas Thompson. Twenty-five years afterward Calvin Thompson built a mill, which was first run by Coleman & Heminway as a <b>satinet</b> mill. In the building hosiery was subsequently manufactured. About 1822 Ephraim Whittaker built a tannery {{on the banks of}} the creek. In 1862 James Aken built a hosiery mill on its site. For many years afterward it was operated successively by Jephtha Kidder, Kidder & McCreedy, Kidder & North, Nelson P. Aken and Nicholas P. Kane. Early in the century a cotton mill was run by Aretus Lyman. Conrad Aibridge also operated a similar establishment. Arnold & Robinson, then Isaac McConihe succeeded to the business. As early as 1819 Albertson's oil cloth dressing factory was in operation, which was abandoned many years ago. Two or three other concerns making cloth goods or knit goods were in operation in the town during the first half of the present century. Andrew J. Smart's paper mill was erected about 1847 or 1848 by Staats D. Tompkins, who sold it about 1865 to Eugene Merwin and John W. Merwin. Ten years later it became the property of Mr. Smart. John Van Heusen built a <b>satinet</b> mill about 1832 on the site of the old Knowlson mill. The building was burned in 1874, but rebuilt at once by Andrew B. Knowlson. Fonda & Sipperly had an early saw mill at Averill Park, and at the same point George Cipperley had a cloth dressing establishment soon after. In 1865 a hosiery mill was established on the same water privilege by John H. Akin and John Mc-Laren.|$|E
5000|$|The Waucantuck Mill Complex was a mill {{complex in}} Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Despite its 2010 demolition, (except for a {{historic}} storage building) {{it is still}} listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original Luke Taft Mill, built in 1824, on the West River {{was very close to}} the present site of the Waucatuck Mill complex. The Waucantuck complex was planned for a condominium and retail complex, underway in 2009. Both are very close to and virtually part of the Wheelockville District, where the Stanley Woolen Mill was built in 1852. Wash and wear fabrics were first developed at this mill in the 20th century. Products were produced under the name of [...] "Indian Head". In the 1960s the former holdings of American Woolen Company were eventually acquired by a company by that name in Uxbridge, MA. Originally the Uxbridge Worsted Company had proposed a buyout of American Woolen to become America's largest woolen conglomerate. The Town of Uxbridge was synonymous with the textile industry and its earliest and later developments. [...] The [...] "Waucantuck Mill Complex" [...] structure was razed in 2010 because of contaminated industrial wastes, and the main complex is gone, {{with the exception of one}} or more storage buildings, though the site remains. A historic marker is planned. The site is the geographic center of the John H. Chaffee Blackstone River Valley National Historic Corridor, a region of national significance to the earliest industrialization of the United States. The Luke Taft Mill, and its successors were important footnotes in the early textile industry of the US. Innovations here included power looms, <b>satinets,</b> mixed textile blends, and wash and wear fabrics.|$|R
5000|$|John Willard Capron {{helped his}} father John, Sr. {{and his brother}} Effingham, to {{establish}} {{one of the earliest}} textile mills in the historic mill town of Uxbridge. The Carpon Mill was started by John, John W. and Effingham's father, circa 1820. The three Capron men later entered into a partnership for the business. The mill became known as the Capron Mill. John Capron, Sr., John W. Capron's father, sited the mill on the Mumford River, in the town center, also known as Uxbridge center. The mill used water power from the river, a renewable source of power. John Capron had purchased the Colonel Seth Read estate, and water mill on the Mumford River when he first came to Uxbridge around 1790. Colonel John Capron, John Sr.'s son, was a prominent citizen in this community. The community is known for some of the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial Revolution. It is part of the historic Blackstone River Valley and National Heritage Corridor of the National Park Service. The mill was the first mill to use power looms for the woolen industry. The first power looms for woolens were introduced at the Capron Mills. These were made in a machine shop at Cumberland, Rhode Island. These were reportedly the first power looms ever made for woolens. [...] The first manufacture of [...] "satinet" [...] was at this mill. Uxbridge became famous for its Cashmere wool. The town of Uxbridge was a business incubator for the cashmere wool industry, <b>satinets,</b> and power looms in the textile industry of America. Effingham Capron, John Capron Sr. and Colonel John W. Capron were pioneers in textile manufacturing in America. John Willard Capron also served multiple roles in the community. He was Postmaster, Chairman of the Board of Selectmen, Notary, and served in the state legislature. Effingham Capron also became a noted anti-slavery champion, and rose to national prominence in the anti-slavery movement.|$|R
5000|$|In 1821, Colonel Francis McLean {{built the}} first textile mill {{in what is now}} Rockville in {{partnership}} with George and Allyn Kellogg and Ralph Talcott, next to a spot known as [...] "the Rock" [...] with capital of $16,000. Francis McLean had partnered previously with some others in the Warburton Mill in Talcottville. [...] "The Rock" [...] was a natural dam of solid stone that made a high falls on the Hockanum River. In what is now the center of Rockville, he dammed up the Hockanum River and built a water powered mill known as the [...] "Rock Mill", which was possibly also known as the McLean Woolen Factory. By 1823 his mill was in full operation. The new mill was 80 by 30 feet, and its product was blue and blue-mix <b>satinet.</b> In 1826 power looms were introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Stanley Woolen Mill {{is located}} {{in the center of the}} Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor at Uxbridge, a {{heritage}} corridor of national significance for America's earliest industrialization. The main factory building represents the last of a line of wooden textile mills built for mechanized manufacturing in Massachusetts and in the US. [...] This mill helped to pioneer <b>satinet,</b> cashmeres, and utilized power looms, (first developed for woolens in the U.S. by John Capron from Uxbridge). [...] Stanley Woolen had a long history of manufacturing military uniforms from the time of the American Civil War through the World Wars and including for the allied armies of Europe in World War I. [...] "Beginning as Stanley Woolen Mills, the firm survived two depressions, weathering the changing times and the changing demands in the world of textiles. Over the years, the Stanley Woolen Company mills sold to such manufacturers as Evan Picone, Perry Ellis, Brooks Brothers and Hager". It is reported that Stanley Woolen Mill was the first US mill to completely manufacture woolen garments, mainly men's wear for the domestic market. Another tradition of this mill's long history was the blending of wool and cottons as fabrics in the manufacture of clothing.|$|E
