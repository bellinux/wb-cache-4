5|$|In Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder, {{the player}} assumes {{the roles of}} the main protagonist Chihaya Kisakinomiya and the {{secondary}} character Kaoruko Nanahara. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In the adult versions of Futari no Elder, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Chihaya and a given heroine having sex. The gameplay is somewhat altered in the PSP version. The PSP version has the sexual content removed, the <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> Utano Sasou and Kaori Kamichika that appeared in the Windows version are removed, and it contains newly added <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> You Kashiwagi and Hatsune Minase. There are three additional sub episodes in the Windows version of Futari no Elder.|$|E

This uses the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to test different <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> selection. Other methods rely on an a priori specification of where shifts in selection have occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. Thick as a Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original Thick as a Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E

5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E
5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{tries to}} {{articulate}} the main sociological "overviews" about globalization, according to the litterature, from Beck to Negri and form Giddens to Inglehart or Huntington. The main thesis is that three scenarios, by and large, coexist in the literature : 1) in <b>scenario</b> <b>of</b> "Empire" with the domination of an "immanent" power over all actors (but not alike); 2) the huntingtonian <b>scenario</b> <b>of</b> the "clash of civilizations" and 3) a more marginal but not implausible <b>scenario</b> <b>of</b> "clash of classes" at a global level. None <b>of</b> this <b>scenario</b> is impossible and none is certain. The text try to assess the plausibility {{of each of the}} three...|$|R
5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War was {{originally}} announced by The Creative Assembly on 3 August 2001, with the working title of Crusader: Total War. Development {{of the game}} started shortly {{after the release of}} Shogun: Total War. Early in development it was decided to change the name to Medieval: Total War; this was to have a name that better reflected the scope of the game. In a press release, The Creative Assembly announced that the game would be published by Activision instead of Electronic Arts, the publisher of the previous games. The Creative Assembly also outlined the features of the game, including the game covering the medieval era from the 11th to 15th century, with players being able to participate in various historical <b>scenarios</b> <b>of</b> the time, such as the Hundred Years' War. Media releases over the subsequent months gave screenshots of the game, with more information on Medieval: Total War's features. The game uses an updated version of the game engine used in , allowing larger battles than previously possible with an increased troop limit of ten thousand. The improved game engine also allowed more battle maps than previously possible, now based upon where the conflicting armies are located on the strategy map. Other new battlefield enhancements included terrain detailed with villages and vegetation and improved castle siege mechanics, with players now having to focus on destroying the walls before assaulting and capturing the castle. The game features improved artificial intelligence from Shogun: Total War, with the individual unit AI and the tactical AI—which controls the overall army tactics—separated to more effectively control the opposing forces.|$|E

Concepts of organizational justice later expanded upon the fundamentals of Equity Theory and pointed to the importance of fairness perceptions in the workplace.|$|E
