5|$|Three years later, Garcian {{arrives at}} Battleship Island in Japan {{to destroy the}} last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who {{presents}} Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to mount {{an assault on the}} US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan's role in rigging American elections—US forces destroy Japan's last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle.|$|E

25|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} explain why the <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> seen so differently by people. The explanations range from scientific theories about human vision to curious supposition about Mona Lisas identity and feelings.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people from}} Southeast Asia (particularly Vietnam and the Philippines) and Southwest Asia (and Iran) also entered Japan during this time, making foreigners {{as a group}} a more visible {{minority}} in Japan. Those foreigners are called 来日 Rainichi ("coming to Japan") in contrast to 在日 Zainichi ("in Japan"). The TBS television series <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> about Bito Hayakawa who was born to a Japanese mother and Filipino father, and struggled to overcome the difficulties faced as a mixed race child.|$|E
25|$|Maike Vogt-Lüerssen {{argues that}} {{the woman behind the}} famous <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> Isabella of Aragon, the Duchess of Milan. Leonardo was the court painter for the Duke of Milan for 11 years. The pattern on Mona Lisa's dark green dress, art critic Maike Vogt-Lüerssen believes, {{indicates}} that {{she was a member of}} the house of Sforza. Her theory is that the Mona Lisa was the first official portrait of the new Duchess of Milan, which requires that it was painted in spring or summer 1489 (and not 1503).|$|E

25|$|Artemis is {{described}} as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair. He is said to resemble his father. As of his adventures in The Lost Colony, Artemis has exchanged one eye with Holly Short {{as a result of}} a botched re-materialization and now possesses one blue eye and one hazel eye, and a time travel in The Time Paradox aged him to his chronological age of 18 but then back again upon his return to his own time. A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand. His <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands. Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit. He often wears Armani suits. It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in The Time Paradox. As of , Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal's attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race. He now possesses two blue eyes and all fingers are back in their original place. It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes on one foot.|$|E
500|$|Priore reflected: [...] "Actually, the [...] reason {{most people}} didn't care for Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> {{that it came}} out in place of Smile." [...] Richie Unterberger concurred, rating the album four out of five stars, and {{suggesting}} that media-hype of the collapsed Smile project was to blame for Smiley Smiles lackluster reception in the United States. He called it a [...] "rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that's plenty weird". In a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: [...] "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." [...] In 2001, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote [...] "Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of Smiles existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic... and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that Sgt. Pepper had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements still {{bring out the best in}} every single track." ...|$|E
500|$|Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> the 12th studio album by American {{rock band}} the Beach Boys, {{released}} on September 18, 1967. The album reached number 9 on UK record charts, but sold poorly in the US, peaking at number 41—the band's lowest chart placement to that point. Critics and fans generally received the album with confusion and disappointment. Only one single was issued from Smiley Smile: [...] "Heroes and Villains". [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] and [...] "Gettin' Hungry" [...] were also released, but the former was issued a year earlier, {{while the latter}} was not credited to the band.|$|E

Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train and have a long lifespan in captivity. Hundreds of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. The dolphin [...] "smile" [...] makes them popular attractions, as this is a welcoming facial expression in humans; however the <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> {{due to a lack of}} facial muscles and subsequent lack of facial expressions.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} about {{psychedelic}} music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile {{as a work}} of the [...] "ultimate psychedelic rock library". Conversely, Stylus Magazines Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album [...] "embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album [...] "can {{be thought of as a}} kind of protomiminal rock music". He continues: ...|$|E
500|$|On the Way to a <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> {{a series}} of short stories that take place between the time of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

[...] "Case of Denzel" [...] is told indirectly {{from the perspective of}} Denzel, who has requested an interview with Reeve Tuesti in the hopes that he may become part of Reeve's newly formed World Regenesis Organization, an army devoted to rebuilding the planet. Denzel tells his life story, including how he became an orphan, the events leading up to his becoming afflicted with Geostigma, and how he came under the care of Tifa and Cloud.

500|$|Usher {{has been}} {{regarded}} as [...] "An international sex symbol" [...] from a young age, predominantly for his stage persona. Fusion states [...] "Usher—one of the greatest R sex symbols in the past 20 years, {{paving the way for}} Chris Brown, Trey Songz and Justin Bieber—used sex as a major part of his image", while VH1 considers him to be [...] "the sexiest male performer ever to walk a stage". People magazine named Usher the [...] "Sexiest R Star" [...] in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in [...] "his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics." [...] Actress Adrienne Frantz who played with Usher in The Bold and the Beautiful also said [...] "Usher definitely has a way with women. His <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> sweet and sexy at the same time", and added [...] "he's a great kisser." [...] He was included on it's [...] "Sexiest Men Alive" [...] list in 2004, as he was 4 years later again in 2008. Usher was ranked number-one on BET’s [...] "All Shades of Fine: 25 Hottest Men of the Past 25 Years" [...] in 2005. Madame Tussauds New York also unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience.

2500|$|Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University {{has argued}} that the <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> mostly drawn in low spatial frequencies, and so can best be seen from a {{distance}} or with one's peripheral vision. [...] Thus, for example, the smile appears more striking when looking at the portrait's eyes than when looking at the mouth itself. [...] Christopher Tyler and Leonid Kontsevich of the Smith-Kettlewell Institute in San Francisco believe that the changing nature of the <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> caused by variable levels of random noise in the human visual system. Dina Goldin, Adjunct Professor at Brown University, {{has argued that}} the secret is in the dynamic position of Mona Lisa's facial muscles, where our mind's eye unconsciously extends her smile; the result is an unusual dynamicity to the face that invokes subtle yet strong emotions in the viewer of the painting.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the season}} began, several press reports noted that, with five veteran players {{returning}} from the 1910 championship team, head coach Fielding H. Yost was optimistic.

[...] The famous 'Hurry Up,' in all his years of coaching experience, has never been so optimistic over Michigan's chances for a victorious season as he is this year -- at least, not since 1905." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Year {{traditions are}} {{also a part of}} Japanese poetry, {{including}} haiku (poems with 17 syllables, in three lines of five, seven and five) and renga (linked poetry). All of the traditions above would be appropriate to include in haiku as kigo (season words). There are also haiku that celebrate many of the [...] "first" [...] of the New Year, such as the [...] "first sun" [...] (hatsuhi) or [...] "first sunrise", [...] "first laughter" [...] (waraizome—starting the New Year with a <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> considered a good sign), and first dream (hatsuyume). Since the traditional New Year was later in the year than the current date, many of these mention the beginning of spring.|$|E
