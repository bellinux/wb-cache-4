The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today.

40|$|A {{long term}} {{study of the}} {{variation}} in d 12 C of bulk leaf material was undertaken under 3 light regimes (3 %, 12 % and 100 % sunlight) using 2 different species displaying contrasting shoot phenologies: Betula pendula Roth. an early successional species with a rapid leaf turnover (“successive” phenology) and Fagus sylvatica L. a late successional species with a <b>single</b> <b>flush</b> of long-lived leaves (“flush” phenology). It was hypothesised that there would be greater seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of the leaves of B. pendula, within a single leaf cohort (due to rapid leaf turnover of that species) and that the different light regimes and shade tolerances of the two species would further extend variation. Physiological and phenological parameters, alongside bulk leaf d 13 C, were measured over the first growth season (2002) on 4 leaf cohorts in the B. pendula and the <b>single</b> <b>flush</b> of the F. sylvatica. The d 13 C of the initial leaf was consistently more enriched in the heavier isotope than bud material.  Further changes were observed both within (up to 2 ‰) and between (up to 4 ‰) leaf cohorts in both species as well as substantial shifts between light regime (up to 6 ‰). During the following growth season, measurements were focused at 2 time points: early season and mild season to attempt to explain the variation within leaf cohort and in the change in isotopic signal between the bud and initial leaf. Alongside the continuation of measurements from the previous season, the d 13 C of the soluble carbohydrates and starch fractions were measured, as well as the d 18 O of leaf organic material to follow the mobile carbon fractions as the organic signal changed and to partition the d 13 C signal into stomatal and biochemical influences. Carbohydrate d 13 C values showed that the within cohort variation could be explained by fractionation processes during phloem unloading and, later in the season, the progressive incorporation of new carbohydrate with a more negative delta.

Sheep were sacrificed and the sinus mucosa harvested 1 or 8 days after treatment to assess treatment and any biofilm regrowth. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to confirm the presence or absence of biofilms, and the extent of biofilm reduction was quantitated using fluorescent in situ hybridization and colony forming unit counts. In the control sheep biofilm coverage averaged 31. 7 %. Saline and mupirocin b. d. washes for 5 days had 23 % and 0. 84 % coverage, respectively, when harvested on day 8. A single mupirocin and gallium wash had 7. 7 % and 16. 2 % on day 1 and 5. 88 % and 16. 0 % on day 8. CAZS with hydrodebrider had 6. 66 % on day 1 but 21. 95 % on day 8 whereas CAZS with hydodebrider and gallium had 13. 3 % on day 8.

40|$|The {{timing of}} fine root {{production}} and turnover strongly influences both the seasonal potential for soil resource acquisition among competing root {{systems and the}} plant fluxes of root carbon into soil pools. However, basic patterns and variability in the rates and timing or fine root production and turnover are generally unknown among perennial plants species. We address this shortfall using a heuristic model relating root phenology to turnover together with three years of minirhizotron observations of root dynamics in 12 temperate tree species grown in a common garden. We specifically investigated how the amount and the timing of root production differ among species and how they impact estimates of fine root turnover. Across the 12 species, there was wide variation in the timing of root production with some species producing a <b>single</b> root <b>flush</b> in early summer and others producing roots either more uniformly over the growing season or in multiple pulses. Additionally, the pattern and timing of root production appeared to be consistent across years for some species but varied in others. Root turnover rate was related to total root production (P < 0. 001) as species with greater root production typically had faster root turnover rates. We also found that, within species, annual root production varied up to a threefold increase between years, which led to large interannual differences in turnover rate. Results from the heuristic model indicated that shifting the pattern or timing of root production can impact estimates of root turnover rates for root populations with life spans {{less than one year}} while estimates of root turnover rate for longer lived roots were unaffected by changes in root phenology. Overall, we suggest that more detailed observations of root phenology and production will improve fidelity of root turnover estimates. Future efforts should link patterns of root phenology and production with whole-plant life history traits and variation in annual and seasonal climate...|$|R
