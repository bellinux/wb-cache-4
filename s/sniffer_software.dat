40|$|Abstract- One of {{the main}} {{problems}} which are considered in this paper is Bluesnarfing which is a high jacking process that will take control over another Bluetooth device without permission. In this case the attacker is capable to tabulate and recognizes the victim's data such as phone book, calendar, messages and other features as well. This paper resembles an analysis process on the Bluetooth protocol stack and an implementation on a security threat. A data analysis process to test and know how the live data were transferred on the protocol stack is captured. This analysis for the usage and roles of the layer such as HCI, RFCOMM, and L 2 CAP on the data captured. A sniffing process will be done to monitor and <b>sniffer</b> <b>software</b> sniff the data transfer between two Bluetooth devices. The sniffing is done {{to analyze the data}} transferred and its properties. In thi...|$|E
40|$|A {{packet sniffer}} is a wiretap device that plugs into {{computer}} networks; unlike telephone circuits, computer networks are shared communication channels. Sharing means that computers can receive {{information that was}} intended for other machines (HUB). NetCap {{is a type of}} packet <b>sniffer</b> <b>software</b> that captures the network data as well as provides sufficient means for decision making process of administrator. This paper illustrates NetCap and its benefits over existing packet sniffers. NetCap is developed in Java totally as well as it consumes very less memory on the hard disk. It encompasses many functionalities like 3 D pie chart statistics, possible malicious IP address detection, TCP flow graph, various coloring rules and filters that may be applied to the captured tabulated network data. It can be used for offline capture also for reading “pcap ” file format. NetCap is developed in Java so it inherently contains the platform independence, but some functionalities may be applied in Windows only. The software contains a rich and easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well as a help file to guide the novice user and help the expert user to exploit its functionalities full...|$|E

Whatever {{the data is}} capturing that will be decoded. the decoding or capturing the data {{can be done by}} using network interfacing controller in promiscuous mode. It also discusses ways to detect the presence of such software on the network and to handle them in an efficient way. Packet sniffer can able to capture the data of entire network that either wired network or wireless network. This paper presents practical results of capturing the data packet by setting the NIC card and results are verified...|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} use of the Internet in {{the workplace}} is {{making it easier for}} workers to steal time and engage in counter productive work behavior. Stealing from the workplace can be through the unauthorized use of a work computer or network. The aforementioned type of theft is known as time and resource theft. As social media and gaming sites become more popular, time and resources theft does as well. Companies may use sniffers to monitor their network. Sniffers monitor network traffic, evaluate network capacity, and can be used to reveal evidence of improper use. Some companies go further than <b>sniffers</b> and use <b>software</b> which allows companies to block and monitor websites that they deem undesirable.|$|R
40|$|Network Monitor with Packet <b>Sniffer</b> is <b>software</b> for {{operating}} network monitor application. It {{has been designed}} for use in any computer in a simple approach. This software interacts easily with user as only buttons are the way of interaction. Network Monitor with Packet Sniffer is a real-time way to manage the network-communication via monitoring, capturing and sniffing {{in order to fulfill}} the project purpose. The result will be packet monitoring traffic, and packet information that can be analyzed in the future. So, it is very convenient to user especially for networking students. This thesis consists of 6 chapters. Chapter 1 will discUss about the Introduction to the System. These first chapters briefly explain about the objective of the system, problem statement and project scopes. Chapter 2 and 3 are about the Literature Review and Methodology of the project. Chapter 2 and 3 will discuss about the methods that will be used, elaborating the sources from the research, and deciding the best tools that will be used to build the system. Chapter 4, Implementation; are about the documentation of the processes during the development of the system, including any modification that been plan and made. While the last, Chapter 5 Result and Discussion and Chapter 6 Conclusion. Chapter 5 will explain about the result that has collected from the analysis and tests of the system along with the constraints and suggestion to enhance the system performance.

40|$|From {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of computers,hubs to switched networks,network administrators need more sophisticated network traffic monitoring tools {{in order to deal}} with the increase. These network monitoring tools are needed in order to perform their work,to obtain the data transiting on a network and capturing it while the network is working. The capture process consists of listening on the network,every transiting frame,independently from its source or destination. However,most of the network traffic monitoring sniffer display data packets that are captured in a less-readable format which are difficult to be analyzed by newbie network administrators or students that are learning to analyze network traffic flow. Moreover,most of the sniffers only use command-line to run. Thus,NetCap is developed to display a more readable and detailed data packets information that are captured and to display a more user-friendly graphical interface. The information about sniffer is searched to analyze the functions of sniffer and research methodology is done to plan,design and implement the <b>sniffer.</b> <b>Software</b> capture architecture for the Microsoft's Win 32 operating system family is analyzed. This architecture includes a low-level framework,winpcap that adds to Win 32 operating systems the ability to efficiently capture data from the most used network families. Based on that,NetCap is design and implemented using Netbeans 6. 9. 1. Furthermore, it also uses JCommon 1. 0. 16 and JFreeChart L 0. 13,library for Java platform to support and develop a real-time packets flow graph in NetCap. This paper uses jpcap,a Java library for capturing packets which is used to develop applications to capture packets from network interfaces plus analyze them in Java,and winpcap,a windows version of libpcap library which includes driver to support capturing packets on windows to design NetCap which is compatible to be used in windows platform...|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceBotnets are {{collections}} of compromised computers which {{have come under}} the control of a malicious person or organisation via malicious software stored on the computers, and which can then be used to interfere with, misuse, or deny access {{to a wide range of}} Internet-based services. With the current trend towards increasing use of the Internet to support activities related to banking, commerce, healthcare and public administration, it is vital to be able to detect and neutralise botnets, so that these activities can continue unhindered. In this paper we present an overview of existing botnet detection techniques and argue why a new, composite detection approach is needed to provide efficient and effective neutralisation of botnets. This approach should combine existing detection efforts into a collaborative botnet protection framework that receives input from a range of different sources, such as packet <b>sniffers,</b> on-access anti-virus <b>software</b> and behavioural analysis of network traffic, computer sub-systems and application programs. Finally, we introduce ContraBot, a collaborative botnet detection framework which combines approaches that analyse network traffic to identify patterns of botnet activity with approaches that analyse software to detect items which are capable of behaving maliciously...|$|R
