40|$|Vitamin C is {{essential}} for primates, guinea pigs and fish. Vitamin C, {{in the form of}} ascorbic acid and its calcium and <b>sodium</b> salts, ascorbyl <b>palmitate,</b> <b>sodium</b> calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is safe for all animal species. Setting a maximum content in feed and water for drinking is not considered necessary. Data on the vitamin C consumption of consumers are based on the levels of vitamin C in foodstuffs, including food of animal origin, produced in accordance with current EU legislation on the supplementation of feed with vitamin C. The exposure is far below the guidance level. Any potential contribution of the use of vitamin C in feed is therefore already considered in the above data. Consequently, the use of vitamin C in animal nutrition is not of concern for consumer safety. In the absence of inhalation toxicity studies it would be prudent to assume that inhalation of dust from the additives presents a health hazard to workers. Sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is unlikely to be a skin sensitiser. This conclusion is extrapolated to sodium ascorbyl phosphate. In the absence of data, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and ascorbyl palmitate should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes and as dermal sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with vitamin C does not pose a risk to the environment. Ascorbic acid, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate are regarded as effective sources of vitamin C when added to feed or water for drinking. Since ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate and ascorbyl palmitate are authorised for use as antioxidants in food and their function in feed {{is essential}}ly the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary...|$|R

40|$|Oral PresentationBackground/Aims: The {{prevalence}} of {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) is high in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH is a progressive hallmark of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Chronic intermittent hypoxia is associated with recurrent episodes of oxygen desaturation and reoxygenation in OSA patients, leading to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The causal link between OSA and NAFLD is not known and the mechanistic effect of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that IH-induced oxidative stress aggravates lipid accumulation and inflammation induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> in HepG 2 cells. Materials and Methods: HepG 2 cells were treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> or vehicle under normoxia (Nx) or IH condition for 72 hours in the present or absence of a ROS scavenger MnTBAP. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay and intracellular lipid deposit was examined by oil red staining. Lipid peroxidation was measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) assay and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by CM-H 2 DCFDA staining. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 6), fatty acid uptake-associated genes (caveolin- 1 and FATP 5), fatty acid synthesis genes (SREBP 1 and ACC 1) and fatty acid β-oxidation gene ACOX were determined by real-time PCR. Results: Results showed that <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> increased lipid deposit in the cells and it also decreased cell viability. The effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> was more prominent in the group co-treated with hypoxia. Levels of MDA and ROS and the expressions of IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 6 and caveolin- 1, but not FATP 5, were significantly increased in the palmitate- or hypoxia-treated group and were remarkably elevated in the co-treated group. These effects were abolished by MnTBAP treatment. In addition, levels of the expression of ACOX, SREBP 1 and ACC 1 were significantly lowered in the cells treated with palmitate or hypoxia and the expressions were much less in the cotreated group. Treatment of MnTBAP prevented the decreased expression of ACOX but {{had no effect on}} the SREBP 1 and ACC 1 expression. Conclusion: IH-induced oxidative stress exacerbates lipid accumulation and inflammation induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> in HepG 2 cells, probably mediated by an increase in lipid uptake and a decrease in the fatty acid β-oxidation. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{desirable}} properties of organic-based fatty acid PCMs, they have the major drawback of low thermal conductivity that reduces {{the rate of heat}} storage and extraction during the melting and solidification cycles. Their thermal conductivity was increased up to 10  % by using an organic fatty acid surfactant such as 5  % sodium myristate, 5  % <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate,</b> or 5  % sodium stearate (Fauzi et al. 2013). Some inorganic materials have high thermal conductivity e.g., graphite and carbon nanomaterials on addition of treated graphite to the PCM increases their thermal properties and thermal conductivity (Ince et al. 2015; Sari et al. 2008; Sari and Karaipekli 2009; Zhang et al. 2013, 2014 a, b, c, 2015; Fang et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2014 a). Exfoliated graphite (xG) fabricated by exfoliation natural graphite has superior properties mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties (Fukushima et al. 2006). Paraffin/exfoliated graphite (XGnP) is used to enhance the thermal conductivity, latent heat, and heat conductivity of composite PCMs (Kim and Drzal 2009). PCMs with low temperature can be used for cold storage applications like transport temperature-sensitive foods, medical applications, refrigeration and biotechnology industries.|$|E
40|$|The obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{syndrome}} is characterized by recurrent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep leading to intermittent hypoxia (IH). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) {{is the most common}} chronic fatty liver disease, which ranges from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis. The prevalence of OSA is high in patients with NAFLD. Emerging evidence suggests that OSA may be involved in the progression of NAFLD. However, the mechanistic effect of IH on the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains elusive. It was hypothesized that IH could aggravate oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis induced by high fat diet (HFD) at an initial stage of pathogenesis of NAFLD in the rat liver. After HFD and IH treatment, remarkably elevated levels of liver injury (ALT, AST and histological study), inflammatory mediators (IL- 6, TNF-α and IL- 1 β), oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy were observed in the co-treatment group than other groups. Besides, NADPH oxidase (NOX 4) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α) expression levels were aggravated by IH in the co-treatment group, suggesting a significant effect of IH on aggravating the early pathogenesis of NAFLD. Up to date, the underlying mechanism of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the pathogenesis of NAFLD aggravated by IH is still unknown. We hypothesized that IH aggravates inflammation and apoptosis induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> (SP) in HepG 2 cells via oxidative stress. MnTBAP chloride is a cell permeable superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic and ROS scavenger. Results showed that the levels of ROS production, oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, inflammation, apoptosis, NOX 4 and HIF- 1 α were aggravated in the IH and SP co-treatment group. These deteriorated effects of IH could be attenuated by the antioxidant MnTBAP, suggesting the IH exacerbates the pathogenesis of NAFLD induced by palmitate via oxidative stress. NOX is an important source of ROS. Apocynin effectively inhibits the activity of NOX. Our results demonstrated apocynin significantly mitigated the deteriorated effects of IH on the lipid accumulation, inflammation and apoptosis induced by palmitate in HepG 2 cells. Moreover, the elevated expression levels of HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α in the co-treated group were also attenuated by apocynin, suggesting a vicious cycle mediated by the HIF/NOX cascade. Thus, NADPH oxidase could worsen the oxidative stress exacerbated by IH which aggravates the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Further, results from knockdown of NOX 4 with siRNA also showed that IH aggravates oxidative stress induced by palmitate via NOX 4. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) could be activated by fatty acids and induce inflammation. Our results showed that TLR 4 knockdown attenuated the inflammation aggravated by IH in the co-treated group, suggesting IH-induced oxidative stress aggravates inflammation induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> in HepG 2 cells via TLR 4. Our studies also showed caveolin 1 knockdown attenuated the lipid accumulation aggravated by IH in the cells treated with palmitate. In conclusion, NADPH oxidase especially NOX 4 could worsen the oxidative stress induced by IH which aggravates the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Caveolin 1 -mediated lipid accumulation, TLR 4 -induced inflammatory response and a vicious cycle mediated by the HIF/NOX cascade might play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. published_or_final_versionBiomedical SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> causes {{apoptosis}} of beta-cells, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 {{has been}} shown to counteract this event. However, the exact mechanisms that underlie palmitate-induced pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and through which pathway Bcl- 2 executes the protective effect are still unclear. Methods. A stable Bcl- 2 -overexpressing RINm 5 F cell clone (BMG) and its negative control (B 45) were exposed to palmitate for up to 8 h, and cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and NF-kappa B activation were studied in time course experiments. Results. Palmitate exposure for 8 h resulted in increased cell death rates, and this event was partially counteracted by Bcl- 2. Bcl- 2 overexpression promoted in parallel also a delayed induction of GADD 153 /CHOP and a weaker phosphorylation of BimEL in palmitate-exposed cells. At earlier time points (2 - 4 h) palmitate exposure resulted in increased generation of ROS, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), and a modest increase in the phosphorylation of eIF 2 alpha and IRE 1 alpha. BMG cells produced similar amounts of ROS and displayed the same eIF 2 alpha and IRE 1 alpha phosphorylation rates as B 45 cells. However, the palmitate-induced dissipation of Delta psi m was partially counteracted by Bcl- 2. In addition, basal NF-kappa B activity was increased in BMG cells. Conclusions. Our results indicate that Bcl- 2 counteracts palmitate-induced beta-cell death by maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and augmenting NF-kappa B activity, but not by affecting ROS production and ER stress...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Diet-derived short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) improve glucose {{homeostasis}} in vivo, but {{the role of}} individual SCFAs and their mechanisms of action have not been defined. This study evaluated the effects of increasing colonic delivery of the SCFA propionate on β-cell function in humans and the direct effects of propionate on isolated human islets in vitro. Materials and Methods: For 24 weeks human subjects ingested an inulin-propionate ester that delivers propionate to the colon. Acute insulin, GLP- 1 and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were quantified pre- and post-supplementation {{in response to a}} mixed meal test. Expression of the SCFA receptor FFAR 2 in human islets was determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Dynamic insulin secretion from perifused human islets was quantified by radioimmunoassay and islet apoptosis was determined by quantification of caspase 3 / 7 activities. Results: Colonic propionate delivery in vivo was associated with improved β-cell function with increased insulin secretion that was independent of changes in GLP- 1 levels. Human islet β-cells expressed FFAR 2 and propionate potentiated dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro, an effect that was dependent on signalling via protein kinase C. Propionate also protected human islets from apoptosis induced by the NEFA <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> and inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: Our results indicate that propionate has beneficial effects on β-cell function in vivo, and in vitro analyses demonstrated that it has direct effects to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin release and maintain β-cell mass through inhibition of apoptosis. These observations support ingestion of propiogenic dietary fibres to maintain healthy glucose homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Himastatin, a cyclohexadepsipeptide antibiotic, had in vivo {{antitumor}} activity against localized P 388 leukemia and B 16 melanoma {{but had no}} distal site antitumor activity. An {{in vitro}} Bacillus subtilis well-agar diffusion assay was employed {{to test the hypothesis}} that himastatin was enzymatically inactivated. The activity of himastatin against B. subtilis was inhibited when himastatin was mixed with mouse liver S 9 fraction and microsomes. However, subsequent investigations demonstrated that the markedly decreased antibacterial activity was not enzymatic in nature but was related to the presence of certain fatty acid salts. Saturated fatty acid sodium salts with a carbon chain number of 8 or more reduced the antimicrobial activity of himastatin 50 to 100 times. If antibiotics such as ampicillin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, and tunicamycin were used in place of himastatin, no meaningful reduction in antibacterial activity occurred. However, the antibacterial activity of the membrane-active peptide antibiotic polymyxin B, but not that of polymyxin E (colistin), was reduced {{in a manner similar to}} that of himastatin. Importantly, the activity of himastatin against HCT- 116 colon adenocarcinoma cells in soft agar was markedly reduced in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> as the reference fatty acid salt. The data indicate that himastatin may be trapped in micelles in vitro.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) on the myocardial cells of mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with hyperuricemia (HUA), and clarify the mechanism thereof. Methods The mouse cardiac myocytes (MCM) cultured with 25 mmol/L high glucose (HG) medium {{were divided into two}} groups: HG plus 300 μmol/L <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> for 18 hours as high glucose and high fat (HG+HF) group, and HG+HF plus 1500 μmol/L uric acid (UA) for 18 hours as HG+HF+HUA group. Then the myocardial cells in HG+HF+HUA group, by use or not use UCP 2 inhibitor genipin, were further divided into two groups: vehicle group and genipin group. In order to verify the mechanism of UCP 2 in myocardial cells injury caused by high glucose, high lipid and high uric acid, the myocardial cells were divided again into genipin group and genipin+N-acetylcysteine (NAC) group. Accordingly, the apoptosis of myocardial cells were measured by flow cytometry at specific time, the mRNA and protein expressions of UCP 2 were determined by q-PCR and Western blotting, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by DHE staining and ELISA. Results The apoptosis rate of myocardial cells increased obviously, and the expression levels of UCP 2 decreased and of ROS elevated significantly in HG+HF+HUA group than in HG+HF group (P< 0. 05). As the expression levels of UCP 2 decreased by genipin intervention, the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells and ROS level in HG+HF+HUA group increased more obviously (P< 0. 05). In contrast, such an effect was reversed by the application of antioxidants NAC (P< 0. 05). Conclusion UCP 2 can inhibit oxidative stress and alleviate the apoptosis of myocardial cells induced by high glucose, high fat and high uric acid.

40|$|The {{temperatures}} and evaporation rates of surfactant-contaminated droplets were determined under controlled conditions. The surfactants used were sodium stearate, <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate,</b> sodium myristate and sodium laurate. The drops were suspended on fine glass fibres or thermocouples in an environmental cell maintained at known temperature and humidity, and the evaporation rate {{was determined by}} optical measurement of the change of diameter with time. The results showed an early evaporation following a "clean" model, with a relatively sharp transition to a regime of "contaminated" evaporation kinetics. Simultaneous measurements of temperature and evaporation rate showed that the contaminants {{had no effect on}} heat transfer, i. e. their effect was limited to forming an additional mass transfer resistance. This mass transfer resistance increased strongly with initial surfactant concentration. Surfactants with longer carbon chains produced higher resistances, but after a longer delay. The partial differential equations describing surfactant diffusion within an evaporating drop were set up and solved, and an approximate analytical solution was shown to agree well with a numerical solution. By assuming that the surfactants retarded evaporation at the drop surface both by presenting a diffusional resistance to water transport and by vapour pressure lowering, a model was constructed to predict the evaporation behaviour of contaminated drops. It predicted the results obtained with sodium stearate well, but was unable to explain the results for shorter chain surfactants which were complicated by their adsorption behaviour at the surfactant-water interface. This model of single drop evaporation was extended to describe the evaporation of contaminated aerosols and used in an attempt to explain the measurements of Raper et al. (1982). Their results could not be explained quantitatively by a surfactant contaminant (though a surfactant would have produced similar qualitative features) and were probably caused by experimental error...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{accumulation}} of free radicals in cells leads to oxidative stress, which plays a causative {{role in the}} induction and progression of various chronic diseases. Therapeutic focus has therefore shifted towards the use of antioxidants, with recent interest in those of plant origin. This study investigated radical scavenging and cytoprotective activities of phytochemicals (quercetin, curcumin, sulforaphane, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, danshensu (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyllactic acid), ferulic acid and m-coumaric acid) against DPPH free radical in a non-cellular assay, and oxidative damage in hepatic (HepG 2) and pancreatic (1. 1 B 4) cells, elicited by an organic hydroperoxide (tert-butylhydroperoxide - tBHP) and a more physiologically relevant stressor (palmitate). Direct and indirect cytoprotective activities were assessed by neutral red viability assay after 5 h co-exposure and 20 h pre-exposure conditions, respectively. Radical scavenging activities of three well-known phytochemicals - quercetin, curcumin and sulforaphane - were initially validated against DPPH (non-cellular assay), where quercetin was shown to be more potent than curcumin; sulforaphane was without effect. With quercetin as positive control, radical scavenging activities of rosmarinic acid and three of its principal metabolites (caffeic acid, danshensu and ferulic acid) were comparable, while m-coumaric acid lacked antiradical activity against DPPH radical. Subsequently in HepG 2 hepatoma cells, quercetin and curcumin were confirmed to possess direct and indirect cytoprotective acitivities against 0. 5 mM tBHP while, sulforaphane only had indirect cytoprotective acitivities. Additionally, co-treatment of HepG 2 cells with low concentrations of quercetin and curcumin (used together) exhibited direct cytoprotective activities against tBHP. However, direct cytoprotective potencies of rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid were less than quercetin. Similar pattern was observed for indirect cytoprotective activities; with danshensu, ferulic acid and m-coumaric acid lacking hepatoprotective activity in co-exposure and pre-exposure conditions. These results highlight the discrepancy between non-cellular and cellular antioxidant activities, which could be accounted to the poor lipophilicity profiles of rosmarinic acid and its principal metabolites. Cytotoxicity assay in 1. 1 B 4 human pancreatic β-cells revealed that these cells were more vulnerable to tBHP-induced oxidative damage than HepG 2 cells. An investigation of selected phytochemicals in 1. 1 B 4 cells produced novel findings, with quercetin exhibiting direct and indirect cytoprotective activities against tBHP (0. 125 mM and 0. 5 mM). Curcumin and caffeic acid were also cytoprotective against 0. 125 mM tBHP but only exhibited direct cytoprotection against 0. 5 mM tBHP. Sulforaphane lacked both direct and indirect cytoprotective activities in 1. 1 B 4 cells, exhibiting marked cytotoxic effects in both conditions. Further analysis in both HepG 2 and 1. 1 B 4 cells proved that indirect cytoprotective activities of selected phytochemicals were not dependent on pro-proliferative activities of quercetin, curcumin, caffeic acid and sulforaphane. Moreover, {{it was observed that}} high concentrations of curcumin and sulforaphane caused necrosis in both cell types, rather than apoptosis; caffeic acid also produced necrotic effect in 1. 1 B 4 cells. Whilst prolonged exposure of HepG 2 and 1. 1 B 4 cells to high glucose concentrations failed to elicit any evidence of glucotoxicity, <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> caused concentration-dependent cytotoxicity after short-term (5 h) and long-term (20 h) exposure to both cell types. Overall, selected phytochemicals caused additive cytotoxicity in the presence of palmitate, although quercetin demonstrated direct cytoprotection alone in HepG 2 cells. Using Western blot, curcumin, caffeic acid and sulforaphane did not upregulate NQO 1, but 20 h exposure to 0. 1 mM quercetin resulted in upregulation in HepG 2 cells, amidst high basal levels of NQO 1 in this cell type. However, both basal and inductive expression of NQO 1 has not been observed in 1. 1 B 4 cells. Thus, although rosmarinic acid, danshensu, caffeic acid and ferulic acid may possess good intrinsic antioxidant properties, their physicochemical properties may limit pharmacological activities at the cellular level. Moreover, the additive cytotoxicity resulting from treatment with selected phytochemicals and <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> highlights a discrepancy between mechanisms of cytotoxicities by tBHP and palmitate...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prolonged {{periods of}} high glucose {{exposure}} results in human islet dysfunction in vitro. The underlying mechanisms behind this effect of high glucose are, however, unknown. The polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) {{is required for}} stabilization of insulin mRNA and the PTB mRNA 3 '-UTR contains binding sites for the microRNA molecules miR- 133 a, miR- 124 a and miR- 146. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to investigate whether high glucose increased the levels of these three miRNAs in association with lower PTB levels and lower insulin biosynthesis rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human islets were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of low (5. 6 mM) or high glucose (20 mM). Islets were also exposed to <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate</b> or the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 beta and IFN-gamma, since saturated free fatty acids and cytokines also cause islet dysfunction. RNA was then isolated for real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR- 133 a, miR- 124 a, miR- 146, insulin mRNA and PTB mRNA contents. Insulin biosynthesis rates were determined by radioactive labeling and immunoprecipitation. Synthetic miR- 133 a precursor and inhibitor were delivered to dispersed islet cells by lipofection, and PTB was analyzed by immunoblotting following culture at low or high glucose. Culture in high glucose resulted in increased islet contents of miR- 133 a and reduced contents of miR- 146. Cytokines increased the contents of miR- 146. The insulin and PTB mRNA contents were unaffected by high glucose. However, both PTB protein levels and insulin biosynthesis rates were decreased in response to high glucose. The miR- 133 a inhibitor prevented the high glucose-induced decrease in PTB and insulin biosynthesis, and the miR- 133 a precursor decreased PTB levels and insulin biosynthesis similarly to high glucose. CONCLUSION: Prolonged high-glucose exposure down-regulates PTB levels and insulin biosynthesis rates in human islets by increasing miR- 133 a levels. We propose that this mechanism contributes to hyperglycemia-induced beta-cell dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of the {{equilibrium}} adsorption and tension behavior of single ionic surfactants and of binary ionic surfactant mixtures {{is important for}} many applications in foaming, detergency, coating flows, and lung surfactant formulations. Certain lung surfactant components, such as DPPG and <b>sodium</b> <b>palmitate,</b> are ionic, as are certain potential replacement lung surfactants, such as sodium myristate. The equilibrium adsorption and tension behavior of two typical ionic surfactants, sodium dodecylsulfate and sodium dodecylsulfonate, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The single component models are fitted to surface tension data and predict adsorbed surface densities and surface potentials. These predictions compare favorably to experimentally determined surface densities obtained from ellipsometry and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, {{as well as to}} the experimentally determined voltage drop across the air/solution interface. ^ The extension of the single component equilibrium tension models to binary ionic surfactant mixtures was performed via the general, thermodynamically consistent framework of the ideal and nonideal adsorbed solution theories. The Nonideal Adsorbed Solution (NAS) model of Siddiqui and Franses [1996], valid for binary mixtures of nonionic surfactants at the air/water interface, was extended to include binary mixtures of ionic surfactants (iNAS). For simplicity, only symmetric ionic surfactants of the same ionic character (charge) were formally considered, although the model can be further extended to any valence type. This new ionic adsorbed solution model is valid below the mixed cmc and also above the mixed cmc when combined to a micellization model. The surface tensions, surface coverages, mixed monolayer compositions, and surface potentials are calculated with the iNAS model, using only parameters for the pure components as model inputs. Counterion binding to monolayers or micelles is an important component of the model. The iNAS model is tested with tension data for an equimolar mixture of sodium dodecylsulfate and sodium dodecylsulfonate. The predictions of the model are further evaluated with independent data on the densities and compositions of the adsorbed monolayers for equimolar mixtures. ...|$|E
