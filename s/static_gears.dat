40|$|Harvesting of the {{invasive}} Manila clam, Tapes philippinarum, is {{the main}} exploitative activity in the Venice lagoon, but the mechanical dredges used in this free-access regime produce a considerable disturbance of the lagoon ecosystem. An ecosystem approach to study the complex effects of clam harvesting was implemented using a trophic mass-balance model. The trophic relations in the ecosystem were quantified with a mixed trophic impact analysis and further evaluated by considering different explanations for the ‘‘Tapes paradox’’, which consists of the apparent population enhancement of Manila clams by dredging and the apparent nutritional advantages that this species receives from re-suspended organic matter. The key-role played by this introduced species is highlighted by a network analysis that indicates a ‘‘wasp-waist control’’ of the system by Manila clams. The model constructed to characterise {{the present state of}} the Venice lagoon ecosystem is compared with models produced for a reconstructed past lagoon and a projected future lagoon. The future model was obtained by simulating the elimination of clam dredging in 10 years. The three different models were compared using thermodynamic and informational indices. Simulating the elimination of clam dredging produced a 33 % increase in artisanal fishery catches, carried out by means of <b>static</b> <b>gears,</b> even with no change in fishing effort. These simulations also forecast an increase in the mean trophic level of the artisanal fishery catches as a positive effect of eliminating mechanical clam harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Universidade do Algarve, 2007 A {{number of}} {{ecological}} indicators {{were used to}} study the impact of fishing gear on the Algarve marine ecosystem. Catch composition, species richness, diversity, mean length, trophic level, percentage of mature and optimum sized fish and percentage of megaspawners were determined for the fish catches of each gear type. Four types of <b>static</b> <b>gears</b> (gill nets, trammel nets, bottom longline and semi-pelagic longline) with different mesh sizes or hook sizes represented the small-scale fisheries and were studied using data from experimental fishing trials, while commercial catches of two trawling types, crustacean trawling and fish trawling exemplified the industrial fisheries. Different species dominated the catches of the different main gears. Gill nets were clearly differentiated by the low trophic levels. Semi-pelagic longline caught larger fish with high trophic levels. Trammel nets also had high percentage of mature individuals in the catches, but also more non-target species. The trawlers affected juveniles of many species. Larger mesh sizes caught larger individuals, though not necessarily mature. The ordination procedure revealed how gear catches are best characterized by the different indicators and catch composition. Technical interactions were apparent when some gears affected juveniles of target species of other gears. Management recommendations such as minimum legal size, closed areas, gear restrictions and modifications are provided. Fishers participation in management can be enhanced by explanations of these simple indicators. Public participation can be extremely important for supporting unpopular management measures...|$|E
40|$|Fishing trials with {{monofilament}} gill {{nets and}} longlines using small hooks {{were carried out}} at the same fishing grounds in Cyclades (Aegean Sea) over 1 year. Four sizes of MUSTAD brand, round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT, numbers 15, 13, 12 and 11) and four mesh sizes of 22, 24, 26 and 28 turn nominal bar length monofilament gill nets were used. Significant differences in the catch size frequency distributions of the two gears were found for four out of five of the most important species caught by both the gears (Diplodus annularis, Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus erythrinus, Scorpaena porcus and Serranus cabrilla), with longlines catching larger fish and a wider size range than gill nets. Whereas longline catch size frequency distributions for most species for the different hook sizes were generally highly overlapped, suggesting little or no differences in size selectivity, gill net catch size frequency distributions clearly showed size selection, with larger mesh sizes catching larger fish. A variety of models were fitted to the gill net data, with the lognormal providing the best fit in most cases. A maximum likelihood method was also used to estimate the parameters of the logistic model for the longline data. Because of the highly overlapped longline catch size frequency distributions parameters could only be estimated for two species. This study shows that the two <b>static</b> <b>gears</b> have different impacts in terms of size selection. This information will be useful for the more effective management of these small-scale, multi-species and multi-gear fisheries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{management}} of fishing capacity requires reliable estimates of current capacity, {{and to this}} end most countries have developed a form of capacity measure usually based on some physical characteristics of the fleet. In the United Kingdom, the "capacity" measurement system currently in place is {{used as the basis}} of existing capacity reduction programmes. Each vessel has a number of Vessel Capacity Units (VCUs) defined by its size and engine power. An assumption is made that this measure is related to the ability of the fleet to catch fish. More recently, techniques have been developed to measure capacity directly in terms of potential output. In this paper, the fishing capacity of a sample of UK otter trawlers and a set of boats that primarily use <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> (i. e. nets and lines) is estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Estimates are made on a species-by-species basis for the key species harvested. These are compared to the existing measures of physical capacity.

40|$|Fishing trials with {{monofilament}} gill {{nets and}} longlines using small hooks {{were carried out}} in Algarve waters (southern Portugal) over a one-year period. Four hook sizes of "Mustad" brand, round bent, flatted sea hooks (Quality 2316 DT, numbers 15, 13, 12 and 11) and four mesh sizes of 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm (bar length) monofilament gill nets were used. Commercially valuable sea breams dominated the longline catches while small pelagics were relatively {{more important in the}} gill nets. Significant differences in the catch size frequency distributions of the two gears were found for all the most important species caught by both gears (Boops boops, Diplodus bellottii, Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Spondyiosoma cantharus, Scomber japonicus and Scorpaena notata), with longlines catching larger fish and a wider size range than nets. Whereas longline catch size frequency distributions for most species for the different hook sizes were generally highly overlapped, suggesting little or no differences in size selectivity, gill net catch size frequency distributions clearly showed size selection. A variety of models were fitted to the gill net and hook data using the SELECT method, while the parameters of the logistic model were estimated by maximum likelihood for the longline data. The bi-normal model gave the best fits for most of the species caught with gill nets, while the logistic model adequately described hook selectivity.

40|$|The set-net fishery of Taiwan was {{examined}} in this study in the context of ecological sustainable development of a unique fishery. Set-net fishery, unlike many other active forms of fishing, involves static gear set in near shore coastal environments and targets migratory pelagic fish. This study is the first comprehensive examination of a set-net fishery and draws on a comprehensive literature (published mainly in Taiwanese). Data are presented on annual production in the context of regional fishing cooperators which have been established to manage the set-net fishery. Information on fishing technology and the application of set-net gears in coastal waters is presented including net design and operation through extending questionnaire census responses. Detailed analyses of the catch from representative set-net fisheries present a comparative evaluation of species composition including interannual and seasonal variation. Sources of variation in the catch rates of set-nets are evaluated, particularly meteorological and environmental data (e. g. sea surface temperature). The {{results of the present study}} reveal that catches of giant trevally, yellowfin tuna, Hawaiian tenpounder, Japanese barracuda and sword fish are correlated with mean monthly water temperature. Only Spanish mackerel, which were associated with peak catches in winter, were negatively correlated with monthly mean temperature. Sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure are consistent with the hypothesis that ocean currents and their variation influence the catch rates of set-nets. Thus, pelagic fish including tuna, mackerel and trevally follow near-shore coastal currents making those fish vulnerable to capture by set-nets. Studies on the bathymetry and underwater topography near set-nets revealed an association with depth contours and catch rates of fish. Fish are more likely to be caught in set-nets if the set-nets are located near underwater troughs which in effect influence migration paths. Knowledge of underwater topography and associated ocean currents is important in locating set-nets and maximising catch rates of target species. By means of self-developed fishery detection data processing system (FDPS), an appropriate fishing site for set-net fishing can be selected. Acoustic surveys of fish near set-nets were used to examine fish behaviour near set-nets. The surveys revealed that most fish were active at night and were more likely to be caught over night than during the day. This is consistent with the daily variation in catches as set-nets are usually harvested twice a day (i. e., morning catch and afternoon catch). Whale sharks are occasionally caught in set-nets. Because of their conservation status, mitigation methods to avoid whale shark capture were evaluated. However, such mitigation is in tension with the economic benefits of catching and selling whale sharks (in high demand by premium seafood markets). Studies showed that most fish caught in set-nets were relatively small (30 - 40 cm total length). Mitigation methods (including wide-spaced rope grids to exclude large animals such as sharks) may negatively affect catch rates of target species (e. g. tuna). Thus, there are both economic and practical disincentives to apply whale shark- reducing devices. In all other respects, when compared with other fish methods (particularly demersal trawling), set-net fisheries have a demonstrably benign impact on coastal environments. Little by-catch is taken with almost all fish caught sold. What little by-catch is taken is used as food in co-located fish cage farming operations. As set-nets employ <b>static</b> <b>gears,</b> the quality of the fish caught is very high (compared with active trawl methods). This, and the regular harvest (twice daily) presents set-net fishery as a source of high value species with concomitant economic return to regional coastal communities. Thus, in the context of ecological sustainable development, the results of this study show demonstrable ecological, economic and social benefits from set-net fisheries in Taiwan...|$|E

We explore the social impacts arising from the establishment of an MPA using Lyme Bay (south west England) as a case study. Through a series of small group semi-structured interviews the social impacts experienced by fishermen (mobile and <b>static</b> <b>gear),</b> recreational users (divers and sea anglers) and recreation service providers (charter boat and dive businesses) were explored. The social impacts expressed varied according to activity in which the stakeholder group engaged. Negative themes included lengthening fishing trips, tension and conflict, fishermen identity, equity and uncertainty in the long-term. Positive themes included improved experiences for both commercial fishermen and recreational users, and expectations for long-term benefits. These impacts need to be understood because they influence stakeholder behaviour. Failure to interpret stakeholder responses may lead to poor decision-making and worsening stakeholder relations. These findings have implications for the success of the MPA in Lyme Bay, but also for the future network of marine conservation zones around the UK. Any assessment of MPA impacts must therefore identify social as well as economic and environmental change...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{contains}} three {{papers that}} comprise {{studies of the}} dynamic behaviour of involute spur and helical gears, and one paper that describes a method to {{determine the influence of}} misalignment on the <b>static</b> helical <b>gear</b> tooth stress. In the first study, the influence of the contact ratio on the dynamic response of a spur gear was examined. The spur gear pair was modelled using a single degree of freedom model with a piecewise constant gear mesh stiffness. By adopting this gear mesh stiffness variation, the dynamic response can be solved analytically. Based on a stability analysis of the resulting dynamic transmission error, the proper contact ratio to use in order to avoid tooth separation near a specific critical rotational speed was determined. In the other two studies of the dynamic behaviour of a gear set, the contact and the load between the gear teeth were more thoroughly investigated. The position of the contact and the distance that the gear teeth must deform were determined for every time increment in the dynamic simulation. This method ensures that the load is properly modelled, even at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the meshing cycle. The technique was applied to a helical gear, which requires a 3 D-analysis when calculating the load distribution along the line of contact. Furthermore, this technique was applied to a spur gear set to study the influence of the elasticity of the bearings and the significance of the gear mesh friction on the dynamic response. In addition, a method to determine how a misalignment of the gear axes will affect the <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> tooth stress of a helical gear pair is presented. Due to the misalignment, the load distribution along the line of contact will be shifted and the maximum contact pressure and the maximum fillet stress will be affected.

This study aimed to compare long-line and gill net catches within the same area in terms of catch composition, fishing yield, by-catch and discards, and specifically for hake, catch size frequency distribution and quality of the fished product. At least 35 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catches in terms of both weight and number. The by-catch represented 23 % and 15 % of the catch in weight for long-lines and gill nets respectively. No illegal sized hake (under 27 cm total length) were caught in either gear during the study period. Discards of non-commercial species were similar for both gears and considered to be negligible (< 3 % by weight). Hake discards were significantly different between gears (7 % for long-lines and 42 % for gill nets, by weight), due to fish deterioration related to soaking time. Higher daily yields were obtained for long-lines (258. 37 kg / 9, 000 hooks) compared with those for gill nets (127. 12 kg / 10 km net).

40|$|The {{conflicts}} between seals and fisheries along the Swedish west coast have intensified {{during the last}} decades, concurrently {{with the increase in}} the harbour seal population size. This study presents published information about interactions between harbour seals and fisheries in the Kattegat-Skagerrak, in addition to new information on the seal by-catch rate and an overview of fisheries suffering from seal damage. Several fisheries have reported interactions with seals, principally fisheries with fyke nets, gill nets and <b>static</b> <b>gear.</b> Development of mitigation measures has been focused on the eel fishery with fyke nets, in which the use of stronger net material has significantly decreased the damage frequency from seals and has yet maintained the catches at satisfactory levels. Under-water filming at fyke nets together with studies of the prey preferences of seals has shown individual specializations in certain foraging techniques. For example, eel may not be a common prey for harbour seals in general, but, it was chosen in preference to other species by seals attacking fyke nets. There is a lack of current data concerning the diet of harbour seals. Previous studies, based on material from the 1970 s and 1980 s, have shown that locally and seasonally abundant prey is preferred. Due to the non-existent information about the food choice, current assessments of the ecological role of harbour seals in Sweden cannot be evaluated. </div...|$|R

For the purpose of this evaluation it is the combination of the 2008 Statutory Instrument (SI) closure and the more recently designated Site of Community Interest (SCI) that form the boundary of the Lyme Bay Fisheries and Conservation Reserve, termed as the Lyme Bay Reserve. Data is analysed between 2005 and 2015.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of fatigue in gears at the tooth root {{can be a}} cause of catastrophic failure if not detected in time. Where traditional low-frequency vibration may help in detecting a well-developed crack or a completely failed tooth, a system for early detection of the nucleation and initial propagation of a fatigue crack can be of great use in condition monitoring. Acoustic emission is a potentially suitable technique, as it is sensitive to the higher frequencies generated by crack propagation and is not affected by low-frequency noise. In this article, a <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> pair is tested where a crack was initiated at a tooth root. Continuous acoustic emission was periodically recorded throughout the test. Data were processed in multiple ways to support the early detection of crack initiation. Initially, traditional feature–based acoustic emission was employed. This showed qualitative results indicating fracture initiation around 8000 cycles. A rolling cross-correlation was then employed to compare two given system states, showing a sensitivity to large changes towards the final phases of crack propagation. A banded fast Fourier transform approach showed that the 110 - to 120 -kHz band was sensitive to the observed crack initiation at 8000 cycles, and to the later larger propagation events at 22, 000 cycles. Two advanced data processing techniques were then used to further support these observations. First, a technique based on Chebyshev polynomial decomposition was used to reduce each wavestream data to a vector of 25 descriptors; these were used to track the system deviation from a baseline state and confirmed the previously observed deviations with a higher sensitivity. Further confirmation came from the analysis of wavestream entropy content, providing support from multiple data analysis techniques on the feasibility of system state tracking using continuous acoustic emission.

40|$|The {{cuttlefish}} (Sepia officinalis Linnaeus 1758) {{represents one}} of the most important coastal fishery resources of the Mediterranean Sea. For Italy, 45 % of cuttlefish landings (2, 328 t) originates from coastal regions of the northern Adriatic Sea: Veneto, Marche, Emilia Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia. In terms of economic value this species represents about 8 % (~€ 16. 5 million) of the production from this basin. From May 2004 to October 2005, cuttlefish were purchased from commercial landings of the Grado fishery fleet. At least 30 specimens were randomly taken each month from each fishing method employed for this species: bottom trawl (cod end mesh size 40 mm), rapido trawl, trammel net (mesh size of inner panel 30 mm) and cuttlefish specific trap. The main biological aspects, such as size, sex ratio, reproductive stage and diet in relation to both the season and type of fishing gear were analyzed. 1, 495 specimens, ranging from 3. 5 to 18. 0 cm mantle length, were analyzed. In relation to the observed size and reproductive stage of individuals caught, trammel nets and cuttlefish traps both appeared to target sexually mature individuals, whilst trawling gear were not selective for either recruits or spawners. In total 34 prey taxa were found in the stomachs of S. officinalis: crabs and bony fish species were the most important prey, although the latter appeared mostly in the largest specimens. Finally the fullness index revealed that cuttlefish caught by trawling were more suitable for diet analysis than those caught by <b>static</b> <b>gear.</b> In this way the contribution of the present paper was to give new insights on the biological parameters of this species in relation to the main fishing gears employed in the northern Adriatic Sea...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is ultimately a social endeavour to sustain or improve human well-being via {{the conservation of}} marine ecosystems. The degree to which ecological gains are realised can depend upon how economic, ecological and social costs (negative impacts) and benefits (positive impacts) {{are included in the}} designation and management process. Without the support of key stakeholder groups whose user rights have been affected by the creation of an MPA, human impacts cannot be reduced. This study analyses a three year dataset to understand the themes associated with the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of an MPA in Lyme Bay, United Kingdom (UK) following its establishment in 2008. Methodologically, the paper presents an ecosystem based management framework for analysing costs and benefits. Two hundred and forty one individuals were interviewed via questionnaire between 2008 and 2010 to determine perceptions and the level of support towards the MPA. Results reveal that despite the contentious manner in which this MPA was established, support for the MPA is strong amongst the majority of stakeholder groups. The level of support and the reasons given for support vary between stakeholder groups. Overall, the stakeholders perceive the social, economic and environmental benefits of the MPA to outweigh the perceived costs.

40|$|The marine {{environment}} provides essential ecosystem {{services that are}} critical to {{the functioning of the}} earth’s life support system and the maintenance of human well-being. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are recognised as being the mechanism though which marine natural capital may be conserved. This thesis focuses on the value associated with marine conservation in a case study area, Lyme Bay, England where a ‘closed area’ was created in 2008. A review of literature spanning 20 years shows that despite sound ecological knowledge of a marine area, the reliance on traditional neo-classical economic valuations for marine spatial planning can obscure other issues pertinent to the ecosystem approach. A further valuation of the marine leisure and recreation industry shows that the industry is of economic significance and that the MPA enables the protection of the most valuable sites but has limited benefits for protecting the full resource base. In terms of ecological value, a ‘service orientated framework’ was developed to enable decision makers to understand the links between benthic species, ecological function and indirect ecosystem services. Results spatially identify which ecosystem services occur and demonstrate the value of the MPA in ensuring delivery of these ecosystem services. In relation to the social value of the MPA the research reveals that support for the MPA is strong amongst the majority of stakeholder groups. Values are expressed as the economic, environmental and social benefits of the MPA. However, there have been clear social costs of the MPA policy and these have been borne by mobile and <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> fishermen and charter boat operators. Each valuation methodology can inform decision making. Though, if ecosystem service valuation is to become a deliberative tool for marine conservation and planning, then {{there is a need for}} a larger societal discussion on what activities and trade-offs society considers acceptable.

Fishing trials were carried out on a seasonal basis (four seasons in the Cantabrian Sea, Algarve and Cyclades and two seasons in the Gulf of Cadiz) with chartered commercial fishing vessels. Overall, size selectivity was estimated for 17 out of 28 species for which sufficient data were available. Trammel nets generally caught a wide size range {{of the most important}} species, with length frequency distributions that were skewed to the right and/or bi-modal. In many cases the length frequency distributions of the different nets were highly overlapped. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also showed that the large outer panel meshes generally had no effect in terms of size selectivity, while the opposite was true for the small inner panel ones. Six different selectivity models (normal scale, normal location, gamma, log-normal, bi-modal and gamma semi-Wileman) were fitted to data {{for the most}} abundant species in the four areas. For fish, the bi-modal model provided the best fits {{for the majority of the}} data sets, with the uni-modal models giving poor fits in most cases. For Sepia officinalis, where trammelling or pocketing was the method of capture in 100 % of the cases, the logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was judged to be more appropriate for describing the size selective properties of the trammel nets. Our results, which are among the first ones on trammel net selectivity in European waters, will be useful for evaluating the impacts of competing gear for the socio-economically important small-scale <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> fisheries.

40|$|Trawling {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its introduction in the 17 th century. In 1882 the Fishery Board for Scotland was established and assigned powers to ban beam and otter trawling where {{necessary to protect}} traditional <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> fisheries. Under these powers, {{large parts of the}} inshore waters off the east and west coasts of Scotland were closed to trawling. The Firth of Clyde remained closed until 1962. More recently, in April 2015 solicitors acting for Greenpeace obtained High Court permission for a judicial review of Defra’s alleged failure to adjust its policy on allocating annual landing quotas to reflect reforms to the CFP. It is claimed the reforms stipulate that greater preference should be given to sustainable low impact fishing methods at the expense of high-impact methods such as trawling. In Scotland, the exclusion of trawling activity from a network of marine protected areas established in July 2015 has also been highly controversial. There is no doubt that some trawl gears can be extremely destructive of fragile habitats and slowly regenerating fauna such as coral. Over expanses of mud or sand, however, it has been claimed that trawling may be a positive factor, akin to ploughing the fields in terrestrial agriculture, and enhancing the productivity of the ecosystem. There have been many scientific studies, both in the field and using mathematical modelling, of the impact of trawling on the seabed. Similarly, we know very well that harvesting of fish and shellfish, whether using trawling or <b>static</b> <b>gear,</b> has consequences for marine food webs. However, there have been few, if any, scientific studies which have put these two aspects of trawling together and then compared the seabed impacts of trawling with the consequences of harvesting. In this project we used a mathematical model to compare and contrast the whole ecosystem effects of harvesting fish and shellfish with the consequences of other aspects of trawling activity, especially the ploughing of seabed habitats. The model is not detailed to the level of individual species or exact locations. Rather it gives results at the level of a whole regional sea area, such as the North Sea or the whole of the west of Scotland. The project had three main components. First, was the extension of an existing mathematical model of a marine ecosystem to include explicit representation of the ploughing effects that different gears have on seabed habitats. Second, an analysis of a large international data set on activity, landings and catches by different fishing gears in northwest European waters, and the mapping of these onto different seabed habitats to generate inputs to the model. Finally, we carried out a series of sensitivity experiments with the model. These experiments investigated the whole ecosystem effects of seabed ploughing by different gears, using food web indicators relevant to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and compared them with the impact of one scenario for implementing a landing obligation, and the potential impacts of a reduction in overall fishing activity. For the North Sea, the results show that even if all ploughing effects were eliminated, the effects on the whole ecosystem would be equivalent to only a 1 % or less change in overall harvesting rate of fish and shellfish. This is a very small effect compared to the changes in effective harvesting rate implied by the improvements in gear selectivity required to achieve the landing obligation. For the west of Scotland region, the model showed that the food web was more sensitive to the effects of ploughing by fishing gears than in the North Sea, but the effect was still small compared to the consequences of activity reduction overall. The greater sensitivity of the west of Scotland to seabed ploughing arose because the disturbance rate of muddy sediments was around 5 -times higher than in the North Sea, almost entirely due to the activities of TR 2 Nephrops trawling. Despite our conclusion that the regional scale food web effects of seabed ploughing are small compared to the primary consequences of harvesting fish, {{this is not to say}} that there are no effects on regional biodiversity, or significant effects at local scales on specific habitats or vulnerable species. In particular the study identifies the TR 2 gear fleet as being responsible for the majority of ecosystem-wide consequences of seabed ploughing. This gear has a particularly high ploughing rate and its activity is focussed on muddy sediments where the nutrient chemistry processes are more vulnerable to ploughing than in sandy and coarser sediments...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{wind farm}} (OWF) {{construction}} in the UK is progressing rapidly alongside increasing spatial pressures on marine ecosystems and social and economic activities. A need for increased protection of habitats, species and ecological processes that support environmental and economic benefits is being met by designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Mitigation and spatial planning solutions are required to enable protection of vital ecological habitats, features and processes and support sustainable economic development. A potential solution is to co-locate OWFs and MPAs. This study uses a multi-disciplinary approach to examine if evidence on the environmental effects of existing OWFs and associated effects on fishing activity (as an existing resource use) benefits MPA goals. Through a systematic review and meta-analyses of existing data, knowledge of OWF effects on species abundance and economic effects on fishing were identified as key evidence gaps. The ecological evidence need was approached through {{a case study of}} ecological effects of North Hoyle OWF, North Wales, UK, using existing pre and post-construction monitoring data, as well as primary baited remote underwater video data, collected 5 years later (8 years post-construction). Results suggested habitat and species recovered to a stable state that showed some community differences to pre-construction conditions. The presence of OWF monopiles is likely to have increased existing heterogeneity of substratum and increased opportunities for scavenging species. Species benefitting and disadvantaged by habitat provided within the OWF reflected meta-analyses trends. Extended baseline monitoring to provide confident identification of natural levels of variation in sediment and fauna was lacking. Analysis of fishing activity and landings before and after OWF construction in three UK case study regions approached effects on resource users. Fishing activity in the three case study areas showed broad scale similarity to national trends. Small-scale activity patterns indicated greater reductions in mobile (towed) fishing gear effort near to operating OWFs than in <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> activity (using pots or static nets). Semi-structured interviews conducted with fishermen in each region revealed loss of ground and disruption as negative effects from OWFs, in addition to existing pressures. Benefits including habitat creation and species augmentation, as well as reduction of cumulative lost ground, were identified by fishermen from co-location of MPAs and OWFs. Ecological effects of OWFs suggested benefits from habitat creation, species augmentation and potential for protection of sandbank habitats between monopiles. Mitigation requirements were identified to maximise these potential benefits to an MPA network. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC...|$|R

Transmission error is very important information in the evaluation of gear engagement and the prediction of vibration and noise from gear boxes.

However, it is impossible to measure all of gear pairs in mass production for actual transmission manufacturers. The prediction of transmission error by the simulation in high accuracy should be powerful and effective means in application.

5000|$|The {{version of}} Kobra seen in Batman Beyond appears in {{an episode of}} Static Shock. In [...] "Future Shock", Kobra carried on with their tactics, and {{eventually}} acquired another leader. They also secretly moved into a location known as Platform 247, and used it as their new headquarters. In an undocumented occurrence, the police arrested the unnamed Kobra Leader (voiced by Lance Henriksen). Thus, Kobra designed a plan to imprison Static and then negotiate a trade. They forged a holographic message from <b>Static's</b> friend <b>Gear</b> so as to lure Static into Platform 247, where he was ambushed, subdued and imprisoned in a stasis field. The negotiation, however, was never in Kobra's plans, as they never truly intended {{to give up the}} captive hero. It was but a ruse to provide their leader with an escape opportunity, while he was being transported to the exchange. After breaking out, Kobra Leader headed off to Kobra's headquarters to kill Static. However, Batman and Static's younger self broke in and took on Kobra's Leader and his soldiers. Static released his older self from the stasis field, who single-handedly defeated a battalion of Kobra worshipers with a single jolt. Kobra's fate afterward remains unknown.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MP As) are increasingly {{viewed as an}} important management tool within a suite of policy alternatives to reduce, prevent and/or reverse on-going declines in marine biodiversity. The overall aim of this thesis was to test the efficacy of MP As as a conservation measure, particularly focusing on partially {{protected areas}} which have received less attention than fully protected areas. An evidence-based approach, combining a rigorous assessment of the literature through 'systematic review' methodology, with field studies of fishing gear restriction areas in the UK was undertaken to examine the biological effects of partially protected areas on biota relative to fully protected areas and open access fished areas. The syntheses of available evidence included in the systematic review suggested that while partially protected areas significantly enhanced density and biomass of fish relative to open access areas, fully protected areas yielded significantly higher biomass of fish within their boundaries relative to partially protected areas. The positive response to protection was primarily driven by target species. The effects of life history and ecological traits on the response of fish species to fully and partially protected areas were further examined using mixed effects modelling. Fish maximum body size, adult habitat preference and the exploitation status of the species {{were significantly related to}} the magnitude of response to full and partial protection. These results highlighted the importance of incorporating species information in the design of new MP As, which ensures that protection is provided at spatial scales relevant to the species in need of conservation. Fishery closed areas, where fishing with bottom-towed gear is prohibited but fishing with <b>static</b> <b>gear</b> is permitted are amongst the commonest examples of MP As in the UK. Underwater camera surveys were conducted at Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the Modiolus Box within the Pen Llyn a'r Sarnau SAC, Skomer Marine Nature Reserve and the Port Erin closed area in the Isle of Man to examine the response of epibenthic invertebrate communities to protection from bottom fishing. Benefits from protection were observed for three of these MP As and the magnitude of response was generally higher for the target species such as scallops and for sessile, fragile taxa such as hydroids, bryozoans and sponges. Two key environmental characteristics that influenced the effect of protection were the intensity of fishing at the control unprotected areas and the level of natural disturbance from waves and tides. Overall, the results showed that partially protected areas are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all extractive activities is not a socio- economically and politically viable option. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the physical nature and dynamics of the environment, the nature of the species concerned and past and present level of fishing intensity throughout the designation process of MP As, so as to avoid negative impacts on fisheries and limited conservation benefits.

40|$|A {{spiral bevel}} gear system {{supported}} on thrust bearings considering the coupled bending-torsional nonlinear vibration is proposed and an eight degrees of freedom (8 DOF) lumped parameter dynamic model of the {{spiral bevel gear}} system combined with time-varying stiffness, <b>static</b> transmission error, <b>gear</b> backlash, and bearing clearances is investigated. The spiral bevel gear system is analyzed with the equations of motion and the dynamic response is solved using the Runge-Kutta method. The effects of mesh frequency, mesh damping coefficient, load coefficient, and gear backlash are revealed, which describe the true mesh characteristics of the spiral bevel gear system. The bifurcation characteristics as jump discontinuities, periodic windows, and chaos are obtained by studying time histories, phase plane portraits, Poincaré maps, Fourier spectra, and global bifurcation diagrams of the gear system. The results presented in this study provide some useful information for engineers in designing and controlling such gear systems...|$|R
