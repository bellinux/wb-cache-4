The crux of stress relief is to flare the shield end along a logarithmic curve. Before 1960, the stress cones were handmade using tape—after the cable was installed. These were protected by potheads, so named because a potting compound/dielectric was poured around the tape inside a metal/ porcelain body insulators. About 1960, preformed terminations were developed consisting of a rubber or elastomer body that is stretched over the cable end.

40|$|Abstract: Well {{known in}} medium voltage {{applications}} up to rated voltages about 36 kV, vacuum tubes are seldom used for real high-voltage applications because {{a couple of}} technical problems have to be overcome like electric field design. A variety of electrode arrangements such as shields, field-grading electrodes and main contacts have to be considered. In general the withstand voltages of these electrode arrangements in vacuum {{are determined by the}} electric field distribution, which can easily be calculated. But local field intensification and electrode area decreases the withstand voltages by a considerable amount. The local electric field intensification is due to electrode material, surface treatment and condition. The area effect depends on the average density of local field intensification sites at the electrodes. Therefore experimental data are needed to obtain additional information. Lightning impulse breakdown voltages of <b>shield</b> <b>electrode</b> and main contact models made of copper-chromium or copper are measured.

30|$|The {{improvement}} of the sensitivity factor is particularly important to extend the measurement down to UHV/XHV range where ion collection currents are normally extremely small. To evaluate the sensitivity performance by modulating the electron energy, {{the role of a}} mesh modulator with 92.2  % physical transparency is investigated. As shown in Fig.  6 c, the relations between K and the modulator potential are tested for three anode potentials of 350, 400, and 450  V, respectively. With increasing the modulator potential from 100 to 700  V, the sensitivity factor varies roughly in two plateaus, and a transition leap occurs when the modulator potential is equal to and 50  V higher than the anode potential. Further increase of the modulator potential does not improve the K factor significantly. This leap is most probably related to the prolongations of the electron trajectories because a slightly higher modulator potential assists the electrons move back and forth around the top of the anode grid. Under the anode potential of 400  V, K reaches 2.85  Torr− 1, 20  % higher than the value without the modulator. Liu et al. also demonstrated the sensitivity improvement by a <b>shield</b> <b>electrode</b> for the CNT BA gauge [37].

EMG-current measurements performed underwater showed no loss of signal amplitude when compared to measurements made in air, although some differences in amplitude and spectral components were observed between conditions. However, signal amplitudes and frequencies displayed consistent behavior across contraction effort levels, irrespective of the experimental condition.

40|$|A single neural circuit, such as {{the network}} of neural populations {{involved}} in learning, expressing, and regulating fear, may spread across many brain regions and show functional heterogeneity among spatially overlapping cell types within each region. These populations, represented as discrete circuit elements in models of circuit function, may also show different patterns of activity and connectivity within the circuit over time. More effective therapies for fear related diseases such as anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder could be achieved if the populations responsible for the pathology were known and could be precisely controlled to restore healthy behavior. The algae- and bacteria-derived light-activated ion channels Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) and Halorhodopsin (Halo) {{could be used to}} treat circuit pathologies because they enable bidirectional control of transfected neurons with high temporal and spatial resolution. Virally delivered to mammalian neurons and expressed under cell-class specific promoters, they can be used to address neural populations which share similar morphology, connectivity, electrophysiology, and, likely, function. Furthermore, the fear circuit may be reverse-engineered by perturbing neural populations, both individually and combinatorially, over many points in the timecourse of fear behavior, to see their effect on both behavior and the electrophysiological function of other neural populations. This requires a tool for multisite optical activation in the freely-moving rodent behaviors used to study fear, which is impossible to achieve with current laser-based optical systems. We developed LED-Coupled Optical Fiber Arrays whose high power output (> 200 mW/mm 2 at fiber tip), high packing density (> 1 fiber/mm 2), low cost (~$ 2 /fiber), low weight (1 - 2 gms), and modular design enable highly scalable, rapid customization for networks with many circuit elements and large structures requiring many points of optical delivery for full coverage. We found that optical activation of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex can facilitate fear extinction in mice who have learned tone-shock association, a resulted strongly suggested but unproved by electrical stimulation experiments which could not differentiate between cell classes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} recent improvements made on the P 300 speller paradigm {{in the context of}} the CoAdapt project. The flashing sequence is elicited by a new design called RIPRAND, in which the flashing rate of elements can be controlled independently of grid cardinality. Element-based evidence accumulation allows early-stopping of the flashes as soon as the symbol has been detected with confidence. No calibration session is nec-essary, thanks to a mixture-of-experts method which makes the initial predictions. When sufficient data can be buffered, subject-specific spatial and temporal filters are learned, with which the interface seamlessly makes its predictions, and the classifiers are adapted online. This paper, which presents results of three online sessions totalling 26 subjects, is the first to report online performance of a P 300 speller with no calibration. 1 Material and Methods The P 300 speller presented in this work was implemented in C++ with OpenViBE [7], and a dedicated stimulating software controlled the keyboard display. The software is opensource and part of OpenViBE release 0. 18 We used a single Windows laptop to run all software components. The P 300 speller keyboard was displayed on a separate LCD screen. A TMSi Refa 8 amplifier, synchronized via hardware to the laptop, was used to record from 12 actively <b>shielded</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The visual stimulations consisted of briefly flashing "smiley" pictures. The P 300 wave was detected via 3 channels of an xDAWN spatial filter [8], combined with a Regularized LDA classifier hereforth called RDA, which incorporates a regularisation of the common covariance matrix. The output of the classifier at each flashing time t is denote y(t). To save time, elements are always flashed in groups. Initial design of P 300 speller groups involved rows and columns of a square matrix [2] or their randomizations [1]. The target element is then found at the intersection of the groups eliciting a P 300 response. But repetitively flashing the same groups causes elements within the target groups to be wrongly selected, because of visual attention effects, and because of the contamination of all group elements by classification errors. Element-wise evidence accumulation avoids these two effects. A different random per-mutation can then be performed at each repetition of the flashes, effectively changing elements' group membership across repetitions. At each flash t, let the binary vector a(t) represent the set of n flashed elements within the grid of cardinality N. The score α(t) of each element (initialized to 0 at time 0) is updated with the following scheme, in which both target and non-target flashes contribute to the accumulation: α(t) = α(t − 1) + lo...|$|R
40|$|Frisch grid {{ionization}} chambers {{are commonly}} used experimental tools for charged particle spectroscopy. In the ideal Frisch grid chamber the anode pulse height is independent of where inside the sensitive volume the charge has been created. This ideal cannot be realized because of imperfect shielding of the anode by the grid. The effect of the imperfect shielding is generally referred to as grid inefficiency. For accurate energy determination the anode pulse height needs to be corrected for this. At present two opposing explanation for grid inefficiency exist. The first explanation {{suggests that there is}} a reduction of the anode pulse height. This is said to arise from positive ions inducing charge on the anode as the electrons are collected. The second explanation suggests that there is a too large anode signal. The addition to the anode signal is said to arise from the drift of electrons. In this thesis the concept of grid inefficiency is investigated by means of wave form digitization. The use of digital signal processing makes it possible to maintain information on the drift of electrons. This information is lost in charged particle spectroscopy experiments using electronic signal processing networks. A series of experiments is described in this thesis. The first experiment was performed to find good measuring conditions for the following experiments. For this purpose the drift velocity of electrons was measured in two chamber filling gases, P- 10 and CF 4. The measured drift velocities are presented for the two gases. Finally, P- 10 was chosen as filling gas for the following experiments. In the second experiment the grid inefficiency was measured for two different types of <b>shielding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The method of determining the grid inefficiency is based on the analysis of the shape of digitized charge signals. The measured values are shown to be in good agreement with calculated values. In the final experiment the effects of grid inefficiency on alpha particle spectroscopy is investigated. It is shown how the correction for grid inefficiency by the two existing models yield equivalent results for energy determination. An attempt to separate the two models is also presented indicating that there is in fact a reduction of the anode pulse height because of grid inefficiency. The thesis is concluded with a theoretical discussion of the anode pulse shape. There grid inefficiency is explained by the drift of electrons. It is shown in this section how explaining grid inefficiency by the drift of electrons should yield the same result as explaining it by the effect of positive ions...|$|R

The external background {{is reduced by}} enclosing the Ge detector array inside a thick active <b>shield.</b> The outer <b>electrode</b> of the coaxial detectors is subdivided into five segments, and internal beta activity is rejected by operating the segmented detector in a multisegment mode. The multisegment mode requires that events be detected in two or more segments before they are recorded. The full-energy-peak (FEP) efficiency of the unit is tested {{as a function of}} the incident gamma-ray energy and of the discriminator threshold of the segments. Measurements of beta-rejection and FEP efficiency are compared with Monte Carlo calculations, and good agreement is noted...|$|R
