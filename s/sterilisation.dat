5|$|In {{homes and}} urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is {{attempted}} through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control {{can be used}} including <b>sterilisation</b> programmes.|$|E
5|$|Women {{in areas}} under Indonesian control were also coerced into {{accepting}} <b>sterilisation</b> procedures, {{and some were}} pressured or forced outright to take the contraceptive Depo Provera. Village leaders were often urged to cooperate with TNI policy and local clinics responsible for administering contraceptive injections were established {{under the control of}} the TNI in the countryside. In one case specifically, a group of high-school girls were injected with the contraceptive without their knowledge. Other forms of birth control consisted of killing newborn children of women who were suspected of being associated with the Fretilin.|$|E
5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory <b>sterilisation</b> of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E

5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the <b>sterilisation</b> room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the <b>sterilisation</b> of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
25|$|Sub-fertility {{must not}} be {{the direct result of}} a <b>sterilisation</b> {{procedure}} in either partner (this does not include conditions where <b>sterilisation</b> occurs as a result of another medical problem).

40|$|The {{physician}} and sexologist Albert Moll, from Berlin, {{was one of}} the main protagonists within the German discourse on the opportunities and dangers of social engineering, by eugenic interventions into human life in general, as well as into reproductive hygiene and healthcare policy in particular. One of the main sexological topics that were discussed intensively during the late-Wilhelminian German Reich and the Weimar Republic was the question of the legalisation of voluntary and compulsory <b>sterilisations</b> on the basis of medical, social, eugenic, economic or criminological indications. As is clear from Moll’s conservative principles of medical ethics, and his conviction that the genetic knowledge required for eugenically indicated <b>sterilisations</b> was not yet sufficiently elaborated, he had doubts and worries about colleagues who were exceedingly zealous about these surgical <b>sterilisations</b> – especially Gustav Boeters from Saxony...|$|R

25|$|The average woman {{living in}} a rural area in India has little or no control over {{becoming}} pregnant. Women, particularly women in rural areas, {{do not have access to}} safe and self-controlled methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like <b>sterilisation,</b> or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. <b>Sterilisation</b> accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female <b>sterilisation</b> accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations. The contraceptive prevalence rate for 2007/2008 was estimated at 54.8%.|$|E

25|$|Eugenics {{programs}} including forced sterilization {{existed in}} most Northern European countries, {{as well as}} other more or less Protestant countries. Some programs, such as Canada's, lasted well into the 1970s. Other countries that had notably active <b>sterilisation</b> programmes include Denmark, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Switzerland, Iceland, and some countries in Latin America (including Panama). In the United Kingdom, Home Secretary Winston Churchill was a noted advocate, and his successor Reginald McKenna introduced a bill that included forced <b>sterilisation.</b> Writer G. K. Chesterton led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the 1913 Mental Deficiency Act.|$|E

30|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in the consent process to advise patients of risks of complications, such as general anaesthesia (< 1 : 100), and general complications after laparoscopic surgery, e.g. pain, bleeding, infection, damage to the bowel/bladder/urethra (1 : 1000 in <b>sterilisations</b> and 1 : 500 for other procedures) [78]. These risk ratios are less than {{the risk of a}} directly adhesion-related readmission (adhesiolysis) in the first year after surgery following a known high-risk laparoscopic procedure, such as an ovarian or tubal procedure, or open ovarian surgery (1 : 80 following laparoscopic surgery and 1 : 50 following open surgery). Even in patients undergoing other therapeutic laparoscopic surgery (excepting tubal <b>sterilisations),</b> the risk of a directly adhesion-related readmission is 1 : 70 and, for open surgery on the Fallopian tubes or uterus, it is 1 : 120 and 1 : 170, respectively, i.e. comparatively high [3].|$|R

5000|$|A demographical {{survey of}} Pala - an area located in Western Changtang about 300 miles north-west of Lhasa - {{conducted}} by tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein brings to light that from 1959 to 1990 large families remained the norm {{and that no}} reproductive restraints were imposed on nomadic herders: [...] "Despite repeated claims in the West that the Chinese had imposed a strict policy of birth control in Tibet, where ‘forced abortions, <b>sterilisations</b> and infanticides are everyday occurrences’ (New York Times, 31 January 1992), there was no policy of restricting reproduction in Pala, let alone evidence of forced abortions, <b>sterilisations</b> or infanticide." [...] An analysis of the fertility histories collected from 71 females aged from 15 to 59 provides strong {{evidence in support of}} the conclusion that no population control policy restricting couples to 2 or even 3 births was or is operative. Besides, no Pala nomads have ever been fined for any subsequent children, and all such children and their families enjoy full rights in the community ...|$|R

25|$|His {{political}} opinions (and Galton's as well) were strongly inclined against the coercive, authoritarian forms of eugenics that became so {{prominent in the}} 20th century.

50|$|Sterilization is {{a popular}} method of {{contraception}} in New Zealand. It has been claimed by academics that 'sterilization has become the preferred method of fertility regulation among women of older reproductive ages.' Often {{one or the other}} partner in a relationship undergoes sterilization. Women undergo tubal ligation and men undergo a vasectomy. New Zealand Family Planning reports that the country has 'one of the highest rates of vasectomy in the world' with 18% of men and 25% of married men having undergone the procedure. Doctors may object to performing <b>sterilisations</b> on conscience grounds but must refer the patient to another practitioner.|$|R

25|$|Legionella is a {{parasite}} of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (160°F; 70°C), <b>sterilisation</b> of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, {{and in some}} cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 July 2012, Judge Elton Hoff {{held that}} the {{evidence}} presented by the women demonstrated {{that they had not}} given informed consent to the <b>sterilisations.</b> The High Court found that obtaining consent from the women when they were in labour or in extreme pain could not constitute informed consent. [...] For it to be valid, consent must be clear and unequivocal and be given freely and voluntarily and not induced by fear, fraud or force. The Court held that written consent does not automatically equate to informed consent as the women did not understand what they were signing, and so the fact that the women had signed a consent form could not absolve the hospitals from responsibility.|$|R
30|$|Following initial practice-based {{research}} [12 – 15], the Surgical and Clinical Adhesions Research (SCAR) {{group has}} quantified the epidemiology and burden that adhesions pose to patients, surgeons and health services. The initial study followed up adhesion-related hospital readmissions in Scotland for 10  years in {{a cohort of}} patients undergoing open abdominal or pelvic surgery [16]. The SCAR Group found that over the study period, up to one in three patients were readmitted at least twice for adhesion-related problems (or other surgery potentially complicated by adhesions) and, moreover, the readmissions continued steadily throughout the 10  years. This research also indicated that patients undergoing open surgical procedures on the colon and rectum [17] and on the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus [4] were at most risk of adhesion-related readmissions. The SCAR group subsequently reported that for therapeutic and diagnostic laparoscopic procedures (i.e. all laparoscopic procedures undertaken {{with the exception of}} low-risk tubal <b>sterilisations),</b> the risk of adhesion-related readmission was comparable to that of gynaecological laparotomy [5]. The group concluded that despite advances in surgical technique, the burden of adhesion-related readmissions continues.|$|R
30|$|Data {{from two}} {{landmark}} epidemiological {{studies conducted in}} the UK, the Surgical and Clinical Adhesions Research (SCAR/SCAR- 2) studies, have shown that gynaecological surgery {{is associated with a}} substantial number of adhesion-related hospital re-admissions and requirements for repeat surgery [8, 13, 16]. In the SCAR study, more than 34 % of patients experienced at least one re-admission directly or possibly related to, or complicated by, adhesions within 10  years of an initial laparotomy in the abdominopelvic region [8]; 16 % of re-admissions in the gynaecological surgery cohort occurred within the first year [13]. The SCAR- 2 study followed-up gynaecological surgery undertaken in 1996 and established similar risks of adhesion-related re-admissions for laparoscopy (excluding <b>sterilisations)</b> and laparotomy (excluding hysterectomies) over a 4 -year follow-up period. Furthermore, a comparison of 2 -year adhesion-related re-admission rates for subsequent surgery conducted in 1997 and 1998 found little change, suggesting that adhesions represent an ongoing burden [16]. This burden represents substantial healthcare costs; one study in the USA estimated the total cost of adhesiolysis to be $ 1.33  billion in 1994 [12].|$|R
