5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is based on a}} chorale, but its style is different from the others.|$|E
5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term surface energy, which is a more general term in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> applies also to solids.|$|E
5|$|The Bronco Pep Band is a student-run band at Cal Poly Pomona. The band {{is a group}} {{within the}} {{athletic}} department. It follows the tradition of other student-run bands in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> focuses on its members individuality. The band attends athletic events during the year to encourage the school's athletic teams and audience support/involvement. The pep band is entirely voluntary and all students at Cal Poly Pomona or {{anyone else in the}} area are free to join.|$|E

5|$|The {{operations}} of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail {{but the way}} they cooperate in ensembles of millions {{is yet to be}} solved. Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.|$|E
5|$|This is an {{exhibition}} of contemporary art, not in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was done recently, but {{in that it is}} cased in the mentality, technology and philosophy of radical art of the most recent times. No one, other than the Aborigines of Australia, has succeeded in exhibiting such art at the Hermitage.|$|E
5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Oman cyclone (JTWC designation: 01A, officially {{known as}} Cyclonic Storm ARB 01) was an {{uncommon}} tropical cyclone that struck the Dhofar region of Oman in May 2002. The first storm of the 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed on May6 in the Arabian Sea, and it maintained a general west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration. The system reached cyclonic storm status on May9, meaning it attained winds of greater than 65km/h (40mph), and on May10 it made landfall near Salalah; shortly thereafter it dissipated. The storm was rare, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was one of only}} eleven tropical cyclones on record to approach the Arabian Peninsula in the month of May.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{are known}} for the great number of deities they honoured, a {{capacity}} that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples {{rather than try to}} eradicate them. One way that Rome promoted stability among diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous cults of pseudo-foreign gods (Roman reinventions of foreign gods) were cultivated at Rome and in the provinces, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for competing monotheistic systems.|$|E

5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} {{he learned}} about a federal dollar-for-dollar matching grant program. In his senior year and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. The fees were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> only assumes the fees from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals would approach a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may serve to urge self-reflection on many more {{members of the military}} of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E
