The three girls always worked in secret, unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p. m. with Don't <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> <b>late,</b> Girls!, then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.|$|E

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> <b>late.</b> I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Prior to recording, Green Day rented {{rehearsal}} {{space in}} Oakland. Armstrong invited Cavallo {{to attend the}} sessions and help guide their writing processes. Cavallo encouraged {{the idea of a}} concept album, recalling a conversation the two had a decade prior, in which Armstrong expressed his desire for their career to have a [...] "Beatles-like arc to their creativity." [...] During the group's sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> <b>late,</b> drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional prank calls. The band demoed the album sufficiently so that it would be completely written and sequenced before they went to record. Hoping to clear his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong traveled to New York City alone for a few weeks, renting a small loft in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions in the basement of Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. He began socializing with songwriters Ryan Adams and Jesse Malin. Many songs from the album were written based on his time in Manhattan, including [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and [...] "Are We the Waiting". While there, he also formulated much of the album's storyline, about people [...] "going away and getting the hell out, {{while at the same time}} fighting their own inner demons." ...|$|E

60|$|To <b>stay</b> <b>up</b> <b>late</b> {{into the}} night is always bad. Let us be as ideal as we may, when {{the sun goes down}} the natural mode of life changes in us. The mind changes its activity. As the soul {{gradually}} goes passive, before yielding up its sway, the mind falls into its second phase of activity. It collects the results of the spent day into consciousness, lays down the honey of quiet thought, or the bitter-sweet honey of the gathered flower. It is the consciousness of that which is past. Evening is our time to read history and tragedy and romance--all of which are the utterance of that which is past, that which is over, that which is finished, is concluded: either sweetly concluded, or bitterly. Evening is the time for this.|$|E
