Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The <b>priming</b> of <b>seed</b> is a process in which the seeds are placed in an osmotic solution for a determined period of time, dried down to original moisture content, then germinated. The osmotic solution, primarily glucose in this study, restricts the availability of water to the seed bringing it to a point just before, yet preventing, radicle emergence. Upon drying down, the seeds are at the same phase in the germination process, so upon contact with water the seeds germinate immediately and synchronously. The objectives of this study were twofold. First, to compare different osmotica as the priming solution, different oxygen concentrations in aerating the priming solution, and different durations of the priming process. Second, to determine what metabolic activities in the seed are affected by priming, especially those dealing with respiration and certain enzyme-catalyzed processes.

40|$|Maximum {{germination}} percentage achieves immediately after harvesting and gradually de#creases with storage time. Aging {{is one of}} the key factors in plant yield loss especially in vegetables. Seed aging is the main problem of seed storage. Application of accelerated aging treatment is used to assess seed vigor and quality. <b>Seed</b> <b>priming</b> enhances seed germination performance after aging. An experiment was conduct in order to investigate the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase during accelerated aging and repair during priming treatment of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seeds.

40|$|Premise of the study: Serotinous plants {{retain their}} seeds {{for a long}} time. In deserts, {{retained}} seeds undergo hydration-dehydration cycles and thus may become primed. Priming enhances germination and seedling vigor. We test the hypothesis that serotiny evolves because it provides a site protected from predators in which <b>seeds</b> can become <b>primed.</b> Rainfall-cued dispersal of <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> may enhance this effect. Methods: We tested this hypothesis with Mammillaria hernandezii through protein-content analyses; field and laboratory germination experiments with primed, unprimed, and retained seeds; and fitness estimations from demographic models. Key results: Hydration-dehydration cycles induced priming, enhancing germination. Artificial priming and retention in the parent plant for 1 yr induced similar changes in seed protein patterns, suggesting that priming occurs naturally while seeds are retained. Under field conditions, germination of seeds retained for 1 yr more than doubled that of seeds of the same cohort that were not primed or that remained buried for 1 yr. The first seeds to germinate died rapidly. Serotinous plants whose <b>seeds</b> underwent <b>priming</b> had higher fitness than those whose seeds were in the soil seed bank or that did not experience priming. Conclusions: <b>Priming</b> in soil <b>seed</b> banks may be costly because of high predation, so <b>seed</b> protection during <b>priming</b> is sufficient to promote the evolution of serotiny. Bet hedging contributes to this process. Rapid germination of <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> that respond to brief rainfall events is disadvantageous because such rainfall is insufficient for seedling survival. Serotinous species counteract this cost by cueing dispersal with heavy precipitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to examine the {{possibilities}} of obtaining <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> that maintain high germination quality and the same longevity as the untreated seeds. For Tall wheatgrass tested, {{we found that the}} desired longevity could be obtained by keeping the seeds under heat shock for a period of several hours, after a priming treatment. Decreasing germination and seedling vigour in BAP 25 and 50 ppm, for 24 priming, did not happen again due to such a treatment. In addition, following priming, heat shock affects the initial quality of <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> in some treatments. Optimal temperature was strongly duration dependent. The method was applied to obtain <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> without the loss of storability, which is similar to those procedures used to induce desiccation tolerance in germinated seeds and acquire thermo tolerance in plant vegetative tissues...|$|R
40|$|Conductivity was {{significantly}} increased by aging and decreased by osmopriming of maize (Zea mays L.) caryopses. Chloride, phosphate, and sulfate {{were the main}} anions that leaked out of maize seeds; their leakage was closely related to conductivity, increased by aging, and decreased by osmopriming. The anion leakage of isolated embryos correlated closely to seed vigor and was more sensitive to aging and priming {{than that of the}} whole seed. Anion leakage may be a more sensitive measure for seed vigor than bulk conductivity readings. Aging did not increase the sugar leakage of whole seeds but significantly increased the sugar leakage of isolated embryos. Sugar leakage was not closely related to total soluble sugar content of <b>seeds.</b> While <b>priming</b> decreased <b>seed</b> conductivity, the decreased anion and sugar leakage of the <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> was mainly caused by the washing effect during priming. The total anions or sugars left in the polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution after priming and in the conductivity solution of the <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> was almost the same as in the conductivity solution of the unprimed seeds alone...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Both the {{scientific}} community and society have shown interest in improving the content of amino acids, carbohydrates and mineral nutrients in maize because it represents an important staple food in many developing countries. Earlier studies demonstrated that the treatment of seeds using ascorbic acid (AsA-seed priming) enhanced soluble carbohydrates, proteins and soluble amino acids for other species. AsA <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> in maize showed the potential for reducing abiotic stresses. The effects on grain quality have not been previously demonstrated. This study investigated the impacts of AsA <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> on maize kernel quality of seeds produced by the plants generated from the primed seeds, based on the amino acid profile and carbohydrate and mineral nutrient contents. AsA <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> improved the maize kernel quality {{with respect to the}} ascorbate content, boron allocation, total carbohydrate content and increased soluble amino acid levels, including serine, tyrosine, alanine, valine, glutamate, arginine, proline, aspartate, lysine and isoleucine, whereas soluble methionine was decreased. Therefore, AsA <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> can represent a potential technique for improving maize grain quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> with osmoticum Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 in improving tolerance of soybean to drought stress. Green house factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted. Treatments consisted of five levels of <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> (dry seeds ??? untreated, PEG concentration: 0, 100, 200, 300 g L- 1 water, respectively) and three levels of drought stress treatments (100 % field capacity, 75 % field capacity and 50 % field capacity). Results showed that seedling growing from primed seeds differed significantly with respect to plant height increment, shoot/root ratio, chlorophyll content and protein content. However, <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> with PEG {{had no effect on}} relative growth rate (RGR), number of stomata, 100 grains weight and grain yield. Among the various concentration of PEG used, priming with 300 g PEG L- 1 water significantly increased chlorophyll content and protein content. Drought stress treatment applied significantly affected plant height, shoot-root ratio, chlorophyll and protein content. <b>Seed</b> <b>priming</b> and drought stress treatments proved to be significant with respect to shoot-root ratio, 100 grains weight, protein and chlorophyll content. Seeds treated with 300 g PEG L- 1 water demonstrated to be superior to the non-primed and all other primed seeds when water stress increased (50 % field capacity). The results indicate that <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> with PEG can improve plant growth in soybean by conferring more resistant seedlings to drought stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> with osmo and hormone priming on growth and seed reserve utilization of millet seeds under drought stress. Treatments were combinations of 4 levels of drought stress (0, - 4, - 8 and - 12 bar) and 3 levels of <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> and control with 3 replications. Results showed that with increase in drought stress, germination components such as germination percentage, germination index, mean time to germination, normal seedling percentage, seedling length, seedling dry weight, weight of utilized (mobilized) seed and seed reserve utilization efficiency decreased, but <b>seed</b> <b>priming</b> showed lower reduction. The highest germination characteristics and seed reserve utilization was obtained by priming in control conditions.

40|$|Many {{environmental}} factors {{are known to}} affect the success of priming, post-hydration drying being critical. Accumulated evidence shows that priming improves the quality of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) seeds. However, the effect of post-hydration drying on the their longevity remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of post-hydration drying speed on the emergence performance and antioxidative activities of <b>primed</b> bitter gourd <b>seeds</b> stored for 48 weeks. Results indicated that priming improved emergence percentage, mean emergence time and seedling growth of treated <b>seeds.</b> <b>Primed</b> <b>seeds</b> also showed lower peroxidation, {{as indicated by the}} accumulation of malondialdehyde (MIDA) and total peroxide, and higher total anti-oxidative activities (TAA) than non-primed seeds. The seeds receiving slow post-hydration drying treatment exhibited faster emergence and better seedling growth than the seeds receiving fast post-hydration drying treatment and the non-primed control. However, the longevity of slow-dried seeds decreased considerably during 48 weeks of storage as compared to that of non-primed and fast-dried seeds. Fast drying treatment maintained the longevity of <b>primed</b> <b>seeds</b> for up to 24 weeks as compared with non-primed control or slow-drying seeds. Improved longevity was due in part to enhanced TAA that minimized the accumulation of MDA and total peroxide during storage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve seed {{germination}} and establishment of wild trees for restoration and reforestation, the effects of <b>priming</b> on <b>seeds</b> from two populations of Buddleja cordata were studied. Seeds were hydroprimed or osmoprimed with polyethylene glycol (- 0. 3 MPa) in a 12 h daily photoperiod at 12 degreesC for 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 days. Priming treatments reduced germination percentages of seeds incubated in light at 25 degreesC and decreased mean germination time. Rates and synchrony of germination were highest in hydroprimed seeds from Ajusco and in osmoprimed <b>seeds</b> from Pedregal, <b>Primed</b> <b>seeds</b> from the least water-stressed site (Ajusco) germinated to higher percentages than those from the most water-stressed site (Pedregal). Further, osmoprimed seeds from both populations germinated to higher percentages than hydroprimed seeds, Increased synchrony and germination rate were retained in osmoprimed seeds (hydropriming not tested) from both populations when stored dry.
