However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory <b>for</b> <b>non-traffic</b> <b>purposes</b> (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|R

Indonesia is the largest aviation market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia is not yet a full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a descriptive {{analysis of the}} police arrest records for Muncie, Indiana, {{to determine if there}} was a decrease in the sex ratio of adults arrested <b>for</b> <b>non-traffic</b> violations from 1967 - 1970. The Muncie police arrest records were compared to the national arrest statistics as published in the Uniform Crime Report. The problems associated with absolute figures on the number r of arrests were avoided by considering the total population of Muncie and the nation. The results of the study showed that on the whole, Muncie followed the general national trend of a decreasing sex ratio of arrests. Although the general national trend was towards a decreasing sex ratio of arrests, there were a few years namely 1962, 1965, and 1966 in which the sex ratio of national arrests increased slightly. Further, Muncie's trend of a decreasing sex ratio of arrests was interruped in 1970 by a slight increase. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

They may issue Penalty Charge Notices for numerous offences (governed by Civil law), either via a hand-held device or CCTV. They may inspect and confiscate blue badges. They may interview motorists suspected of disabled badge fraud under caution. They may immobilise vehicles. Penalty charge notices are not criminal proceedings, {{and failure to}} pay will result in certificated bailiffs serving warrants of execution. They may issue penalties for several moving violations, among them driving in bus lanes, executing prohibited turns and driving the wrong way on a one way system. They may penalize for failure to display valid road tax. [...] Increasingly civil {{enforcement officers}} employed by some authorities issue fixed penalties <b>for</b> <b>non-traffic</b> offences using the Community Protection scheme of the Police Reform Act 2002. This range of offences include environmental crime such as fly-tipping and spitting, as well as anti-social behaviour like noise violations and truancy, in addition to issuing tickets for parking and traffic violations.|$|R
