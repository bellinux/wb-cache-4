This aging is commonly performed in used bourbon casks, but may also be performed in other types of wooden casks or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tanks.</b> The aging process determines the color of the rum.

50|$|Secondary {{fermentation}} is {{a process}} commonly associated with winemaking, which entails a second period of fermentation in a different vessel than the one used to start the fermentation process. An example {{of this would be}} starting fermentation in a carboy or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank</b> and then moving it over to oak barrels. Rather than being a separate, second fermentation, this is most often one single fermentation period that is conducted in multiple vessels. However, the term does also apply to procedures that could be described as a second and distinct fermentation period.|$|E

50|$|The Kamioka area of {{the city}} of Hida is home to the Kamioka Observatory {{underground}} laboratory. Located 1000 m underground in Kamioka Mining and Smelting Co.'s Mozumi Mine, the Super-Kamiokande experiment searches for neutrinos from the high atmosphere, the sun and supernovae, while the KamLAND experiment searches for antineutrinos from regional nuclear reactors. The Super-Kamiokande consists of a cylindrical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank</b> that is 41.4 m tall and 39.3 m in diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. Some of the 11,146 photomultiplier tubes are on display at the Miraikan in Tokyo. The same facility also hosts the CLIO prototype and KAGRA gravitational wave detector.|$|E
50|$|The Super-K {{is located}} 1000 m {{underground}} in the Mozumi Mine in Hida's Kamioka area. It {{consists of a}} cylindrical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank</b> that is 41.4 m tall and 39.3 m in diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. The tank volume is divided by a stainless steel superstructure into an inner detector (ID) region that is 33.8 m in diameter and 36.2 m in height and outer detector (OD) which consists of the remaining tank volume. Mounted on the superstructure are 11,146 photomultiplier tubes (PMT) 50 cm in diameter that face the ID and 1,885 20 cm PMTs that face the OD. There is a Tyvek and blacksheet barrier attached to the superstructure that optically separates the ID and OD.|$|E
50|$|The {{fermentation}} process {{takes place in}} open wooden tubs and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tanks.</b> The wine is matured in oak and tonneau barrels made from fine-pored French oak with a capacity of 225 or 500 litres.|$|R

50|$|Chemical tankers {{normally}} {{have a series}} of separate cargo tanks which are either coated with specialized coatings such as phenolic epoxy or zinc paint, or made from <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> The coating or cargo tank material determines what types of cargo a particular <b>tank</b> can carry: <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tanks</b> are required for aggressive acid cargoes such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid, while 'easier' cargoes — such as vegetable oil — can be carried in epoxy coated tanks. The coating or tank material also influences how quickly tanks can be cleaned. Typically, ships with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tanks</b> can carry a wider range of cargoes and can clean more quickly between one cargo and another, which justifies the additional cost of their construction.|$|R

According to DEP inspectors, they discovered a pool of clear liquid measuring approximately 400 sq ft in size outside of the damaged white <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank,</b> Number 396. DEP inspectors also stated that Freedom Industries' workers had set up one cinder block and a 50 lb bag of safety absorbent powder to stop the flow of the stream of leaking chemical.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{consisted}} of an aluminum grid with 54 vertical channels arranged in 6 rows by 9 channels wide. The channels {{could be used}} for fuel rods, experiments and additional uses. An additional 8 channels were used for control rods. [...] The core was contained in a cylindrical <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank</b> 2.4 meters in diameter and 7.3 meters tall. The core was surrounded by a heavy concrete shield which also served as a secondary containment vessel. [...] One of the configurations of the reactor had a 2.5 in lead gamma ray shield installed in the first row and 4 in beryllium blocks installed in row 6. This left rows 2 through 5 for installation of fuel and experimental usage. A typical core loading {{consisted of}} 33 fuel elements, each containing 236 grams of 93% enriched Uranium (when new).|$|E
5000|$|On 18 December 1958, {{the launch}} of Atlas 10B sent the missile into orbit around the Earth (without use of an upper stage) {{carrying}} the [...] "SCORE" [...] (Signal Communications by Orbiting Relay Equipment) communications payload. Atlas 10B/SCORE, at 8750 lb was the heaviest man-made object then in orbit, the first voice relay satellite, and the first man-made object in space easily {{visible to the naked}} eye due to the large, mirror-polished <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tank.</b> This was the first flight in what would be a long career for the Atlas as a satellite launcher. Many retired Atlas ICBMs would be used as launch vehicles, most with an added spin-stabilized solid rocket motor upper stage for polar orbit military payloads. Even before its military use ended in 1965, Atlas had placed four Project Mercury astronauts in orbit and was becoming the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles, most notably Atlas Agena and Atlas Centaur.|$|E
