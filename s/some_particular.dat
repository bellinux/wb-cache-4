5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about <b>some</b> <b>particular</b> issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in <b>some</b> <b>particular</b> sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to <b>some</b> <b>particular</b> aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjective}} indigenous {{is derived}} from the Latin word indigena, which is based on the root gen- 'to be born' with an archaic form of the prefix in 'in'.
