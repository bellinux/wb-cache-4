25|$|McGinn {{provided}} the RUC {{with a lot}} of information about IRA activities, and even betrayed Frank McCabe, the IRA commander behind the sniper campaign, but he eventually withdrew his statement. One of the key players in the British campaign against the South Armagh sniper was Welsh Guards' Captain Rupert Thorneloe, according to journalist Toby Harnden. Thorneloe worked as an intelligence liaison officer between the 3rd Infantry Brigade and the RUC Special Branch. Thorneloe, who reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, was killed in July 2009 by an improvised explosive device during the war in Afghanistan. Another senior figure involved in the British efforts against the sniper squads was SAS Staff Sergeant Gaz Hunter, whose experience in South Armagh dated back to 1975. Despite the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> among British forces after the arrests, there was concern over the other two Barrett rifles still in possession of the South Armagh Brigade.|$|E

25|$|Regular season {{dominance}} led to {{some success}} in the post-season. The Athletics' lone World Series championship of the era was a four-game sweep of the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series. Unfortunately for the A's, their sweep of the Giants was overshadowed by the Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred {{at the start of}} Game 3 before a national television audience. This forced the remaining games to be delayed for ten days. When play resumed, the atmosphere was dominated more by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> than celebration by baseball fans. Heavily favored Athletics teams lost the World Series in both 1988, to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in 1990, to the Cincinnati Reds. The latter was a shocking four-game sweep reminiscent of the A's loss to the Boston Braves 76 years earlier. The team began declining, winning the A.L. West championship in 1992 (but losing to Toronto in the ALCS), then finishing last in 1993.|$|E

Chernow explains that his plantation operations were only minimally profitable His lands in the west (Piedmont) yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians, and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent. [...] Washington attempted to sell off these holdings but failed to obtain the price that he desired. [...] Meanwhile, he was losing money at Mount Vernon due to a glut of unproductive slaves, which he declined to sell due to a desire to keep families intact.

500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Kelly Clarkson from her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, was released as the lead single from Breakaway {{two weeks before the}} album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sound with a mixture of soft and loud alternative rock sound. Martin originally wrote [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] with Pink in mind but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> with the end of her troubled relationship.|$|E

After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch as you do it unto them, you do it unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first movement, set to two beautiful verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E

[...] Influenced by hip-hop, it is primarily a ballad. The standard edition album closer, [...] "Rare", is a folk song accompanied by an acoustic guitar and galloping beat.

2500|$|Malbim {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure," [...] to mean that since the money being brought to Egypt {{from all over the}} world was only [...] "a treasure" [...] – that is, hidden away in the treasury until the time of the Exodus from Egypt, when it would become the Israelites' – the steward told the brothers that their treasure could remain in their sacks, for it made no sense to place it in Pharaoh's treasury, when it was destined for them in any case. Professor Nahum M. Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the steward's reassuring reply was intelligible only on the assumption that he was privy to Joseph's scheme. [...] His purpose was to lull the brothers into a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief.</b> Professor Robert Alter of University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the steward dismissed the brothers' fears by introducing a kind of fairy tale explanation for the silver that they found in their bags. But Professor Jon D. Levenson of Harvard Divinity School wrote that the steward sensed the hand of a beneficent Providence in the strange events.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has {{that same kind of}} edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint {{for the simple reason that}} I have to. I feel a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E

2500|$|People {{experiencing}} the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall {{one or more}} features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound and/or meaning. Individuals report {{a feeling of being}} seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> when the word is found. While many aspects of the tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence, the direct-access view and the inferential view. The direct-access view posits that the state occurs when memory strength is not enough to recall an item, but is strong enough to trigger the state. The inferential view claims that TOTs aren't completely based on inaccessible, yet activated targets; rather they arise when the rememberer tries to piece together different clues about the word. Emotional-induced retrieval often causes more TOT experiences than an emotionally neutral retrieval, such as asking where a famous icon was assassinated rather than simply asking the capital city of a state. Emotional TOT experiences also have a longer retrieval time than non-emotional TOT experiences. [...] The cause of this [...] is unknown but possibilities include using a different retrieval strategy when having an emotional TOT experience rather than a non-emotional TOT experience, fluency at the time of retrieval, and strength of memory.|$|E
2500|$|Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, {{believed}} the invasion could not succeed and doubted whether the German air force {{would be able}} to win control of the skies; nevertheless he hoped that an early victory in the Battle of Britain would force the UK government to negotiate, without any need for an invasion. Adolf Galland, commander of [...] fighters at the time, claimed invasion plans were not serious and that there was a palpable <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> in the [...] when it was finally called off. Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt also took this view and thought that Hitler never seriously intended to invade Britain and the whole thing was a bluff to put pressure on the British government to come to terms following the Fall of France. He observed that Napoleon had failed to invade and the difficulties that confounded him did not appear to have been solved by the Sea Lion planners. In fact, in November 1939, the German naval staff produced a study on the possibility of an invasion of Britain and concluded that it required two preconditions, air and naval superiority, neither of which Germany ever had. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz believed air superiority was not enough and admitted, [...] "We possessed neither control of the air or the sea; nor were we in any position to gain it." [...] Grand Admiral Erich Raeder thought it would be impossible for Germany to attempt an invasion until the spring of 1941; he instead called for Malta and the Suez Canal to be overrun so German forces could link up with Japanese forces in the Indian Ocean to bring about the collapse of the British Empire in the Far East, and prevent the Americans from being able to use British bases if the United States entered the war.|$|E

The mind was too exclusively occupied with itself--its own mind affairs. The cage was only recognised as a cage, an unsuitable habitation, when I was out of it. An example, this, of the eternal disharmony between the busy mind and nature--or Mother Nature, let us say; the more the mind is concentrated on its own business the blinder we are to the signals of disapproval on her kindly countenance, the deafer to her warning whispers in our ear.|$|R
