5000|$|In {{looking at}} {{various types of}} offenses, {{an example of a}} digital {{obscenity}} offense is child pornography. In the modern world of technology, many jurisdictions are reforming their laws to prevent the over-prosecution of sex offenders and focusing on crimes involving a victim. The term <b>sexual</b> <b>predator</b> is often used to describe a sex offender or any of the [...] "tier offenders"; however, only the category just below sexually-violent <b>sexual</b> <b>predator</b> is reserved for a severe or repeated sex offender: <b>sexual</b> <b>predator.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the United States, age {{of consent}} laws {{regarding}} sexual activity are {{made at the}} state level. There are several federal statutes related to protecting minors from <b>sexual</b> <b>predators,</b> but laws regarding specific age requirements for sexual consent are left to individual states, territories, and the District of Columbia. Depending on the jurisdiction, legal age of consent ranges from 16 to 18 years old. In some places, civil and criminal laws within the same state conflict with each other.|$|E

25|$|Operation Mango: An {{extensive}} {{investigation that}} closed down a beachside resort owned by U.S. citizens in Acapulco, Mexico, which offered children to <b>sexual</b> <b>predators.</b> The resort was {{a haven for}} pedophiles that traveled to the facility {{for the sole purpose}} of engaging in sex with minors. The proprietor of the business was convicted. As a result of this investigation and others, Mexico's federal government recently created a task force to address crimes against children in the country.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{raised the}} legal age of consent to 16 years. Justice minister Vic Toews proposed {{the bill in}} order to protect youth against <b>sexual</b> <b>predators.</b> The Tackling Violent Crime Act took effect on 1 May 2008, making the current age of consent 16. A close in age exemption allows teenagers aged 14 and 15 to engage in sexual acts with partners who are less than 5 years older than them. Before this law, the age of consent was 14 (it had been set at 14 in 1890, before that date it was 12).|$|E
25|$|The {{questionable}} conversations, {{which took}} place between 1995 and 2005, were investigated by the FBI for possible criminal violations. In September 2008, Florida officials investigating Foley decided not to charge him, citing a lack of evidence and the expiration of the statute of limitations. The House Ethics Committee investigated {{the response of the}} House Republican leadership and their staff to earlier warnings about Foley's conduct. In early October 2006, two news organizations anonymously quoted former pages who said that they had sexual liaisons with Foley after turning 18 and 21. Foley was chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which introduced legislation targeting <b>sexual</b> <b>predators</b> and created stricter guidelines for tracking them.|$|E

25|$|Kurt Alexander Eichenwald (born June 28, 1961) is an American {{journalist}} {{who serves as}} a senior writer with Newsweek, a contributing editor with Vanity Fair and a New York Times bestselling author of four books, one of which, The Informant (2000), {{was made into a}} motion picture in 2009. He was formerly a writer and investigative reporter with The New York Times and later with Condé Nast's business magazine, Portfolio. Eichenwald had been employed by The New York Times since 1986 and primarily covered Wall Street and corporate topics such as insider trading, accounting scandals, and takeovers, but also wrote about a range of issues including terrorism, the Bill Clinton pardon controversy, Federal health care policy, and <b>sexual</b> <b>predators</b> on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, McDonnell ran for {{attorney}} general. He campaigned on issues including protecting children from <b>sexual</b> <b>predators,</b> drug enforcement, identity theft, gang violence, and terrorism. The first result showed {{him with a}} victory of 323 votes, out of over 1.9 million votes cast, over his opponent, Democratic State Senator Creigh Deeds. Deeds filed for a recount, which began on December 20, 2005. A court decision limited the recount to just recompiling vote totals instead of examining individual optically scanned ballots. After preliminary figures revealed 37 more votes for McDonnell and that Deeds could not make up the difference, he conceded the next day, giving McDonnell a 323-vote margin of victory. McDonnell outspent Deeds {{in the general election}} by nearly $1 million. He was inaugurated on January 14, 2006, in Williamsburg, along with Democratic Governor Tim Kaine and Republican Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling.|$|E
25|$|Children {{also face}} dangers online such as {{cyberbullying}} and approaches by <b>sexual</b> <b>predators,</b> who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material {{which they may}} find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable Internet filtering, and/or supervise their children's online activities, {{in an attempt to}} protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.|$|E

25|$|Privacy {{concerns}} with social networking services {{have been raised}} growing concerns among users {{on the dangers of}} giving out too much personal information and the threat of <b>sexual</b> <b>predators.</b> Users of these services also {{need to be aware of}} data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.|$|E
25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to <b>sexual</b> <b>predators,</b> cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E

According to Beattie, youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online <b>sexual</b> <b>predators</b> to increase regulation of the Internet; characterizing children as infantile evoked a concept of innocence which {{was a form of}} obsession over the concept of purity.|$|E

Authorities of the Swiss canton of Valais claimed that Raëlians support a doctrine of [...] "complete sexual liberty", and they denied an application by Raël to live in their area. The website Raelianews.org denied that sexual freedom between consenting adults in any way implies pedophilia.|$|E

500|$|On August 24, 2009, Garrido {{visited the}} San Francisco {{office of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and left a four-page essay {{containing}} his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other <b>sexual</b> <b>predators</b> by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E

While the results of the system evaluation on the training collection are nice, the test run results for the official <b>Sexual</b> <b>Predator</b> Identification sub-task have shown much room for improvement. ...|$|R
