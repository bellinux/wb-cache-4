50|$|The {{mining sector}} of Ashanti region is predominated by gold mining with Ashanti region {{possessing}} {{an array of}} gold mines concessions and vast gold deposits as the Ashanti region private-gold mining revenues including galamsey revenues {{is estimated to be}} ₵4.3 trillion (₵4,394,000,000,000) annually from gold mining with over 90% of the countries gold mining-output originates from underground mining (hard rock) mines and underground mining (soft rock) mines and surface mines and open-pit mines in the Ashanti region. However, an increasing portion of Ashanti region's remaining 10% of gold mining-output is from small-scale miners as means of self-employment in Ashanti region as the majority (58.7%) of the Ashanti region workforce are <b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> <b>employees.</b> Following a legislation legalizing unregistered gold mining (referred to as galamsey in Ashanti region) there has been a large {{increase in the number of}} small-scale mining operations as means of self-employment in Ashanti region which do not extract gold in such environmentally friendly ways. The legislation was enacted to prevent illegal gold extraction which it claimed constituted 20% of Ashanti region's total gold mining-output and thus a major decrease in the Ashanti region's potential revenues from gold mining.

5000|$|When {{personal}} preference {{and the amount}} of time spent working do not align, both men and women experience a decrease in subjective well-being. The negative effect of working more or working less than preferred has been found across multiple studies, most finding that working more than preferred (over-employed) is more detrimental, but some found that working less (under-employed) is more detrimental. Most individuals' levels of subjective well-being returned to [...] "normal" [...] (level previous to time mismatch) within one year. Levels remained lower only when individuals worked more hours than preferred for a period of two years or more, which may indicate that it is more detrimental to be over-employed than under-employed in the long-term. Employment status effects are not confined to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed. Becoming self-employed can increase subjective well-being, given the right conditions. Those who leave work to become self-employed report greater life satisfaction than those who work for others or become self-employed after unemployment; this effect increases over time. Those who are self-employed and have employees of their own report higher life-satisfaction than those who are <b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> <b>employees,</b> and women who are <b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> <b>employees</b> report a higher life satisfaction than men in the same condition.|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} of self-employed and family workers since 2002 can be mainly {{attributed to the}} {{increase of}} <b>self-employed</b> workers <b>without</b> <b>employees</b> (Solo-Selbstständige). In 2014, their share was 56 [*]%. The increase of <b>self-employed</b> workers <b>without</b> <b>employees</b> is supported by government aid. It can be assumed that one part of this increase {{can be attributed to}} the intensified use of labour market policy instruments, like interim payment (Überbrückungsgeld) and grants for business start-ups (Existenzgründungszuschuss). Since 2006, these labour market policy instruments are combined as start-up subsidies (Gründungszuschuss). However, since 2011, the financial support of the BA for self-employed workers declined considerably.|$|R

30|$|The {{working time}} of {{self-employed}} workers and family workers exceeds the annual hours worked of employees to a great extent. In 2014, self-employed and family workers performed on average 1973 h. In the 1990 s their annual working time was on average 320  h higher, but since 2001 it declines. This decline {{is due to}} the increasing share of <b>self-employed</b> workers <b>without</b> <b>employees,</b> with one third of them working part-time. As a result the part-time rate among self-employed workers strongly increased. One reason for this increase is the larger use of subsidized founding until 2011. Recent studies show that the working time in those newly founded establishments is lower than among traditional self-employed workers, and that self-employment in part-time seemed to be realised with this instrument (cf. Caliendo et al. 2009). Other studies also show that the foundation process in Germany seems to change from self-employment in full-time to part-time self-employment (cf. Brenke 2013).|$|R

40|$|There is a {{controversial}} debate whether the Institutions of western welfare-states like the Social Insurance, Health and Safety Standards or Wage Agreements are still corresponding with {{new forms of}} employment. Because {{of the rise of}} Non-Standard-Employment and the growing autonomy of employees it is argued that there is no scope for collective and solidary arrangements of workers anymore. Contrary to this, in this paper it is argued that autonoumous forms of work organization open up new possibilities for collective arrangements in work-policy, based on the principals of welfare state. In this context, autonoumus forms of work-organization are defined as specific forms of the so called "Arbeitskraftunternehmer", a figure discussed in recent german literature. The work focuses on the group of own-account-workers, defined as <b>self-employed</b> persones <b>without</b> <b>employees,</b> that is seen in part of the literature as a prototyp of future workforms. The example of a network of own-account workers, that is examined in this paper, shows how collective solutions of autonoumus actors can look like.

30|$|Along {{with the}} growth of low pay, this more {{widespread}} use of non-standard contracts is a major feature of labour market duality in Germany. The increase in ‘atypical’ jobs is partly due to sectoral change in favour of private service sector jobs, but it was also facilitated by some deregulation of legal provisions governing those jobs. Particularly striking is the massive {{increase in the number of}} part-time workers covered by social insurance and regulations that standardize working conditions. Additionally there has been an expansion of marginal part-time work with gross earnings up to 450  EUR per month. The latter can be attributed to a peculiar emerging employment pattern in some private services in reaction to the availability and expansion of the Minijob arrangement. Fixed-term contracts have remained at a medium level over recent years, with rates at about 7 – 8 [*]% of total employment (excluding about the same share of fixed-term apprenticeship contracts). Increased dynamism is behind the development of temporary agency work, although it is still a quite small segment of the labour market with about 2.5 [*]% of total employment. The expansion of agency work is mostly due to substantial reforms and related restructuring of companies in the manufacturing sector since the mid- 2000 s. Quite notably, finally, is the increase in the number of <b>self-employed</b> people <b>without</b> <b>employees.</b>|$|R

30|$|This insight {{still holds}} when {{performing}} {{a number of}} robustness checks. First of all, {{it could be argued}} that comparing average earnings is not very meaningful given that entrepreneurial earnings are distinctly positively skewed (although taking logs somewhat alleviates the problem). Thus, I also conducted decompositions of the median earnings differential, utilizing the concept of RIF regression as described in Fortin et al. (2011). For this, one can run usual OLS regressions and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions, but the dependent variable is replaced by the recentered influence function (RIF) of its median. 20 The results of the respective Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions are displayed in columns 2 and 4 of Table  4. Several other robustness checks are not reported in tables but are available on request: Instead of paid employees, I used the self-employed as the reference group; I excluded extreme values of the logarithmic hourly earnings distribution (higher than the 75  % quantile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range and lower than the 25  % quantile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range, respectively); I used “exposure to risk” instead of “strained by risk”; I additionally included 12 occupational area dummies; I included dummies for each possible answer category of the working conditions instead of binary variables, thus using all available variation in working conditions; I included the variables used as exclusion restrictions, i.e., age and self-employment of parents, directly (instead of the inverse Mill’s ratios) or just dropped the inverse Mill’s ratios (without replacing them with the exclusion restrictions); I used monthly instead of hourly earnings as the dependent variable and controlled for logarithmic working hours; finally, I differentiated between solo <b>self-employed</b> (i.e., <b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> any other <b>employees)</b> and self-employed who also employ other workers. By and large, the contribution of working conditions also remained insignificant and/or inconsistent with the idea of compensating differentials in these cases, the only exception being “pressure and overstrain”, which was small but positive statistically significant in the case of female solo self-employed.|$|R

The main aims are to estimate returns to education and to identify, conditioned on education and labour market experience, earnings differentials by gender and across sectors (public, private and informal). We confirm the general pattern that returns to education are increasing in level and years of education but note differences across sector of employment and the earnings distribution. Public sector workers (who {{tend to be more}} educated with longer tenure) and the self-employed with employees (small and micro enterprises) have the highest earnings whereas informal sector (<b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> <b>employees)</b> and private sector wage earners have similar earnings on average (except for wage earners in large firms who have considerably higher earnings). Post-primary education is important in determining selection into wage employment, especially for the public sector.

Despite this achievement, there is concern rapid expansion has put pressure on school systems at the cost of quality. Focusing on the West African country of Ghana, whereas the proportion of children age 6 - 17 years having ever attended school rose by 10 % between 1991 and 2006, basic school completion has remained constant at approximately 50 %. Consequently, research needs to take a wider definition of educational access and extend focus beyond initial engagement and consider appropriate progression. This paper employs multilevel level models to examine the association between basic school completion and secondary school attendance of adolescents with maternal employment in urban Ghana. Data comes from a sample of the 2010 Ghanaian Population and Housing Census.

40|$|Inspirés par les explications « pull » et « push » de la résurgence du travail {{autonome}} dans les années 1980 et 1990, nous proposons un modèle inédit de l’entrée dans le travail autonome et une évaluation de sa pertinence à partir des résultats d’une enquête originale via l’Internet auprès de 748 travailleurs autonomes québécois. La principale hypothèse de notre modèle propose que le passage au travail autonome découle le plus souvent d’une décision motivée à la fois par des aspirations personnelles et professionnelles spécifiques et par des conditions d’emploi précaires ou insatisfaisantes. Les résultats de notre étude exploratoire confirment la pertinence de notre hypothèse quant à l’influence combinée des facteurs « push » et « pull » sur la décision d’entrer dans le travail autonome. Elle révèle néanmoins des différences significatives entre les déterminants des décisions des hommes et des femmes. In Canada, in Quebec, {{and in most}} industrialized countries, self-employment {{showed more}} rapid growth during the 1980 s and 1990 s than did full-time, salaried employment. The authors wonder {{how it is possible}} to explain the strong growth of this employment status, {{especially in the case of}} <b>self-employed</b> <b>without</b> <b>employees,</b> bearing in mind the fewer benefits and lower remuneration for those in this largest category of self-employed workers. Is this increased transition to self-employment a free choice which is also an obvious one for workers having a different set of goals, or rather is it a choice that was imposed by the worsening of conditions on the labour market?Based on the “pull” and “push” explanations for the resurgence of self-employment, the authors propose a previously unpublished model for the transition to this employment status, and then an evaluation of this model’s relevance, beginning with an original Internet investigation involving 748 Quebec self-employed workers. The main hypothesis of the authors’ model suggests that the choice of self-employment is, most often, the result of both personal goals and of precarious or unsatisfactory working conditions. The results of their exploratory study confirm the relevance of this hypothesis as regards the combined influence of “push” and “pull” factors and suggest that is not very appropriate to describe the transitions towards self-employment in Quebec as voluntary or as involuntary. Instead, the results point out the complexity of the motivations and of the circumstances leading up to this decision. Regression analysis clearly show the relevance of several hypothesis which underlie the models studied, and also the relevance of several vectors of variables used to verify these hypotheses. The model that takes into account prior workplace experience seems to be the most convincing and more clearly explains the more or less voluntary nature of the decision to choose self-employment. This prior experience has the greatest impact on early nature of the decision to join the ranks of the self-employed, as do several career anchors. These career goals as well as an individual’s status and working conditions prior to the transition to self-employment appear as the vectors of variables that contribute the most to explaining the more or less voluntary nature of the decision to opt for this atypical employment status. Responsibility for young children also plays a role in the same way. However, the effect of human capital on the voluntary nature of the decision to become self-employed is significant, but the opposite of what was predicted. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that the determinants of the more or less voluntary entry of women into self-employment are significantly different from those of men. For men, human capital, and status prior to self-employment explain twice as great a proportion of the dependent variable than is the case for women. The impact of prior status on the degree of voluntarism of entry into self-employment corresponds quite well to our model’s hypothesis, notably in the case of men. Unemployment, a part-time or temporary job, or work experience involving a poor working climate and limited possibilities for advancement give rise to a more involuntary transition towards self-employment. For women, whose work experience is generally more limited, the results obtained are different. Prior experience in a part-time or temporary job is usually associated with voluntary entry into self-employment. For the latter, career goals and access to the revenue from a spouse, or from family or from government assistance stand out as the main determinants. The career goal vector accounts for a 50 %– 80 % greater proportion of the dependant variable than it does in the case of males, while access to other revenues does not have a significant impact on accounting for decisions made by men. If, in both cases, the autonomy anchor is associated with a more voluntary transition to self-employment, and the professional and personal security anchor is associated with a more involuntary transition, the voluntary nature of women’s decisions will be also increased by the variety-creativity anchor and the service anchor, and lessened by the technical competencies anchor, while, for men, only managerial competencies anchor will have an additional positive impact on their decision. This study of more or less voluntary passages to self-employment is exploratory due to the specific and original nature of its inquiry and also because of the dependant variable that was selected. The methodology has certain limits, which call for a careful and cautious interpretation of results and encourage the undertaking of other complementary studies to confirm or invalidate the results obtained. Longitudinal studies of the transitions into and then out of self-employment should allow us to better understand the circumstances as well as the characteristics of those who live this experience.
