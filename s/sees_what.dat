On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E
25|$|After {{the test}} subject has seen {{and responded to}} all of the inkblots (free {{association}} phase), the tester then presents them again one at a time in a set sequence for the subject to study: the subject is asked to note where he <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> he originally saw and what makes it look like that (inquiry phase). The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them. Whether the cards are rotated, and other related factors such as whether permission to rotate them is asked, may expose personality traits and normally contributes to the assessment.|$|E

After Ali <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> appears to be her dead mother and Detective Wilden, she starts to question her sanity and checks herself into the same hospital Charlotte attended. Spencer, Toby and Mona work together to catch Sara, but instead they find old medical records for a woman named Mary Drake, and {{she was the one who}} gave birth to Charles while a patient at the Radley (now a hotel managed by Ashley Marin) 25 years ago, the DiLaurentis family adopted Charles as she was unable to take care of him.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side of the house, Pam leads Vic into the garden toward a pond with a statue of Ellen in it. She {{suddenly}} disappears. When Vic looks down into the pond, he <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> he believes to be Pam's dead body. He attempts to pull her out of the water, but the body vanishes and he is left clutching only her nightgown. He panics and runs back toward the house. Looking back, he sees the statue come to life and has a heart attack. Vic tries to draw the attention of Emery (who is inside the house), but Emery again believes this to be an apparition and refuses to open the window. Nick arrives and tries to open the window, but it will not open and the glass cannot be broken. Vic collapses and dies in full view of Emery and Nick. Out in the woods, Mrs. Waterman is stopped and knocked unconscious by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E

Manon follows them, and when she <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> the two are doing, [...] understands and gives out a shriek. The men hear it, but quickly dismiss the sound as that of a buzzard making a kill. As Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the cold water of the spring, the film ends with the caption [...] "end of part one".|$|E

When Lisa <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> Bart has done with her project, she is annoyed. She asks Marge for help, who suggests she run a hamster through a maze. Lisa takes the idea to heart, but instead of just testing the intelligence of a mammal, she pits the hamster against [...] Bart to find out who is smarter. After two simple tests, the hamster leads two to zero.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Dinklage {{starred in}} the comedy horror film Knights of Badassdom {{opposite}} Ryan Kwanten and Steve Zahn. The film is about three best friends that go to the woods and reenact a live action Dungeons & Dragons role play, when they mistakenly conjure up a demon from Hell. The same year, he played the villain Bolivar Trask in the superhero film [...] The movie was the sixth highest-grossing film of 2014 with global revenues of $747.9 million. In preparation for his role, Dinklage stated {{that he did not}} want to approach the character necessarily as a villain, saying that Trask [...] "actually <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> he's doing as a good thing". He also voiced the AI Ghost in the 2014 video game Destiny, but was replaced by Nolan North in August 2015.|$|E
500|$|Now {{in the key}} of G (two semitones {{down from}} the Get Back performance), [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] begins [...] "dirge"-like with a two-note pedal point {{provided}} by layers of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Only at the one-minute mark, {{at the start of}} verse two, does the rhythm section come in, after which the instruments begin to [...] "break out of their metronomic straitjacket to attain an almost ecstatic release", as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner put it in 1977. The [...] "balmy" [...] slide guitar passage, supported by Barham's string section, follows this second verse, and from that point on – around 2:38 – the same, circular chord structure continues for the remaining four-and-a-half minutes of the song. The long fade-out <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> Schaffner termed the [...] "pseudo-symphonic tension" [...] burst into a frenzy of brass and timpani, further bottleneck soloing, and the [...] "What a pity" [...] mantra joined by [...] "Hey Jude"-style [...] "Na-na-na-na" [...] chorus.|$|E
500|$|Brooklynne Kelly Peters from Blast Magazine praised Anna Torv's acting, {{because she}} [...] "brings a {{sensitivity}} to Olivia's character that is heart-wrenching but so well integrated into her character that action scenes seem totally natural for her". The standout for her however, was John Noble's performance, as he played [...] "lovable and brilliant" [...] Walter and [...] "chillingly conniving" [...] Walternate, {{both of which}} makes him [...] "an even more unforgettable character" [...] as the audience <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> Walter could have been. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing that [...] "the third season of Fringe opened tonight {{with one of the}} strongest, boldest episodes in the whole run of the series". Murray especially praised the [...] "well-written, acted and photographed" [...] taxi scenes between Olivia and Henry. The Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson particularly enjoyed the nine-minute opening, writing that he loved the episode because of three reasons: Olivia [...] "kicked butt" [...] and stayed a step ahead of Walternate, her struggles with identity, and all of the careful details put into the parallel universe.|$|E

500|$|Down on {{his luck}} and starved for inspiration, Lisa {{recommends}} Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals. As Marge and Homer kiss each other on the roof of their house Jasper Johns comes on a boat and steals the painting Marge was painting.

500|$|... "Dazzling Blue" [...] {{is based}} on his {{relationship}} with wife Edie Brickell, and the title references her favorite color. [...] "The CAT scan's eye <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> the heart's concealing", sang Simon over African cadences and Indian tablas, before marvelling at how his wife and he [...] "were born beneath a star of dazzling blue". He said the song {{reminded him of his}} work as a part of Simon & Garfunkel. [...] "Rewrite" [...] features segments of recordings made on a small digital recorder by Brickell on a 2009 family trip together in Kenya. Simon was frustrated over the guitar tone in his song and attached the sound of a wildebeest to a certain guitar note each time it occurred, in an effort to create an interesting sound. The song contains nighttime ambience recorded during the trip. It was written about a burned out Vietnam veteran imagining that he could rewrite his life, in order to give it a happy ending. [...] "Love and Hard Times" [...] is an affirmation of love for Brickell. The beginning of the song references “God and his only son” visiting Earth. Simon noted that the song’s thesis is being thankful at the highest level. The track contains orchestral arrangement from Gil Goldstein, which was recorded at Avatar Studios, as Ramone wanted a larger room to record in.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E

Later, in January 2014 in an interview with BBC World, Gülen said [...] "If I were to say anything to people I may say people should vote for those who are respectful to democracy, rule of law, who get on well with people.

2500|$|Sometimes {{the same}} {{dictionary}} can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary is [...] "at war with itself": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít (she'll tear me apart when she <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> I've {{done to the}} car). Whereas hi taharóg otí, literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.|$|E
2500|$|Jaspers {{set down}} his views on mental illness in a book which he {{published}} in 1913, General Psychopathology. This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers's central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of psychosis) by their form rather than by their content. For example, in diagnosing a hallucination, {{it is more important}} to note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them, than to note what the patient <b>sees.</b> <b>What</b> the patient sees is the [...] "content", but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the [...] "form".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{contrast}} is between Emile Blondet and Raoul Nathan. Both are multi-talented men-of-letters. Blondet {{is the natural}} son of the prefect of Alençon and is described as witty but lazy, incurably hesitant, non-partisan, a political atheist, a player of the game of political opinions (along with Rastignac), having the most judicious mind of the day. He marries Madame de Montcornet and eventually becomes a prefect. Nathan is described as half-Jewish and possessing a second-rate mind. Nathan succumbs to the flattery of unscrupulous financiers and does not {{see that they are}} prepared to bankrupt him to achieve their purposes. Blondet <b>sees</b> <b>what</b> is happening but does not enlighten Nathan. The downfall drives Nathan to attempt suicide by the method of [...] "any poor work-girl". He then sells out to the government of the day (on Blondet's advice) to secure an income, and returns to living with the actress/courtesan Florine. In the end he accepts the cross of the Legion of Honour (which he formerly satirised) and becomes a defender of the doctrine of heredity.|$|E
