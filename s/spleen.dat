5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, <b>spleen</b> and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads).

40|$|ABSTRACT Marek’s disease (MD) is a viral neoplas-tic {{disease of}} {{chickens}} caused by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), which is {{serious threat to}} worldwide poultry industry. Our previous studies showed that CD 30 gene was hypomethylated in MD lymphoma. In this study, we further analyzed differential expression patterns and methylation levels of CD 30 gene between MDV-infected and noninfected <b>spleens</b> at 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d postinfection (dpi). The {{results showed that the}} expres-sion of CD 30 in MDV-infected <b>spleens</b> was significantly lower than that in noninfected <b>spleens</b> at 4 dpi. The expression of CD 30 did not present significant differ-ence between MDV-infected and noninfected <b>spleens</b> at 7 and 14 dpi. However, an increased expression of CD 30 was presented in MDV-infected <b>spleens</b> at both 21 and 28 dpi. Simultaneously, CD 30 showed a lower DNA methylation level in MDV-infected <b>spleens</b> at 14, 21, and 28 dpi. The results indicated that CD 30 gene was involved in the whole process of MD tumorigenesis and upregulated expression of CD 30 in MDV-infected <b>spleens</b> might be attributed to the hypomethylation of promoter of CD 30 gene...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the number of E-RFC and the in vitro {{response}} to PHA and ConA were determined for lymphocytes obtained from <b>spleens</b> and lymph nodes of untreated HD patients. The results were correlated with tissue involvement and with the histological pattern of the disease. Our investigation has revealed: (1) involved <b>spleens</b> and lymph nodes contained {{a higher percentage of}} T-lymphocytes than uninvolved tissues. The differences was statistically significant for lymph nodes. (2) A statistically significant correlation was not found between T-lymphocyte numbers and histology. (3) Lymphocytes from uninvolved <b>spleens</b> were significantly more reactive to both mitogens than cells from involved <b>spleens</b> and control non-neoplastic <b>spleens</b> as well. (4) Similar results were obtained with lymph node lymphocytes; however, a significant difference was observed only when cells were stimulated with ConA. (5) The difference in proliferative response between uninvolved and involved tissues was maximally expressed in MC and progressively decreased in NS and LP. (6) T-cell enrichment does not alter the difference between uninvolved and involved <b>spleens.</b> (7) Cells from uninvolved and involved <b>spleens,</b> cultured for 24 hours, maintained unchanged their proliferative capacity. In this study evidence is provided that in HD T-lymphocytes from uninvolved tissues are characterized by an increased reactivity in mitogens, whereas cells from involved tissues are normally responsive...|$|R

5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the <b>spleen.</b> To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the <b>spleen.</b> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.

40|$|<b>Spleens</b> from W/Fu rats {{bearing a}} syngeneic {{progressively}} growing (C 58 NT) D tumor contain cells which can inhibit lymphoproliferative responses in a mixed lymphocyte-tumor interaction designed to demonstrate suppressor activity. <b>Spleens</b> from rats having rejected (C 58 NT) D tumors also contained suppressor cells {{but to a}} lesser degree. The growth inhibition assay, which measures inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells, was evaluated as a simple assay system to screen for suppressor cell activity. The effector cells in both assays had the same characteristics, indicating a predominant role of macrophages. Normal rat <b>spleens</b> were found to contain growth inhibition activity {{which led to the}} demonstration of suppressor cell activity in <b>spleens</b> of normal animals.

40|$|AbstractBackground/objectiveHematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplant}} (HSCT) {{is the only}} curative treatment for myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis (MPN-MF). The main clinical manifestation of MPN-MF is splenomegaly secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The effects of HSCT on splenic EMH and associated vascular and stromal changes are unknown. This study compares the findings seen in <b>spleens</b> following HSCT with those of nontransplanted patients, normal controls, and matched bone marrow (BM) samples. MethodsThis study included three transplanted MPN-MF <b>spleens,</b> three nontransplanted MPN-MF <b>spleens,</b> and three normal controls. <b>Spleens</b> were assessed for: (a) presence/extent of EMH; (b) presence of Gamna–Gandy bodies; (c) splenic fibrosis; (d) CD 34 -positive microvessel density; (e) CD 8 -positive sinusoids; (f) frequency of smooth muscle actin-positive myoid cells; and (g) nerve growth factor receptor-positive adventitial reticulum cells. In two cases, matched BM samples were assessed for cellularity, presence of atypical megakaryocytes, and fibrosis. ResultsCompared with normal controls, all MPN-MF <b>spleens</b> were larger in size, had EMH, red pulp fibrosis, higher CD 34 -positive microvessel density, and decreased CD 8 -positive sinusoids. Compared with nontransplanted cases, post-HSCT <b>spleens</b> showed disappearance or reduction of EMH. Gamna–Gandy bodies were increased; no differences in the remaining parameters were found. A reduction of splenic EMH was associated with normalization of BM cellularity and megakaryopoiesis. ConclusionHSCT reduces/abrogates splenic EMH and is {{associated with an increased}} number of Gamna–Gandy bodies, which may suggest vascular damage. The lack of stromal changes in <b>spleens</b> removed shortly after transplant is in line with similar observations in the BM, where a longer interval is often necessary for resolution of fibrosis...|$|R
5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy.
