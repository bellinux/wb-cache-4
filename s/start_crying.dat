25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would <b>start</b> <b>crying</b> every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again <b>start</b> <b>crying.</b>|$|E

500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to <b>start</b> <b>crying.</b> David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would <b>start</b> <b>crying</b> onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
