25|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{can provide}} rapid {{feedback on the}} progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may {{be able to do the}} same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (<b>servos).</b> The coating and <b>servos</b> are built on a metal skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.|$|E

25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic flight control system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the <b>servos,</b> causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic flight control system that could have revealed the problem. The Finnish authorities were also criticized for insufficient supervision.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectro-hydraulic <b>servo</b> valve is {{a typical}} {{complicated}} multi-domain system constituted by mechanical, electric, hydraulic and magnetic components, which is widely used in electro-hydraulic <b>servo</b> systems such as construction machinery, heavy equipment, weapon and so forth. The traditional method of modeling and simulation of <b>servo</b> valve is based on block diagram or signal flow, which cannot describe the <b>servo</b> valve system from components level nor be used in modeling and simulation of overall <b>servo</b> systems. In the procedure of traditional method, computational causality must be involved in modeling of <b>servo</b> valve, which is inconvenient to execute modification on components or parameters. Modelica is an object-oriented modeling language which is suited for large, complex, heterogeneous and multi-domain systems. The key features of Modelica are multi-domain, object-oriented and non-causal, which are suitable for modeling of <b>servo</b> valve and make the model readable, reusable, and easy to modify. The simulation results show similar curves with traditional method. This new <b>servo</b> valve modeling and simulation method can provide the engineers a more efficient way to design and optimize a <b>servo</b> valve and an overall <b>servo</b> system...|$|R

5000|$|Embedded <b>servo</b> or wedge <b>servo</b> {{is a type}} of <b>servo</b> {{configuration}} used on hard disks. Embedded <b>servo</b> systems embed {{the feedback}} signals for the read/write head positioner (usually a voice coil motor) inside gaps (wedges) in the data tracks of the disk. This setup allows the entire set of platters to be used, instead of having to reserve one or two surfaces for the <b>servo's</b> use, which makes more space for data available on the drive. Embedded <b>servo</b> was originally developed in the 1970s, and started to appear on mass-market hard drives for personal computers in the late 1980s.|$|R
25|$|Industrial {{robotics}} is a sub-branch in {{the industrial}} automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include; machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few. Industrial robots utilizes various mechanical, electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision, accuracy and speed that far exceeds any human performance. The birth of industrial robot came shortly after World War II as United States saw {{the need for a}} quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods. <b>Servos,</b> digital logic and solid state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and overtime these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance.|$|E
25|$|By the 12th {{century the}} only known bourgeois were the {{multinational}} inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition {{of a number of}} liberties. In the country, most people were freemen, peasants, artisans, or infantrymen, who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of servitude. Finally, <b>servos,</b> libertos, and pueros (serfs and slaves), either obtained in war with the Moors or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (domesticos and scancianes), shepherds, and farmhands.

500|$|Another way {{in which}} {{languages}} convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as [...] "I love you" [...] is meaningful, but [...] "*love you I" [...] is not. Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning. For example, in English, the two sentences [...] "the slaves were cursing the master" [...] and [...] "the master was cursing the slaves" [...] mean different things, because {{the role of the}} grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus <b>servos</b> vituperabat and <b>Servos</b> vituperabat dominus mean [...] "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because <b>servos,</b> or [...] "slaves", is in the accusative case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or [...] "master", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.|$|E

40|$|Pneumatic <b>servo</b> {{systems are}} applied in several {{industrial}} applications and {{have also been}} studied extensively {{for the purposes of}} compensating the nonlinearity of pneumatic <b>servo</b> systems and improving the controllability with robust control.

However, the characteristic of a <b>servo</b> valve greatly influences the dynamic characteristic of the pneumatic <b>servo</b> and should be taken into account in the control system design. In this research, a new method of control system design, which deals with the pneumatic <b>servo</b> system as a fifth-order time lag system including a second-order time lag system of a <b>servo</b> valve, has been proposed. The experiment shows that the proposed method is effective. As a result, we can decide all of the control parameters including the proportional gain without trial and error.

30|$|The <b>servo</b> {{cylinder}} is {{the executive}} component of a hydraulic <b>servo</b> system. Its performance directly affects overall system control accuracy under both dynamic and static conditions [1 – 3]. When an overloaded horizontal <b>servo</b> cylinder articulates an output curve force, a partial load {{is placed on the}} piston rod based on the installation and load characteristics [1, 4, 5], creating friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, which can lead to leakage and scuffing of the cylinder bore. Additionally, this friction negatively affects the output characteristics and reliability of a <b>servo</b> cylinder, significantly reducing its lifespan [6 – 8].
