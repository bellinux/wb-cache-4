6000|$|This plant, the scarlet-runner of English gardeners and the Phaseolus coccineus of Lamarck, {{originally}} {{came from}} Mexico, as I am informed by Mr. Bentham. The flowers are so constructed that hive and humble-bees, which visit them incessantly, almost always alight {{on the left}} wing-petal, as they can best suck the nectar from this side. Their weight and movements depress the petal, and this causes the stigma to protrude from the <b>spirally-wound</b> keel, and a brush of hairs round the stigma pushes out the pollen before it. The pollen adheres to the head or proboscis of the bee which is at work, and is thus placed either on the stigma of the same flower, or is carried to another flower. (5/4. The flowers have been described by Delpino, and in an admirable manner by Mr. Farrer in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 2 4th series October 1868 page 256. My son Francis has explained 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189, the use of one peculiarity in their structure, namely, a little vertical projection on the single free stamen near its base, which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the two nectar-holes in the staminal sheath. He shows that this projection prevents the bees reaching the nectar, unless {{they go to the}} left side of the flower, and it is absolutely necessary for cross-fertilisation that they should alight on the left wing-petal.) Several years ago I covered some plants under a large net, and these produced on one occasion about one-third, and on another occasion about one-eighth, of the number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growing close alongside produced. (5/5. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and more especially ibid 1858 page 828. Also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.) This lessened fertility was not caused by any injury from the net, as I moved the wing-petals of several protected flowers, in the same manner as bees do, and these produced remarkably fine pods. When the net was taken off, the flowers were immediately visited by bees, and it was interesting to observe how quickly the plants became covered with young pods. As the flowers are much frequented by Thrips, the self-fertilisation of most of the flowers under the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects. Dr. Ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant, and [...] "out of a vast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod, while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful." [...] Mr. Belt gives a more curious case; this plant grows well and flowers in Nicaragua; but as none of the native bees visit the flowers, not a single pod is ever produced. (5/6. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' 1870 page 168. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 70. The latter author gives a case 'Nature' 1875 page 26, of a late crop of Phaseolus multiflorus near London which [...] "was rendered barren" [...] by the humble-bees cutting, as they frequently do, holes at the bases of the flowers instead of entering them in the proper manner.) ...|$|E

50|$|Calendering {{can also}} used for polishing, or making uniform, {{coatings}} applied to substrates- an older use was in polishing magnetic tapes, for which the contact roller rotates much faster than the web speed. More recently, it {{is used in the}} production of certain types of secondary battery cells (such as <b>spirally-wound</b> or prismatic Lithium-ion cells) to achieve uniform thickness of electrode material coatings on current collector foils.|$|E
50|$|True memory-effect is {{specific}} to sintered-plate nickel-cadmium cells, and is exceedingly difficult to reproduce, especially in lower ampere-hour cells. In one particular test {{program designed to}} induce the effect, none was found after more than 700 precisely-controlled charge/discharge cycles. In the program, <b>spirally-wound</b> one-ampere-hour cells were used. In a follow-up program, 20-ampere-hour aerospace-type cells were used on a similar test régime. Memory effects showed up after a few hundred cycles.|$|E
50|$|Clean-in-place {{systems are}} {{typically}} used to remove fouling from membranes after extensive use. The CIP process may use detergents, reactive agents such as sodium hypochlorite and acids and alkalis such as citric acid and sodium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) {{must be removed}} from the feed in some membrane plants. Bleach oxidizes thin-film membranes. Oxidation will degrade the membranes to a point where they will no longer perform at rated rejection levels and have to be replaced. Bleach can be added to a NaOH sodium hydroxide CIP during an initial system start-up before <b>spirally-wound</b> membranes are loaded into the plant to help disinfect the system. Bleach is also used to CIP perforated stainless steel (Graver) membranes, as their tolerance for sodium hypochlorite is much higher than a <b>spirally-wound</b> membrane. Caustics and acids are most often used as primary CIP chemicals. Caustic removes organic fouling and acid removes minerals. Enzyme solutions are also used in some systems for helping remove organic fouling material from the membrane plant. The pH and temperature are important to a CIP program. If pH and temperature are too high the membrane will degrade and flux performance will suffer. If pH and temperature are too low, the system simply will not be cleaned properly. Every application has different CIP requirements. e.g. a dairy RO reverse osmosis plant most likely will require a more rigorous CIP program than a water purification RO plant. Each membrane manufacturer has their own guidelines for CIP procedures for their product.|$|E
50|$|Nine of the {{eighteen}} known examples may {{be attributed}} to him. Three of them still exist. They use the technology of both suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges. Arnodin built a great number of second generation suspension bridges {{at the turn of the}} 20th century and he also restored and consolidated a number of old first generation suspension bridges (before 1860): the aprons were reinforced and the old wire cables replaced by <b>spirally-wound</b> double torsion steel wire ropes, often with addition of a cable-stayed bridge (known structural modification under the name of “Système Arnodin”). His factory (for the production of prefabricated metal sub-structures) was established in Châteauneuf-sur-Loire. Vestiges of this factory were still visible a few years ago, and the chimney could still be seen, half ruined, between the Loire and railway.|$|E
50|$|In 1895 {{the company}} had about 25 {{employees}} and sold about $2,000 of bearings each month.That year Hyatt hired the 20-year-old Alfred P. Sloan as a draftsman.Sloan had recently obtained a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He had been struggling to find a job, and was recommended to Hyatt by John E. Searles, president of the American Sugar Refining Company, {{a friend of his}} father and a major investor in Hyatt.Sloan wrote later, Although the company was mismanaged and financially insecure, Sloan saw that the <b>spirally-wound</b> flexible roller bearing product had real potential.At that time machine parts did not have precise dimensions, so the flexibility of the Hyatt bearing was a valuable quality.However, Sloan left Hyatt in 1897 to take a better-paying job with which he could afford to marry his fiancée, Irene Jackson.He joined another start-up company named Hygienic Refrigerator, which was trying to develop an electric refrigerator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{design of}} pressure vessels {{is described in}} the book Codex Madrid I, by Leonardo da Vinci, in 1495, where containers of pressurized air were theorized to lift heavy weights underwater, however vessels resembling what are used today did not come about until the 1800s where steam was generated in boilers helping to spur the industrial revolution. [...] However, with poor material quality and manufacturing techniques along with improper knowledge of design, operation and maintenance {{there was a large}} number of damaging and often fatal explosions associated with these boilers and pressure vessels, with a death occurring on a nearly daily basis in the United States. [...] Local providences and states in the US began enacting rules for constructing these vessels after some particularly devastating vessel failures occurred killing dozens of people at a time, which made it difficult for manufacturers {{to keep up with the}} varied rules from one location to another and the first pressure vessel code was developed starting in 1911 and released in 1914, starting the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). [...] In an early effort to design a tank capable of withstanding pressures up to , a 6 in diameter tank was developed in 1919 that was <b>spirally-wound</b> with two layers of high tensile strength steel wire to prevent sidewall rupture, and the end caps longitudinally reinforced with lengthwise high-tensile rods. [...] The need for high pressure and temperature vessels for petroleum refineries and chemical plants gave rise to vessels joined with welding instead of rivets (which were unsuitable for the pressures and temperatures required) and in 1920s and 1930s the BPVC included welding as an acceptable means of construction, and welding is the main means of joining metal vessels today.|$|E

40|$|Four {{different}} {{heat transfer}} paths were separately investigated in a <b>spirally-wound</b> D-size cell. Thermal resistances of the relating components along each heat transfer path were calculated, {{and the total}} network of thermal resistances was constructed, resulting in the total thermal resistance of approximately 16. 4 C/W at Tw = 40 C, and 12. 2 C/W at Tw = 100 C. The amount of heat transferred along the radial direction, which is normal to the electrodes, {{was found to be}} about 91 percent of the total heat dissipation. Based on the present results obtained at the component level, the present D-size lithium cell may be operated at a C/ 2 discharge rate under normal discharge conditions below the cut-off voltage of 2. 5 V...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design of {{flexible}} pipes, buried in shallow trenches with dry sand backfill. The thesis reports the comprehensive analysis of twenty-two full-scale load tests conducted between 1989 and 1991 on pipe installations, mainly within a laboratory facility, at the University of South Australia. The pipes were highly flexible, <b>spirally-wound,</b> uPVC pipes, ranging in diameter from 300 to 450 mm. Guidelines were required by industry for safe cover heights for these pipes when subjected to construction traffic. The tests were designed by, and conducted under the supervision of, the author, prior to the author undertaking this thesis. As current design approaches for pipes could not anticipate the large loading settlements and hence, soil plasticity, experienced in these tests, finite element analyses were attempted. Extensive investigations of the materials in the installations were undertaken to permit finite element modelling of the buried pipe installations. In particular, a series of large strain triaxial tests were conducted on the sand backfill in the buried pipe installations, to provide {{an understanding of the}} sand behaviour in terms of critical state theory. Subsequently a constitutive model for the soil was developed. The soil model was validated before implementation in an element of finite element program, AFENA (Carter and Balaam, 1995). Single element modelling of the triaxial tests proved invaluable in obtaining material constants for the soil model. The new element was applied successfully to the analysis of a side-constrained, plate loading test on the sand. The simulation of the buried pipe tests was shown to require three-dimensional finite element analysis to approach the observed pipe-soil behaviour. Non-compliant side boundary conditions were ultimately adjudged chiefly responsible for the difficulty in matching the experimental data. The value of numerical analyses performed in tandem with physical testing was apparent, albeit in hindsight. The research has identified the prediction of vertical soil pressure above the pipe due to external loading as being the major difficulty for designers. Based on the finite element analyses of the field tests, a preliminary simple expression was developed for estimation of these pressures, which could be used with currently available design approaches to reasonably predict pipe deflections...|$|E
