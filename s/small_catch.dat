Once all discs and the dial are rotating together, the dial is rotated until the last disc is in place and the notch is in the proper positioning, then by rotating the dial in the other direction, the catches will all disconnect, starting from the dial to the first disc and so on until they connect from the other side and the discs begin to rotate together by the same method but in the opposite direction. In this way, the remaining discs are able to rotate and change their position without further disturbing the last disc.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{functions}} of the two synergistic pheromone components, (4 s) -cis-verbenol (cV) and 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 - 01 (MB), {{and the role of}} ipsdienol in the attraction of Ips typographus (L.) (Scolytidae) to pheromone sources were studied in the field. Absolute and relative beetle catches were compared between several traps placed at and nearby a central pheromone source: a pipe trap containing the source, a surrounding sticky trap, a nearby window trap, and four distant window traps. A higher catch in the outer down-wind distant traps indicated an up-wind anemotaxis to the source. Increased MB release, with cV constant, increased the proportion caught in the central pipe trap, indicating MB as a landing stimulus. Release of MB alone gave a very <b>small</b> <b>catch.</b> Ipsdienol could not substitute for cV in the synergism with MB. An increase of cV, with MB constant, increased the number of beetles caught, but not the proportion caught in the pipe trap. The sex ratio was equal in the window traps, but fell to 30 % males in both sticky and pipe traps, showing that {{a large proportion of the}} males attracted to the source did not land. The proportion of males in the pipe trap was reduced at the highest cV dose. The results support the idea of each pheromone component having a different relative importance in releasing different steps in the behavioural chain. Key words.

40|$|Characteristics of the {{spawning}} {{population of}} Atlantic herring along the Maine coast are inferred from {{an examination of}} larval catch rates {{and the distribution of}} larval cohorts based on otolith growth increments. Comparison of larval catch rates with the har-vests of adult herring indicated that larval production decreased precipitously in 1978 following the removal of the 1970 year-class from the coastal spawning population and a general increase in the catch of adults. Reduced larval production persisted after 1978 and reached a low level in 1981 which resulted in the collapse of the fishery for juveniles (age 2) in 1983. Comparison of catch rates from larval surveys along the coast and the occurrence of larval cohorts inshore during 1980 - 81 with those reported for the mid- 1960 's and early 1970 's indicated little change in the location of spawning grounds and the presence of larval cohorts, but the mechanisms which enhance larval survival and recruitment were probably not the same for the spawning grounds off eastern and central-western Maine. It is suggested that the survival of larvae hatched in the eastern area was increased by their dispersion westward along the coast to overwinter in the many estuaries and embayments, whereas larvae hatched in the central-western area were less widely dispersed but their survival was increased by the shorter winter experienced by some because of late spawning. The absence of late spawning in the central-western area in 1981. evident from the absence of larval cohorts inshore during the winter. was probably responsible in part for the very <b>small</b> <b>catch</b> of juvenile herring in 1983. The implications of reducing the spawning population below some critical level by intensive harvesting of weak year-classes are discussed in relation to management problems...|$|E
40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandWe {{conducted}} shallow-set {{longline fishing}} operations on a research vessel {{in the western}} North Pacific, May-July, 2002 - 2004. We investigated sea turtle interaction with a pelagic longline fishery and preliminarily examined the potential gear modifications (bait and hook types) for reducing sea turtle bycatch or mortality. A total of 54 loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta were caught in 76 operations (about 74, 000 hooks), which were all alive. The mean straight carapace length was 67 cm (range: 52 - 82 cm); this suggested most of loggerhead sea turtles caught in this area were sub-adult. Loggerhead sea turtle catches ranged from 19. 1 to 24. 5 °C in sea surface temperature, which were concentrated in warm water masses in the Kuroshio extension. The Loggerhead sea turtle catch was more frequently observed on hooks hauled after sunrise. For bait type, the catches by mackerel bait were fewer than those by squid bait. In the circle hook trial in 2003, the deep-hooking rates (proportion of deep-hooking (at esophagus or pharynx) to total in numbers) on squid bait were 0. 41 and 0. 23 in 3. 8 sun conventional tuna hook (n = 22) and 3. 8 sun Tankichi type circle hook (which had similar size to 3. 8 sun conventional tuna hook) (n = 13), respectively, but {{the difference was not}} significant (P > 0. 05, extended Fisher’s exact test).

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In a non-cooperative fishing game of two players, {{one single}} player must be {{sufficiently}} dominant {{in order to}} have an incentive to conserve the stock. Maximum growth rate of fish stocks could often be too low in order to provide a conservation incentive for a dominant player. The fish catch left for the dominant player could be much less than that taken by the free rider and be considered unfair. As the number of players increases it becomes less likely that the any single one will be sufficiently dominant to have an incentive to conserve the fish stock. Would this necessarily mean that fish stocks are increasingly likely to be exploited to extinction as the number of players increases? Would not players prefer to avoid annihilation of their fisheries even if no single one is dominant enough to conserve the stock in its own interest? This, at any rate, seems to have happened in the Northeast Atlantic mackerel fishery where no player is dominant enough for this purpose. Despite no comprehensive formal cooperation and much rhetoric the parties have set themselves rather cautious fish quotas. An otherwise assured mutual destruction could prompt the parties sharing a fish stock to cooperate, at least informally, even if no single party in dominant enough to conserve the stock. This could even produce a better situation than when one of two parties is able to free ride on the dominant party, leaving a grossly <b>small</b> <b>catch</b> to be taken by the dominant party...|$|E
40|$|Bernhard Linde (1886 – 1954) was a {{recognized}} and prolific Estonian theatre {{critic of the}} first quarter of the 20 th century, who mediated and propagated western as well as eastern European theatrical innovations. In addition, he was active as a literary and art critic, publisher, and proponent of libraries, to a modest extent he was a prose writer and poet. Unquestionably, however, Bernhard Linde’s most prominent role was as one of the founding members of the literary movement Young Estonia. He was the group’s first general manager; later on, he was the secretary of the Estonian Writers’ Association Young Estonia, and the chairman of the board of the Young Estonia Publishing House. Linde’s formal education culminated in graduation from Tartu University as a Slavic philologist; he was the only member of the Young Estonia group to demonstrate serious and sustained interest toward Slavic cultures and peoples. Linde was a contradictory figure, evoking a range of responses from his contemporaries: on the one hand, there was the unbelievably broad range of his participation in cultural life, his organizing skills and business instincts in directing publishing houses; on the other hand, a superficiality in his writings, his often rash and subjective style as a critic, and his financial intrigues. If one adds in Linde’s stubbornness, egocentrism, and intense spirit of protest, which often led to lawsuits, the outcome is the portrait of an extremely complicated, fascinating, and passionate man—both in his creative work and his personal life Linde guaranteed a place for himself in literary history through a <b>small</b> <b>catch</b> of texts: a few foundational essays (for example, on August Kitzberg), a translation of Balzac’s Le père Goriot, the essay collection Omad ja võõrad (Own and Foreign) and a travel book focusing on the literature and theatre of eastern Europe (Loova Kesk-Euroopa Poole (Toward A Creative Central Europe)). The prominent public figure and historian Eduard Laaman has pointed out that the historical picture of Young Estonia would be incomplete without Bernhard Linde. It was Laaman who, in view of Linde’s business instincts, dubbed him Young Estonia’s ”leader of the pack”, a label that stuck. While fulfilling the responsibilities of the group’s general secretary and business manager (the Estonian word asjaajaja has a broad connotational field) Linde carried most of the burden of Young Estonia’s correspondence. Though he often protested against the designation, the term general manager seems most precisely to characterize Linde’s activities in the context of Young Estonia, since the group’s financial matters and problems connected with its publishing activities were largely his to handle. Compared with his organizational work, his own literary contributions from the Young Estonia era were modest. Young Estonia’s fifth and last album was published in 1915. The last text specifically about Young Estonia authored by a member of the movement was Bernhard Linde’s ”Noor-Eesti” kümme aastat (Young Estonia: Ten Years), also mostly written that same year, though not published until 1919 (publication date on the title page was 1918, reprinted 2005). This text is a systematic historical overview of the movement which continues to offer valuable perspectives for today’s reader. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} ecology of sandy beaches {{has been largely}} ignored in comparison to rocky shores, even though sandy beach fauna may be abundant, and of considerable economic and ecological significance. I used ecological and genetic techniques to investigate aspects of the ecology, life history and levels of exploitation of the surf clam or pipi, Donax deltoides. My data, obtained from sampling pipis from five beaches over five years, highlight spatio-temporal variability in the distribution and abundance of Donax deltoides across all temporal and spatial scales. Within site variability was usually as high as between site or between time variability. Densities could vary by several orders of magnitude over spatial scales as small as 10 - 20 m. At least some of this variability {{can be attributed to}} the fact that Donax deltoides is highly mobile. Size classes were commonly missing from samples, with both medium and larger sized animals effectively missing on 27 % of sampling days, although smaller animals were present in 95 % of samples. This is a reflection of mobility rather than mortality, as size classes appeared or disappeared at very short temporal scales (days). Different size classes often occupied different heights on the shore, and the zone occupied by the different size classes varied over time. While small and medium pipis were most likely to be located in the swash (in 72 % and 48 % of samples respectively), large pipis were equally likely to be located in the swash (32 %), intertidal (38 %) or subtidal zone (30 %). The distribution pattern of different size groups was not consistent across short temporal scales (days) or across spatial scales of a few kilometres. This study underlines the inadequacy of the single transect approach adopted many workers. For smaller animals initial growth was rapid, from 6 mm to 30 mm within 4 - 8 months, and growth was asymptotic. Growth rates were fairly consistent both between and within regions. Pipis appeared to reach 37 mm in 37 mm insites, at which size 50 % were sexually mature. Growth clearly slowed with size. Mortality varied both between and within sites, with few large animals found at some sites. Recruitment patterns were consistent both between and within sites. Reproductive data, derived from a variety of sources including gonad smears, condition indices, oocyte diameters and stereology, revealed that the spawning pattern of Donax deltoides was poorly defined. I found considerable variation in the timing of reproduction from year to year, both among individuals and among years. The size at which pipis can be defined as fully mature was consistent both between sites and among years. Gonad smears indicated that at least 50 % of pipis were mature by 37 mm in length, with gametes being found in animals as small as 27 mm. Populations at two widely separated locations showed prolonged spawning, with some peaks in activity. At both sites, mature females (≥ 37 mm) contained apparently mature eggs nearly all year. The number of eggs held per female was low, but overall fecundity is likely to be high as females released eggs over a long period. A consequence of such a prolonged spawning period was the presence of recruits beaches all year round, however juvenile mortality was high and large numbers of recruits did not go on to establish detectable cohorts. Cohorts only established between July and December during this study at all sites. I found consistent recruitment even on beaches where there were very few adults, indicating that there was not a strong stockrecruitment relationship in this species. This finding was supported by electrophoretic data, suggesting that local populations of pipis on the east coast of Australia are strongly connected and form a single fishery. I surveyed patterns of allelic variation within 12 samples of pipis from beaches separated by up to 1200 km along the east Australian coast, influenced to varying degrees by the East Australian Current. On the east coast of Australia the erratic nature of this current, the formation of closed rip cells which limit the circulation of water offshore from surf beaches, and the turbulent nature of the surf zone itself (which may lower fertilisation success) might be expected to restrict larval dispersal and make the supply of recruits variable. However I found no evidence of population subdivision, with little genetic variation among all samples (FST = 0. 009), among geographic regions (FRT = 0. 001), or among samples (FSR = 0. 010). These data imply that larvae are moving between regions and that levels of present or recent gene flow are high. I found no accumulation of rare alleles at either extreme of the distribution studied, which suggests that gene flow is bidirectional. I found large differences between harvesting patterns in the recreational and commercial pipi fisheries, implying that the sectors may have very different impacts on local pipi stocks, even though both fisheries were restricted solely to hand gathering. I estimated the catch from Stockton Beach on the mid-north coast, which accounts for half of the total catch of pipis in NSW. I found a combined recreational and commercial catch of pipis of 237. 7 tonnes during the period March 1996 to February 1997 inclusive, taken in a total of 120, 672 collector hours. The commercial fishery was characterised by a relatively large catch, low fishing effort, and high catch rate. In contrast, the recreational fishery was characterised by a relatively <b>small</b> <b>catch,</b> high fishing effort, and very low catch rates. Recreational fishers took 20 % of the combined commercial and recreational catch on Stockton Beach, but accounted for 89 % of the fishing effort, with an estimated 15, 795 parties participating. The majority of recreational harvesters were collecting for food, rather than bait. I also compared the recreational harvest at Stockton Beach with that of Seven Mile Beach on the south coast of NSW. I found clear differences in the recreational catch between the north and south coasts of NSW, with extremely low catch rates in the south. In general my data fit with life history predictions for an outcrossing planktotrophic species in a variable environment. Pipis became sexually mature at an early age, produced large numbers of small eggs, and had low but variable reproductive effort. Year round spawning may mitigate the effects of a stochastic environment, particularly if spawning in Donax deltoides is in response to oceanographic triggers. Prolonged partial spawning may be a form of bet-hedging in exposed environments with changing environmental conditions...|$|E

More than 200 scientists and experts have opposed the compromise proposal for lifting the ban, and have also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994. Opponents of the compromise plan want to see an end to all commercial whaling, but are willing to allow subsistence-level catches by indigenous peoples.|$|R
