2500|$|Implicit or {{explicit}} {{in most of}} the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes {{in a way that made}} it look different. The gap junction had been shown to create a micro-environment between the two cells in the extra-cellular space or [...] "gap". This portion of extra-cellular space was somewhat isolated from the surrounding space and also bridged by what we now call connexon pairs which form even more tightly <b>sealed</b> <b>bridges</b> that cross the gap junction gap between two cells. When viewed in the plane of the membrane by freeze-fracture techniques, higher-resolution distribution of connexons within the gap junction plaque is possible.|$|R

5|$|While {{making a}} {{delivery}} in the Historic District, Cole is instructed {{to open the}} package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling several city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after {{he is accused of}} triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the <b>sealed</b> <b>bridge,</b> only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the <b>Seal</b> Island <b>Bridge</b> {{began in}} 1960 {{as part of}} the Trans-Canada Highway project. The bridge, officially known as the Great Bras d'Or Crossing, was {{completed}} in 1961 {{at a cost of about}} $4,652,850. The construction of 23 km of approach roads increased the total cost of the project to about $6-million. The bridge is a crucial link in the Trans Canada Highway between Sydney and Baddeck, carrying more than 7,500 vehicles a day in peak periods. [...] The structure carries 2 traffic lanes of Highway 105 and was originally constructed with a pedestrian sidewalk on each side.|$|R

Corrosion-resistant stainless-steel spacer separates secondary and primary seals in both old and new versions of seal assembly. In new version, combination of flexible <b>sealing</b> lip and <b>bridge</b> is less susceptible to cracking at low temperatures...|$|R

His request was initially refused by Monroe with the proposal that Kean spend the following two <b>sealing</b> seasons as <b>bridge</b> master under Captain Joe Barbour on the SS Esquimaux. Finally, Monroe concluded that Kean had acquired sufficient experience to captain the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Kellys Mountain is a {{mountain}} located in Victoria County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Trans Canada Highway winds {{its way up}} the mountain via Route 105. It is known for both its scenic view from the top and its steep slope {{on both sides of}} the mountain highway. There is a parking space at the top known as the Bras d'Or Look Off that gives a view of <b>Seal</b> Island <b>Bridge,</b> Great Bras d'Or channel and Boularderie Island, areas where the highway travels after the driver descends the eastern portion of the Highway. Travelers should be aware of a sharp hairpin turn at the foot of the eastern end of the mountain that switches back greater than 180 degrees after a steep descent.|$|R
30|$|Within {{the period}} of time considered, Dycal capping {{contributes}} to the heterogeneous formation of a reparative dentinal bridge. Tunnel defects as well as the presence of osteodentin favor bacteria recontamination and consequently the lack of formation of a hermetic <b>seal.</b> Reparative dentin <b>bridge</b> contains cell debris permitting communication between the oral cavity and the outer pulp. This is probably the reason for the long-term high rate failure of pulp cappings (Cox et al. 1996).|$|R

5000|$|Seal {{made two}} {{first-class}} appearances for Sussex in the 1904 County Championship against Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. [...] Against Leicestershire at Aylestone Road, Leicester, Seal wasn't required to bat or bowl, with the match petering {{out into a}} draw. [...] In the following match against Nottinghamshire at Trent <b>Bridge,</b> <b>Seal</b> was run out for a duck in Sussex's first-innings, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for the same score by John Gunn. He also bowled five wicketless overs in the match, with Nottinghamshire winning by 226 runs.|$|R

However, Lord Frey has <b>sealed</b> off the <b>bridge</b> and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf.

50|$|In January 2009, Pakistan <b>sealed</b> off the <b>bridge</b> {{as part of}} a {{military}} offensive against Taliban guerrillas. This military operation was mainly focused on Jamrud, a district on the Khyber road. The target was to “dynamite or bulldoze homes belonging to men suspected of harboring or supporting Taliban militants or carrying out other illegal activities”. The result meant that more than 70 people were arrested and 45 homes were destroyed. In addition, two children and one woman were killed. As a response, in early February 2009, Taliban insurgents cut off the Khyber Pass temporarily by blowing up a key bridge.|$|R
50|$|It was {{initially}} just a railway bridge {{over which the}} trains of the Rhenish Railway Company ran to Oberlahnstein, connecting {{the left and right}} bank lines. It had three spans constructed of wrought iron, each 97 m long, across the Rhine. The height of the arch was 3.14 m. It had two 10 metre-high towers {{at each end of the}} bridge, which had iron bars that could be used to <b>seal</b> off the <b>bridge</b> in the event of war. In addition, the right bank was protected by the Horchheim Gate Fortress (Horchheimer Torbefestigung) built between 1864 and 1867.|$|R

5000|$|The highway travels {{northeast}} from Port Hastings {{along the}} base of a group of mountains known as [...] "The Big Ridge" [...] to Whycocomagh. It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula. Highway 105 descends the east slope of Kelly's Mountain using a series of sharp turns including a 180° hairpin turn at New Harris Forks before crossing the Great Bras d'Or Channel of Bras d'Or Lake on the <b>Seal</b> Island <b>Bridge.</b> The road crosses Boularderie Island using another short Super two controlled access segment and then runs southeast as an uncontrolled access road through the villages of Bras d'Or and Florence. Highway 105 regains controlled access for the final 3 km to its eastern terminus at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney where travellers can continue to Newfoundland.|$|R
5|$|InFamous {{is set in}} Empire City, {{a fictional}} {{metropolis}} based on New York City, consisting of the Neon District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, {{the location of the}} city government. Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to <b>seal</b> the only <b>bridge</b> leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.|$|R
