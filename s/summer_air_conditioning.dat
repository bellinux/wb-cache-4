50|$|Free cooling {{systems can}} have very high efficiencies, and are {{sometimes}} combined with seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} (STES) so the cold of winter {{can be used for}} <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Free cooling and hybrid systems are mature technology.|$|E
50|$|For {{the latter}} reason especially, drum-style {{humidifiers}} {{should always be}} turned off at the water supply during <b>summer</b> (<b>air</b> <b>conditioning)</b> months, and should always be used with high quality furnace air filters (MERV ratings as high as possible to ensure small numbers of mold spores reaching the humidifier pan) when the water supply is turned on.|$|E
50|$|Both {{of these}} well types use a {{down-hole}} control valve. ASR {{can also be}} used to re-inject water used by HVAC systems to maintain the ground water levels and store the thermal differences from summertime cooling for winter time heating. Industry can also capture cold winter waters and store it for summertime use and avoid the need for cooling water in the summer for industrial processes. This may also free up short supplies of summer time water for other beneficial uses. This reinjection process may also avoid the cost of surface disposal and avoid the increased thermal load to the rivers and streams during the <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> season.|$|E

50|$|The Index {{is one of}} {{the first}} towers in the region to {{intelligently}} embrace its climatic surrounding environment within its fundamental design principles.

50|$|Any {{humidifiers}} should {{usually be}} disabled during the <b>summer</b> months if <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> is used; <b>air</b> conditioners partially function to reducing indoor humidity, {{and having a}} humidifier continue to operate will waste significant amounts of energy.|$|R
50|$|Free cooling {{systems can}} have very high efficiencies, and are {{sometimes}} combined with seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} so the cold of winter {{can be used for}} <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} (TES) is {{achieved}} with widely differing technologies. Depending {{on the specific}} technology, it allows excess thermal energy to be stored and used hours, days, or months later, at scales ranging from individual process, building, multiuser-building, district, town, or region. Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime, storing summer heat for winter heating, or winter cold for <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (Seasonal thermal energy storage). Storage media include water or ice-slush tanks, masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers by means of boreholes, deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata; shallow, lined pits filled with gravel and water and insulated at the top, as well as eutectic solutions and phase-change materials.|$|E
50|$|Thermal energy storage, which {{includes}} technologies both for short- and long-term retention of heat or cold, can create or improve {{the utility of}} waste heat (or cold). One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) at a foundry in Sweden. The heat is stored in the bedrock surrounding a cluster of heat exchanger equipped boreholes, and is used for space heating in an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to utilize natural waste heat is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada, which, by using a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, obtains 97 percent of its year-round heat from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs. Another STES application is storing winter cold underground, for <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b>|$|E

50|$|Over 800,000 {{inhabitants}} of Reunion Island {{rely on a}} limited supply of energy.

5000|$|In some {{circumstances}} {{the use of}} an enabling technology, either diurnal thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada. The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, and this enables obtaining 97 percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs.

40|$|The {{request of}} <b>summer</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> in {{dwellings}} is continuously increasing {{in many countries}} for comfort reasons.

The use of radiant systems, especially ceiling ones, can represent a good solution if the building is correctly sheltered from solar gains, suitably insulated and the internal gains are controlled. On the other hand, the risk of reaching surfaces temperatures below dew point with consequent condensations, can limit the application of this technology. In this regard the use of mechanical controlled ventilation with cooling and dehumidification of air contributes to a larger application of radiant systems.

Some research achievements show that buildings will decrease the indoor room temperatures by 1 o C during summer and increase the indoor room temperature by 1 o C during winter with 6 %~ 10 % savings of energy consumption.

An innovative ground coupling using a reversible (pump-assisted) thermosiphon with its high heat flux characteristics, intrinsic to two-phase heat pipes, as an in-ground heat exchanger is proposed and its performance is evaluated in a series of lab-scale experiments. Extraction and injection of heat from/into the water-saturated sand with a single thermosiphon unit representing a cell in an array of thermosiphons is modeled. These results demonstrate that near freezing point of water, due to weak or no natural convection, heat transfer is mainly due to conduction.
