June Hancock's solicitor Adrian Budgen explained that victims were [...] "typically" [...] awarded compensation of £100,000, of which £10,000 was invariably paid back to cover any industrial injury benefits received. The victim would then receive only 24% {{of the remaining}} £90,000. He said: [...] "It is a pittance. If we had known in 2001 {{it was going to}} take four years I am sure there would have been a much bigger outcry. We just ran into the mire. It was beyond our control. Very much of what was happening was being dictated across the water in the United States." [...] All of the 50 claimants had already died by the time the payments were made.|$|E
6000|$|Walking {{away with}} F. B. {{from one of}} these parties of the Colonel's, and seriously alarmed at what I had {{observed}} there, I demanded of Bayham whether my conjectures were not correct, that some misfortune overhung our old friend's house? At first Bayham denied stoutly or pretended ignorance; but at length, having reached the Haunt together, which I had not visited since I was a married man, we entered that place of entertainment, and were greeted by its old landlady and waitress, and accommodated with a quiet parlour. And here F. B., after groaning and sighing--after solacing himself with a prodigious quantity of bitter beer--fairly burst out, and, with tears in his eyes, made a full and sad confession respecting this unlucky Bundelcund Banking Company. The shares had been going lower and lower, {{so that there was}} no sale now for them at all. To meet the liabilities, the directors must have undergone the greatest sacrifices. He did know--he did not like to think what the Colonel's personal losses were. The respectable solicitors of the Company had retired, long since, after having <b>secured</b> <b>payment</b> of a most respectable bill; and had given place to the firm of dubious law-agents of whom I had that evening seen a partner. How the retiring partners from India had been allowed to withdraw, and to bring fortunes along with them, was a mystery to Mr. Frederick Bayham. The great Indian millionnaire was in his, F. B.'s eyes, [...] "a confounded mahogany-coloured heathen humbug." [...] These fine parties which the Colonel was giving, and that fine carriage which was always flaunting about the Park with poor Mrs. Clive and the Campaigner, and the nurse and the baby, were, in F. B.'s opinion, all decoys and shams. He did not mean to say that the meals were not paid, and that the Colonel had to plunder for his horses' corn; but he knew that Sherrick, and the attorney, and the manager, insisted upon the necessity of giving these parties, and keeping up this state and grandeur, and opined that it was at the special instance of these advisers that the Colonel had contested the borough for which he was now returned. [...] "Do you know how much that contest cost?" [...] asks F. B. [...] "The sum, sir, was awful! and we have ever so much of it to pay. I came up twice myself from Newcome to Campion and Sherrick about it. I betray no secrets--F. B., sir, would die a thousand deaths before he would tell the secrets of his benefactor!--But, Pendennis, you understand a thing or two. You know what o'clock it is, and so does yours truly, F. B., who drinks your health. I know the taste of Sherrick's wine well enough. F. B., sir, fears the Greeks and all the gifts they bring. Confound his Amontillado! I had rather drink this honest malt and hops all my life than ever see a drop of his abominable sherry. Golden? F. B. believes it is golden--and a precious deal dearer than gold too"--and herewith, ringing the bell, my friend asked for a second pint of the just-named and cheaper fluid.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Maha spent $20 {{million during}} an epic {{shopping}} spree in high-end Parisian boutiques, habitually {{walking out of}} the door after staff had been given an embossed card marked [...] "Payment to Follow". She lived in various top hotels in Paris, including the Crillon, which remained a long-time creditor; she then moved to the luxury Georges V hotel, owned by her nephew, Prince Alwaleed. Shops she patronised report that her payment history had always been excellent, but that her staff started shrugging off payment all of a sudden. She has since been pursued by some 30 Parisian retailers for 15 million Euro worth of merchandise. Casualwear retailer Key Largo finally <b>secured</b> <b>payment</b> after obtaining a court order to seize goods from her Georges V hotel suite. Bailiffs were met by the Saudi consul, who issued a guaranteed payment for $125,000 {{in the presence of a}} chief of police. Those debts were said to have been eventually settled through the Saudi embassy. The negative publicity of her Parisian stay incurred the wrath of King Abdullah, who grounded her on her return from Paris. Nevertheless, she once again escaped back to Paris from Saudi in December 2011. Media reported that she and her entourage, occupying 41 rooms at the Shangri-La Hotel in the 16th Arrondissement in Paris where they had been staying since 23 December 2012, tried to sneak out of the hotel at 3:30 am of 31 May 2012 without paying the $7 million bill. Police were called, but Maha claimed diplomatic immunity. In the meantime pending resolution, she decanted to the Royal Monceau Hotel owned by a friend, the Emir of Qatar. In March 2013, creditors obtained a court order from a judge in Nanterre, and two storage units containing Maha's purchases from 2012 were seized, to be auctioned off to satisfy creditors. Maha was barred from leaving Saudi Arabia after the latest spending spree.|$|E

40|$|A {{need for}} secure payment methods in the mobile access {{channels}} has arisen {{as a result}} of the increase of on-line commerce. Most of the current payment methods that can be used in conducting transactions e. g. on the Internet have major drawbacks either in terms of functionality, usability, costs or security. The only widely accepted way of securely and reliably authorizing electronic payment transactions is through the use of digital signatures in a PKI framework. Organizations like the WAP Forum and MeT Initiative have made efforts to introduce industry standards for bringing PKI capabilities to mobile phones. The WAP version 1. 2. 1 compliant handsets already come with support for making digital signatures using the wireless identity module WIM. These new capabilities readily lend themselves to implementing mobile payment systems. This thesis work presents a system that makes use of the MeT WPKI framework in implementing electronic payment authorization. The Mobile Payment System interacts with the merchant, the payer and the issuer as well as supporting back-end systems in coordinating <b>secured</b> <b>payment</b> transactions. The system is engineered to b...|$|E
