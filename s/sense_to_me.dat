500|$|Michael Nader {{was fired}} from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To {{partially}} appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because [...] "after being a major character for so long, it didn't make any <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> So I declined. But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri's return on a contract basis I would love to go back." ...|$|E
500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing really made <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E
500|$|The Make-Up's gospel {{attitude}} {{was related to}} utilization of the audience as a group member, which Svenonius likened {{to the rise of}} the 90s dance music scene: [...] "We're not interested in countering it. It makes <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that techno, rave and dance music should go over in the face of rock and roll because it's democratic for everybody to express themselves. [...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We want to be at once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form to sort of breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster". [...] Svenonius would often interact with the audience in a number of ways, including call and response lyrics, direct address, and leaving the stage and going out into the crowd.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Eminem {{planned to}} release a sequel of his sixth studio album Relapse titled Relapse 2, but {{cancelled}} the project and released a completely different studio release titled Recovery. He said, [...] "as I kept recording and working with new producers, {{the idea of a}} sequel to Relapse started to make less and less <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I wanted to make a completely new album." [...] "Not Afraid" [...] was primarily produced by the Canadian hip hop musician Boi-1da. According to Mike Strange, who recorded [...] "Not Afraid", he wanted to work with Boi-1da after listening to his [...] "Forever", which he had produced for the rapper Drake. Boi-1da sent Strange many tracks, to some of which Eminem wrote lyrics. These tracks were opened in Pro Tools, as Strange proceeded to record Eminem's vocals. Recording sessions took place at Effigy Studios, in Ferndale, Michigan but Boi-1da was absent during the sessions.|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

Jones is known for being extremely private about her personal life. Regarding the rise of social media and texting, she commented: [...] "In my 20s, we weren’t even texting yet,” she said. “There are times I’ve been told, ‘You’ve {{got to have a}} lot more fans on social media to get booked on this show.’ It makes <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> — I’m just not that good at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Bourne's {{decision}} to cast men as the swans. The original ballet is a standard in the European tradition of romanticized female–male love. The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional gender roles, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone has the power to save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed gay love at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like choreography given to the swan corps re-interprets the archetype of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, [...] "The idea of a male swan makes complete <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The strength, the beauty, the enormous wingspan of these creatures suggests to the musculature of a male dancer more readily than a ballerina in her white tutu." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause.

2500|$|While convincing Philip Baker Hall to do {{the film}} by {{explaining}} {{the significance of the}} rain of frogs, the actor told him a story about {{when he was in the}} mountains of Italy and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed. According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as Bob Barker and Arthur Godfrey. The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of Charles Fort and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in The Bible when he first wrote the sequence. At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was [...] "going through a weird, personal time", and he started to understand [...] "why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> somehow".|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted [...] "There is no Relapse2", thus {{announcing that}} the album has been {{scrapped}} {{in favor of}} his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result {{did not seem to}} him as continuation of Relapse but more of an individual project that deserved its own name. Eminem said: [...] "I had originally planned for Relapse2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." [...] The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.|$|E
2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, it strikes me as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's or whether you go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scheduled for {{a release}} date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to {{coincide}} with the creation of a trade paperback, , to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, Batman: Anarky was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or [...] "tone down" [...] the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an [...] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. [...] As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, [...] "Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t make <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time and it doesn’t make sense now." [...] These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. [...] "I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work." ...|$|E
