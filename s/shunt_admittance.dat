These topologies, invented by Otto Zobel, have the same passbands as the ladder on which they are based but their transfer functions are modified to improve some parameter such as impedance matching, stopband rejection or passband-to-stopband transition steepness.

40|$|An {{improvement}} of unbalanced distribution system operation {{is carried out}} by reactive power compensation. The lagging reactive power demand is compensated by allocating a number of three-phase shunt capacitors. At the stage, the compensation devices are determined tentatively in term of number, size and location. The effects of the installed shunt capacitors are then analyzed. The unbalanced condition of distribution system is taken into account {{due to the fact}} that distribution system is inherently imbalance. For three-phase unbalanced power flow analyses, forward-backward propagation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm works directly on the system without any modification. Starting with determination of forward and backward propagation paths, the algorithm calculates branch currents using backward path. With the branch currents in hand, the bus voltages are calculated using the obtained branch currents and line impedances. Equivalent injection currents representing loads and <b>shunt</b> <b>admittances</b> method are required. The algorithm offers robust and good convergence characteristics for radial distribution system. In this paper, reactive power compensation is simulated using tentative approach and the achieved system improvements are observed.

40|$|Scope of this {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} {{the influence of the}} electromagnetic properties of the earth on the wave propagation characteristics of overhead power lines and underground power cables in transient responses. The fundamental methodology for the calculation of the per unit length circuit parameters of the overhead transmission lines and underground cables is presented, with special emphasis on the influence of the earth on these parameters as expressed through proper correction terms. The earth correction terms are calculated using novel expressions derived from the solution of the EM field equations, using the Herzian Vector approach. Individual earth correction terms are calculated for the self and mutual complex series impedances and the complex <b>shunt</b> <b>admittances</b> and so the proposed model can be also applied to practical multiconductor transmission line and cable configurations. The proposed model both for the overhead power lines and the underground cable arrangements has a generalized form, since it can include cases with arbitrary resistivities, permittivities, and permeabilities of all propagation media, while it takes into account earth stratification. Therefore, it can be used in simulations of the transmission lines, covering a wide range of power engineering operational states, from steady state up to very fast transients and Power Line Communications (PLC). The accuracy of the proposed model is justified, comparing the obtained results with the corresponding from other simplified models. Furthermore a systematic investigation of the influence of the earth electromagnetic properties on the wave propagation characteristics and transient responses in transmission system arrangements is implemented. ...|$|R
