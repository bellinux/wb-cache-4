Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad.

But both can be false, if <b>some</b> <b>men</b> are honest, and <b>some</b> <b>men</b> are not. For if <b>some</b> <b>men</b> are honest, the proposition 'no man is honest' is false.
