25|$|Gryce {{is rumored}} to have {{traveled}} to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship in 1951 to study with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. However, there is much confusion and rumor surrounding this period in Gryce's life, {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that Gryce did receive a Fulbright or formally study with the two composers. Gryce did take two semesters off to study in Europe, but little is known about his travels. It is possible that he studied with the composers privately. While Gryce did propagate the Fulbright rumor himself to substantiate his credentials, Gryce had little else to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time in his life.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an cannot {{deal with}} the State of Israel {{as we know it}} today, since that State came into {{existing}} in 1948 only, i.e. many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that – {{before the end of the}} time – the Jewish people will come from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good faith believes what other people <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.|$|E

He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. Quite apart from that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{study of}} matrix algebra first emerged in England in the mid-1800s. In 1844 Hermann Grassmann {{published}} his [...] "Theory of Extension" [...] which included foundational new topics {{of what is}} today called linear algebra. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term matrix, which is Latin for [...] "womb". While studying compositions of linear transformations, Arthur Cayley was led to define matrix multiplication and inverses. Crucially, Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix, thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants, and wrote [...] "There would be many things to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants".|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Jeremy Zoss {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.25 out of 10, writing [...] "if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering {{is the equivalent}} of a splatter flick." [...] He concluded [...] "while I have many positive things to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> title, I cannot stress enough that it's not for everyone. Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1908 the Swiss {{mountain}} dog appeared for {{the first}} time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib [...] a breeder of the Berner [...] showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager to hear what the Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, would <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, [...] high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, [...] "The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog." [...] Heim wrote in his judge’s notes: [...] "Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under [...] "other breeds" [...] I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give this interesting dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here." ...|$|E

[...] Sputnikmusic was more negative, stating that [...] "Similarly, there was a time when All Time Low were a genuinely exciting young pop punk band; when the songs were dynamic and Alex Fucking Gaskarth's vocals were merely double-tracked rather than layered and autotuned to fuck." [...] idobi Radio also gave a negative review stating, [...] "The band lost their way... This experiment went wildly out of control. The album lacks overall direction and cohesiveness." [...] Review Rinse Repeat's review was mixed, noting that the record [...] "Overproduced and emotionally flat, there just isn't much good to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> album. Strange enough, All Time Low seem to be in a completely different world this time around, as tracks like [...] "Forget About It", [...] "Under a Paper Moon" [...] and [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'" [...] show with unneeded slickness, out-of-body songwriting (not in a good way) and underachieving vocals." ...|$|E
