40|$|This study {{examines}} B-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) class-switching {{events in the}} context of parasite antigen-specific Th-cell responses in experimental African trypanosomiasis. Inbred mice were infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and the coordinate stimulation of Th-cell cytokine responses and B-cell responses to the trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) was measured. The cytokines produced by T cells in response to VSG, at both the transcript and protein levels, were gamma interferon and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) but not IL- 4 or IL- 5. Isotype profiles of antibodies specific for VSG showed that IgG 1, IgG 2 a, and IgG 3 switch responses predominated; no VSG-specific IgE responses were detected. To determine whether cryptic IL- 4 responses played a role in promoting the unexpected IgG 1 <b>switch</b> <b>response,</b> IL- 4 knockout mice were infected; the cytokine responses and Ig isotype profiles of IL- 4 knockout mice were identical to those of the wild-type control mice except for dramatically reduced IgG 1 levels in response to VSG. Thus, these results revealed an IL- 4 -dependent component of the VSG-driven B-cell Cμ-to-Cγ 1 switch. We speculate that an IL- 4 response is mediated primarily by cells other than T lymphocytes since IL- 4 -secreting but parasite antigen-unresponsive, “background” cells were detected in all infected mice and since infected nude mice also displayed a detectable IgG 1 <b>switch</b> <b>response.</b> Overall, our results suggest that B-cell clonal stimulation, maturation, and Ig class switching in African trypanosomiasis may be partially regulated by unusual mechanisms that do not include antigen-specific Th 1 or Th 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{switching}} using {{a dynamic}} local index gradient induced in an InGaAsP/InP Y-junction waveguide switch is investigated using optical, electrical, and thermal simulations, and demonstrated experimentally. Switching {{is accomplished by}} creating a steep index gradient in the optical path near the Y junction. Both simulations and experiments indicate that either carrier injection or the thermo-optic effect {{can be used as}} the active switching mechanism. For carrier injection the induced index change under the electrode, 3 ̆ 94 n, is negative. The measured switch contrast ratio is about 20 dB, with a response time of approximately 5 ns. The thermo-optic effect gives a positive 3 ̆ 94 n, and the observed contrast ratio is about 10 dB.

On a single cell level, cells appear to be either ‘‘on’ ’ or ‘‘off’ ’ for CYP 1 A 1 induction at a given dose; some cells never respond to PCB 126. These cells represent a non-responding population. Cells that are switched ‘‘on’ ’ by PCB 126 display varying levels of induction, much like the dimmer on a light switch.

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{response to}} weak biological signals requires {{that they be}} amplified with fidelity. In E. coli, the flagellar motors that control swimming can switch direction in response to very small changes in the concentration of the signaling protein CheY-P, but how this works is not well understood.

In contrast, we have previously demonstrated that weakening {{of the interaction between}} Gal 80 p and Gal 4 p alone is sufficient to abolish the ultrasensitivity (Das Adhikari et al. 2014). Here, we demonstrate that altering the epistatic interaction between Gal 80 p and Gal 4 p also abolishes the bistability, and the <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> to galactose becomes graded instead of binary. However, the GAL/MEL switch of wild-type and epistatically altered strains responded in a graded fashion to melibiose.

Its signal-response curve appears sigmoidal, constituting a biochemical switch. However, the switch behavior only emerges in the "zero-order region", i. e. when the signal molecule concentration is much {{lower than that of}} the substrate it modifies. In this work we showed that the switching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals and substrates, provided that the signal molecules catalyze the modification reaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the proposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of constant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is robust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder is quasi-static, large fluctuations of the <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> behavior may be observed at low concentrations.

The optimized length of CPW based transmission line (λ/ 4), computed by considering the permittivity of gold at microwave frequencies is approximately 2700  μm. The overall size of SPDT including the CPW ground area reduces from 12  mm 2 for SiO 2 dielectric layer based configuration to approximately 6  mm 2 for HfO 2 based capacitive SPDT. The reduction in dimensions ensures lower hysteresis in switch on-off characteristics and better stress related deformation control in electroplated metallic structures. The insertion loss, return loss and isolation are also better in the case of SPDT with HfO 2 compared to SiO 2 based devices. SPDT having SiO 2 dielectric layer shows insertion loss of 0. 35 dB, return loss of 26. 4 dB and isolation of 45. 1  dB at 10  GHz, whereas SPDT having HfO 2 dielectric layer shows insertion loss of 0. 08 dB, return loss of 35. 7 dB and isolation of 48. 8  dB at 10  GHz.

More specifically, the study aims at assessing the effects of infraspinatus muscle atrophy on the cortical representation of the TTDPM. A proprioception testing device (PTD) was used to measure the TTDPM.

40|$|The GAL {{genetic switch}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{exhibits}} an ultrasensitive {{response to the}} inducer galactose {{as well as the}} "all-or-none" behavior characteristic of many eukaryotic regulatory networks. We have constructed a strain that allows intermediate levels of gene expression from a tunable GAL 1 promoter at both the population and the single cell level by altering the regulation of the galactose permease Gal 2 p. Similar modifications to other feedback loops regulating the Gal 80 p repressor and the Gal 3 p signaling protein did not result in similarly tuned responses, indicating that the level of inducer transport is unique in its ability to control the <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> of the network. In addition, removal of the Gal 1 p galactokinase from the network resulted in a regimed response due to the dual role of this enzyme in galactose catabolism and transport. These two activities have competing effects on the response of the network to galactose such that the transport effects of Gal 1 p are dominant at low galactose concentrations, whereas its catabolic effects are dominant at high galactose concentrations.

40|$|All-optical devices allow {{improvements}} in the speed of optical communication and computation systems by avoiding the conversion between the optical and electronic domains. The focus of this thesis is the experimental investigation of {{a new type of}} all-optical switch that is based on the control of optical patterns formed by nonlinear interactions between light and matter. The all-optical switch consists of a pair of light beams that counterpropagate through warm rubidium vapor. These beams induce a nonlinear optical instability that gives rise to mirrorless parametric self-oscillation and generates light in the state of polarization that is orthogonal to that of the pump beams. In the far-field, the generated light forms patterns consisting of two or more spots. To characterize this instability, I observe experimentally the amount of generated power and the properties of the generated patterns as a function of pump beam intensity, frequency, and size. Near an atomic resonance, the instability has a very low threshold: with less than 1 mW of total pump power, > 3 μW of power is generated. To apply this system to all-optical switching, I observe that the orientation of the generated patterns can be controlled by introducing a symmetry-breaking perturbation to the system. A perturbation {{in the form of a}} weak switch beam injected into the nonlinear medium is suitable for controlling the orientation of the generated patterns. The device operates as a switch where each state of the pattern orientation corresponds to a state of the switch, and spatial filtering of the generated pattern defines the output ports of the device. Measurements of the <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> show that it can be actuated by as few as 600 photons. For a switch beam with 1 /e field radius w_ 0 = 185 μm, 600 photons correspond to 5. 4 × 10 ^- 4 photons/ which is comparable to the best reported results from all-optical switches based on electromagnetically-induced transparentcy (EIT). This approach to all-optical switching operates at very low light levels and exhibits cascadability and transistorlike response. Furthermore, the sensitivity is comparable to switches using cold-atom EIT or cavity quantum-electrodynamics techniques but is achieved with a simpler system, requiring only one optical frequency and occurring in warm atomic vapor. I develop a numerical model for the switch that exhibits patterns that rotate in the presence of a weak applied optical field. Results from this model, and from my experiment, show that the <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> time increases as the input power decreases. I propose that this increase is due to critical slowing down (CSD). Mapping the pattern orientation to a simple one-dimensional system shows that CSD can account for the observed increase in response time at low input power. The ultimate performance of the device is likely limited by CSD and I conclude that the minimum number of photons capable of actuating the switch is between 400 and 600 photons. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{suppress}} and flexibly adapt motor behavior {{is a fundamental}} mechanism of cognitive control, which is impaired in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we used a combination of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and diffusion weighted imaging tractography to study changes in brain function and structure associated with motor switching performance in TBI. Twenty-three young adults with moderate-severe TBI and twenty-six healthy controls made spatially and temporally coupled bimanual circular movements. A visual cue signaled the right hand to switch or continue its circling direction. The time to initiate the switch (<b>switch</b> <b>response</b> time) was longer and more variable in the TBI group and TBI patients exhibited a higher incidence of complete contralateral (left hand) movement disruptions. Both groups activated the basal ganglia and a previously described network for task-set implementation, including the supplementary motor complex and bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC). Relative to controls, patients had significantly increased activation in the presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and left IFC, and showed underactivation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) region. This altered functional engagement was related to the white matter microstructural properties of the tracts connecting preSMA, IFC, and STN. Both functional activity in preSMA, IFC, and STN, and the integrity of the connections between them were associated with behavioral performance across patients and controls. We suggest that damage to these key pathways within the motor switching network because of TBI, shifts the patients toward {{the lower end of the}} existing structure-function-behavior spectrum. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} applied methods to study abnormal cognition is the Continuous Performance Task (CPT). It is unclear, however, which cognitive functions are engaged in normal CPT performance. The aims of the present study were to identify the neurocognitive functions engaged in the main variants of the CPT and to determine to what extent these variants differentially engage these functions. We hypothesized that the main CPT versions (CPT-X, CPT-AX, CPT-Identical Pairs) can be distinguished by whether they demand sustained or transient attention and sustained or transient response preparation. Transient attention to objects like letters or digits, that is, the need to switch attention to different objects from trial to trial, impairs target detection accuracy relative to sustained attention to a single object. Transient response preparation, that is, the possibility to <b>switch</b> <b>response</b> preparation on and off from trial to trial, improves response speed relative to having to sustain response preparation across all trials. Comparison of task performance and Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) of healthy participants obtained in the main CPT variants confirmed these hypotheses. Behavioral and ERP measures indicated worse target detection in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X, consistent with a higher demand on transient attention in that task. In contrast, behavioral and ERP measures indicated higher response speed in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X, associated with more response preparation in advance of the targets. This supports the idea of increased transient response preparation in the CPT-AX. We conclude that CPTs differ along at least two task variables that each influences a different cognitive function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{systematically}} {{understand the}} molecular events that underlie biological phenomena, we must develop methods to integrate {{an enormous amount}} of genomic and proteomic data. The integration of molecular data should go beyond the construction of biochemical cascades among molecules to include tying the biochemical phenomena to physical events. For the behavior and guidance of growth cones, it remains largely unclear how biochemical events in the cytoplasm are linked to the morphological changes of the growth cone. We take a computational approach to simulate the biochemical signaling cascade involving members of the Rho family of GTPases and examine their potential roles in growth-cone motility and axon guidance.

40|$|Being {{able to stop}} (or inhibit) {{an action}} rapidly as in a stop-signal task is an {{essential}} human ability. Previous studies showed that when a pre-stimulus cue warned of the possible need to stop a response in an upcoming trial, participants’ response time (RT) increased if the subsequent trial required a go response (i. e., go RT cost) relative to a trial where this uncertainty was not present. This increase of the go RT correlated with more efficient response stopping. However, it remains a question whether foreknowledge of upcoming inhibition trials given prior to the task is sufficient to modulate neural activity associated with the primary go responses irrespective of whether stopping an overt response is required. We presented three task conditions with identical primary (i. e., go) response trials but without pre-stimulus cues. Participants were informed that Condition 1 had only go trials (All-go condition), Condition 2 required a stop response for some trials (Stop condition), and Condition 3 required a response incongruent with the primary response (i. e., <b>Switch</b> <b>response)</b> for some trials (Switch condition). Participants performed the tasks during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) scans. Results showed {{a significant increase in the}} go RT (cost) in the Stop and Switch conditions relative to the All-go condition. The go RT cost was correlated with decreased inhibition time. fMRI activation in the frontal-basal-ganglia regions during the go responses in the Stop and Switch conditions was also correlated with the efficiency of Stop and Switch responses. These results suggest that foreknowledge prior to the task is sufficient to influence neural activity associated with the primary response and modulate inhibition efficiency, irrespective of whether stopping an overt response is required...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatically {{actuated}} beams {{are common}} elements in microelectromechanical devices {{that serve as}} high-frequency resonators, actuators, and sensors. The present effort serves to develop a comprehensive nonlinear modeling paradigm for such device elements that accounts for nonlinearities due to the electrostatic field, beam deformations, and intermittent mechanical contact. The presence of these complex aspects associated with the force field, the inherent beam behavior and the interactions with rigid obstacles calls for advanced modeling techniques that account for the finite configurational changes via geometrically exact approaches. An immediate practical application is the design of highly sensitive limit switches for use as indicators or control devices in micromechanical systems. The limit switches considered here rely on an abrupt transition of the internal state of the switch between two distinctly different steady-state behaviors {{as a result of}} a small change in the value of a system parameter. The present collaboration will explore a limit-switch design that relies on the abrupt transition associated with the onset of low-velocity impacts between an electrostatically actuated beam element and its environment. This is supported by theoretical predictions indicating a post-trigger response rate that grows beyond all bounds as the threshold parameter value is approached. The proposed phenomenology thus compares favorably with existing designs in terms of guaranteeing a more instantaneous <b>switch</b> <b>response.</b> The proposed research is strongly driven by a combined effort from two complementary backgrounds, that in nonlinear continuum mechanics of Prof. Lacarbonara and that in non-smooth system dynamics and bifurcation theory of Prof. Dankowicz.

Is performance in task-cuing experiments mediated by task-set selection or associative compound retrieval? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 40, 1002 - 1024. [URL] 2014 American Psychological AssociationTask-cuing experiments are usually intended to explore control of task set. But when small stimulus sets are used, they plausibly afford learning of the response associated {{with a combination of}} cue and stimulus, without reference to tasks. In 3 experiments we presented the typical trials of a task-cuing experiment: a cue (colored shape) followed, after a short or long interval, by a digit to which 1 of 2 responses was required. In a tasks condition, participants were (as usual) directed to interpret the cue as an instruction to perform either an odd/even or a high/low classification task. In a cue + stimulus → response (CSR) condition, to induce learning of mappings between cue-stimulus compound and response, participants were, in Experiment 1, given standard task instructions and additionally encouraged to learn the CSR mappings; in Experiment 2, informed of all the CSR mappings and asked to learn them, without standard task instructions; in Experiment 3, required to learn the mappings by trial and error. The effects of a task <b>switch,</b> <b>response</b> congruence, preparation, and transfer to a new set of stimuli differed substantially between the conditions in ways indicative of classification according to task rules in the tasks condition, and retrieval of responses specific to stimulus-cue combinations in the CSR conditions. Qualitative features of the latter could be captured by an associative learning network. Hence associatively based compound retrieval can {{serve as the basis for}} performance with a small stimulus set. But when organization by tasks is apparent, control via task set selection is the natural and efficient strategy...|$|E
50|$|Optoelectrowetting (OEW) is {{a method}} of liquid droplet {{manipulation}} used in microfluidics applications. This technique builds {{on the principle of}} electrowetting, which has proven useful in liquid actuation due to fast <b>switching</b> <b>response</b> times and low power consumption. Where traditional electrowetting runs into challenges, however, such as in the simultaneous manipulation of multiple droplets, OEW presents a lucrative alternative that is both simpler and cheaper to produce. OEW surfaces are easy to fabricate, since they require no lithography, and have real-time, reconfigurable, large-scale manipulation control, due to its reaction to light intensity.|$|R
25|$|Ukrainian {{is mainly}} spoken in western and central Ukraine. In western Ukraine, Ukrainian {{is also the}} {{dominant}} language in cities (such as Lviv). In central Ukraine, Ukrainian and Russian are both equally used in cities, with Russian being more common in Kiev, while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russian is primarily used in cities, and Ukrainian is used in rural areas. These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question <b>switches</b> <b>responses</b> of a significant group of people.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} fast {{electro-optic}} <b>switching</b> (<b>response</b> time 0. 1 ms) of a blue-phase-polymer templated nematic with a broad-temperature range of thermodynamic stability and hysteresis-free performance. The nematic fills a polymer template that imposes a periodic structure with cubic symmetry and submicron period. In the field-free state, the nematic in polymer template is optically isotropic. An applied electric field causes non-zero optical retardance. The approach thus combines beneficial structural and optical {{features of the}} blue phase (cubic structure with submicron periodicity) and superior thermodynamic stability and electro-optic switching ability of the nematic filler.
