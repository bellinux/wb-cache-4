When the Soviet Union broke up, shares of the Soviet wagon fleet were allocated to the various republics; the smaller ones did not get the better deals. As a feature of the Soviet system, state-owned rail companies provide provided <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> such as free education and housing to their workers. After independence, each country had {{to figure out how to}} address these obligations (without Soviet funding). In Soviet times, marketing was not a concern for railways since their clients were for the most part assigned to them by a central planning agency. To increase revenues after independence, railways had either to find more clients or to increase tariffs.|$|E

40|$|In 1994 the new {{democratic}} South Africa called for the shift in legislation and policies. <b>Social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery post- 1994 has to be aligned with the principles and key themes of developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> heralded by the RDP (1994), the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, {{as well as the}} Copenhagen Commitments to Social Development (1995). In the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> sector, the White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> of 1997 was adopted as <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> policy for South Africa. The White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> is embedded in a developmental approach and charted a new path for <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the promotion of national social development. Developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is a pro poor strategy which strives to promote a welfare system that facilitates the development of human capacity and self-reliance within a caring and enabling socio-economic environment. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery towards a developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> approach in the Vhembe district, Limpopo. A qualitative research approach was used for this study and the research design was an instrumental case study. The sample for the study was selected purposively and included 28 social workers and four supervisors from four sub-districts in the Vhembe district. Data was collected through four focus group interviews with social workers and one-on-one interviews with the supervisors. Research findings indicate that developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery in this district has progressed in terms of protective services to families and children. However, in terms of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the social service sector still lags behind. The overall conclusion is that the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery towards the developmental approach is slow and unsatisfactory. The recommendations of this study are captured in strategies that social workers could use to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery, strategies suggested for supervisors to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> delivery, and lastly strategies on the creation of an enabling environment.

40|$|There was a {{major change}} in 2000 in the {{national}} policy on <b>social</b> <b>welfare.</b> The Long-term Care Insurance System started in April 2000. In addition, in June 2000, drastic amendments were made to the <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Service,</b> after an interval of fifty years. Such changes are having an influence on the management of <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> business. One influence is that management must have a clearer market mechanism for <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> business. Today <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> mainly involve manual labor, and thus, management of personnel expenditures has become the main problem. Although most private companies are diligently carrying out systematic research in HRM (human resource management), in the public <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> business field study HRM is lagging.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{and highlights}} {{the economic and}} social services provided by Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood （EMB） to the Egyptian society. Furthermore, this study attempts to examine the political impact of those activities within the Egyptian society in favour of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s political struggle. The study divides the result into economic activities, and <b>social</b> and <b>welfare</b> <b>services.</b> In the case of economic activities, the study claims that the EMB mainly engaged its activities through its non-member sympathizers while the <b>social</b> and <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> are mostly visible in the health and the educational sectors. The visibility of the <b>social</b> and <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> has been described by some scholars as a turned blind eye from the government authorities toward the group’s robust <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> sector. 本論文では、政府と対立するエジプトのムスリムブラザーフッド（EMB）がエジプト社会に対してもたらした経済的、社会的サービスを概観し、説明している。その上で、エジプトのムスリムブラザーフッドの政治活動が、エジプト社会にもたらした政治的な影響の分析を試みている。本論文では、その結果を経済活動と社会福祉サービスに分類する。経済活動においては、EMB は主に非メンバーの支援者を通じて活動しているため目立たない一方で、保健と教育分野における社会福祉サービスにおいては、目に見える形で活動が行われている。こうした社会福祉サービスの可視化は、政府がEMB の多くの社会福祉分野活動に対して、見て見ぬふりをしている証拠であると一部の学者によって説明されている...|$|R
