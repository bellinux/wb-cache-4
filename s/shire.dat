The Senators already had two first basemen in Joe Judge and Joe Kuhel and, when reports {{surfaced}} that <b>Shires</b> was complaining about being a reserve player and that his work ethic was lacking, Senators owner Clark Griffith sold <b>Shires</b> to the minor league Milwaukee Brewers for a reported $10,000 in November 1930. With typical bombast, <b>Shires</b> claimed {{that he was too}} good a player to be sitting on a major league bench and predicted that he would hit, [...] "around [...]350" [...] for Milwaukee. In December 1930, <b>Shires</b> was arrested in Hollywood, California on charges of drunkenness and carrying concealed weapons.

5000|$|In December 1929, <b>Shires</b> {{tried his}} hand at boxing, taking 21 seconds to {{knockout}} an unknown fighter named Dan Daly. <b>Shires</b> entered the arena wearing a robe with the words [...] "Arthur The Great Shires" [...] printed on back. It was reported on December 14 that Chicago Cubs player Hack Wilson signed a contract to meet <b>Shires</b> in the ring in January. On December 18, Shires' boxing career suffered a setback when he lost a bout to Chicago Bears football player George Trafton. Seeing no benefit in fighting a defeated boxer, Wilson backed out of his proposed bout with <b>Shires.</b> In late December, <b>Shires</b> was suspended by the Michigan State Boxing Commission and the National Boxing Association after his boxing manager was alleged to have offered money to a future <b>Shires</b> opponent to lose a fight on purpose. Soon after that revelation, Dan Daly admitted to the Illinois State Boxing Commission that he too had lost his fight to <b>Shires</b> on purpose. <b>Shires</b> was eventually cleared from any wrongdoing by the boxing commissions after no evidence was found that he had fixed the fights.|$|R
5|$|In 1878, the British {{organisation}} {{now known}} as the <b>Shire</b> Horse Society was created, with the American <b>Shire</b> Horse Association beginning in 1885. The breed was exported from Britain to the United States in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but popularity fell as mechanisation increased, reaching a low point in the 1950s and 1960s. Popularity began to increase again in the 1970s and after. However, population numbers are still considered to be at critical levels by both the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the US-based American Livestock Breeds Conservancy.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the English Cart Horse Society was formed, and in 1884 {{changed its}} name to the <b>Shire</b> Horse Society. The Society {{published}} a stud book, with the first edition in 1878 containing 2,381 stallions and records dating back to 1770. Between 1901 and 1914, 5,000 Shires were registered each year with the society. The first Shires were imported to the United States in 1853, with large numbers of horses being imported in the 1880s. The American <b>Shire</b> Horse Association was established in 1885 to register and promote the breed. The <b>Shire</b> soon became popular in the United States, and almost 4,000 Shires were imported between 1900 and 1918. Approximately 6,700 Shires were registered with the US association between 1909 and 1911. Around the time of Second World War, increasing mechanisation and strict regulations on the purchase of livestock feed reduced the need for and ability to keep draught horses. Thousands of Shires were slaughtered and several large breeding studs closed. The breed fell to its lowest point in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1955 fewer than 100 horses were shown at the annual British Spring Show.|$|E
