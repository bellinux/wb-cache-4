40|$|This study {{seeks to}} provide a {{long-term}} context for {{the growing number of}} trend analyses which have been applied to river flows in Europe. Most studies apply trend tests to fixed periods, in relatively short (generally 1960 s–present) records. This study adopts an alternative "multi-temporal" approach, whereby trends are fitted to every possible combination of start and end years in a record. The method is applied to 132 catchments with long (1932 – 2004) hydrometric records from northern and central Europe, which were chosen as they are minimally anthropogenically influenced and have good quality data. The catchments are first clustered into five regions, which are broadly homogenous in terms of interdecadal variability of annual mean flow. The multi-temporal trend approach was then applied to regional time series of different hydrological indicators (annual, monthly and high and low flows). The results reveal that the magnitude and even direction of <b>short-term</b> <b>trends</b> are heavily influenced by interdecadal variability. Some <b>short-term</b> <b>trends</b> revealed in previous studies are shown to be unrepresentative of long-term change. For example, previous studies have identified post- 1960 river flow decreases in southern and eastern Europe: in parts of eastern Europe, these trends are resilient to study period, extending back to the 1930 s; in southern France, longer records show evidence of positive trends which reverse from the 1960 s. Recent (post- 1960) positive trends in northern Europe are also not present in longer records, due to decadal variations influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation. The results provide a long-term reference for comparison with published and future studies. The multi-temporal approach advocated here is recommended for use in future trend assessments, to help contextualise <b>short-term</b> <b>trends.</b> Future work should also attempt to explain the decadal-scale variations that drive <b>short-term</b> <b>trends,</b> and thus develop more sophisticated methods for trend detection that take account of interdecadal variability and its drivers...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To describe, evaluate, {{and suggest}} interpretations for an {{observed}} aggregate-level relation between trends in mortality from cirrhosis and {{per capita consumption}} of distilled spirits in the United States. DESIGN: Trend analysis using data on US cirrhosis mortality and per capita alcohol consumption. RESULTS: There is a consistent long-term trend relation between mortality from cirrhosis and per capita consumption of distilled spirits in the United States from 1949 to 1994. Two instances of comparatively sharp drops in the consumption of spirits in the 1940 s generated mixed results in predicting changes in cirrhosis mortality. CONCLUSIONS: An aggregate-level relation between trends in long-term cirrhosis mortality and the consumption of spirits falls considerably short of establishing a direct causal link between the two for individuals. Moreover, two sharp drops in the consumption of spirits generated only mixed results {{with respect to the}} <b>short-term</b> <b>trend</b> in cirrhosis.

40|$|Wollongong, Australia is {{an urban}} site at the {{intersection}} of anthropogenic, biomass burning, biogenic and marine sources of atmospheric trace gases. The location offers a valuable opportunity to study drivers of atmospheric composition in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, a record of surface carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) was measured with an in situ Fourier transform infrared trace gas analyser between April 2011 and August 2014. Clean air was found to arrive at Wollongong in approximately 10 % of air masses. Biomass burning influence was evident in the average annual cycle of clean air CO during austral spring. A significant negative <b>short-term</b> <b>trend</b> was found in clean air CO (− 1. 5 nmol mol− 1 a− 1), driven by a reduction in northern Australian biomass burning. Significant <b>short-term</b> positive <b>trends</b> in clean air CH 4 (5. 4 nmol mol− 1 a− 1) and CO 2 (1. 9 μmol mol− 1 a− 1) were consistent with the long-term global average trends. Polluted Wollongong air was investigated using wind-direction/wind-speed clustering, which revealed major influence from local urban and industrial sources from the south. High values of CH 4, with anthropogenic ΔCH 4 /ΔCO 2 enhancement ratio signatures, originated from the northwest, in the direction of local coal mining. A pollution climatology was developed for the region using back trajectory analysis and ΔO 3 /ΔCO enhancement ratios. Ozone production environments in austral spring and summer were associated with anticyclonic meteorology on the east coast of Australia, while ozone depletion environments in autumn and winter were associated with continental transport, or fast moving trajectories from southern latitudes. This implies the need to consider meteorological conditions when developing policies for controlling air quality...|$|R

The BDI is influenced by many factors, especially the random incidents in dry bulk market, inducing the difficulty in forecasting of BDI. Therefore, to eliminate the impact of random incidents in dry bulk market, wavelet transform is adopted to denoise the BDI data series. Hence, the combined model of wavelet transform and support vector machine is developed to forecast BDI in this paper. Lastly, the BDI data in 2005 to 2012 are presented to test the proposed model. The 84 prior consecutive monthly BDI data are the inputs of the model, and the last 12 monthly BDI data are the outputs of model.
