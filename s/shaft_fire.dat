50|$|A bad <b>shaft</b> <b>fire</b> {{and water}} {{difficulties}} at their Tombstone properties led to bankruptcy and forced Imperial to lease its holdings to Asarco in 1911. Asarco began optioning Imperial claims in 1915, ultimately acquiring {{all of the}} company's assets - including the railroad and the smelter at Sasco - by 1919. Under Asarco's early tenure, Silverbell again served as the company headquarters and workers' community. Its population temporarily rebounded to 1,200 in 1920. Although the Sasco smelter closed in 1919, after only about four years of renewed operation, the electrical plant continued to supply power to Silver Bell and the mines. The post office, which had also closed in 1911, was reopened in 1916.|$|E
50|$|The {{explosion}} caused {{significant damage}} to mine’s roadways {{and to the}} bottom of the main <b>shaft.</b> Several <b>fires</b> ignited the coal seams and supporting timber structures filling the mine with smoke.|$|R
50|$|From the 13th-18th storeys (they are 20 metres high) {{the tower}} only {{contains}} the lift <b>shafts</b> and the <b>fire</b> escape staircase.|$|R
60|$|Then was flung {{high in the}} air {{what might}} be likened to a <b>shaft</b> of <b>fire</b> filled with {{fragments}} of iron, wood, and human flesh, rising higher and higher until its force was spent, when it fell outwardly as falls a column of water broken by the wind.|$|R
5000|$|Zorin and May Day capture Sutton and Bond at City Hall {{and frame}} them for murdering Howe. They trap Sutton and Bond in an {{elevator}} and set the elevator <b>shaft</b> on <b>fire.</b> Sutton and Bond escape the burning building. They steal a fire truck when officers on scene attempt to detain them for Howe's murder.|$|R
50|$|Here {{the spear}} shaft is not {{connected}} to a gun or buoy. This is more commonly associated with spearfishing on SCUBA where excess cable or line can be problematic. Also {{it can be used}} in the areas with exceptionally clear water, where underwater hunter can track his <b>shaft</b> after <b>firing</b> it. It is not used in turbid waters with poor visibility.|$|R
5000|$|The tower, which {{rises from}} one of the main entrances, has a clock face on all four sides. When first opened, the clock tower also served as a hose tower and a {{ventilation}} <b>shaft</b> for the <b>fire</b> headquarters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{explosion}} {{manifested itself}} in a volume of flame and dust at the number two or downcast shaft, followed seconds later by a volume of flame from the upcast or number one <b>shaft</b> which set <b>fire</b> to the wooden sheds or headings above it.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the forest}} lands was logged out during the gold rush era of the mid-1800s. During this time, the forest was intensively logged, the wood {{products}} used as tunnel supports, sleepers for tramways, lining of mining <b>shafts,</b> to <b>fire</b> mine boilers, piles for piers and docks, electric poles, heavy construction timbers and fuel wood. It was only in 1860 that the 1860 Land Act (Section 80) was created, prohibiting the slashing and subtraction of trees. Eleven years later, in 1871, the Wombat State Forest was established.|$|R
5000|$|The Avondale Mine {{disaster}} was {{a massive}} fire at the Avondale Colliery near Plymouth, Pennsylvania, on September 6, 1869. It caused the death of 110 workers. It started when the wooden lining of the mine <b>shaft</b> caught <b>fire</b> and ignited the coal breaker built directly overhead. The shaft was the only entrance and exit to the mine, and the fire trapped and suffocated 108 of the workers (the other two fatalities were rescuers). It was the greatest mine disaster to that point in American history.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} {{built by the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O), which became {{a component of the}} Chessie System in 1972, then was merged into CSX in 1987. A well-known landmark along Sand Patch Grade is the 4,475 ft Sand Patch Tunnel, which was constructed between 1854 and 1871. The original one-track tunnel was abandoned after a two-track tunnel was completed nearby in 1912. The tunnels used vertical ventilation <b>shafts</b> with <b>fires</b> in them to circulate air. The original tunnel was abandoned in 1917 and is now flooded and collapsed in places.|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 22 September 1934 at 2:08 a.m. {{a violent}} {{explosion}} {{ripped through the}} Dennis section of the Gresford colliery coalfield. The explosion, which happened more than 1.3 mi away {{from the bottom of}} the Dennis main <b>shaft,</b> started <b>fires</b> and blocked the main access road to all the other districts in the section. At the time up to 500 men were working underground on the night shift with more than half in the affected areas. The rest were in the Martin section about 2 mi from the explosion; many there were unaware for some time afterwards that a disaster had occurred.|$|R
50|$|Even {{in ancient}} times, {{charcoal}} was manufactured in kilns. Logs were {{arranged in a}} conical heap (a charcoal kiln or pile) around posts, a <b>fire</b> <b>shaft</b> was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the <b>fire</b> <b>shaft</b> and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350 °C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the kiln, the charcoal burner could assess {{the state of the}} carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization.|$|R
50|$|The Dikuluwe mine near Musonoi {{has been}} {{exploited}} since prehistoric times. Monseigneur de Hemptinne watched Yeke people working this mine as late as 1924. They would work in the dry season, stopping when the first rains arrived. The mining camp was near a stream where millet could be planted. Women and children collected malachite from the surface, while men used iron picks to excavate pits and <b>shafts,</b> using <b>fire</b> to crack the rocks when needed. The mines were between 10 m and 15 m deep with galleries up to 20 m long. The ore would be sorted and then taken to a nearby stream for concentration before being smelted.|$|R
60|$|We {{asked if}} there really was any country beyond the mountains, and Kou-en {{answered}} wearily that he believed so. Either in this or in a previous life he had heard that people lived there who worshipped fire. Certainly also {{it was true that}} about thirty years ago a brother who had climbed the great peak yonder to spend some days in solitary meditation, returned and reported that he had seen a marvellous thing, namely, a <b>shaft</b> of <b>fire</b> burning in the heavens beyond those same mountains, though whether this were a vision, or what, he could not say. He recalled, however, that about that time they had felt a great earthquake.|$|R
6000|$|Imagine a great iron-bound crate {{of burning}} coal, hanging over a gulf of {{darkness}} faintly showing the brickwork {{of the base}} of a chimney. [...] "We're {{at the bottom of the}} <b>shaft.</b> That <b>fire</b> makes a draught that sucks up the foul air from the bottom of the pit. There's another down-draw shaft in another part of the mine where the clean air comes in. We aren't going to set the mines on fire. There's an earth and brick floor at the bottom of the pit; the crate hangs over. It isn't so deep as you think." [...] Then a devil--a naked devil--came in with a pitchfork and fed the spouting flames. This was perfectly in keeping with the landscape.|$|R
50|$|Prehistoric {{mines in}} the Katanga belt {{have been found}} at Dikuluwe near Musonoi, Tenke-Fungurume, Kambove, Luisha, Ruashi and Etoile, and at the Naviundo and Luano archaeological sites.

30|$|Misfire and fire-through {{are defined}} as {{the failure of the}} {{converter}} switch to TURN-ON and TURN-OFF at a scheduled conducting and non-conducting periods respectively. The effect of fire through and misfire of WEGS for fraction of seconds at a switch of either GSC or RSC produces oscillations in output power and voltage. Misfire has very little effect on DFIG output and <b>shaft</b> speed than <b>fire</b> through fault [46]. SMES compensates the deviation in DFIG output during misfire or fire through faults.|$|R
50|$|During early May 1897, {{dynamite}} {{had been}} used to enable the extension of the workings in the lowest part in order for the working levels to be extended and an inspection of the mine had been undertaken by the Government Inspector, along with the Mine Captain on Friday 7 May, the purpose of which was to ensure there was sufficient ventilation, with their findings being satisfactory. Miners had finished their shift on Saturday 8 May, and the mine was closed the following day, Sunday 9 May. Due to inadequate safety measures a stray candle had been allowed to continue burning which in turn set fire to a nearby pit prop consequently starting a <b>fire</b> in the <b>shaft.</b> The <b>fire</b> would have continued burning so long as oxygen was present, the process forming carbon monoxide which filled the lower parts of the shaft.|$|R
60|$|In a month her deck {{was almost}} leveled, but the muddy flood that gurgled about her still lay beneath her {{corroded}} water line, and Jefferson {{seized the opportunity}} of laying out an anchor to heave on before the stream ran too strong. The launch's boiler had given out, and they lashed her to the surfboat, with the hatch covers as a bracing between, but they spent an afternoon over it before Jefferson was satisfied, and the thick, steamy night was closing in when they warped the double craft under the Cumbria's forecastle. It rose above them blackly, with a blaze of flickering radiance over it where the blast-lamp hurled a <b>shaft</b> of <b>fire</b> upwards into the rain. Floundering figures cut against the uncertain brilliancy, voices came down muffled through the deluge, {{and there was a}} creaking and groaning as the ponderous stream anchor swung out overhead.|$|R
50|$|Designed by E. H. Blumenthal, the Monte Vista Fire Station is {{a two-story}} Pueblo Revival {{building}} with a three-story corner tower. The building is constructed from structural clay tile and stuccoed to resemble New Mexico's traditional adobe buildings with stepped parapets, projecting vigas, and ladders. The tower has staggered windows following the stairs inside and contains a three-story central <b>shaft</b> for drying <b>fire</b> hoses. The building retains its original 14 ft garage doors and wood-framed 6/6 sash windows. A matching addition {{at the rear of}} the building was added in 1952 to accommodate larger trucks.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel {{underwent}} {{major changes}} in the three years it remained closed after the fire. Renovations include computerised detection equipment, extra security bays, a parallel escape <b>shaft</b> and a <b>fire</b> station {{in the middle of the}} tunnel complete with double cabbed fire trucks. The safety shafts also have clean air flowing through them via vents. Any people in the security bays now have video contact with the control centre, so they can communicate with the people trapped inside and inform them about what is happening in the tunnel more clearly.|$|R
50|$|The {{collapsing}} roof {{released a}} large amount of firedamp, a naturally occurring flammable gas, which frequentlyly caused explosions as it had in the previous accident of 1870. Unfortunately there were several miners nearby who were using a naked flame. Davy lamps and other safety lights had been available since 1815 but were not readily available for the miners who were expected to buy their own and it was common practice for open lanterns to be used. The resulting explosions collapsed further <b>shafts</b> after setting <b>fire</b> to the support beams and caused the deaths of the 54 men.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Austin {{had gone}} down to the stoke-hold. The place was dimly lighted, and insufferably hot, for, with the Cumbria stationary, no more air came down the ventilator <b>shafts</b> than the <b>fires</b> would draw, and they were burning sulkily. In fact, it was only by strenuous labour that steam could be raised at all. Here and there the pale flicker of an oil lamp emphasised the gloom, though there were three half-moon patches of brightness {{in each of the}} two boilers, until a fierce red glow beat out as Tom, the donkey-man, flung open a furnace door. Then Austin gained some impression of his surroundings.|$|R
40|$|Flame retardancy of wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) {{needs to}} be improved to widen the applications for these composites. This may be accomplished by protecting both polymer matrix and wood filler with a fire-retardant (FR). In this study, hardly inflammable particleboard converted into wood flour (B 1 -particleboard flour) was used in combination with several halogen-free FRs. The fire performance and thermal properties of the WPC (matrix: recycled polypropylene) were investigated using limiting oxygen index analysis (LOI), a modified single-flame source test, <b>fire</b> <b>shaft</b> test and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The combination of B 1 -particleboard flour, expandable graphite and red phosphorous led to the highest LOI (38. 3). However, at the same time, relatively high water absorption of this formulation was observed which was attributed to the reaction of ammonium polyphosphate in the B 1 -particleboard flour and red phosphorous which was added during the compounding step, leading to increased hydrophilicity of the composite. The combination of B 1 -particleboard flour and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) or phosphorized expandable graphite to protect the polymer matrix offered the best overall performance when taking into account LOI (here: 34 – 35), tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and water absorption values. The WPC-formulation including B 1 -particleboard flour and APP did not pass {{the requirements of the}} German <b>fire</b> <b>shaft</b> test according to DIN 4102 - 1, however, the duration until smoke gas temperature exceeded 200 °C was more than doubled compared to a commercial WPC-profile based on PP without fire-retardants. The modified single-flame source test showed that all WPC formulations were self-extinguishing...|$|R

While a significant number died from flames, a greater number of deaths were caused by suffocation from the thick, black smoke. Around 900 guests were able to leave the building but some 150 had to be rescued by the fire services and by heroic members of the public, including two sailors who were reported to have rescued 27 people between them. Two-thirds of hotel fire deaths in 1946 occurred in the La Salle and Winecoff (Atlanta) fires. The hotel fire was so devastating, it resulted in the Chicago city council enacting new hotel building codes and fire-fighting procedures, including the installation of automatic alarm systems and instructions of fire safety inside the hotel rooms.|$|R
60|$|We left Damascus at {{noon and}} rode across the plain {{a couple of}} hours, and then the party stopped a while {{in the shade of}} some fig-trees to {{give me a chance to}} rest. It was the hottest day we had seen yet--the sun-flames shot down like the <b>shafts</b> of <b>fire</b> that stream out before a blow-pipe--the rays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the head and pass {{downward}} like rain from a roof. I imagined I could distinguish between the floods of rays--I thought I could tell when each flood struck my head, when it reached my shoulders, and when the next one came. It was terrible. All the desert glared so fiercely that my eyes were swimming in tears all the time. The boys had white umbrellas heavily lined with dark green. They were a priceless blessing. I thanked fortune that I had one, too, notwithstanding it was packed up with the baggage and was ten miles ahead. It is madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella. They told me in Beirout (these people who always gorge you with advice) that it was madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella. It was on this account that I got one.|$|R
40|$|Smoke back-layering flow {{length is}} {{the length of}} the {{reversed}} smoke flow upstream of the fire when the longitudinal ventilation velocity is lower than the critical velocity. This paper experimentally investigates the smoke back-layering flow length of longitudinal ventilated tunnel fires with a vertical shaft in the upstream (0. 5 - 4. 0 m from the fire source) using a 1 / 10 reduced-scale subway tunnel model. Experimental results show that the vertical shaft in the upstream can control the smoke back-layering flow length within a relatively limited range, compared to the tunnel without vertical shaft. Moreover, for the cases that the fire source is not located exactly below the vertical shaft, the most appropriate dimensionless distance between the vertical <b>shaft</b> and <b>fire</b> source is 3, resulting in the shortest smoke back-layering flow length. By introducing a concept of virtual fire source below vertical shaft, a new empirical model was further deduced to predict the smoke back-layering flow length. Its predictions fit reasonably well when the dimensionless longitudinal flow velocity is less than 0. 19. Beyond that, the predictions are little higher than the experiments, which is because some of the assumptions in this model are invalid under higher longitudinal ventilation velocity...|$|R

25|$|It {{was in the}} North <b>Shaft</b> that a <b>fire</b> {{occurred}} in 1952, which caused the greatest single loss {{of life in the}} mine's entire history. An electrical fault one weekend may have started the fire. When the men went to work on the Monday morning (7 July 1952), the air compressor was started up, and air from a broken air line fanned the flames, releasing poisonous carbon monoxide gas which began to circulate round the mine. Some of the men began to collapse when they reached the 175Fathom Level. Four men who had descended the 940N Winze were killed, and rescuers were driven out of the mine by the gas. The bodies could not be recovered until 16 July, and the mine did not reopen until 1 September.|$|R
