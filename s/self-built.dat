5|$|Following Lego Racers success, news {{arose in}} April 2001 that Pocket Studios {{was working on}} a sequel to the Game Boy Advance version of Lego Racers, titled Lego Racers 2, which was then shown at E3 2001 in May that year. The eponymous Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 {{counterpart}} to Lego Racers 2, developed by Attention to Detail, was announced in August 2001, and released in September 2001. The sequel followed up immediately after Rocket Racer's deafeat in Lego Racers, who is shown a new opportunity to reclaim his title as world champion, by travelling to Xalax and prove himself worthy of it. After Rocket Racer proceeds to do so and succeeds, the player is tasked to control their <b>self-built</b> protagonist, racing through various worlds based on Lego themes, and eventually face Rocket Racer again. Lego Racers 2 was received less favorably than Lego Racers, and too far incorporated elements from both, Lego Racers and Rollcage, another game developed by Attention to Detail.|$|E

Also, several nationally famous rock groups have been founded in Belo Horizonte, including Jota Quest, Pato Fu, Skank, 14 Bis and Tianastácia. In later years, Belo Horizonte has been more frequently included in Brazilian tours of foreign mainstream and independent acts.|$|E
25|$|AGS {{took another}} step ahead in 1978 when the team started {{competing}} in the European Formula 2 Championship. Still, the car - by now the AGS JH15 - was self-penned (by Vanderpleyn), <b>self-built</b> and self-run. Formula 2 was a difficult task for the small team, racing 1978 and 1979 without scoring any championship points. The early 1980s were somewhat better. AGS {{was one of the}} few teams who ran its own cars (Maurer, Minardi and Merzario were the others), and eventually the team was able to score points regularly. Soon some victories came, too. AGS made history when works driver Philippe Streiff won the final race of Formula 2 in 1984, using an AGS JH19C.|$|E
25|$|Nivkhs {{lived in}} {{two types of}} <b>self-built</b> winter {{dwelling}}s. Most ancient of these was the ryv (or to). The dwelling was a round dugout about 7.5 meters (23feet) in diameter, shored up by wooden poles and covered with packed dirt and grass. The ryv had a fireplace {{in the center and}} a smoke hole for light and smoke escape. The other type of dwelling used for winter is the chad ryv similar to the Nanai dio which was modeled after Manchurian and Chinese dwellings of the Amur. The chad ryv were one-room structures with a gable roof and a kan (Korean furnace) for heating. A nearby shed held sledges, skis, boats, and dogs.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{growth in}} São Paulo has {{followed}} three patterns {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, <b>self-built</b> housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.|$|E
25|$|The year 1975 saw {{a turning}} point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With {{financial}} support from Phonogram Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the Autobahn album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up {{in the form of a}} quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The pair also started singing live for the first time, Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on <b>self-built</b> electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.|$|E

500|$|Sumner largely {{acted as}} the band's director, a role he {{continued}} in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument {{on a few}} recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, [...] "He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, {{because no one else}} would play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using <b>self-built</b> synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E
500|$|As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering {{performs}} {{science and}} physics experiments {{in a lab}} coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and prefers [...] "things that are more mental, using mental powers". He later explained: [...] "It's all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [...] going 'Is it [...] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don't do". Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay, mind reader Max Maven and Eugene Burger as influences on his technique. His performances often involve intricate <b>self-built</b> machines.|$|E
500|$|Home was {{investigated}} by Crookes in a <b>self-built</b> laboratory {{at the rear}} of his house at Mornington Road, North London in 1871. No plans of the laboratory have been found and there is no contemporary description of it. Crookes wrote the board and spring balance experiment was a success with Home and had proven [...] "beyond doubt" [...] the existence of a [...] "psychic force." [...] However, the experiment could be easily dismissed as the result of vibrations caused by the passage of Euston trains in the large railway cutting near his house in London. The experiment was not repeatable and sometimes failed to produce any phenomena. The experiment was rejected and ridiculed by the scientific community for lack of scientific controls. In the experiment Home refused for Crookes to be near him and would draw attention to something {{on the other side of}} the room, or make conversation for diversionary signals.|$|E

2500|$|The Plan of the Avenues was {{implemented}} during the 1920s {{and sought to}} build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods [...] The plan also led {{to the expansion of}} bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system. This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of <b>self-built</b> single-family houses.|$|E

2500|$|A minor hit in 1965, [...] "Wine and Women", {{led to the}} group's first LP, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By 1966 Festival was, however, on {{the verge}} of {{dropping}} them from the Leedon roster because of their perceived lack of commercial success. It was at this time that they met the American-born songwriter, producer and entrepreneur Nat Kipner, who had just been appointed A manager of a new independent label, Spin Records. Kipner briefly took over as the group's manager and successfully negotiated their transfer to Spin in exchange for granting Festival the Australian distribution rights to the group's recordings. Through Kipner the Bee Gees met engineer-producer, Ossie Byrne, who produced (or co-produced with Kipner) many of the earlier Spin recordings, most of which were cut at his own small, <b>self-built</b> St Clair Studio in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville. Byrne gave the Gibb brothers virtually unlimited access to St Clair Studio {{over a period of several}} months in mid-1966. The group later acknowledged that this enabled them to greatly improve their skills as recording artists. During this productive time they recorded a large batch of original material—including the song that would become their first major hit, [...] "Spicks and Specks" [...] (on which Byrne played the trumpet coda)—as well as cover versions of current hits by overseas acts such as the Beatles. They regularly collaborated with other local musicians, including members of beat band Steve & The Board, led by Steve Kipner, Nat's teenage son.|$|E
