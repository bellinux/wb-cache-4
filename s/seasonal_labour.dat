25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of <b>seasonal</b> migrant <b>labour</b> in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|R

We propose to investigate the opportunity to use labour (family labour and hired, permanent and <b>seasonal,</b> wage <b>labour)</b> as an entry point for a typology of agricultural holdings, with an application on French data from the Census collected in 2000. Then, we characterize the holdings belonging to the groups defined by the typology based on the type of labour...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} impact of the labour force {{composition}} of farms – the share of family labour, permanent hired <b>labour,</b> and <b>seasonal</b> hired <b>labour</b> – on farm productivity. A simple transformation of a Cobb-Douglas function allows us to estimate the relative efficiency of each labour force. Our estimation is based on specialised fruit and vegetable farms over the period 1995 - 2006 drawn from the French sample of the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We show that the labour force composition affects the farm’s productivity and that family workers are less productive than hired workers even if the specialisation of some hired worker in seasonal high productivity tasks is taking into account. The results suggest that this difference is linked with productivity gains inherent to task specialisation. We also find that seasonal workers are not less productive than permanent ones altought seasonal work in agriculture is synonymous with low earnings, job insecurity and absence of career development...|$|R

This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities.

5000|$|Since 1905 a semi-governmental agency {{called the}} [...] "Head Office of Farm Workers" [...] {{took up the}} {{engagement}} of workers from outside Germany. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>labour</b> contracts {{to the detriment of}} Polish workers allowed the opportunity for many corrupt practices. The immigrant workers were poorly paid, exploited and - in practicality - totally unprotected. Nevertheless, the influx of candidates was always large and, in the eve of World War I, the number of immigrant workers exceeded 500,000 persons, 80% of them from the struggling Russian-controlled part of Poland. Approximately 200,000 Poles worked in the eastern provinces of Prussia among low living standards and intensive exploitation. A male worker could save 100-150 Marks per year, while a female worker could save 50-100 Marks per year at best.|$|E
50|$|Since 2007 {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme in New Zealand, in which New Zealand horticultural businesses can source <b>seasonal</b> <b>labour</b> from several Pacific Islands including Vanuatu, a small number of New Zealand businesses have sourced their RSE labour from Epi, primarily from the Lamen Bay area. Each year between 50 and 80 workers are recruited. These workers spend up to seven months of the year in New Zealand working as seasonal labourers in the horticultural industry; returning {{at the end of the}} period with their savings. A worker on the scheme could be anticipated to save approximately 450 000 Vatu over the seven-month work period. This has provided a substantial cash injection to the local economy and improved the living conditions of many of the residents and their families.|$|E

With the numbers of sheep and goats in the hundreds of thousands for polities, animal husbandry must have been practiced with a significant element of mobility, often over long distance. Porter understands these animal husbandry practices to have been undertaken as family-based activities, providing for the <b>seasonal</b> fluctuations in <b>labour</b> requirements of animal husbandry and acting against the socially fragmenting nature of long-distance mobility, a ‘geography of kinship’ acting to maintain socio-political coherence over geographically vast polities.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} basic {{standards}} for HIV related integrated biological and behavioural surveillance (IBBS) survey implementation, specific challenges of survey management, and to propose brief practical guidelines for management of IBBS surveys in resource limited setting. Methods: Two methods {{were used to}} address our study objectives: (a) a narrative {{review of the literature}} and (b) our experience as participant observer when working on IBBS survey management between July 2012 and January 2013 in Nepal. Results: In Nepal, IBBS surveys are conducted among key populations at higher risk of HIV such as people who inject drugs, {{men who have sex with}} men, female sex workers, <b>seasonal</b> male <b>labour</b> migrants and truckers (proxy for clients of female sex workers). The involvement of different institutions, people, and procedures makes IBBS survey management-including planning, implementation, sharing of findings and possible uses of survey findings-complicated to perform. In addition, basic survey methods and techniques including respondent driven sampling and two stage cluster sampling, are sometimes not properly performed in practice. Conclusions: This study showed that field implementation of some standards methods such as respondent driven sampling and cluster sampling for HIV related estimate or trends used for IBBS survey could be improved. This paper described lessons learnt and may be used as a guiding reference to improve and evaluate IBBS surveys in resource-poor settings also outside of Nepal...|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{isolated}} location, the Verzasca Valley {{is claimed}} {{as one of}} the valleys that could keep the best its originality. The secluded geographical location made it unattractive for conquerors since the Roman period, and even before. First traces of settlement have been found from the early 2nd millennium BC in its south. In Berzona, a locality (frazione) of Vogorno, situated on the hiking trail, Sass di Striöi (literally: witches stone) is situated, a shell rock probably around 600-700 BC; there are about 90 such carved rocks in the Verzasca Valley. Although initially free farmers, the valley was from about 1410 alternately ruled by the Swiss Confederacy, Savoy, Leventia and the Rusca family. In the European Middle Ages, the population were mainly pastoralists, and since the early 17th century, many residents had leave for <b>seasonal</b> <b>labour</b> outside their home valley; still unemployed young men were recruited as mercenaries for foreign armies. In two quarries also granite is mined by local workers.|$|E
50|$|In 1896 {{the railway}} line linked Childers to Cordalba, and later {{extended}} on to Dallamil and Booyal, which helped {{to build the}} number of settlers {{in the area and}} brought more people into Childers for shopping and recreation. As the sugar industry developed, the population of the district was swelled enormously by seasonal workers who came in to cut the cane harvest by hand. Special Saturday trains were laid on to take workers into Childers for shopping and to return them late at night. This influx of business contributed in a major way to the prosperity of the town. The closure of some mills in the Interwar period and the changeover to mechanical harvesting in the 1960s substantially reduced this influx of <b>seasonal</b> <b>labour</b> and the change to road transport saw the closure of rail link to Booyal closed in 1955 and to Childers itself in 1964.

It is a good source of Vitam in C, potassium and dietary fibre. Rhubarb is primarily used as a food ingredient but has medicinal characteristics as well. It can be marketed fresh, frozen, processed or as a nutraceutical 1. A commercial sized operation will require capital investment for production and processing equipment.

Here the empirical data are weak and it is hazardous to average them from {{a small number of}} detailed models or cases. This is especially true of the discussion about pastoral labour, the elephant in the room in most analyses of pastoral development. Pastoral labour has very different characteristics from agricultural labour (very significant role played by individual skills and knowledge so that one hour's input by person A is very different from an hour put in by person B; substantial economies of scale in some operations with large step jumps in labour requirements between herd size categories; wide <b>seasonal</b> differences in <b>labour</b> demand but year-round labour inputs required; large differences in the skills required for different tasks), but we scarcely begin to understand pastoral labour so far.|$|R
