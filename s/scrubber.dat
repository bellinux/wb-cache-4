25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet <b>scrubber</b> which is commonly used. A wet <b>scrubber</b> is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the <b>scrubber.</b> That is, the <b>scrubber</b> turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E
25|$|In {{closed circuit}} SCUBA (rebreather) diving, exhaled carbon dioxide {{must be removed}} from the {{breathing}} system, usually by a <b>scrubber</b> containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO2, such as soda lime. If not removed from the system, it may be re-inhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration, known as <b>scrubber</b> breakthrough.|$|E

5000|$|The highest [...] removal {{efficiencies}} (greater than 90%) {{are achieved}} by wet <b>scrubbers</b> {{and the lowest}} (less than 80%) by dry <b>scrubbers.</b> However, the newer designs for dry <b>scrubbers</b> are capable of achieving efficiencies {{in the order of}} 90%.|$|R
50|$|FRP <b>Scrubbers</b> {{are used}} for {{scrubbing}} fluids. In air pollution control technology, <b>scrubbers</b> come in three varieties, Dry Media, Wet Media, and Biological.|$|R
50|$|However, {{cyclonic}} spray <b>scrubbers</b> are not {{as efficient}} as venturi <b>scrubbers</b> {{because they are not}} capable of producing the same degree of useful turbulence.|$|R
25|$|Particulate {{scrubbers}} Wet <b>scrubber</b> {{is a form}} {{of pollution}} control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet <b>scrubber,</b> the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.|$|E

50|$|Flue gas {{desulfurization}} <b>scrubbers</b> {{have been}} applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that {{range in size from}} 5 MW to 1500 MW. Scottish Power are spending £400 million installing FGD at Longannet power station, which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry <b>scrubbers</b> and spray <b>scrubbers</b> have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically aided <b>scrubbers</b> {{are capable}} of high {{collection}} efficiencies for particles with diameters of 1 μm or greater. However, achieving these high efficiencies usually requires a greater energy input than those of other <b>scrubbers</b> operating at similar efficiencies. In mechanically aided <b>scrubbers,</b> the majority of particle collection occurs in the liquid droplets formed by the rotating blades or rotor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{facility}} has three 168 m smokestacks,one {{of which is}} equipped with flue-gas desulfurization units, commonly called [...] "scrubbers", to remove sulfur oxide. [...] Emissions from <b>scrubbers</b> at the Lambton station could be seen for over 16 km, although with the <b>scrubbers</b> operating properly, these plumes likely had over 90% less SO2 compared with other coal-fired stations without <b>scrubbers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The above cost of {{production}} also excludes the operating cost of the thermal oxidizer and <b>scrubber</b> added in May 2005 in response to odor complaints (see below).|$|E
25|$|<b>Scrubber</b> {{systems are}} used to remove carbon dioxide from the {{breathing}} gas, and other filters to remove odours and other contaminants. Booster pump systems {{are used to}} return gas to high pressure storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{spent acid}} is {{degassed}} in an acid blowdown drum, waste water pH is adjusted and acid vent streams are neutralized with caustic in a <b>scrubber</b> before being flared. Spent acid goes to storage and periodically removed.|$|E

5000|$|Wet media <b>scrubbers</b> {{typically}} douse the polluted {{fluid in}} a scrubbing solution. These vessels must {{be designed to}} more stringent criteria. The design constraints for wet media <b>scrubbers</b> typically include: ...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} number of {{commercial}} <b>scrubbers</b> available, {{it is not possible to}} describe each individual type here. However, the following sections provide examples of typical <b>scrubbers</b> in each category.|$|R
25|$|A similar CO2 <b>scrubber</b> {{has also}} been built by Carbon Engineering. Besides simply {{focusing}} on capturing the CO2, the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the CO2, for example {{in the production of}} fuels, which would thus be carbon-neutral.|$|E
25|$|Internal bell {{gas panel}} {{to supply the}} gas to the divers, and bell reclaim equipment, which {{controls}} the exhaust hose back-pressure, and can shut off the reclaim hose if the diver's gas supply is interrupted. A <b>scrubber</b> for the bell atmosphere and water trap would be included.|$|E
25|$|Prebreathing {{the unit}} (usually for about 3 minutes) shortly before {{entering}} the water is a standard procedure. This ensures that the <b>scrubber</b> material {{gets a chance to}} warm up to operating temperature, and works correctly, and that the partial pressure of oxygen in a closed-circuit rebreather is controlled correctly.|$|E
5000|$|For {{particulate}} control, wet <b>scrubbers</b> (also {{referred to}} as wet collectors) are evaluated against fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). Some advantages of wet <b>scrubbers</b> over these devices are as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO2) {{emissions}} {{are controlled by}} forced oxidation wet <b>scrubbers.</b> The <b>scrubbers</b> consist of two countercurrent-flow absorber vessels on each unit, using limestone slurry sprays to remove more than 92% of SO2 from the flue gas. [...] The three <b>scrubbers</b> in total consume about 24 MW of power, and use 130,000 tons of limestone and 3,000 acre•ft (3,700,000 m3) of water per year, producing 200,000 tons of gypsum per year.|$|R
30|$|<b>Scrubbers</b> are an {{emerging}} technology in shipping, {{but the general}} opinion among shipowners {{seems to be that}} <b>scrubbers</b> are so far not sufficiently reliable for use in maritime environments (cf. AMEC [1], NECL II [34]).|$|R

25|$|Managing CO2 levels was a {{particular}} challenge, {{and a source of}} controversy regarding the Biosphere 2 project's alleged misrepresentation to the public. Daily fluctuation of carbon dioxide dynamics was typically 600 ppm because of the strong drawdown during sunlight hours by plant photosynthesis, followed by a similar rise during the nighttime when system respiration dominated. As expected, there was also a strong seasonal signature to CO2 levels, with wintertime levels as high as 4,000-4,500 ppm and summertime levels near 1,000 ppm. The crew worked to manage the CO2 by occasionally turning on a CO2 <b>scrubber,</b> activating and de-activating the desert and savannah through control of irrigation water, cutting and storing biomass to sequester carbon, and utilizing all potential planting areas with fast-growing species to increase system photosynthesis. In November 1991, investigative reporting in the Village Voice alleged that the crew had secretly installed the CO2 <b>scrubber</b> device, violating Biosphere 2's advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally.|$|E
25|$|Intel {{has been}} accused by some {{residents}} of Rio Rancho, New Mexico of allowing VOCs {{to be released in}} excess of their pollution permit. One resident claimed that a release of 1.4 tons of carbon tetrachloride was measured from one acid <b>scrubber</b> during the fourth quarter of 2003 but an emission factor allowed Intel to report no carbon tetrachloride emissions for all of 2003.|$|E
40|$|This type of {{technology}} {{is a part of}} the group of air pollution controls collectively referred to as “wet <b>scrubbers.</b> ” Fiber-bed <b>scrubbers</b> are also known as wetted-filter <b>scrubbers</b> and mist eliminators. 2. Type of Technology: Removal of air pollutants by inertial and diffusional interception. 3. Applicable Pollutants: Fiber-bed <b>scrubbers</b> are used to collect fine and/or soluble particulate matter (PM) or as mist eliminators to collect liquid aerosols, including inorganic (e. g., sulfuric acid mist) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Insoluble and/or coarse PM will clog the fiber bed with time, and VOC which are difficult to condense will not be collected efficiently (EPA, 1998; Enviro-Chem...|$|R
5000|$|Biological <b>scrubbers</b> are {{structurally}} {{identical to}} the wet media <b>scrubbers,</b> but vary in their design. The vessel {{is designed to be}} larger, so the air moves slower through the vessel. The media is designed to encourage biological growth, and the water that sprays through the vessel is filled with nutrients to encourage bacteria to grow. In such <b>scrubbers,</b> the bacteria scrub the pollutant. Also, instead of a single, large support system (typically 10 feet depth of media for chemical <b>scrubbers),</b> there are multiple stages of media support, that can change the design requirements of the vessel. (See biofilter for similar technology that is usually performed outside of an FRP vessel.) ...|$|R
50|$|Another way to {{classify}} wet <b>scrubbers</b> is by their use - to primarily collect either particulates or gaseous pollutants. Again, this distinction {{is not always}} clear since <b>scrubbers</b> can often be used to remove both types of pollutants.|$|R
25|$|A helium reclaim system (or {{push-pull}} system) {{may be used}} {{to recover}} helium based breathing gas after use by the divers as this is more economical than losing it to the environment in open circuit systems. The recovered gas is passed through a <b>scrubber</b> system to remove carbon dioxide, filtered to remove odours, and pressurised into storage containers, where it may be mixed with oxygen to the required composition.|$|E
25|$|The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Power Station Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project {{will use}} post-combustion, amine-based <b>scrubber</b> {{technology}} to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 {{of the power}} plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields. However, only about a half of this CO2 will actually be permanently stored, the remainder is released into the atmosphere during capturing, and the processing in the oil field.|$|E
25|$|Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or {{dissolved}} {{content of}} organics and gases, before adding {{it to their}} aquaria. This {{can be accomplished by}} additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae <b>scrubber</b> to filter the water naturally.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} wet <b>scrubbers</b> or any air {{pollution}} control device depends on the industrial process conditions {{and the nature of}} the air pollutants involved. Inlet gas characteristics and dust properties (if particles are present) are of primary importance. <b>Scrubbers</b> can be designed to collect particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutants. The versatility of wet <b>scrubbers</b> allow them to be built in numerous configurations, all designed to provide good contact between the liquid and polluted gas stream.|$|R
40|$|In this work, oxidant <b>scrubbers</b> were {{evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to prevent sampling losses of dimethylsulfide caused by reactions with nitrogen dioxide.

Among the <b>scrubbers</b> tested, the best were shown to be the one made with filter paper or glass wool coated with iron (II) sulfate, sulfuric acid and pyrogallic acid, and the one made from with paper coated with triethanolamine. The results obtained under laboratory conditions, using dimethylsulfide standard gas, and in field experiments confirmed that these <b>scrubbers</b> are suitable for the prevention of oxidation during sampling...|$|R
