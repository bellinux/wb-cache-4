25|$|<b>Situs</b> inversus (also called <b>situs</b> transversus or oppositus) is a {{congenital}} {{condition in}} which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as <b>situs</b> solitus while <b>situs</b> inversus is generally the mirror image of <b>situs</b> solitus. Although cardiac problems are more common than in the general population, most people with <b>situs</b> inversus have no medical symptoms or complications resulting from the condition, and until the advent of modern medicine it was usually undiagnosed.|$|E
25|$|In rarer {{cases such as}} <b>situs</b> ambiguus or heterotaxy, <b>situs</b> {{cannot be}} determined. In these patients, the liver may be midline, the spleen absent or multiple, and the bowel malrotated. Often, {{structures}} are duplicated or absent altogether. This {{is more likely to}} cause medical problems than <b>situs</b> inversus totalis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Situs</b> inversus also complicates organ {{transplantation}} operations as donor organs will more likely come from <b>situs</b> solitus (normal) donors. As hearts and livers are chiral, geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped {{in the mirror}} image. For example, a person with <b>situs</b> inversus who requires a heart transplant needs all the vessels to the transplant donor heart reattached to their existing ones. However, the orientation of these vessels in a person with <b>situs</b> inversus is reversed, necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{congenital}} heart defects, individuals with <b>situs</b> inversus are phenotypically normal, and can live normal healthy lives, without any complications related to their medical condition. There is a 5–10% prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with <b>situs</b> inversus totalis, most commonly transposition of the great vessels. The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95% in <b>situs</b> inversus with levocardia.|$|E
25|$|About 25% of {{individuals}} with <b>situs</b> inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development. Normally functioning cilia determine {{the position of the}} internal organs during early embryological development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing <b>situs</b> inversus. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of <b>situs</b> inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Situs</b> inversus {{is found}} in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, <b>situs</b> inversus totalis, it {{involves}} complete transposition (right to left reversal) {{of all of the}} abdominal organs. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, right-hearted). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with <b>situs</b> inversus have no medical symptoms or complications, although they should wear a medical identification tag to warn emergency medical staff that the patient's internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly, e.g. by listening for a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest.|$|E
25|$|In {{his very}} {{influential}} paper, Analysis <b>Situs,</b> Henri Poincaré gave {{a definition of}} a (differentiable) manifold (variété) which served as a precursor to the modern concept of a manifold.|$|E
25|$|Their {{work was}} corrected, {{consolidated}} and greatly extended by Henri Poincaré. In 1895 he published his ground-breaking paper on Analysis <b>Situs,</b> which introduced the concepts {{now known as}} homotopy and homology, which are now considered part of algebraic topology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Situs</b> inversus of {{the optic}} disc may occur {{unilaterally}} or bilaterally, associated with reduced binocularity and stereoacuity resembling monofixation syndrome. It {{is characterized by}} emergence of the retinal vessels in an anomalous direction (from the nasal rather than the temporal aspect) with dysversion (tilt) of the optic disc.|$|E
25|$|Foye {{was born}} with a {{condition}} called <b>situs</b> inversus that caused him to be born with his organs reversed, meaning his heart is {{on the right side of}} his body and his liver is on the left. Foye has two daughters, Paige Christine Foye and Penny Carter Foye.|$|E
25|$|Euler's {{work was}} {{presented}} to the St. Petersburg Academy on 26 August 1735, and published as Solutio problematis ad geometriam <b>situs</b> pertinentis (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics.|$|E
25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the {{interest}} in analysis <b>situs</b> did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked {{long on the}} mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis <b>situs</b> (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite multitude as he called it) of instants.|$|E
25|$|Mirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits {{later in}} the {{embryonic}} stage than normal timing, around day 9–12. This type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as opposite dominant handedness, dental structure, or even organs (<b>situs</b> inversus). If the split occurs later than this time period, the twins risk being conjoined. There is no DNA-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{this element}} is {{expressed}} as {{the intent to}} commit a felony “therein”. The {{use of the word}} “therein” adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. The <b>situs</b> of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} section of Analysis <b>Situs,</b> Poincaré defines a {{manifold}} as the level set of a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the implicit function theorem. In the third section, he begins by remarking that the graph of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter sense. He then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' (une chaîne des variétés).|$|E
25|$|In 1846, Möbius invited Grassmann {{to enter}} a {{competition}} {{to solve a problem}} first proposed by Leibniz: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed analysis <b>situs).</b> Grassmann's Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik, was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.|$|E
25|$|Brouwer's {{approach}} yielded its fruits, and in 1910 he {{also found}} a proof that was valid for any finite dimension, {{as well as other}} key theorems such as the invariance of dimension. In the context of this work, Brouwer also generalized the Jordan curve theorem to arbitrary dimension and established the properties connected with the degree of a continuous mapping. This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincaré and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis <b>situs</b> became algebraic topology.|$|E
25|$|In {{jurisdictional}} strikes, outlawed by Taft–Hartley, a union {{strikes in}} order to assign particular work to the employees it represents. Secondary boycotts and common <b>situs</b> picketing, also outlawed by the act, are actions in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which {{is associated with a}} targeted business. A later statute, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{written by}} Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg and {{published}} in 1736 {{is regarded as the}} first paper in the history of graph theory. This paper, as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the knight problem, carried on with the analysis <b>situs</b> initiated by Leibniz. Euler's formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and L'Huilier, and represents the beginning of the branch of mathematics known as topology.|$|E
25|$|After his conviction, Kamber {{worked as}} a {{lobbyist}} for the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO. Under Robert Georgine, also a Republican, Kamber rose quickly to become the department's chief lobbyist. Kamber's tenure at BCTD was marked by a significant drop in {{the political power of}} the AFL-CIO on Capitol Hill. In 1977, Kamber and the BCTD persuaded the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives to rush a common <b>situs</b> picketing bill onto the floor in the hopes of stampeding members of Congress to approve the legislation. Instead, the tactic lead to a major defeat for labor.|$|E
25|$|But this {{is subject}} to the {{substantial}} exceptions contained in Articles 3–6, the limitations on insurance actions in Articles 7–12, and consumer contracts in Articles 13–15. Article 16 also grants exclusive jurisdiction to specified jurisdictions as the lex <b>situs</b> of immovable property and a res, and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the enforcement of judgments. Subsequent articles allow forum selection clauses and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum. The Brussels Regime therefore represents a harmonised set of rules for the determination of all questions of jurisdiction throughout the EU and EFTA (but not Liechtenstein) excluding FNC.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-18th century, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that certain progressions of mathematical reasoning recurred when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be done in more generality, and then applied to special cases. This method of studying calculus- and analysis-related concepts {{came to be known as}} analysis <b>situs,</b> and later as topology. The important topics in this field were properties of more general figures, such as connectedness and boundaries, rather than properties like straightness, and precise equality of length and angle measurements, which had been the focus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Topology soon became a separate field of major importance, rather than a sub-field of geometry or analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex <b>situs,</b> as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E

2500|$|Although for Leibniz the <b>situs</b> of a {{sequence}} of points is completely determined by {{the distance between them}} and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer Euler, in the famous 1736 paper solving the Königsberg Bridge Problem and its generalizations, used the term geometria <b>situs</b> in such a sense that the <b>situs</b> remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{individuals}} with documented cases of <b>situs</b> inversus include: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Situs</b> inversus is {{generally}} an autosomal recessive genetic condition, {{although it can}} be X-linked or found in identical [...] "mirror image" [...] twins.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>situs</b> inversus is a {{short form}} of the Latin phrase [...] "situs inversus viscerum", meaning [...] "inverted {{position}} of the internal organs".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} <b>situs</b> inversus totalis {{are unaware of}} their unusual anatomy until they seek medical {{attention}} for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a Barium meal or enema. The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms {{will be on the}} atypical side. For example, if an individual with <b>situs</b> inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies. Thus, {{in the event of a}} medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has <b>situs</b> inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their physicians before an examination, so the physician can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. [...] Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{differential equations}} better, a new branch of mathematics was born. Poincaré called it analysis <b>situs.</b> The French Encyclopædia Universalis defines {{it as the}} branch which [...] "treats the properties of an object that are invariant if it is deformed in any continuous way, without tearing". In 1886, Poincaré proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, although the connection with {{the subject of this}} article was not yet apparent. A little later, he developed one of the fundamental tools for better understanding the analysis <b>situs,</b> now known as the fundamental group or sometimes the Poincaré group. This method can be used for a very compact proof of the theorem under discussion.|$|E
2500|$|Topology {{developed}} as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation. Such ideas go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria <b>situs</b> (Greek-Latin for [...] "geometry of place") and analysis <b>situs</b> (Greek-Latin for [...] "picking apart of place"). [...] Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg Problem and Polyhedron Formula are arguably the field's first theorems. The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, {{although it was not}} until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed. [...] By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|Dextrocardia (the heart {{being located}} {{on the right side}} of the thorax) was first seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1452–1519, [...] and then {{recognised}} by Marco Aurelio Severino in 1643.
