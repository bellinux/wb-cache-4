In March 2009, he was invited by publisher Majesco Entertainment to pitch an idea for a Nintendo DS game, and keeping these mechanics in mind, he pitched a game called Deception. In Deception, two players would play one half of a married couple, with the aim to gather as much damaging evidence regarding their spouse's infidelities as ammunition for a forthcoming divorce case. Majesco rejected this concept as being [...] "too sensitive a subject for the DS market".|$|E

The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're <b>so</b> <b>focused</b> on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E
