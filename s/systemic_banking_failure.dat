40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{methods for}} assessing {{the probability of a}} systemic failure of the global banking system. We examine a sample of 334 banks (representing 80 % of global bank equity) in 28 countries around global financial crises such as the Asian crisis and September 11, 2001. The maximum probability of a systematic failure is estimated as the maximum cumulative abnormal return experienced by the subset of banks not directly exposed to a negative shock. Across different crisis events, this maximum level is between 1 %- 12 %. More precise point estimates of the likelihood of systemic failure are obtained from structural models. For example, maximum likelihood estimation of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> probabilities implied by equity prices suggests the Russian crisis induced about a 6 % change in <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> <b>failure.</b> Also, we demonstrate that estimates of systemic risk can be obtained from default probabilities of banks that are implied in their equity option prices.

40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies of banking crises have employed "banking crisis" (BC) indicators constructedusing primarily information on government actions undertaken {{in response to}} bank distress. Weformulate a simple theoretical model of a banking industry which we use to identify and constructtheory-based measures of <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> shocks (SBS). Using both country-level and firm-level samples, we show that SBS indicators consistently predict BC indicators based on four major BCseries that {{have appeared in the}} literature. Therefore, BC indicatorsactually measure lagged government responses to <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> shocks, rather than the occurrence of crises per se. We re-examine the separate impact of macroeconomic factors, bank market structure, deposit insurance, andexternal shocks on the probability of a <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> shocks and on the probability of governmentresponses to bank distress. The impact of these variables on the likelihood of a government responseto bank distress is totally different from that on the likelihood of a <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> shock.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{domestic}} financial intermediation of foreign capital inflows based on agency costs is developed for studying financial crises in emerging markets. In equilibrium, the banking system becomes progressively more fragile under imperfect prudential regulation and public sector loan guarantees until a crisis occurs with a sudden reversal of capital flows. The crisis evolves endogenously as the banking system becomes increasingly vulnerable through the renegotiation of loans after idiosyncratic firm-specific revenue shocks. The model generates dynamic relationships between foreign capital inflows, domestic investment, corporate debt and equity values in an endogenous growth model. The model''s assumptions and implications for {{the behavior of the}} economy before and after crisis are compared to the experience of five East Asian economies. The case studies compare three that suffered a crisis or near-crisis, Thailand and Malaysia, to two that did not, Taiwan Province of China and Singapore, and lend support to the model.

While there are many commonalities between recent and past crises, {{both in terms of}} underlying causes and policy responses, there are some important differences in terms of the scale and scope of interventions. Direct fiscal costs to support the financial sector were smaller this time as a consequence of swift policy action and significant indirect support from expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, the widespread use of guarantees on liabilities, and direct purchases of assets. While these policies have reduced the real impact of the current crisis, they have increased the burden of public debt and the size of government contingent liabilities, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability in some countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how much capital banks should optimally hold. Our model encompasses {{different kinds of}} moral hazard studied in banking: asset substitution (or risk shifting, e. g., making risky, negative net present value loans), managerial rent seeking (e. g., shirking or investing in inefficient “pet” projects that yield private benefits), and the free cash flow problem (manifesting as inefficient consumption of cash for perquisites by the manager). The privately optimal capital structure of the bank balances the benefit of leverage {{as reflected in the}} market discipline imposed by uninsured creditors on rent seeking {{on the one hand and}} the cost of leverage as reflected in the asset substitution induced at high levels of leverage on the other hand. Under some conditions, the capital structure resolves all the moral hazard problems we study, but under other conditions, the goal of having the market discipline of leverage clashes with the goal of having the benefit of equity capital in attenuating asset substitution moral hazard. In this case, private contracting must tolerate some form of inefficiency and bank value is not maximized as it is in the first best. Despite this, there is no economic rationale for regulation. However, when <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> are correlated and en masse failures can impose significant social costs, regulators may intervene ex post via bank bailouts. Anticipation of this generates multiple Nash equilibria, one of which features systemic risk in that all banks choose inefficiently high leverage, take excessively correlated asset risk, and, because debt is paid off by regulators when banks fail en masse, market discipline is compromised. While a simple minimum (tier- 1) capital requirement suffices to restore efficiency under some conditions, there are also conditions under which an optimal arrangement to contain the build-up of systemic risk takes the form of the regular (tier- 1) capital requirement plus a “special capital account” that involves 1) building up capital via dividend payout restrictions, 2) investment of the retained earnings in designated assets, and 3) contingent distribution provisions.

The likelihood of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> also increases with bank risk-taking. In the cross-section, the smaller domestically-oriented banks were relatively more vulnerable to liquidity risk, while the large cross-border banks were more susceptible to solvency risk due to excessive leverage. The results support the proposed Basel III regulations on structural liquidity and leverage, but suggest that emphasis should be placed on the latter, particularly for the systemically-important institutions.

The researcher found out that supervisory and the regulatory functions of the RBZ have not been effective in curtailing distress in the commercial banks. The results also show that majority of the respondents believed that urgent attention towards verification; processing and settlement of claims filed by depositors of failed banks would help in boosting confidence of the banksâ€™ customers. Therefore, in order for commercial banks to improve profitability it was recommended that commercial banks need to invest in supply side of their macroeconomics through capital expansion and deposit layering activities both at individual bank level and industrial level at large as the demand for bank loans continues to escalate. Therefore,effective bank supervision is important in protecting depositors' funds, avoiding <b>bank</b> <b>failures</b> and installing discipline in the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|Did the {{occurrence}} of <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crises in the 1990 s and 2000 s significantly alter the behavior of banks in the Mercosur? The objective {{of this paper is}} to answer this question by analyzing changes in bank behavior after crises in the Mercosur region. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to apply the convergence methodology-which is common in the growth literature-to post-crisis bank behavior. Using a panel dataset of commercial banks during the period 1990 - 2006, we analyze the impact of crises on four sets of financial indicators of bank behavior-profitability, maturity preference, credit supply, and risk. The paper finds that most indicators of bank behavior, such as profitability, in fact revert to previous or more normal levels. However, a key finding of the paper is that private sector intermediation is significantly reduced for prolonged periods of time and that high levels excess liquidity persist well after the crisis.

40|$|After the East Asian crisis, {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in both academic and policy circles about the role that bank weaknesses play in contributing to <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis. Even though, it has been recognized in the recent theoretical literature on banking crises that both macroeconomic and bank-level fundamentals have {{to be taken into account}} in the explanation of <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis, to date, there is little cross-country empirical evidence for emerging markets on the role of bank weaknesses in contributing to both sudden deposit withdrawals and <b>bank</b> <b>failures.</b> In this context, my thesis analyzes the episodes of <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis in Latin America (Argentina, 1995; Mexico, 1994; and Venezuela, 1994) and East Asia (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand in 1997) using bank-level data in order to answer the following questions. First, to what extent, did financial conditions of individual <b>banks</b> explain <b>bank</b> <b>failures?</b> Did only the weakest banks, in terms of their fundamentals, fail in the crisis countries? Second, did depositors in crisis countries discipline riskier banks by withdrawing their deposits in such a way that deposit withdrawals could be considered an act of market discipline? The results for East Asia and Latin America show that bank-level fundamentals both affect significantly the likelihood of failure and explain a high proportion of the likelihood of <b>failure</b> of failed <b>banks</b> (around fifty percent). In East Asian crisis countries, there was little overlap in the distribution of logit propensity scores between failed and non-failed banks, implying that mainly the weakest banks failed. However, in Latin American crisis countries, there was a much clear overlap in the distribution of logit propensity scores, implying that banking system and macroeconomic shocks are relatively much more important in Latin America. Regarding market discipline, a stable model of bank-level fundamentals explains the growth rate of deposits in both regions even during the peak of the crisis periods. However, in both regions, the relative contribution of bank level fundamentals during the peak of the crisis periods declined. In this context, to some degree, the observed deposit withdrawals represented an informed market response to observable bank weaknesses...|$|R
40|$|Closures {{have been}} used to resolve problem banks in many {{countries}} {{in a wide range of}} economic circumstances, yet banking supervisors frequently defer intervention and closure. Avoiding the costs of disruption is the principal argument in favor of extraordinary measures, such as the use of public funds for recapitalization or forbearance, as alternatives to closing insolvent banks. Well-planned and implemented closure options can preserve essential functions performed by failing banks, mitigating disruption. Extraordinary measures to avoid closure should generally be avoided, but may be used in a systemic crisis to preserve some portion of a widely insolvent banking sector.

40|$|When a country''s {{banking system}} becomes more {{linked to the}} global banking network, does that system get more or less prone to a banking crisis? Using model {{simulations}} and econometric estimates based on a world-wide dataset, we find an M-shaped relationship between financial stability of a country''s banking sector and its interconnectedness. In particular, for banking sectors that are not very connected to the global banking network, increases in interconnectedness {{are associated with a}} reduced probability of a banking crisis. Once interconnectedness reaches a certain value, further increases in interconnectedness can increase the probability of a banking crisis. Our findings suggest that it may be beneficial for policies to support greater interlinkages for less connected banking systems, but after a certain point the advantages of increased interconnectedness become less clear.

Until recently, Europe has seen {{only a small number}} of outright <b>bank</b> <b>failures,</b> which made the estimation of early warning models for bank supervision very difficult. This paper presents a unique database of individual bank distress across the European Union from mid- 1990 s to 2008. Using this data set, we analyze the causes of banking distress in Europe.

40|$|Abstract: Bank erosion {{consists}} of two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial hydraulic force and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> {{under the influence of}} gravity. Because bank resistance force varies with the degree of saturation of bank material, the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is the probability of the driving force of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree of saturation of bank material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate of bank erosion is due to both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar <b>bank</b> <b>failure,</b> a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> was included in the analysis of <b>bank</b> <b>failure.</b> A method for calculating the rate of bank erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and <b>bank</b> <b>failure</b> processes, and accounts for the effects of hydraulic force, bank geometry, bank material properties, and probability of <b>bank</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

We also find that higher-quality reports tend {{to be associated with}} more stable financial environments.

40|$|In {{episodes of}} {{significant}} banking distress or perceived systemic {{risk to the}} financial system, policymakers have often opted for issuing blanket guarantees on bank liabilities to stop or avoid widespread bank runs. In theory, blanket guarantees can prevent bank runs if they are credible. However, guarantee could add substantial fiscal costs to bank restructuring programs and may increase moral hazard going forward. Using a sample of 42 episodes of banking crises, this paper finds that blanket guarantees are successful in reducing liquidity pressures on banks arising from deposit withdrawals. However, banks'' foreign liabilities appear virtually irresponsive to blanket guarantees. Furthermore, guarantees tend to be fiscally costly, though this positive association arises {{in large part because}} guarantees tend to be employed in conjunction with extensive liquidity support and when crises are severe.
