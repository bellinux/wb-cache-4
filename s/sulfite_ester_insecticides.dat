5000|$|A <b>sulfite</b> <b>ester</b> is a {{functional}} {{group with the}} structure (RO)(R'O)SO. They adopt a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry due {{to the presence of}} lone pairs on the sulphur atom. When substituents R and R' differ, the compound is chiral owing to the stereogenic sulphur centre; when the R groups are the same the compound will have idealised Cs molecular symmetry. They are commonly prepared by the reaction of thionyl chloride with alcohols. The reaction is typically performed at room temperature to prevent the alcohol being converted into a chloroalkane. Bases such as pyridine {{can also be used to}} promote the reaction: ...|$|R
50|$|In organic synthesis, SF4 is used {{to convert}} COH and C=O groups into CF and CF2 groups, respectively. Certain {{alcohols}} readily give the corresponding fluorocarbon. Ketones and aldehydes give geminal difluorides. The presence of protons alpha to the carbonyl leads to side reactions and diminished (30-40%) yield. Also diols can give cyclic <b>sulfite</b> <b>esters,</b> (RO)2SO. Carboxylic acids convert to trifluoromethyl derivatives. For example treatment of heptanoic acid with SF4 at 100-130 °C produces 1,1,1-trifluoroheptane. Hexafluoro-2-butyne can be similarly produced from acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The coproducts from these fluorinations, including unreacted SF4 together with SOF2 and SO2, are toxic but can be neutralized by their treatment with aqueous KOH.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} two {{pyrethroid}} <b>ester</b> <b>insecticides,</b> {{as well as}} their concentration, on the insect survival were studied along with the dynamics of the insect intoxication, as dependent on the application rate of the chemicals. The laboratory tarsal plate test, carried out in May 2006, was based on commercial formulations of τ-fluvalinate and λ-cyhalothrin instead of pure a. i. The study aimed at producing practical recommendations about the reduction of the application rate in the chemical protection of the oil seed rape (OSR) against the pod and the stem weevils and against the pollen beetle. The results suggest that the application rate reduction of τ-fluvalinate does not alter considerably the survival of the tested insect parasitoids, whereas in case of λ-cyhalothrin it is accompanied by an increase in the insects`survival...|$|R
40|$|Chrysanthemyl {{diphosphate}} synthase (CPPase) catalyzes the condensation of two {{molecules of}} dimethylallyl diphosphate to produce chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP), a monoterpene with a non-head-to-tail or irregular c 1 ′- 2 - 3 linkage between isoprenoid units. Irregular monoterpenes {{are common in}} Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and related members of the Asteraceae family. In C. cinerariaefolium, CPP is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the pyrethrin <b>ester</b> <b>insecticides.</b> CPPase was purified from immature chrysanthemum flowers, and the N terminus of the protein was sequenced. A C. cinerariaefolium λ cDNA library was screened by using degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on the amino acid sequence to identify a CPPase clone that encoded a 45 -kDa preprotein. The first 50 aa of the ORF constitute a putative plastidial targeting sequence. Recombinant CPPase bearing an N-terminal polyhistidine affinity tag {{in place of the}} targeting sequence was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain by Ni 2 + chromatography. Incubation of recombinant CPPase with dimethylallyl diphosphate produced CPP. The diphosphate ester was hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase, and the resulting monoterpene alcohol was analyzed by GC/MS to confirm its structure. The amino acid sequence of CPPase aligns closely with that of the chain elongation prenyltransferase farnesyl diphosphate synthase rather than squalene synthase or phytoene synthase, which catalyze c 1 ′- 2 - 3 cyclopropanation reactions similar to the CPPase reaction...|$|R
40|$|Disulfoton (O,O, diethyl S- 2 -(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate) {{and other}} organophosphorus <b>ester</b> {{compounds}} are <b>insecticides</b> which inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Chemicals of this class cause signs of toxicity in mammals which are referable to acculmulation of acetylcholine at neuroeffector sites. A tolerance to this toxic action can be induced in experimental animals by giving multiple, sublethal {{doses of the}} compounds. There is strong evidence that disulfoton tolerance occurs because of {{a reduction in the}} sensitivity of tissues in the affected animals to acetylcholine. ^ Experiments were designed to test the possibility that a {{decrease in the number of}} muscarinic cholinergic receptors could be downmodulating the sensitivity of tissues to acetylcholine. It was found that, concomitant with the onset of disulfoton tolerance, there was a decrease relative to control values in the specific binding of (2 ̆ 73) H quinuclidinyl benzilate ((2 ̆ 73) HQNB, a compound which selectively labels muscarinic cholinergic receptors) to homogenates of rat brain and ileal muscle. The decrease in (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding was due to a reduction in the density of muscarinic receptors. There was, however, no alteration in the binding of (2 ̆ 73) H QNB, or the muscarinic agonists (2 ̆ 73) H oxotremorine-M and oxotremorine to atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats. The possibility that cardiac tissue was not subsensitive to cholinergic agonists was ruled out in experiments testing the effect of the muscarinic agonist carbachol on heart rate in vivo, and the negative chronotropic effect of oxotremorine on atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats: a clear reduction in the sensitivity to cholinergic agonists was seen in each case. It was, therefore concluded that the specificity and temporal correlation of (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding decreases suggested that the loss of muscarinic receptors might play a role in modulating the sensitivity of several tissues to acetylcholine, but that other mechanisms also contribute to the tolerance phenomenon. ^ Other experiments revealed that disulfoton tolerance, as measured by resistance to the lethal effects of carbachol, could be induced by feeding rats low levels of the organophosphorus ester in the diet. The concentration of disulfoton used inhibited acetylcholinesterase, but not to the extent that overt signs of toxicity were observed. These results suggested that tolerance to organophosphorus <b>ester</b> <b>insecticides</b> could be induced in rodents with a dosing scheme which more closely modeled the sort of low level exposures which would be expected in humans environmentally or occupationally in contact with these compounds. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{metabolite}} of {{a widely}} used pesticide, paraoxon, exerted a dramatic mutagenic synergistic effect in Salmonella typhimurium {{with a number}} of mammalian-activated or plant-activated aromatic amines and heterocyclic amines. The mutagenic synergy required an activated an aromatic amine, and was not attributable to the generation of new mutagenic products or to the modification of the stability of the activated aromatic amine products. Paraoxon modulated the genotoxic potency of dietaiy heterocyclic amines in human cells. The results of this study raise the concern of the environmental effects of organophosphorus <b>ester</b> <b>insecticides.</b> A clone of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, AS 52, was isolated, characterised and analysed under identical treatment conditions with the mutagens 2 -acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (2 AAAF), ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), and UV radiation. The genetic endpoints included acute DNA damage detected in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, whole cell clastogenicity detected with laser beam flow cytometry and forward mutation at a target gene. There were statistically significant increases in DNA damage and forward mutation with all three mutagens. Statistically significant increases in chromosome damage were observed with 2 AAAF and EMS but not with UV. A non-uniform distribution of DNA damage throughout the genome was indicated with the chemical mutagens in the SCGE assay. Another type of modulation in genotoxic response was investigated whereby numerous commercial soybean processing products and by-products were analysed for their antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activities. Antimutagenic activity was detected in a soybean processing by-product, soybean molasses and in an ethanol extract, fraction PCC. PCC protected mammalian cells against direct DNA damage, clastogenic damage and point mutation induced by 2 AAAF. A fraction of PCC, PCC 100 was an effective antimutagen in mammalian cells and in human lymphocytes. Analytical chemical studies identified the compounds responsible for the antimutagenic activity as the soyasaponins I, III and V...|$|R
