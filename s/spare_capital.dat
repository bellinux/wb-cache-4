60|$|There is, however, {{very little}} {{hope that the}} {{decisions}} reached by the Washington Conference will permanently benefit China, and a considerable chance that they may do quite the reverse. In Manchuria {{the status quo is}} to be maintained, while in Shantung the Japanese have made concessions, the value of which only time can show. The Four Powers--America, Great Britain, France, and Japan--have agreed to exploit China in combination, not competitively. There is a consortium as regards loans, which will have the power of the purse and will therefore be the real Government of China. As the Americans are the only people who have much <b>spare</b> <b>capital,</b> they will control the consortium. As they consider their civilization the finest in the world, they will set to work to turn the Chinese into muscular Christians. As the financiers are the most splendid feature of the American civilization, China must be so governed as to enrich the financiers, who will in return establish colleges and hospitals and Y.M.C.A.'s throughout the length and breadth of the land, and employ agents to buy up the artistic treasures of China for sepulture in their mansions. Chinese intellect, like that of America, will be, directly or indirectly, in the pay of the Trust magnates, and therefore no effective voice will be, raised in favour of radical reform. The inauguration of this system will be welcomed even by some Socialists in the West as a great victory for peace and freedom.|$|E

50|$|The Improved Villa and Cottage Homes Building Company {{was formed}} in 1887 for the {{purposes}} of building local artisan dwellings under a mortgage system. In 1889, it bought 7.5 acre of land at Thornton Heath for £2,000. (This may have sounded a good deal. Twenty years previously the Board of Health had bought 8 acre from John Bennington for £3,000.) However, the company had no <b>spare</b> <b>capital</b> to carry out construction. They tried to sell the land but found the value had been overestimated. The original vendor bought back 4 acre at a knock down price, but the firm went bankrupt in 1892. The failure of another speculative builder in 1901 was attributed to losses in work at Thornton Heath and the inability to let houses when completed. There were also knock-on effects as a result of failed speculation: in 1898, the debts of one Thornton Heath builder caused the bankruptcy of a solicitor.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to present the role and the {{significance}} of guarantee function of financial reserves of company. The problem concerning the influence of financial reserves on the company’s strategies is relatively new in the Polish literature, as it is connected with transformation of conditions in which companies operate and with adaptation of Accounting Act as well as other legal acts governing establishing of reserves in the company to a market economy. Problems concerning financial reserves are usually tackled in the literature - both Polish and foreign - in the aspect of financial accounting (concerning the balance-sheet category of reserves for liabilities, that is, reserves resulting from the deferred income tax, reserves for pension and other benefits or remaining reserves) and in the equity management aspect (it concerns problems connected with reserve and <b>spare</b> <b>capital).</b> Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 zostało dofinansowane ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej naukę...|$|E

Both the Romans and the Samnites forced the captives of their defeated enemies to pass under a yoke formed from spears. The practice is said to have originated as a form of expiation. According to Livy, Horatius killed his own sister because she mourned the death of her lover Curiatius rather than her fallen brothers.

40|$|There are 22 {{construction}} {{support vessels}} in the DOF Group that have active heave compensated cranes with lifting capacity of above 50 tonnes. The Brazilian flagged Skandi Salvador was chosen to represent the fleet in terms of specifications, since she {{was close to the}} average numbers for size, age and capacity. She has a NOV crane with SWL of 140 t. There are two main types of maintenance; preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. Fault distributions can be used to evaluate which type of maintenance that should be performed, and in which intervals. Maintenance management should be a process of continuous improvement, with focus on planning, execution, reporting and analysis in order to establish and revise resource needs, goals and requirements, and the maintenance program itself. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Risk Based Inspection (RBI) are useful methods to establish an optimal maintenance and inspection program, based on functional demands, functional faults, and prevention of these functional faults. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) concept and the ?Newsboy? model are mathematical decision models {{that can be used to}} decide number of spares to be ordered, order point, safety level, and investments in <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts. Seven areas of improvement for the maintenance practice in the DOF Group were proposed: 1. 	Informal experience to be made formal. 2. 	Formalize the maintenance management processes. 3. 	Introduce scientific methods like Reliability Centered Maintenance and Risk Based Inspection to establish maintenance program. 4. 	Introduce scientific methods for spare parts management. 5. 	Introduce a fleet-oriented philosophy for all aspects of the maintenance practice, especially for spare parts management. 6. 	Bring the users closer to decisions regarding the MMS 7. 	Increase practical usability of critical equipment classification. The main objective of spare parts management is to find the optimal numbers, types and locations for spare parts needed to perform the desired tasks with as high uptime as possible. In effect, to have spare parts available when they are needed, but to avoid stocking spare parts that are not needed. At the heart of the proposed spare parts management philosophy lie fleet orientation, formalization, and scientific methods. A spare part evaluation work process is proposed, consisting of 6 phases: 1. 	Basic input. Where the actor responsible collects the data necessary for making the evaluation. 2. 	Spare part categorization. The spare parts are categorized in three categories, based on given criteria. 3. 	Risk assessment. A consequence classification is carried out to decide the desired probability of having a spare available during procurement lead time for operational spares and consumables. 4. 	Decision tools. Two different decision tools are utilized to make optimal decisions for the spare parts considered. 5. 	Output. The decisions are summarized and carried out. Information related to the <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts decisions are entered into a newly established <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts experience register. 6. 	MMS. The results from the spare part evaluations are inserted in the maintenance management system. An important part of the proposed spare parts management philosophy is the ability to make optimal decisions in changing environments. If the evaluation process is not dynamic, the actors responsible will soon revert to the former, subjective methods for making decisions. So, whenever a change in the operation of a vessel is planned or registered, the project/vessel manager should ask himself how this change might affect the input parameters of the decision tools. This forms the basis for the proposed dynamic spare part evaluation work process. The decision tool for <b>capital</b> <b>spares</b> is built around the relation between the expected cost of holding a spare part and not needing it, versus the expected cost of not having it when you need it. When basing the evaluation on significantly lower delivery times than estimated by the manufacturer, the optimal <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts investment decisions for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador were to purchase all the recommended parts, except the largest crane wire. Using the estimated delivery times from the manufacturer, the optimal decisions were clearly to purchase all the recommended spare parts. At the delivery time of Skandi Salvador, the DOF Group chose to only purchase four of the items on the list of recommended <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts. The <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts investment decisions taken by the DOF Group at the delivery time of the vessel are therefore considered sub-optimal compared to the findings in this thesis, and the DOF Group is advised to purchase the remaining <b>capital</b> <b>spare</b> parts on the list of recommended spare parts. The decision tool for operational spares and consumables finds the optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock. An important input parameter is the desired probability of having enough spare during procurement lead time. This parameter is set based on the consequence classification for the part. The decision tool was used to make decisions for optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock for a list of recommended spare parts for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of Ethernet in the cellular terrestrial cloud {{radio access network}} (C-RAN) fronthaul is considered {{as a way for}} improving C-RAN network reconfigurability and efficiency in terms of both capital and operational expenditures. Moreover CPRI line bit rate dynamic reconfiguration may <b>spare</b> further <b>capital</b> expenditures by avoiding a peak traffic capacity allocation. A possible solution for introducing Ethernet in the fronthaul is the encapsulation of Common Packet Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet. However, it must be assured that CPRI strict requirements on delay and jitter are still met. In this work the combined impact of encapsulating CPRI on Ethernet and of the dynamic CPRI line bit rate reconfiguration on delay and jitter is evaluated. The evaluation is both analytical and based on the pre-synthesis emulation of dynamic CPRI line bit rate reconfiguration. Results show that dynamic CPRI line bit rate reconfiguration can be achieved within about one millisecond. However, if a size-based encapsulation of CPRI over Ethernet is utilized, dynamic CPRI line bit rate reconfiguration might cause delay variations (i. e., jitter) up to few microseconds...|$|R

The Old Summer Palace was a complex of palaces and gardens eight kilometres northwest of the walls of Beijing; it had been built during the 18th and early 19th centuries, and was where the emperors of the Qing dynasty resided and handled government affairs. An alternative account says that Lord Elgin had initially considered the destruction of the Forbidden City. However, fearing that this act might interfere with the signing of the Convention of Peking, which was where it was being negotiated, he opted for the destruction of the Old Summer Palace in its stead.|$|R

50|$|Early on March 1, as Oscar passed about 90 km to the west-southwest of Nadi, it {{was decided}} to secure Nadi's radar dish and the {{satellite}} antennae as storm-force winds outside gusted to 140 km/h.

After wind gusts dropped and the pressure rose at Nadi, the radar was able to be brought back into operation at around 12:00 UTC (00:00 FST, March 2). The radar's poor image suggested that Oscar was now located to the south of Sigatoka, having accelerated from 7 to 15 km/h while the radar was shut down.

60|$|Never did a {{government}} or a people meet a terrible disaster {{with a more}} undaunted front than that displayed {{by the government and}} British population of India when {{the full extent of the}} peril caused by the rising of the Sepoys was first clearly understood. By the rising of Delhi, and of the whole country down to Allahabad, the northern part of India was entirely cut off from Calcutta, and was left wholly to its own resources. Any help that could be <b>spared</b> from the <b>capital</b> was needed for the menaced garrisons of Allahabad, Benares, and Agra, while it was certain that the important stations of Cawnpore and Lucknow, in the newly-annexed province of Oude, would at best be scarcely able to defend themselves, and would in all probability urgently require assistance. Thus the rebel city of Delhi, the center and focus of the insurrection, was safe from any possibility of a British advance from the south. Nor did it look as if the position of the English was much better in the north. At Sealkote, Lahore, and many other stations, the Sepoys mutinied, and the Sikh regiments were disturbed, and semi-mutinous. It was at this all-important moment that the fidelity of two or three of the great Sikh chieftains saved British India. Foremost of them was the Rajah of Puttiala, who, when the whole Sikh nation was wavering as to the course it should take, rode into the nearest British station with only one retainer, and offered his whole force and his whole treasury to the British government. A half-dozen other prominent princes instantly followed the example; and from that moment Northern India was not only safe, but was able to furnish troops for the siege of Delhi. The Sikh regiments at once returned to their habitual state of cheerful obedience, and served with unflinching loyalty and bravery through the campaign.|$|R
