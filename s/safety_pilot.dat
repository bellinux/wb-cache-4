5|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the DC-7 had {{departed}} Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45a.m. on a training flight with two pilots on board. In {{the front seat of}} the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who as part of his training would spend the flight under a hood that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed him to see his instrument panel.|$|E

25|$|Olgay Özgür was the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> of the flight, a {{graduate}} of a flight school in Ankara, who flew the MD 80 for World Focus Airlines before joining Turkish Airlines and passing the 737 type rating; {{he was sitting in}} the cockpit's center jump seat.

25|$|Kelsey flew {{extensively}} {{for commercial}} concerns {{as well as}} privately, and obtained a transport pilot license. He joined the United States Army Air Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant on May 2, 1929. At Mitchel Field, he worked with the Guggenheim Fog Flying Laboratory. As stipulated by Harry Guggenheim, Kelsey flew as Lieutenant Jimmy Doolittle's <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> during the first fully 'blind' instrument flight on September 24, 1929, showing observers {{that he was not}} in control by keeping his hands visible outside the cockpit. The following year he graduated from Primary and Advanced Flying Schools, and in 1931 he obtained his master of science degree in aeronautical engineering at MIT. Assigned with the 20th Pursuit Group at Mather Field and later at Barksdale Field, he served in various tactical unit duties.|$|E

This study proposes that the evolution of Crew Resource Management training helps reducing particular types of airline pilot errors.

Their treatment of the NTSB went very far beyond cinematic license into simple mean-spirited dishonesty. The movie may actually be detrimental to aviation <b>safety.</b> <b>Pilots</b> involved in accidents will now expect harsh, unfair treatment by investigators.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that both pilots must agree prior to flight which pilot is the Pilot In Command (PIC). The designated Pilot In Command is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft and is liable for any mishaps. If the pilot operating the controls of the aircraft is designated the PIC, then the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> cannot log PIC time. If the <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> is not the acting Pilot In Command, he can, however, log the time as Second-In-Command.|$|E

50|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> {{option is}} a very popular among general {{aviation}} pilots {{since it is the}} lesser expensive of the two options. Either pilot can potentially log the time as Pilot In Command (PIC) and an agreement of who is acting as Pilot In Command should be discussed before the flight occurs. The pilot wearing the foggles may log the time on the basis that he is rated in the airplane, and is the sole manipulator of the controls. The <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> can log PIC time only if he is the agreed upon acting Pilot In Command for the flight.|$|E
50|$|A <b>safety</b> <b>pilot</b> is a rated {{pilot who}} helps {{maintain}} visual separation from other aircraft, clouds, and terrain while another pilot is wearing view limiting devices {{for the purposes}} of simulating instrument conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Simulator {{sickness}} is {{a subset}} of motion sickness that is typically experienced by pilots who undergo training for {{extended periods of time}} in flight simulators. Due to the spatial limitations imposed on these simulators, perceived discrepancies between the motion of the simulator and that of the vehicle can occur and lead to simulator sickness.It is similar to motion sickness in many ways, but occurs in simulated environments and can be induced without actual motion. Symptoms of simulator sickness include discomfort, apathy, drowsiness, disorientation, fatigue, vomiting, and many more.These symptoms can reduce the effectiveness of simulators in flight training and result in systematic consequences such as decreased simulator use, compromised training, ground safety, and flight <b>safety.</b> <b>Pilots</b> are less likely to want to repeat the experience in a simulator if they have suffered from simulator sickness and hence can reduce the number of potential users.
