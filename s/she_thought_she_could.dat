25|$|In 1990, {{during her}} time at Cranbrook Kingswood, Blair was {{involved}} in a production of T.S. Eliotâ€™s Murder in the Cathedral. According to Blair, it was a failure, but her English teacher told her not to give up; {{that was the first time}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be an actress.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Llorona" [...] is Spanish for [...] "The Crying Woman" [...] and is {{a popular}} legend in Spanish-speaking {{cultures}} in the colonies of the Americas, with many versions extant. The basic story is that La Llorona was a beautiful woman who killed her children {{to be with the}} man that she loved and was subsequently rejected by him. He might have been the children's father who had left their mother for another woman, or he might have been a man she loved but who was uninterested in a relationship with a woman with children, and whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win if the children were out of the way.|$|E
6000|$|Then, just as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> really <b>could</b> not {{endure the}} ache {{in her arms}} and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in Harmon Andrews's dory! ...|$|R
60|$|Laura {{gave him}} a keen glance and got a jar. He frowned and his mouth was tight. <b>She</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> move Jimmy, but now she doubted, and because she was proud she dared not try.|$|R
50|$|When Victoria proposes an unthinkable plan, Olivia {{is forced}} to accept, leaving her with a {{marriage}} <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have and her sister going off to help in France, when World War I is in full throttle.|$|R
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. An unselfish motive. She went because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{help someone}} by going.|$|E
60|$|Laura {{lifted her}} head and her look was proud. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play up and the fellow must not imagine Stannard had gone to Jimmy's help.|$|E
60|$|At dinner, {{or rather}} supper, {{that night she}} noticed that both her father and his partner seemed to be {{suffering}} from suppressed excitement, of which <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> guess the cause.|$|E
60|$|Then he left her, and {{she heard}} him walk down the stairs with heavy slow steps, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{perceive}} from the sound that he was sad at heart, {{but that he was}} resolved not to show his sadness outwardly.|$|R
50|$|The Moon {{returns to}} its {{original}} position, K-9 {{goes back to the}} safe to guard the black hole and the Slitheen return to Raxacoricofallapatorius. As Sarah Jane, Maria, Luke, Clyde, Alan and Chrissie watch the ship leave, Sarah Jane reflects how <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be part of a family.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Holiday {{did like}} {{the plan of}} going to Chamouni very much. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go over the {{mountain}} pass on a mule; and that at any rate <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go on the carrying chair. So the excursion was decided upon, and the party set off the next day.|$|R
60|$|It was over, and she {{had escaped}} without reproaches and without detection. Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> resign herself to almost everything.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice was}} {{so low that}} at first he {{could not make out}} what she said. Then he made it out. She was saying that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get well again if {{children}} believed in fairies.|$|E
60|$|When Claude Locker had gone, Olive {{missed him}} more than <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> miss anybody. Much of the life seemed to {{have gone out of}} the place, and the captain's high spirits waned as if he was {{suffering}} from the depression which follows a stimulant.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{turned away}} her head without answering. Something deep within her was {{softening}} her anger. She must {{fight to keep}} angry; and that was easy enough, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only keep in mind Slone's opposition to her. Strangely, she discovered {{that it had been}} sweet to find him always governed by her desire or will.|$|R
50|$|Thatcher watched wrestling growing up, {{and is a}} fan of Trish Stratus and Christian. Thatcher is dating fellow {{professional}} wrestler, Corvis Fear, {{whom she}} met when she was sixteen. Although she had been a fan of wrestling, it wasn't until she met Fear that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> realistically accomplish becoming a professional wrestler. Fear later helped to train her.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent to her gained freedom, Skye was {{introduced}} to Edmund Grey. Skye remembered seeing Dimitri and Maria making love, and Skye developed a crush on Edmund. Skye's crush turned to obsession. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> split up Edmund and Maria, Edmund would be hers. Skye bribed a lab tech, got access to Maria's paternity test and changed the father's name from Edmund to Dimitri.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe {{fell into}} speculations on the wisdom whose counsel all asked, and which had left such an {{impression}} of affectionate honour. She would gladly lean on such an one, but if no one of the like mould remained, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never bear the responsibilities of marriage.|$|E
6000|$|The captain paid no {{attention}} to these remarks. [...] "If she doesn't want to send a telegram, I don't see what she is going to town for in such a hurry. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get there sooner than a man could go on a horse," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|At first, Madam Rachel said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not very}} well that evening, for she had a {{difficult}} text to talk about; but the boys promised to walk along quietly, and to be very sober and attentive; and so she went and put on her garden bonnet, and came out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Kate?" [...] demanded Fred. It {{seemed as}} though, for the moment, he {{were full of}} courage. He looked round at Mrs. O'Hara, but nobody {{answered}} him. She was still standing with her eyes fixed upon the man, almost as though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dart out upon him and destroy him. [...] "Where is Kate?" [...] he asked again. [...] "Is she well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} walking fast, {{in order to}} get here quickly," [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the shelter hard by; and that the heat of his hand was feverishness? ...|$|R
60|$|We had a {{long walk}} before us the next day, and it was our desire, therefore, to get up early, even so early as six o'clock, if that could be managed without {{disturbing}} the whole household. We put it to our hostess whether <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> this <b>could</b> be done. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> might not be about herself at that time; it was her morning for going into the town, some eight miles off, and she rarely got back much before seven; but, possibly, her husband {{or one of the}} boys would be returning home to lunch about that hour. Anyhow, somebody should be sent back to wake us and get our breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked her}} an hour ago," [...] said Jack Herring, {{who was still}} holding his head between his hands {{as if to make}} sure it was there, [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever learn to love me. Would you say that could be {{construed}} into an offer of marriage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Still, {{she talked}} to {{him and told him}} what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make him {{properly}} understand, and so, from one point to another, she went on until she had given the ex-sailor a very good idea of the state of her mind in regard to what she was doing, and what she thought she ought to do.|$|E
60|$|As {{she went}} through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments; and {{although}} some were small and hidden in queer places, Billina spied them all, and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms. The green ornaments she {{did not bother to}} count, for <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find them all when the time came.|$|E
60|$|Still wish it! He {{would gladly}} go to-morrow {{if she would}} come with him. But, of course, {{that could not be}} arranged. She had her {{contract}} to fulfil at the theatre, then there would be her house and furniture to dispose of, and there was Aunt Marie.... But, of course, Aunt Marie would come too.... <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get away some time before the spring; and he swore that he could not leave Paris until she came with him.|$|R
60|$|Left to his {{reflections}} Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not skilful in {{the management}} of a horse, but <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before.|$|R
6000|$|She {{patted the}} cold, rigid cheeks with her rough brown little palms. Then she blew {{in the dead}} face, gravely. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only open mamma's eyes she'd be awake. So she took her finger and thumb and tried to lift the lashes, {{and when she did}} she was frightened by the look of the set faded gray eyes. Then the terrible vague shadow of the Unknown settled upon her and she cried convulsively: [...] "Mamma! mamma, I want you!" [...] Thus she met death, early in her life.|$|R
60|$|This was obvious. The writing had a {{distinctive}} character, and Beatrice examined the faded portrait carefully. It was full length, and showed a lady in old-fashioned dress with an unmistakable stamp {{of dignity and}} elegance. The face had grown very faint, but on holding it to the light <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> perceive an elusive likeness to Hester Harding.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{better go}} in and look at her, Sarah," [...] she said, as she rinsed out the pails. [...] "If you think I'd better stay here to-night, I will. If the woman was like anybody else a body would know what to do; but, if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scare us by saying {{she was going to}} die, she'd say it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{shut his}} eyes as if to forget the horrors of which he spoke. They were fresh and real to him. Frida {{did not like to}} {{question}} him further. She knew to what he referred, and in a dim, vague way (for she was less wise than he, she knew) <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> imagine why he found it all so terrible.|$|E
60|$|If any elves {{had been}} {{hovering}} about the dingy hall just then, {{they would have}} seen the mother's tired face brighten beautifully when she discovered the gifts, and found that her little girls had been so kindly remembered. Something more brilliant than the mock diamonds in Miss Kent's best earrings fell and glittered on the dusty floor as Mrs. Blake added the mittens to the other things, and went to her lonely room again, smiling as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> thank them all in a sweet and simple way.|$|R
60|$|In her haste {{and trouble}} of mind, she quite forgot {{her car and}} the winged dragons; or, it may be, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> follow up the search more {{thoroughly}} on foot. At all events, {{this was the way}} in which she began her sorrowful journey, holding her torch before her, and looking carefully at every object along the path. And as it happened, she had not gone far before she found one of the magnificent flowers which grew on the shrub that Proserpina had pulled up.|$|R
60|$|To some he {{mentioned}} retainers; money down, to speak grossly. Most accepted {{on the strength}} of Merton's assurances that their services must always be ready. There were difficulties with Miss Willoughby and Miss Markham. The former lady (who needed it most) flatly refused the arrangement. Merton pleaded in vain. Miss Markham, the girl known to her contemporaries as Milo, could not hazard her present engagement at Madame Claudine's. If she was needed by the scheme in the dead season <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be ready for whatever it was.|$|R
