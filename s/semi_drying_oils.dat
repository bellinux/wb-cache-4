40|$|Iodine {{value is}} defined as the number of centigrams of iodine per gram of oil sample. Drying {{property}} of fatty oils mainly depends on the type of unsaturated fatty acids and relative amounts of each type of fatty acid in a unit weight of oil. Iodine value of fatty oil is a quantitative measure of unsaturation and hence fatty oils are categorized into drying oil, semidrying oil and non-drying based on iodine value. Fatty oils with iodine value above 150 mgg-l are called drying oils and iodine value in between 150 mgg-l and 120 mgg-l are <b>semi</b> <b>drying</b> <b>oils,</b> whereas fatty oils having iodine values below 120 mgg' are classified as non-drying oils...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of alkyd resins, <b>drying</b> (including <b>semi</b> <b>drying)</b> and nondrying. Both types are {{typically}} produced from dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides, such as phthalic anhydride or maleic anhydride, and polyols, such as trimethylolpropane, glycerine, or pentaerythritol. Alkyds are also used in items such as resins and paints.For the [...] "drying" [...] resins, triglycerides are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (often derived from plant and vegetable oils, e.g. linseed <b>oil).</b> These <b>drying</b> alkyds are cured in air. The drying speed {{and the nature of the}} coatings depends on the amount and type of <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> employed (more polyunsaturated oil means faster reaction in air) and use of metal salts, the so-called <b>oil</b> <b>drying</b> agents.

50|$|Because {{the major}} {{components}} of an alkyd coating, i.e. fatty acids and triglyceride oils, {{are derived from}} low cost renewable resources, this has kept the cost of alkyd coatings very low despite ever increasing cost of petroleum, which is the predominant raw material source of most other coatings such as vinyls, acrylics, epoxies, and polyurethanes.

5000|$|A <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> is an {{oil that}} hardens to a tough, solid film {{after a period}} of {{exposure}} to air.

Some commonly used <b>drying</b> <b>oils</b> include linseed oil, tung oil, poppy seed oil, perilla oil, and walnut oil.

5000|$|By definition, <b>drying</b> <b>oils,</b> such as linseed and tung oil, are {{not true}} {{varnishes}} though often in modern terms they accomplish the same thing. <b>Drying</b> <b>oils</b> cure through an exothermic reaction between the polyunsaturated portion of the oil and oxygen from the air. Originally, the term [...] "varnish" [...] referred to finishes that were made entirely of resin dissolved in suitable solvents, either ethanol (alcohol) or turpentine. The advantage to finishes in previous centuries was that resin varnishes had a very rapid cure rate compared to oils; in most cases they are cured practically {{as soon as the}} solvent has fully evaporated. By contrast, untreated or [...] "raw" [...] oils may take weeks or months to cure, depending on ambient temperature and other environmental factors. In modern terms, [...] "boiled" [...] or partially polymerized <b>drying</b> <b>oils</b> with added siccatives or dryers (chemical catalysts) have cure times of less than 24 hours.

40|$|Typical Japanese {{natural resin}} films, i. e., oriental lacquer films, cashew resin films, and <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> {{polymers}} were characterized, and also an ancient coating was identified using two-stage pyrolysis-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol components, {{which are the}} main constituents of the respective oriental lacquers, were detected by the pyrolysis at 400. Additionally, the pyrolysis products, which reflect {{the structure of the}} urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol polymers, were detected by pyrolysis at 500 after pyrolysis at 400. All the results have shown a significant progress occurring in the side chain-side chain CC coupling and aromatic nucleus-side chain CO coupling of urushiol, laccol, and thitsiol concurrently with the formation of the respective lacquer films. The cashew resin film was found to be terminated with saturated cardols and cardanols by the pyrolysis at 400. Furthermore, pyrolysis at 500 revealed that the autoxidative side chain-side chain CC coupling accelerated the cross-linking of trienyl- and dienylcardanols during the polymerization. The C 4 C 18 free fatty acids were detected by the pyrolysis of the <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> polymers. These pyrolysis products are significant markers for a <b>drying</b> <b>oil</b> polymer.
