40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{factors affecting}} {{the price of}} <b>South</b> <b>Korea’s</b> Certified Emission Reduction (CER) using statistical methods. CER refers to the transaction price {{for the amount of}} carbon emitted. Analysis of results found a co-integration relationship among the price of <b>South</b> <b>Korea’s</b> CER, oil price (WTI), and <b>South</b> <b>Korea’s</b> maximum electric power demand, which means that there is a long-term relationship among the three variables. Based on this result, VECM (vector error correction model) analysis, impulse response function, and variance decomposition were performed. As the oil price (WTI) increases, the demand for gas in power generation in Korea declines while the demand for coal increases. This leads to increased greenhouse gas (GHG; e. g., CO 2) emissions and increased price of <b>South</b> <b>Korea’s</b> CERs. In addition, rising oil prices (WTI) cause a decline in demand for oil products such as kerosene, which results in an increase in <b>South</b> <b>Korea’s</b> maximum power demand...|$|R
