50|$|Improvements to the Rambler {{included}} a full-width die-cast grille while the body side gained an uninterrupted line. Rather than blending into the C-pillar, the belt line continued to the tailfins. Engineering changes included thicker brake linings and larger brakes for V8-powered cars, {{as well as}} fuel economy improvements with lower axle ratios and more efficient carburetor for the I6 engines. An electrically engaged overdrive unit behind the three-speed manual transmission was also available. The automatic transmission was operated by pushbuttons on the left-side of the instrument panel. To increase longevity, Rambler mufflers were aluminum-coated {{on the inside and}} zinc-coated on the outside. On cars with automatic transmission, engine starting was now incorporated into the neutral pushbutton, thus eliminating the ignition key <b>start</b> <b>switch.</b> Accidental starter engagement was prevented by a lockout when the engine was running.|$|E

The user should be able to control the mobile robot platform with an application programmer interface (API). The API needs input as physical values and returns physical values as output. To use the mobile robot platform flexibly for extended applications, some analogue and digital input and output ports are adapted to the embedded system by an additional circuit board.

40|$|A project {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B. S. degree. Department of Mechanical Engineering ME 494 In order to find a safer method for recreational divers to recover small submerged object, Bazinga Team, a senior project design group from the California Maritime Academy, designed and built an automatically ascending, double lift point, self-contained lifting device. The concept stems from the manually operated lift bags used for recreational diver salvage. This project will allow divers a hands-free method to execute salvage operations. A number of methods were discussed for accomplishing this task. The method chosen consists of a control module attached to a scuba tank that will supply input air for two lift bags and discharge air from the bags using a pneumatic actuator. A pressure sensor and accelerometer are used to input values to an Arduino that are needed to determine rate of ascent and orientation of the object being salvaged. This device is being developed to operate at approximately 100 ft, which is the safe limit for recreational divers. The composition of the device includes a number of off-the-shelf components for ease of acquisition, cost, and assembly. The internal components of the control module will include operating valves for the air system, an Arduino, a control circuit board, a pressure sensor, batteries, a <b>start</b> <b>switch,</b> and an accelerometer. The components external of the cap and tube style module, are the tank and regulator, air lines rigging gear and the lift bags. The lift bags will include pneumatic actuators mounted to the dump valves. The device is in the prototype stage {{for the purposes of}} the academic requirements. The team fabricated many of the parts in the device, while the rest were purchased, installed, and function tested. Many issues had to be managed to be ready for pool testing. Watertight integrity was determined as well as electromechanical function. Control issues were resolved by building addition branches of the electrical circuit, particularly in the case of adapting the pressure sensor resolution into a usable range for the scope of the project. The device was tested in the CMA pool. While the electromechanical testing in the pool was satisfactory, there were resource constraints that prevented the necessary testing to get a satisfactory test of the control system. The project group is planning to develop a 2 nd iteration after graduation. California Maritime Academy [...] Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps can run {{directly}} from a direct current (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the <b>starting</b> <b>switch</b> is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated {{directly from}} DC for those reasons.
