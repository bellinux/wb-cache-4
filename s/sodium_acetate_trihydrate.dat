40|$|There is {{a current}} {{requirement}} for technologies that store heat for {{both domestic and}} industrial applications. Phase-change materials (PCMs) represent an important class of materials that offer potential for heat storage. Heat-storage systems are required to undergo multiple melt/freeze cycles without any change in melting-crystallisation point and heat output. Salt hydrates are attractive candidates on account of their high energy densities, but there are issues associated with potential crystallisation of lower-hydrates, long-term stability, and reliable nucleation. An extensive review of the PCMs in the literature, combined with an evaluation of commercially available PCMs led {{to the conclusion that}} many of the reported PCMs, lack {{at least one of the}} key requirements required for use as a heat-storage medium. The focus of this research was therefore to identify and characterise new PCM compositions with tailored properties. New PCM compositions based of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>trihydrate</b> were developed, which showed improved properties through the use of selective polymers that retard the nucleation of undesirable anhydrous sodium acetate. Furthermore, the mechanism of nucleation of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>trihydrate</b> by heterogeneous additives has been investigated using variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction. This study showed that when anhydrous Na 2 HPO 4 was introduced to molten <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>trihydrate</b> at 58 °C the hydrogenphosphate salt is present as the dihydrate. On heating to temperatures in the range 75 - 90 °C the dihydrate was observed to dehydrate to form anhydrous Na₂HPO 4. This result explains the prior observation that the nucleator is deactivated on heating. The depression of melting point of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>trihydrate</b> caused by the addition of lithium acetate dihydrate has also been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. It has been possible to tune the melting point of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>trihydrate</b> thereby modifying its thermal properties. Studies of the nucleation of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, a potential PCM, led to the structural characterisation of six new hydrates using single crystal Xray diffraction. All of these hydrates can exist in samples with the pentahydrate composition at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 45 °C. These hydrates are: α-Na₂S₂O₃· 2 H₂O, which formed during the melting of α-Na₂S₂O₃· 5 H₂O; two new pentahydrates, β-Na₂S₂O₃· 5 H₂O and γ-Na₂S₂O₃· 5 H₂O; Na₂S₂O₃· 1. 33 H₂O, β-Na₂S₂O₃· 2 H₂O and Na₂S₂O₃· 3. 67 H₂O, which formed during the melting of β- Na₂S₂O₃· 5 H₂O.

The pattern of hemodynamic response to injury will be evaluated between those who received <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> and those who did not. The primary purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> on hemodynamic parameters. Secondarily we looked at the effects on prevention and treatment of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Methods The study arm was comprised of patients who had received <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusions in place of normal saline between March 2005 and December 2009. A control arm was created based on matching three pre-treatment variables: injury severity score (ISS), pH (+/- 0. 03) and base deficit (+/- 3). A retrospective chart review was performed for patients in both arms. Blood pressure, arterial blood gas data and chemistry values were recorded for the time points of - 6, - 1, 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours from start of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusion. Patients were excluded based on the following criteria: patients who were given sodium bicarbonate within 48 hours of starting <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate,</b> those given <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> as a bolus, non-trauma patients, burn patients, patients who expired within 24 hours of arrival to the ICU, patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and patients whose medical record could not be obtained. Results A total of 78 patients were included in the study, 39 in the study arm and 39 in the control arm. There were no statistically significant drops in blood pressure within either group. The median pH between the two groups at the start of infusion was equal. Both groups trended towards normal pH with the study arm improving faster than the control arm. The median serum bicarbonate at start of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> infusion was 19 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L at time zero for the study and control arms respectively with both trending upward during the study period.
