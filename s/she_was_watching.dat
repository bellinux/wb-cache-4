500|$|Rolling Stone found {{similarities}} between the video for [...] "Sweet Dreams", Kanye West's video for [...] "Paranoid" [...] (2009) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes. Canadian magazine Dose also compared the video with [...] "Paranoid" [...] due to their similar dream sequences. Nadia Mendoza of The Sun further compared Knowles' look in the video with Lady Gaga's. Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video, writing that [...] "the dark, horror-type music, the pumping heartbeat, the equally spooky lullaby, the screech of an electric guitar", gave her the impression that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> [...] "some 80s magician, with a Knowles soundtrack". However, she complimented {{the rest of the}} video writing that [...] "things (thankfully) move away from the Hallowe'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory (right from the fact it's proper 80s pop through to the video essentially being 'Single Ladies' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers)". Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé's finest and more memorable work, but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles she has seen since [...] "Crazy in Love". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in [...] "Single Ladies".|$|E
