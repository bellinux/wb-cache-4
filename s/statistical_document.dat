6000|$|To {{return to}} France and the {{controversy}} on finance, our opponents had at length the indiscretion to publish a document that they said had been furnished them by some of their [...] "honorables Américains" [...] and by which they attempted to prove some one of their various positions; for by this time they had taken a great many, scarcely any two of which agreed. I {{have no doubt that}} this document, in the present instance, did come from [...] "Americans," [...] though it originally came from Captain Basil Hall. This gentleman had appended to his travels, a table, which purported to contain an arranged statement {{of the cost of the}} state governments. You will form some idea of the value of this table, as a political and <b>statistical</b> <b>document,</b> by an exposure of one or two of its more prominent errors. Taking, for instance, our own state; the receipts from the property of the state, such as its canal, common school, literature, and other funds, necessarily passing through the treasury, the sum total is made to figure against us, as the annual charge of government; which, by these means, is swelled to five times the real amount. Every one knows that the receipts of the canals alone, the moment that the conditions of the loans effected to construct them shall admit of their application, will be more than sufficient to meet the entire charges of the state government twice over; but, by this mystified statement, we are made to appear the poorer for every dollar of properly we possess! And yet this is the nature of the evidence that some of our people furnished to the writers on the French side of this question; a side that, by their own showing, was the side of monarchy? ...|$|E

We have many and very important information on the people's one of the largest feudal domain in Transylvania in the middle Ages. The 8152 inhabitants, where nearly 90 % for them is represented by serfs, live in 121 villages scattered over an area large enough in the old county of Zarand. The predominantly landform is mountain. The majority of the 121 villages, 76 % more accurate, have up to 80 `s inhabitants, so they are relative small villages. Yet some localities are also somewhat larger – market towns - which have between 184 and 460 inhabitants. Finally, we can see that the old type of habitat is preserved up to the present day with few changes and 70 villages from them exist in our days on the territory of the counties Arad and Hunedoara...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{search engines}} attempt to {{aggregate}} all available online data {{for a specific}} vertical into a normalized and structured data model. There are two common strategies for aggregating data: 1) data feeds, and 2) web crawling. Data feeds use source-specific translation rules to collect structured data, but require the source to specifically expose the data. Web crawling collects data through the same interface that users view it, which requires additional work to identify and extract the relevant content from unstructured or semi-structured text. Generalizing these tasks across many websites is difficult because each website presents content in its own arbitrary way. This thesis proposes a strategy for identifying relevant content across many websites with improved accuracy. Many well known <b>statistical</b> <b>document</b> classification algorithms can distinguish between classes of documents with high accuracy. These algorithms fail when test data is significantly different than training data, {{as is often the}} case in the vertical search context. This thesis adaptively builds website-specific document classifiers to avoid common classification failure conditions. Training data is selected dynamically by exploiting common user interface patterns. The results obtained here demonstrate that using adaptive document classifiers improves accuracy with minimal performance costs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a prototype}} text retrieval system which uses relatively advanced {{natural language processing}} techniques {{in order to enhance}} the effectiveness of <b>statistical</b> <b>document</b> retrieval. The backbone of our system is a traditional retrieval engine which builds inverted index files from pre-processed docu- ments, and then searches and ranks the documents in response to user queries. Natural language processing is used to (1) preprocess the documents in order to extract contents-carrying terms, (2) discover interterm dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific to the database domain, and (3) process user's natural language requests into effective search queries. The basic assumption of this design is that term-based representation of contents is in principle sufficient to build an effective if not optimal search query out of any users request. This has been confirmed by an experiment that compared effectiveness of expert-user prepared queries with those derived automatically from an initial narrative information request. In this paper we show that largescale natural language processing (hundreds of millions of words and more) is not only required for a better retrieval, but it is also doable, given appropriate resources. We report on selected preliminary restfits of experiments with 500 MByte database of Wall Street Journal articles, as well as some earlier restfits with a smaller document collection...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates for}} agricultural production data in areas currently in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh from 1901 / 02 to 2001 / 02. A salient feature of these estimates {{is that they}} correspond to current international borders. The British Empire of India, which was broken up in 1947 (in the so-called "Partition" of the Indian subcontinent), covered areas of what are now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Although a rich accumulation of <b>statistical</b> <b>documents</b> {{is available from the}} colonial period, there has been no rigorous attempt to compile statistics corresponding to the current borders during a period that includes years prior to 1947. This is because the Partition broke up the Empire of India not only at the provincial level (for which data are readily available) but also at the district or lower levels of administration. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap, focusing on production in crop farming in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Since neither the states of Pakistan and Bangladesh nor the concept of such nations existed during {{the early decades of the}} twentieth century, this exercise is hypothetical to some extent. Nevertheless, because farming activities are carried out on the soil of a region irrespective of its political designation, the estimates presented in this paper could shed new light on agricultural development in the three countries over the long term. ...|$|R

The focus is the reduction of paid daily working hours as an instrument for better working conditions and a better life. The empirical study {{is based on a}} hospital where working hours have been reduced in four wards by one hour a day in three of the geriatric nursing departments. The aim of the dissertation was to describe the effects of the shorter working day on employees and on the organisation i. e. the hospital.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how community secondary school heads in Shinyanga, Tanzania, are prepared and supported to implement the Secondary Education Development Plan (SEDP). The research was a case study employing mixed methods. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and <b>statistical</b> <b>documents.</b> It was found that many teachers are appointed to headships with little skill in leadership and management, still fewer of them are sent for leadership training yearly. Moreover, results revealed that, shortage of essential services and of teachers, together with many responsibilities, causes a good number of heads to feel discontented with their job. Surprisingly, it was also found that some school heads work without guidelines on how to implement the Secondary Education Development Plan (SEDP). The study was limited by the number of respondents; simply 37. 1 percent of all participants responded. This necessitates further research, employing a larger sample, on the preparation and development of schools heads in Shinyanga so as to reach an accurate conclusion. Moreover, an investigation into the importance of training to enhance performance is imperative.
