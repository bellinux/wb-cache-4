The fast deceleration of the liquid leads to water hammer upstream the valve and to cavitational hammer downstream the fast closing valve. The valve characteristics given by manufacturers are usually measured at steady state flow conditions of the liquid. In comparison, the dynamic characteristics depend on the initial liquid velocity, valve closing velocity, the absolute pipe pressure and the pipe geometry. Fraunhofer UMSICHT conducts various test series examining valve dynamic characteristics in order of the dynamic analysis of pressure surges in fast closing processes. Therefore a test rig is used which consists of two pipelines of DN 50 and DN 100 with an approximate length of 230 m each.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} problem in the safety {{assessment}} of automatic control and protection systems. There is an increasing dependence on software for performing safety-critical functions, like the <b>safety</b> <b>shut-down</b> of dangerous plants. Software brings increased risk of design defects and thus systematic failures; redundancy with diversity between redundant channels is a possible defence. While diversity techniques can improve the dependability of software-based systems, they do not alleviate the difficulties of assessing whether such a system is safe enough for operation. We study this problem for a simple safety protection system consisting of two diverse channels performing the same function. The problem is evaluating its probability of failure in demand. Assuming failure independence between dangerous failures of the channels is unrealistic. One can instead use evidence from the observation of the whole system's behaviour under realistic test conditions. Standard inference procedures can then estimate system reliability, but they take no advantage of a system’s fault-tolerant structure. We show how to extend these techniques to take account of fault tolerance by a conceptually straightforward application of Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, the method is computationally complex and requires the conceptually difficult step of specifying 'prior' distributions for the parameters of interest. This paper presents the correct inference procedure, exemplifies possible pitfalls in its application and clarifies some non-intuitive issues about reliability assessment for fault-tolerant software...|$|R

On the same basis the potential and the limits of the safety conception realized in the AVR with self-stabilization in the case of accident can be determined.

40|$|The areas {{reviewed}} {{in this section}} of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) include those instrumentation and control systems-associated with systems used to achieve and maintain a safe shutdown condition of the plant. To the extent that the engineered safety feature (ESF) systems are used to achieve and maintain safe shutdown, the review of these systems in this section is limited to those features which are unique to safe shutdown and not directly related to accident mitigation. Such features may involve individual component control for safe shutdown versus sytem level actuation for accident mitigation or system operating modes which involve considerations which differ for safe shutdown and accident mitigation. This SRP section also addresses the review of those systems required for safe shutdown which are not classified as ESF systems. The specific arrangement of these systems depends on the type of plant (pressurized water reactor, PWR; boiling water reactor, BWR; etc.) as well as on individual plant design features, and the conditions under. which the safe shutdown has to be achieved and maintained. The functional performance requirements of safe <b>shut-down</b> <b>systems</b> and essential auxiliary supporting systems are reviewed by other branches in accordance with the SRP sections which address these systems. There are two kinds of shutdown conditions: hot shutdown and cold shutdown.

For the CPP method the cleaning system is directly coupled with the filter candles. One feature of this new technique is that the cleaning gas pressure exceeds the system pressure only by 0. 05 to 0. 1 MPa, whereas in case of conventional jet pulse systems two times the system pressure (at least 0. 6 MPa) is standard. The key advantage of the coupled pressure pulse cleaning is that a safety filter for each filter candle can be integrated in the clean gas side of the filter.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of many modern computer and communication systems is {{dictated by the}} latency of communication pipelines. At the same time, power/energy consumption is often another limiting factor in many portable systems. We {{address the problem of}} how to minimize the power consumption in system-level pipelines under latency constraints. In particular, we apply fragmentation technique to achieve parallelism and exploit advantages provided by variable voltage design methodology to optimally select voltage and, therefore, speed of each pipeline stage. We focus our study on the practical case when each pipeline stage operates at a fixed speed. Unlike the conventional pipeline system, where all stages run at the same speed, our system may have different stages running at different speeds to conserve energy while providing guaranteed latency. For a given latency requirement, we find explicit solutions for the most energy efficient fragmentation and voltage setting. We further study a less practical case when each stage can dynamically change its speed to get further energy saving. We define the problem and transform it to a nonlinear system whose solution provides a lower bound for energy consumption. We apply the obtained theoretical results to develop algorithms for power/energy minimization of computer and communication systems. The experimental result suggests that significant power/energy reduction, is possible without additional latency. In fact, we achieve almost 40 % total energy saving over the combined minimal supply voltage selection and <b>system</b> <b>shut-down</b> technique and 85 % if none of these two energy minimization methods is used.

Examples of such measures are evacuation of buildings, <b>shut-down</b> of critical <b>systems</b> (nuclear reactors, industrial chemical processes, etc.) and stopping of high-speed trains. The type of mitigation measures that can be effectively activated depends on the amount of warning time available, but timeliness is often in conflict with the reliability of the predictions, which become more accurate as more seismic sensor data is collected. There is therefore an inevitable trade-off between the amount of warning time available and the reliability of the predictions provided by the Early Warning System. To investigate this trade-off, the consequences of the two alternatives of taking mitigation actions or not acting must be analyzed, accounting for significant uncertainty in the predictions. In this report, we present a decision-making procedure based on the real-time evaluation of the consequences of taking no action and of activating mitigation measures which is based on the probabilities of false and missed alerts.

Examples of such measures are evacuation of buildings, <b>shut-down</b> of critical <b>systems</b> (nuclear reactors, industrial chemical processes, etc.) and stopping of high-speed trains. In areas close to faults, where seismic EWS are especially relevant, only tens of seconds of warning are available. Such short warning times mean that to be effective a seismic EWS must depend on automated procedures, including those for decision making about whether to activate mitigation measures; the time is too short to require human intervention when the event is first detected. As a result of the automation, careful attention must be paid to the design of the local seismic EWS for each critical facility; in particular, a means of controlling the trade-off between false alarms and missed alarms is desirable. To investigate this trade-off, the consequences of the two alternatives of taking mitigation actions or not acting must be analyzed, accounting for significant uncertainty in the predictions.

40|$|The MAX IV {{facility}} in Lund, Sweden, {{consists of two}} storage rings for production of synchrotron radiation, and a full-energy LINAC for top-up injections. The LINAC also delivers short high-intensity electron bunches to a short pulse facility. MAX IV was inaugurated in June 2016, and the larger 3 GeV ring has been delivering light to users since November 2016. In this thesis, the design and implementation of RF kickers for different systems in MAX IV are presented. The first system is the chopper which {{is located in the}} so called thermionic pre-injector that delivers the electron pulses to the main LINAC during ring injections. The electron source is here a thermionic S-band RF gun. All electrons that enter the chopper can not be captured by the rings during injection. These undesired electrons are deflected and dumped by the chopper before they reach the first accelerating structure in the LINAC. The RF kickers in the chopper system are two planar striplines. The second system is the bunch-by-bunch feedback system in the 3 GeV ring. The system is mainly used to suppress coupled-bunch mode instabilities. These instabilities drive coherent oscillations of the electron bunches. The oscillations have a degrading effect on the beam quality since they increase the effective emittance and the energy spread. By sampling the beam motion, the bunch-by-bunch feedback system suppresses the oscillations by corrective kicks to the bunches in all three planes via RF kickers. The system is also a comprehensive diagnostic tool {{that can be used to}} characterize many different parameters of the ring. This far, two striplines have been operating as RF kickers in the three planes. A waveguide overloaded cavity kicker has been designed, and this device will operate as a dedicated kicker in the longitudinal plane after the 2017 summer <b>shut-down.</b> The third <b>system</b> is a diagnostic stripline with switching networks that is mainly used for betatron tune measurements in the two MAX IV storage rings and in the SOLARIS storage ring. This stripline can be used for many different applications...|$|R
40|$|On-board {{reforming}} {{of liquid}} fuels into hydrogen is an enabling technology that could accelerate consumer usage of fuel cell powered vehicles. The technology would leverage {{the convenience of}} the existing gasoline fueling infrastructure while {{taking advantage of the}} fuel cell efficiency and low emissions. Commercial acceptance of on-board reforming faces several obstacles that include: (1) startup time, (2) transient response, and (3) system complexity (size, weight and cost). These obstacles are being addressed in a variety of projects through development, integration and optimization of existing fuel processing system designs. In this project, CESI investigated steam reforming (SR), water-gas-shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation (PrOx) catalysts while developing plate reactor designs and hardware where the catalytic function is integrated into a primary surface heat exchanger. The plate reactor approach has several advantages. The separation of the reforming and combustion streams permits the reforming reaction to be conducted at a higher pressure than the combustion reaction, thereby avoiding costly gas compression for combustion. The separation of the two streams also prevents the dilution of the reformate stream by the combustion air. The advantages of the plate reactor are not limited to steam reforming applications. In a WGS or PrOx reaction, the non-catalytic side of the plate would act as a heat exchanger to remove the heat generated by the exothermic WGS or PrOx reactions. This would maintain the catalyst under nearly isothermal conditions whereby the catalyst would operate at its optimal temperature. Furthermore, the plate design approach results in a low pressure drop, rapid transient capable and attrition-resistant reactor. These qualities are valued in any application, be it on-board or stationary fuel processing, since they reduce parasitic losses, increase over-all system efficiency and help perpetuate catalyst durability. In this program, CESI took the initial steam reforming plate-reactor concept and advanced it towards an integrated fuel processing system. A substantial amount of modeling was performed to guide the catalyst development and prototype hardware design and fabrication efforts. The plate-reactor mechanical design was studied in detail to establish design guidelines which would help the plate reactor survive the stresses of repeated thermal cycles (from start-ups and <b>shut-downs).</b> Integrated <b>system</b> performance modeling was performed to predict system efficiencies and determine the parameters with the most significant impact on efficiency. In conjunction with the modeling effort, a significant effort was directed towards catalyst development. CESI developed a highly active, sulfur tolerant, coke resistant, precious metal based reforming catalyst. CESI also developed its own non-precious metal based water-gas shift catalyst and demonstrated the catalysts durability over several thousands of hours of testing. CESI also developed a unique preferential oxidation catalyst capable of reducing 1 % CO to < 10 ppm CO over a 35 C operating window through a single pass plate-based reactor. Finally, CESI combined the modeling results and steam reforming catalyst development efforts into prototype hardware. The first generation 3 kW(e) prototype was fabricated from existing heat-exchanger plates to expedite the fabrication process. This prototype demonstrated steady state operation ranging from 5 to 100 % load conditions. The prototype also demonstrated a 20 : 1 turndown ratio, 10 : 1 load transient operation and rapid start-up capability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} three {{problems within}} the eld of competing risks modelling in reliability. The rst problem concerns {{the question of}} identi ability within certain subclasses of Doyen and Gaudoin's recently proposed generalised competing risks framework. Bedford and Lindqvist have shown identi ability for one such subclass - a two component series system in which, every time a component fails it is restored to a state "as good as new", while the other component is restored to a state "as bad as old". In this thesis two different subclasses are shown to be identifiable. The first is a generalisation of the Bedford and Lindqvist example for series systems with n components. The second is an n component series system in which each time a component fails it is restored to a state "as good as new". At {{the same time the}} remaining components are restored to a state "as good as new" with probability p (which may depend on both the component being restored and the component that failed), or to a state "as bad as old" with probability (1 - p). The second problem concerns the use of competing risks models to study opportunistic maintenance. Bedford and Alkali proposed the following model - the system exhibits a sequence of warning signals, the inter-arrival times of which are assumed to be independently distributed (but non-identical) exponential random variables. The hazard rate of the time to system failure is modelled as a piecewise exponential distribution, in which the hazard rate is constant between signals. A sequence of maintenance opportunities occurs according to a homogeneous Poisson process and the rst opportunity after the kth signal is used to preventatively maintain the system. In this thesis closed form expressions for the above model are calculated (subject to some minor technical restrictions) for the marginal distributions of the time to both preventative and corrective maintenance. Also, the sub-distribution of the time to corrective maintenance is calculated. The third problem concerns the estimation of the marginal distribution for one of two independent competing risks, when knowledge of which risk caused the <b>system</b> <b>shut-down</b> is unknown for some of the observations in the dataset. In this thesis a new estimator based on the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator is developed for the above set-up. A re-distribution to the right algorithm is also developed and this is shown to be equivalent to the new estimator. The new estimator is also shown to be consistent.
