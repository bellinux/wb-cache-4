40|$|Saussure was an {{innovator}} of the meta-linguistic terminology, too. In {{addition to}} his theoretical analysis he tried to find the more adequate terms {{to explain how the}} language works. The Greek philosophers were the main source of this theoretical and <b>terminological</b> <b>research.</b> The essay compares concepts and terms of the Saussurian linguistic with concepts and terms of Greek philosophy. "Signifiant" and "signifié", for example, which belong to the common sense of modern linguist, are a Saussurian innovation modeled on the stoic couple "semainon/semainòmenon". But this is not a loan translation. He focuses on the arbitrary nature of their relation through the Aristotle’s and early Stoicism’s analyses on the notion of "pros ti".

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} devoted to {{analysis}} of the stable word complex as a linguistic unit as it is acquiring a new vision within the integrated scientific knowledge. The subject of analysis is {{the evolution of the}} above-mentioned notion from the moment of its defining in the Russian linguistics of the XX century and up to the present. The author aims to demonstrate the possible practical application of the above-mentioned notion to the <b>terminological</b> <b>research</b> within the cognitive-discourse paradigm. Methodology. The comparative analysis constitutes the basis of the research. Results. The results of the study are that the author defines the complex terminological unit as a stable word complex and shows its implementation in the phraseology within the field of cognitive linguistic research paradigm. Practical implications. The results of the study can be applied in the linguistic texts analysis as well as the analysis of the terminological lexical systems within cognitive-discourse phraseology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{translation}} process of specialized texts should {{take into consideration}} two essential dimensions: the content and the form, as they are exactly the elements the translator has to transfer from a source language A to a target language B. It is an interdisciplinary process as it implies translation methods and techniques {{and at the same}} time documentation work and <b>terminological</b> <b>research</b> in that field. The aim of this article is to analyze the process of teaching specialized translation through film subtitling, proving that it must deal with a double aspect: notional and linguistic. The student has to learn how to gather information quickly and efficiently and how to use the new knowledge. We shall analyze, as well, the way the documentation and the terminological work fit into the process of translation. They must not replace the student's translation competence, because a text which is the result of a good documentation is not necessarily a well translated text. We shall prove that, even if he/she has to translate a specialized text, the translator has his/her freedom and must use his/her creativity in translating it...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{will discuss}} the {{benefits}} of applying a thorough <b>terminological</b> <b>research</b> approach to translation and interpreting lessons in undergraduate courses for interpreters and translators. The idea was born after {{and thanks to the}} cooperation of TermCoord, the terminology unit of the European Union, which has recently developed collaboration projects with universities to improve and update their terminology database. This cooperation confirmed what we had already experienced in our courses. As professors at a university for interpreters and translators, we were able to identify some specific needs and weaknesses of the young students and this led us to use glossaries as a means to improve their language knowledge and technical skills. We realised that it is very useful to teach the students a correct terminological approach and make them prepare glossaries themselves. We will first briefly introduce some theoretical approaches in the field of terminology, then show how to apply them though practical examples taken from real texts and glossaries we use and prepare during our lessons, with concrete suggestions to adopt in translation courses...|$|R
40|$|Using {{computers}} for terminology management has an almost 50 years old history. At {{the beginning of}} the sixties of the last century main frame computers were programmed to elaborate, maintain and retrieve terminological data collections. Later mini computers and (networking) personal computers were used to manage terminology for certain subject fields and the way of supporting terminological activities changed. Today the internet provides not only a medium for <b>terminological</b> <b>research</b> but also an online platform for world-wide cooperative terminology work. The paper describes the different stages of computational terminology management with special attention to the possibilities how the software solutions can support (and impede) the terminologist. In particular it is explained in detail how specific principles and methods of terminology theory were influenced by the technology and how terminological working methods have changed over the time. Special attention is drawn to ISO standards for terminological data modelling and the possibilities the world wide web offers to terminologists.

40|$|The {{growing body}} of {{research}} on large-scale mass wasting events so far has only scarcely investigated the sedimentology of chaotic deposits from non-volcanic terrestrial landslides such that any overarching and <b>systematic</b> <b>terminological</b> framework remains elusive. Yet recent work has emphasized the need for better understanding the internal structure and composition of rockslide deposits as a means to characterise the mechanics during the final stages of runout and emplacement. We offer a comprehensive overview on the occurrence of rock fragmentation and frictional melt both at different geographic locations, and different sections within large (> 10 (6) m(3)) rockslide masses. We argue that exposures of pervasively fragmented and interlocked jigsaw-cracked rock masses; basal melange containing rip-up clasts and phantom blocks; micro-breccia; and thin bands of basal frictionite are indispensable clues for identifying deposits from giant rockslides that may remain morphologically inconspicuous otherwise. These sedimentary assemblages are diagnostic tools for distinguishing large rockslide debris from macro and microscopically similar glacial deposits, tectonic fault-zone breccias, and impact breccias, and thus help avoid palaeoclimatic and tectonic misinterpretations, let alone misestimates of the hazard from giant rockslides. Moreover, experimental results from Mossbauer spectroscopy of frictionite samples support visual interpretations of thin sections, and demonstrate that short-lived (1500 degrees C in the absence of water occurred at the base of several giant moving rockslides. This finding supports previous theories of dry excess runout accompanied by comminution of rock masses down to gm-scale, and indicates that catastrophic motion of large fragmenting rock masses does not require water as a potential lubricant...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{concerns}} the problems surrounding {{the use of}} the term "concept" in current ontology and terminology research. It is based on the constructive dialogue between realist ontology on the one hand and the world of formal standardization of health informatics on the other, but its conclusions are not restricted to the domain of medicine. The term "concept" is one of the most misused even in literature and technical standards which attempt to bring clarity. In this paper we propose to use the term "concept" in the context of producing defined professional terminologies with one specific and consistent meaning which we propose for adoption as the agreed meaning of the term in future <b>terminological</b> <b>research,</b> and specifically in the development of formal terminologies to be used in computer systems. We also discuss and propose new definitions of a set of cognate terms. We describe the relations governing the realm of concepts, and compare these to the richer and more complex set of relations obtaining between entities in the real world. On this basis we also summarize an associated terminology for ontologies as representations of the real world and a partial mapping between the world of concepts and the world of reality.

40|$|Approaching old textsâ lexical {{reservoirs}} {{and recognizing}} {{them not only}} leads to more enrichment and productivity of Persian language vocabularies but also {{can be an effective}} pace toward investigating historical trend of Persian language in the domain of words and terminologies. Holy Quranâs interpretation, known as Cambridge commentary, is doubtlessly among the most valuable works for investigating the status of prose texts in historical linguistics and <b>terminological</b> <b>researches</b> of old texts. One of the notable tools of this interpretation, and maybe its distinctive feature compared to other old commentaries of the Quran, is the elegant attractive homogeneity between its lexical and linguistic structure and Khorasaniâs style, especially in its proper and organized usage of words. Taking a special look at the lofty Cambridge commentary of the Quran as a precious sample of Persian language lexicons, this article explores the linguistic value of old texts. Hence, setting a lexical comparison of Cambridge commentary with Khorasani poemsâ style as a pivotal element, 36 rare words are chosen from this book and compared with 40 Persian old texts belonging to 4 th- 6 th Hegira centuries. Among them, 18 sources are in verse form, 10 are Quranic, 6 are Persian and Arabic dictionaries to Persian and 6 sources are other old prose works.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Terminology and Lexicography {{have been}} {{especially}} addressed to the Allied Health Sciences regarding discussion of case reports or concerning publication of scientific articles. The knowledge of Human Anatomy enables the understanding of medical terms and the refinement of Medical Terminology makes possible a better anatomicomedical communication in a highly technical level. Most of the scientific publications in both Anatomy and Medicine are found only in English and most of dictionaries or search resources available do not have specificity enough to explain anatomicomedical, terminological, or lexicographical occurrences. OBJECTIVE: To design and produce a multilingual terminological dictionary (Latim-English-Portuguese-Spanish) containing a list of English anatomicomedical terms in common usage in cardiology subspecialties addressed to medical students and professionals, to other allied health sciences professionals, and to translators working in this specific field. METHODS: Terms, semantical and grammatical components were selected to compose an anatomicocardiological corpus. The adequacy to the thematic <b>terminological</b> <b>research</b> requests and the translation reliability level will be settled from the terminology specificity {{in contrast to the}} semantics, as well as from a peer survey of the main terms used by national and international experts in specialized journals, Internet sites, and from text-books on Anatomy and Cardiology. The inclusion criteria will be the terms included in the English, Portuguese, and Spanish Terminologia Anatomica - the official terminology of the anatomical sciences; nonofficial technical commonly used terms which lead to terminology or translation misunderstanding often being a source of confusion. RESULTS: A table with a sample of the 508 most used anatomical cardiologic terms in English language peer-reviewed journals of cardiology and (pediatric and adult) thoracic surgery is shown. CONCLUSIONS: The working up of a multilingual terminological dictionary reduces the risk of ambiguities, inconsistencies, inutilities, and repetitions concerning the Nomenclature addressed to the Allied Health Sciences by prioritizing the inclusion of official technical terms and a judicious selection of commonly used terms. Efforts to standardize lists of structures in Humana Anatomy lead to both opportunities of scientific update and conceptual enlightenmen...|$|R

40|$|The lack of {{terminology}} in Zulu can {{be overcome}} if it is developed to meet international scientific and technical demands. This lack of terminology {{can be traced back}} to the absence of proper language policy implementation with regard to the African languages. Even though Zulu possesses the basic elements that are necessary for its development, such as orthographical standards, dictionaries, grammars and published literature, a number of problems exist within the technical elaboration and standardisation processes: *	Inconsistencies in the application of standard rules, in relation to both orthography and terminology. *	The lack of standardisation of the (technical) word-formation patterns in Zulu. (Generally the role of culture in elaboration has largely been overlooked). *	The avoidance of exploiting written technical text corpora as a resource for terminology. (Text encoding by means of corpus query tools in term extraction has just begun in Zulu and needs to be properly exemplified). *	The avoidance of introducing oral technical corpora as a resource for improving the acceptability of technical terminology by, for instance, designing a type of reusable corpus annotation. This study contributes towards solving these problems by offering a practical approach within the context of the real written, standard and oral Zulu language, mainly within the medical terminological domain. This approach offers a reusable methodological foundation with proper language exemplification that can guide terminologists in <b>terminological</b> <b>research,</b> or to some extent even train them, to achieve effective technical elaboration and eventual standardisation. This thesis aims at attaining consistent standardisation on the orthographical level in order to ease the elaboration task of the terminologist. It also aims at standardising the methods of word- (term-) formation linking them to cultural factors, such as taboo. However, this thesis also emphasises the significance of using written and oral technical corpora as terminology resource. This, for instance, is made possible through the application of corpus linguistics, in semi-automatic term extraction from a written technical corpus to aid lemmatisation (listing entries) and in corpus annotation to improve the acceptability of terminology, based on the comparison of standard terms with oral terms.

In the diachronic perspective, I try to grasp the social context and historical origins of agenda-setting as a concept, its development, main trends, and developmental lines. This way, I move forward to the synchronic perspective and describe academic grounding of agenda-setting; I give a detailed analysis of the present level of the agenda-setting research and the main research areas through available classifications.

40|$|Background: Much of the {{research}} and scholarship {{in the field of}} CSR has been plagued by the issue of what CSR is. The most cited definition is Carroll’s pyramid of CSR (1999) which proposes four responsibilities of business: economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic. Yet some have debated how philanthropy can be realistically conceived as a responsibility when most are agreed, including Carroll himself, that philanthropy is a discretionary activity (Baden and Harwood, 2013). Such potential dichotomies suggest that what is required is an adapted approach to how CSR is defined. In this paper we draw upon our recent case study research to shed light on, if not actually resolve, this <b>terminological</b> ambiguity. The <b>research</b> develops an implicit (tacit) / explicit (codified) framework of CSR that is adapted from Matten and Moon’s implicit / explicit institutional framework (Matten and Moon, 2008) ...|$|R

The paper concludes with a description of the geographic background in the ethnolinguistic dictionary Slavic Antiquities, whose main purpose is a reconstruction of old Slavic culture aided by the linguistic method of study of folk culture, i. e. the study of verbal expressions for a number of cultural phenomena (lexical and phraseological items) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{disaster}} statistics and disaster occurrence {{is a complicated}} interdisciplinary field involving the interplay of new theoretical findings from several scientific fields like mathematics, physics, and computer science. Statistical studies on the mode of occurrence of natural disasters largely rely on fundamental findings in the statistics of rare events, which were derived in the 20 th century. With regard to natural disasters, {{it is not so}} much the fact that the importance of this problem for mankind was recognized during the last third of the 20 th century - the myths one encounters in ancient civilizations show that the problem of disasters has always been recognized - rather, it is the fact that mankind now possesses the necessary theoretical and practical tools to effectively study natural disasters, which in turn supports effective, major practical measures to minimize their impact. All the above factors have resulted in considerable progress in natural disaster research. Substantial accrued material on natural disasters and the use of advanced recording techniques have opened new doors for empirical analysis. However, despite the considerable progress made, the situation is still far from ideal. Sufficiently complete catalogs of events are still not available for many types of disasters, and the methodological and even <b>terminological</b> bases of <b>research</b> need to be further developed and standardized. The present monograph summarizes recent advances in the field of disaster statistics, primarily focusing on the occurrence of disasters that can be described by distributions with heavy tails. These disasters typically occur on a very broad range of scales, the rare greatest events being capable of causing losses comparable to the total losses of all smaller disasters of the same type.
