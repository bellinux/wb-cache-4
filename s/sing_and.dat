The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E

5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets {{are added to}} the original scoring.

Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of <b>Sing</b> <b>and</b> Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they too are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{acoustic}} cues {{and human}} capability for discriminating <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices are discussed {{to develop an}} automatic discrimination system for <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices. Based {{on the results of}} preliminary subjective experiments, listeners discriminate between <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices with 70. 0 % accuracy for 200 ms signals and 99. 7 % for one-second signals. Since even short stimuli of 200 ms can be correctly discriminated, not only temporal characteristics but also short-time spectral features can be cues for discrimination. To examine how listeners distinguish between these two voices, we conducted subjective experiments with <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voice stimuli whose voice quality and prosody were systematically distorted by using signal processing techniques. The experimental results suggest that spectral and prosodic cues complementarily contributed to perceptual judgments. Furthermore, a software system that can automatically discriminate between <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> speaking voices and such performances is also reported...|$|R

5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most Barbadians.

5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In December 1969, Bell and Wrixon met {{by chance}} in a pub in Dublin {{and found that}} they shared similar ideas of forming a band, and decided to visit the Countdown Club where they saw Lynott and Downey perform with Orphanage. Lynott was not playing bass guitar at this time, but Bell was {{particularly}} impressed by Downey, and introduced himself to Lynott and Downey during a break. When Bell asked if they would consider forming a band together, Downey was initially sceptical, but both men were aware of Bell's musical reputation. They agreed on condition that Lynott play bass guitar as well as <b>sing,</b> <b>and</b> that the band would perform some of Lynott's compositions.
