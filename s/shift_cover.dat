Over the years, as the volume of volunteers (people x <b>shifts</b> <b>covered)</b> has increased, the ticket cap was increased. Other factors taken into account when raising the ticket cap are the availability of space for parking and the impact of noise on surrounding residents.|$|R

40|$|The {{paradigm}} shift has occurred since more than 40 years. This <b>shift</b> <b>covers</b> almost all fields of science. As {{a tradition of}} revolutionary thinking, a {{paradigm shift}} also occurred in education, particularly in language education. This article contains {{a review of the}} process of paradigm shift in a communicative language teaching, namely the shift from positivism to post positivism. This discussion includes eight aspects of change, among others, Learner Autonomy, the essence a Social Learning, Curriculum Integration, Focus on Meaning, Diversity, Thinking Skills, Alternative Measurement, and Teachers as Co-LearnersIn fact the eighth aspects of paradigm were not fully implemented thoroughly in public education, particularly in the field of second language. Educators and other stakeholders have been trying to understand and implement the change by way of partial, rather than a holistic manner. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that this change is important to improve the quality of learning a second language...|$|R

3000|$|Assume that {{parameters}} d 1, d 2, and d 3 are {{the number}} of nurses required for morning, evening, and night scheduling periods on each day, respectively. Based on assumptions 3 and 4 discussed in “Problem description,” a long <b>shift</b> <b>covers</b> the demands of both morning and evening scheduling periods on each day, simultaneously. Thus, if the maximum possible number of nurses is assigned to this shift on each day, {{the number of}} required nurses during each day is minimized. It {{is clear that the}} maximum number of required nurses to work in long shift is equivalent to the minimum number of required nurses to work in the morning or evening shifts. For instance, assume that d 1  =  7, d 2  =  4, and d 3  =  3. In this case, the minimum number of nurses required for a day is equal to 10 nurses (3, 3, and 4 nurses for morning, night, and long shift, respectively). Thus, the minimum number of nurses required for each day can be calculated by max{d 1, d 2 } + d 3 [...].|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{species and}} low {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) threaten the biodiversity and ecosystem health of estuaries worldwide. To test {{the hypothesis that}} exposure to low DO reduces resistance of epifaunal community to invasion in the Chesapeake Bay, we conducted experiments using standardized settling panels, including 1) controlled experiments exposing epifaunal communities to low DO; 2) measurement of the short term response of motile and sessile epifauna to low DO; 3) survey of multiple sites in which community structure was correlated with low DO and other environmental variables; and 4) evaluation of the biological and structural effects of an invasive hydroid and a cryptogenic tunicate, both with high tolerance for low DO, on recruitment and development of epifauna. Periodic hypoxia was correlated with an increased cover of the native serpulid polychaete, Hydroides dianthus . Cover of invasive and cryptogenic species increased with exposure to moderate low DO. Cover and incidence of bryozoans, sabellid polychaetes, and cnidarians differed among DO treatments. Nematodes, caprellids, and harpacticoid copepods vacated epifaunal communities in response to low DO. In the multi-site survey, > 50 % cover of invasive and cryptogenic species was associated with exposure to chronic low DO. Six of eight sites in the survey experienced periodic low DO ( 40 % of days below 4 mg/l DO). <b>Shifting</b> <b>cover</b> of Hydroides dianthus , barnacles, and invasive species was correlated (> 50 %) with percent of days experiencing low DO. Epifaunal heterogeneity reflected environmental differences among sites. Species richness and diversity at local sites declined with increasing abundance of certain taxa in higher salinity, higher diversity areas. Heightened cover of Molgula manhattensis, Hydroides dianthus or barnacles led to reduced local diversity but regional species diversity was maintained through environmental heterogeneity across sites. Conversely, in lower salinity, lower diversity zone, Cordylophora caspia, an invasive hydroid, had {{a positive effect on}} some species. Temporal and spatial <b>shifts</b> in <b>cover</b> of dominant species and in species diversity in response to low DO disturbance and other environmental factors may facilitate persistence of less competitive native or invasive species...|$|R
