40|$|In this essay, Janus {{is used as}} {{a metaphor}} for {{examining}} the nature of cultural diversity in Australian sport. It does so by firstly presenting a historical context for sport in Australia and the relative lack of cultural diversity found in sport. Within a country dominated by the running codes of football and cricket, the position of soccer in Australia was somewhat unique as it became a bastion for many non-Anglo migrant groups. However, in the 1980 s and 1990 s soccer's lack of organizational success at the state and national level was negatively ascribed to the tensions between the ethnically affiliated clubs, the same clubs that were ironically the stalwarts driving the growing popularity of the sport. We examine the initiatives used to restructure the game in Australia to make football more appealing to mainstream (i. e. non-ethnically aligned) spectators. The contemporary situation is explored through <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> and the results of a survey of 3, 056 spectators undertaken during the first season of the new A-League are presented. The essay concludes with a discussion about the relative success of the restructure in terms of changing the face of Australian soccer. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the management of the logistics-manufacturing interface between the manufacturer and its logistics service provider from the perspective of the service-dominant (S-D) logic. Design/methodology/approach: The approach adopted is that of abductive reasoning through case study: data is primarily gleaned from semi-structured in-depth interviews. Field visits and <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> are used to ensure data validity. Findings: The results show that the interface can be categorized into three levels: design interface between products and logistic services, process interface between manufacturing processes and service-offering processes, and information interface between manufacturing information systems and logistics information systems. The results also indicate that ten foundational premises of S-D logic, especially service-focused, customer-oriented, and rational views can be applied in defining and managing these interfaces. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes not only to the theory of S-D logic and managing interface, but also provides managers with guidelines of applying S-D logic to build a service-focused, customer-oriented and relational logic to effectively manage the logistics-manufacturing interface.

40|$|Servitization (Vandermerwe and Rada, 1988), as {{a process}} of value-creation through {{bundling}} services to physical products, has been broadly recognized as a competitive manufacturing strategy to the conventional manufacturer in many industries. It was found that the conventional manufacturers can achieve more revenue from their service units (Quinn et al., 1990; Quinn, 1992), and actually most of the added value comes from service constituents (Machuca et al., 2007). Servitization strategy increasingly plays essential roles on the operations performance and competitive advantage (Sawhney et al., 2004; Slack et al., 2004) of the conventional manufacturers, in particular during the economy recession time. Two servitization strategies are identified based on the case studies in the PC industry and <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> research. Product-centric servitization strategy focuses on providing physical products and associated services (normally after-sale services) on time to the customers, whilst service-centric strategy emphasizes on offering services or servitized products in a timely fashion. The capability requirements and organizational features are different for these two types of servitization strategy. The results show that the choice of the servitization strategy largely depends on the core competence what have been established in the company. From the perspective of industry, its development of the whole industry is substantially affected by the interrelationships among all the related industries. Furthermore, well-designed policies by the industrial associations and the government are vital to the further development of the PC manufacturing industry...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual research framework is devised from a review of the literature, and case studies are used to investigate the manufacturing strategies and practices in place in the case companies. Data is collected through semi-structured interviews and <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation.</b> Findings – The results show that, with over-capacity in the Chinese bus manufacturing industry, success is no longer determined by high productivity or low price; a quick response to the customers' tailored demands is essential in a climate of fierce competition. The suggested best practices for time-based competitive advantages comprise building technical centers and post-doctoral research stations, applying modularity logic, adopting RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), and optimizing processes by, for example, involving customers and integrating inbound and outbound logistics.

The latter is considerably cheaper; for example the nine region innovation systems project described in Cooke, Boekholt & Tödtling (2000) cost the European Union some € 1 million at 1996 – 8 prices. Accordingly, given the global scale of the research task essayed in this paper, the latter approach was inspirational but the former was the more practical. The methodology adopted was thus dependent on semi-structured interviews with representative firms and support agencies, individual and group analyses and {{a small number of}} reflect-back workshops. First, key ICT ecosystems were identified. For example, in Europe this involved <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> and data analysis to identify these, then meetings were set up with key firms and agencies (e.g. cluster manager) where semi-structured interviews were held involving two interviewers. Individual and group analyses were then conducted for interpretation and triangulation purposes. Finally, in the European-based research, which also involved inquiry into global shifts in ICT, results were reported to two reflect-back workshops with ICT firm and agency representatives and respondents from the regional ecosystems. In Asia and north America, ICT research documentation was accessed and expert interviews conducted with knowledgeable respondents from industry, government or academe as appropriate and available. On most occasions reflect-back opportunities occurred at workshops and seminars where forerunners of this paper were presented. Although dualistic, with more formalised and direct face-to-face firm and agency interviewing in the first part and co-present, but for practical reasons, more distanced interactions in the second, the results nevertheless (after Geertz, 1973) provide rich, thick descriptions of real phenomena and action instances, theory testing and facilitation of communication to governance, managerial and academic audiences (Birkinshaw et al., 2011; see also Marschan-Piekkari & Welch, 2004).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{draws from}} a bi-national {{comparative}} {{study on the}} importance of ‘winning’ within university sport in England and the United States, in two institutions, University College Worcester (UCW) and the British University Sport Association (BUSA) in England and Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. The thesis focuses on perceptions and attitudes related to the ‘amateur’ – ‘commercial’ ethos of winning, specifically of administrative personnel, coaches and athletes within these systems. In order to provide a contextual setting, the socio-historical development of sport culture generally and in universities in particular was examined in both countries. This context also provided an informed rationale for ‘participants’ perceptions and attitudes selected for this study. A multi-method approach for data collection was utilised comprising questionnaire and interview instruments supported by a comprehensive underpinning literature review including participant observation and analysis of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> in a comparative dimension. The study’s findings suggest that the extent of the importance of winning within university sport in England and the United States is influenced by a range of shaping factors. BUSA’s central goal emanates from an ‘amateur’ approach that includes features such as ‘mass-participation’ and recreational enjoyment for the student-athletes participating. The NCAA is a business-run organisation that operates on financial budgets into the millions. Inter-collegiate sport serves as a major form of entertainment in American society, with ‘commercial’ pressures driving a ‘winning’ attitude on all levels. However, the empirical evidence and participant observations do suggest an emerging blurring of perceptions, especially amongst the athlete groups at both UCW and NNU. The evidence reveals features, which challenge accepted orthodoxy on {{the nature and extent of}} the ‘amateur’ – ‘commercial’ ethos continuum in both university systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence that}} unionized faculty associations have had on the management and governance structures of Canadian universities by exploring the reasons that led to certification, the certification process, and the collective bargaining history at three research level Anglophone universities. Since the 1940 s Canadian labour legislation has permitted unionization and collective bargaining in the private sector, {{but it was only}} in the mid 1960 s that changes in the legislation, at both the federal and provincial levels, allowed individuals in the public sector to unionize. The certification of professionals in the public sector gave Canadian university faculty associations the model they needed to consider unionization and collective bargaining as a viable means by which they might ensure academic freedom, increase faculty autonomy and improve compensation. The three universities [...] the University of Manitoba, Dalhousie University and Queen's University [...] were studied using case study methodology, which included interviews, examination of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation,</b> and textual analysis of collective agreements. In each case, the conditions under which unionization occurred have been examined, the reasons for certification analysed, and the results discussed. This study shows that unionization led in fundamental ways to changes in the governance and management structure of the universities, with authority relating to faculty personnel matters shifting from the senate to direct negotiations between the board of governors and faculty associations. As a result, significant management powers have devolved from the senior academic administrators to academic peers. The gentlemen's agreements, formerly forged during senate debates, have been replaced by negotiated collective agreements. The overall implications of these changes on the governance and management of Canadian Anglophone universities have generally been positive, but only time will tell whether they will continue to be so...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{financial}} incentives mechanisms (FIMs) in Australian government large nonresidential building projects {{is seen as}} a way to improve project motivation and outcomes and reinforce long-term commitment between participants. Yet very little empirical research has been conducted into how FIMs should be applied in the context of construction projects and what determines their impact on motivation. The primary aim of this research was to identify the motivation drivers impacting on the achievement of FIM goals. This allowed for the formulation of recommendations to improve Australian government building procurement strategies, creating the potential for better project outcomes. The research involved four major case studies of large construction projects. Analysis of motivation drivers on each project was based on interviews with senior project participants, <b>secondary</b> <b>documentation</b> and site visits. Once the motivation drivers were identified, they were ranked by the weighted number of motivation indicators impacted, to give an indication of their relative importance. The results provide Australian government clients with key areas for policy direction. The findings indicate that the following motivation drivers (in order of impact) were more important than FIM design in achieving FIM goals: equitable contract risk allocation and management scope for future project opportunities with the client harmonious project relationships early contractor involvement in design stages value-driven tender selection processes. A consequence of ignoring these key procurement initiatives can be a less than ideal FIM goal performance, despite the nature of FIM design, including the strength of the reward on offer. FIMs have {{the potential to be a}} valuable addition to any project procurement strategy. Yet, the main message of this thesis is: If clients rely solely on financial incentives as the driver of motivation it will likely result in failure...|$|E
