500|$|Kelly {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Sian Prior, a journalist, university lecturer and opera singer, from 2002 to 2011. They met when Kelly was interviewed on her Sunday Arts ABC radio program. Kelly wrote [...] "You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine" [...] for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished. Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, {{as well as with the}} Stardust Five. She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions including clarinet on six tracks of his A – Z Recordings boxed set. In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, [...] "I got lucky, I met a woman who said: 'It's me or it'. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' every day for a long time. Less now". The couple had separated during the making of Kelly's biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, {{this is a really}} tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> one lingering, anxious look, {{and opened}} the door.|$|E
60|$|HARRY. That's {{the only}} reason I put up with her. <b>She</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> creeps. I have the {{impression}} that she watches every movement I make.|$|R
6000|$|... "In coorse she does. Hasn't she known {{me these}} tin years? Are we not related? Didn't <b>she</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> very horse which I rode, and, to make belave, tould you I'd bought in London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My girl <b>she</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> go onst, [...] When I was a London lad, [...] An' I went on {{the drink}} for a fortnight, [...] An' then I went to the bad. [...] <b>The</b> Queen <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a shillin' [...] To fight for 'er over the seas; [...] But Guv'ment built me a fever-trap, [...] An' Injia <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> disease.|$|R
6000|$|... "From Granny Willis. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> name, an' I likes it, an' mean {{to stick}} by it--Good arternoon, gen'lemen. Ta, ta, Punch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not mannish. And yet <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> notion that, {{when it came}} to companionship, {{she would}} be just as well {{satisfied}} with a lot of girls as young men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{stolen the}} Flibberty, Mr. Sheldon. Run clean away with her. She's a wild one. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> fever. Brought it on by shock. And got me drunk, as well--rotten drunk." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> didn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{time to ask}} of what precisely. She {{raised her}} head and {{addressed}} me.|$|R
60|$|My name is Marguerite Forrester--an absurdly long {{name for}} so small a girl. Aunt Martha always calls me Marguerite, with an accent of strong disapproval. She {{does not like}} my name, but <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> full benefit of it. Connie Shelmardine {{used to call me}} Rita. Connie was my roommate last year at the Seminary. We {{correspond}} occasionally, but Aunt Martha frowns on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hain't {{got nothing}} against her," [...] he declared; [...] "I {{tried to make}} that plain. She's as nice and common a young lady as I ever see, and I don't believe she had a {{thing to do with}} it. But I suspicioned they was up to somethin' when she brought them baskets. And when <b>she</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> message from old Flint, I was sure of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In such doings?" [...] Her simple {{description}} of them required, {{in the light}} of her expression, to be carried no further, and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> whole thing as she had never done. [...] "I believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend {{take this}} sceptre {{in memory of}} me, but beware how thou usest it save at the last to summon me, for it has virtues," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> jewelled Sistrum that she bore--then said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will try}} a shot with it, Jerry. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> bag of bullets {{and a box}} of patches and his powder-horn with it. We will see what it will do in our hands, we are both pretty good shots." ...|$|E
60|$|And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest {{to be with}} <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> of <b>the</b> tree, and I did eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I did {{not wish}} to keep her {{standing}} in the street, we now walked on together, and <b>she</b> briefly <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> facts of the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>she</b> had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{slightest}} {{reason to}} hope," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "how easy {{it would be to}} tear this letter into scraps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{deserves it}} well o' me," [...] {{observed}} Gaff, as he slowly printed his signature on the cheque, [...] "for <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Noo Testament, that's bin o' more valley {{to me than}} thousands o' gold an' silver--God bless her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I have," [...] {{said the}} Slogger, [...] "and it's a curious suckumstance that 'er place of abode--so Sally says--is in the Vest End, not wery far from here. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{street and the}} name, but wasn't quite sure of the number." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{said her}} mother, 'when I got {{up this morning}} I found a note put outside my door in which -- But here it is, you can read it for yourself,' and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> slip of paper on which the {{following}} was written: -- ...|$|E
6000|$|Wood. [Aside.] I {{think the}} devil's in her; <b>she</b> has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> hint again.--Well, it shall go hard, but I will offer {{violence}} sometimes; will that content you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I murdered her," [...] screamed {{the miserable}} woman, [...] "I killed her with fright. Why did <b>she</b> not <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> money? ’Twas {{no use to}} her. Ah! Look there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is as much}} {{a mystery}} to me as to you," [...] Gavin answered, [...] "but <b>she</b> will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> money, and that is all I ask of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘To be sure,’ said Mr. Grewgious, provokingly {{slowly and}} internally, as {{he kept his}} eyes on the fire: ‘I might have known it sooner; <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> opening; but I am such an {{exceedingly}} Angular man, that it never occurred to me; I took all for granted.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How dreadful! I do {{not know}} any one that I pity so much as I do her. I {{was in the house}} with her some time, and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> idea of being the most unhappy woman I had ever met with. Don't you think that she is very unhappy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, and it {{was enough}} to {{dismount}} me from my hobby," [...] said Lance. [...] "What! when I thought I had the prettiest girl in the Castle dancing after my whistle, to find that <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> bag to hold, and was smuggling in a corner with a rich old Puritan!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She may be yet," [...] said Edmund smiling, [...] "but she has {{the best}} sort of happiness. She is in less danger of {{clinging}} to this world than we are. And somehow <b>she</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> impression of one too high and noble to seek her happiness {{in the way in}} which most people look for it. Yes, we ourselves, Agnes, we have a nest and home in this world; she stands above it, and her only relation with it is to make others happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{it is very}} rude of you to call me {{a fossil}} when I am only {{approaching}} that stage. Oh! I am glad to see you. I am glad!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> both <b>the</b> outstretched hands.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I had not a {{reliance}} on her being truthful,' said Eugene, after taking some half-dozen turns, 'I should begin to think <b>she</b> had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> slip for the second time. But she promised, {{and she is a}} girl of her word.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are making}} a mistake, Citizen," [...] she said very quietly. [...] "I am Citizeness Candeille's maid. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{passport}} herself, just before I left for England; if you will ask her the question, she will confirm what I say, and she assured {{me that it was}} quite en regle." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Ford {{interrupted}} her. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{impression of}} being a woman who wanted {{a good deal of}} the conversation, and who did not care how she got it. In a conversational sense she thugged Mrs Drassilis at this point, or rather she swept over her like some tidal wave, blotting her out.|$|E
6000|$|We {{found her}} already armed, {{for that day}} she was to ride to Jargeau, and none was with her but her confessor. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best of greetings, and bade me eat bread and drink wine. [...] "And soon," [...] she said, [...] "if you recover the quicker, I trust to give you wine to drink in Paris." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{those few}} words <b>she</b> unconsciously <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> key to her whole character: to that generous trust in others which, in her nature, grew innocently {{out of the}} sense of her own truth. I only knew it {{intuitively}} then. I know it by experience now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes {{she is and}} {{sometimes}} not. She is very sensitive to influences, and at times when Clarke is near she grows almost as enthusiastic as he--at other times she bitterly complains. I tried to free her from Clarke, but <b>she</b> wouldn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> authority necessary." ...|$|R
60|$|The tone {{in which}} she said this made me feel sure she {{was the mother of}} the boy, and when <b>she</b> had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> tea, and looked around in a general way to see that I was {{provided}} with what else I needed, she left the room.|$|R
