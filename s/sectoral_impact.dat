A decomposition analysis identifies the important drivers of the macroeconomic impacts. We show that while expenditure on pollution abatement is a cost for the abating sectors, it also generates an increased demand for the sectors that produce the goods required for pollution abatement. Moreover, we find that positive feedback effects, particularly those related to health can offset the resource costs associated to the clean air policy and result in positive macroeconomic impacts for {{the economy of the}} European Union...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>impacts</b> of the CEE {{integration with}} EU. Adopting a partial equi-librium model we explicitly model {{the agricultural sector}} in CEE. The underlying partial equilibrium model {{is based on the}} duality theory. The model captures all key CAP instruments, such as price sup-port, area payments, animal premiums, quotas and set-aside premiums. The policy simulation analysis allows us to track how changes in the CAP affect the supply and demand behaviour of agricultural producers and consumers of food products. Our simulation results suggest that farm income in CEE will rise mainly due to area payments and animal premiums. The impact on consumer welfare is rather small, as decreasing prices for some food products are offset by increasing prices for other agricultural goods...|$|R

We use a computable general equilibrium model, informed by detailed sector studies, to estimate the economy-wide impacts of climate change under four climate projections. Climate change is found to always reduce national welfare, with poor and urban households and the northern Savannah zone being the worst affected. However, there is wide variation across scenarios {{in the size of}} climate impacts and in the relative importance of <b>sectoral</b> <b>impact</b> channels, thus underscoring the need for multi-sector approaches that account for climate uncertainty.

However, when analyzing the sectoral details, the empirical results indicate that FDI has a varying impact on the productive sectors in Thailand. Out of the 9 sub-sectors covered by this study, 5 sub-sectors (manufacturing, construction, financial, wholesale, retail trade, and agriculture) show strong statistically-significant positive effects of FDI on the relevant sector's value-added output.

Three different electricity generation types (Coal-based, other-fossil-fuels-based and non-fossil-fuel-based) are considered {{along with the other}} industries in the economy. Several simulations with different carbon tax levels and two revenue recycling methods are considered. In addition to the traditional lump-sum transfer of the carbon tax revenue to the households, the study also analyses the impact of rebating the proceeds to the electricity sector while giving more credits to clean electricity production. The simulation results suggest that rebating the carbon proceeds to the producers entails a lower welfare cost in comparison to its transfers to households...|$|R

40|$|A {{topic of}} current {{research}} in {{discussion about the}} Brazilian economy is the exemption from payroll taxes, which aims to stimulate competitiveness of the firms, boosting economic growth.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify fuel substitution potential by estimating potential price induced energy substitution and by considering available technological options. We consider the impacts of CO 2 taxation on reduction of emissions until 2020, assuming CO 2 neutrality of burning fuel wood. We finally address the macroeconomic, environmental and <b>sectoral</b> <b>impacts</b> of enhanced usages of fuel wood for energy. The main assumptions are a 1. 5 times increase of fuel wood useby 2020 and achieving a share of renewables of 29. 83 %. The main outcome for this scenario is that the Austrian economy could benefit from the double dividend of sustained economic growth and fulfilment of EU targets on renewables and CO 2 reduction. The prospects for the energy intensive industries deteriorate - most of them would have to reconsider their technological options and face adverse conditions for their production sites. ...|$|R

However, skeptics fear that waste reduction, appropriate treatment and disposal are not affordable within the current economic circumstances, neither from an economic nor from a social point of view. This paper mainly deals with the first aspect and touches upon the second. It investigates the short-run and long-run <b>sectoral</b> <b>impacts</b> of an environmental tax on hazardous waste in South African mining using an open-economy multisectoral general equilibrium model. The results bear out the expectation that the possibilities for shifting higher production costs are limited in an open economy.
