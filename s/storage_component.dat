2500|$|Snow {{cover is}} an {{extremely}} important <b>storage</b> <b>component</b> in the water balance, especially seasonal snowpacks in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal snowpacks in the Earth’s mountain ranges account for {{the major source of}} the runoff for stream flow and groundwater recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the Colorado River basin originates as snowmelt. Snowmelt runoff from the Earth’s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Further, over 40% of the world’s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique ecosystems needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale feedbacks to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture and runoff to the oceans.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice. In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon ablation of the sea-ice [...]|$|E

40|$|<b>Storage</b> <b>components</b> are a {{major source}} of energy {{dissipation}} in modern superscalar microprocessors. As the instruction windows get larger with each generation of processors, register files and other structures that hold intermediate data become larger and dissipate more power. Therefore it is important {{to find new ways to}} reduce the energy dissipation of data holding components. Many values written to and read from these <b>storage</b> <b>components</b> are known to require fewer bits than is provided by the storage space. Upper order bits of these values are unnecessary and energy savings can be achieved by not writing and reading these bits. Floating value data has different characteristics and offer special energy savings opportunities. In this paper we analyze the bit-level statistics of data values and propose simple modifications to data holding components that save significant energy inside the processors. Our results show that by using simple modifications on the <b>storage</b> <b>components</b> it is possible to achieve 40 % reduction in the integer register file energy dissipation and up to 60 % reduction in the immediate field of the issue queue. We also show that energy dissipation can be reduced by half for some floating point benchmarks by identifying values that indicate a zero operand...|$|R
