2500|$|The {{skyscraper}} {{was originally}} designed for banking and offices. The {{base of the}} tower contained retail and office space along with a large banking hall and its associated facilities. The main floor of the banking hall housed the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's teller counters and tubular steel furniture custom designed for the banking floor. On the mezzanine levels were the bank's offices, a vault and safe deposit boxes. Below the banking hall, {{on the ground and}} basement floors, was [...] of retail space designed {{to be able to be}} altered as needed.

50|$|Much of {{the data}} from the LOFAR {{telescope}} is <b>stored,</b> <b>accessed</b> from and archived on the LOFAR Long-Term Archive, designed by ASTRON and Target. The data will be hosted at the Target data center and several other European centers.|$|R
50|$|The 4000 I/O {{design is}} based around having {{a number of}} Input/Output Processors known as IOPs, each of which {{interfaces}} between the store {{and a set of}} I/O controllers. The IOPs are controlled by the Nucleus function in the CPU, but once an I/O event is triggered, they operate autonomously without interaction with the CPU until the I/O completes. The Normal Interface IOPs can each support up to 255 or 256 simultaneous I/O operations, each on a separate Way. The I/O controllers on each IOP would each occupy one or more Ways, depending on how many simultaneous I/O operations they need to handle. The IOP polices each Way's <b>access</b> to main <b>store,</b> allowing only <b>access</b> to successive memory locations defined for the I/O operation that Way is currently performing. The earlier IOPs performed 8-bit and 16-bit wide <b>store</b> <b>accesses,</b> with a burst mode for doing up to 8 transfers together for higher throughput I/O controllers. The later IOPs added 32-bit wide <b>store</b> <b>accesses.</b>|$|R

50|$|Dense {{instruction}} coding, {{and extensive}} use of the register sets, meant that relatively few <b>store</b> <b>accesses</b> were needed for common scientific codes, such as scalar product and polynomial inner loops. This did much to offset the relatively slow core cycle time, giving the KDF9 {{about a third of}} the speed of its much more famous, but 8 times more expensive and much less commercially successful contemporary, the Manchester/Ferranti Atlas Computer.|$|R
5000|$|Because inbound {{marketing}} is web-based and therefore digital, it can generate {{large amounts of}} data on website visitor activity, prospect profiles, prospect preferences and their [...] "digital footprint". Automation is needed to collect, analyze, correlate, and create actionable insight from this massive amount of data. Automation is also needed to <b>store,</b> <b>access,</b> and share electronically between various stakeholders in the company, including marketing and sales, both at corporate and in the field.|$|E
50|$|CloudMe {{features}} a Cloud storage and sync solution {{that allows the}} users to <b>store,</b> <b>access</b> and share their content, both {{with each other and}} with people outside the service.

5000|$|Most commonly, [...] "shopping while black" [...] {{involves}} {{a black person}} being followed around or closely monitored by a clerk or guard who suspects {{he or she may}} steal, but it can also involve being denied <b>store</b> <b>access,</b> being refused service, use of ethnic slurs, being searched, being asked for extra forms of identification, having purchases limited, being required to have a higher credit limit than other customers, being charged a higher price, or being asked more rigorous questions on applications. [...] It could also mean a request for any item the store actually carries being denied with the store attendant claiming that the item doesn't exist or is not in stock. This can be the result of store policy, or individual employee prejudice. Consumer racial profiling occurs in many retail environments including grocery stores, clothing shops, department stores and office supply shops, and companies accused of consumer racial profiling have included Eddie Bauer, Office Max, Wal-Mart, Sears, Dillard's, Macy's and Home Depot.|$|E
40|$|Given {{declines in}} {{supermarkets}} in Washtenaw County, Michigan (MI), {{we aim to}} characterize the relationship between food <b>store</b> <b>access</b> and fruit and vegetable intake in Ypsilanti, MI. A cross-sectional, convenience sample survey was conducted in March 2011 at the Ypsilanti District Library (n= 83). Self-reported food <b>store</b> <b>access,</b> perceived food environment, and fruit and vegetable intake were assessed. Linear and logistic regressions were performed between <b>store</b> <b>access,</b> fruit and vegetable intake, and meeting dietary recommendations. Perception was evaluated for effect modification. Adjusting for demographics, each food store within one mile of participants’ homes increased odds of meeting recommended intake by 105 % (OR 2. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 02, 4. 10). However, contrary to previous literature, each additional minute to the food store was associated with consumption of 0. 37 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 10, 0. 64) more servings {{of fruits and vegetables}} per day. Perception was not a statistically significant effect modifier, but data suggest differences for those with divergent perceptions. Food environment is associated with fruit and vegetable intake in Ypsilanti, MI. Inconsistent findings suggest that programs should focus on enhancing the food environment within the context of perceptions and preferences...|$|E
