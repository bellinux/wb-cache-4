50|$|Thousands {{of items}} that were {{traditionally}} not computer-related include microprocessors. These include large and <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances,</b> cars (and their accessory equipment units), car keys, tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and electrical circuit breakers, smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from DVD players to phonograph turntables). Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems, to allow optimal control of emissions over widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.|$|E

50|$|With {{turnover}} of <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> high and costs relatively low, many consumers will throw unwanted electric {{goods in the}} normal dustbin, meaning that items of potentially high reuse or recycling value go to landfills. While larger items such as washing machines are usually collected, {{it has been estimated}} that the 160,000 tonnes of EEE in regular waste collections was worth Â£220 million. And 23% of EEE taken to Household Waste Recycling Centres was immediately resaleable - or would be with minor repairs or refurbishment. This indicates a lack of awareness among consumers as to where and how to dispose of EEE, and of the potential value of things that are literally going in the bin.|$|E
5000|$|A {{primary cell}} is a battery that is {{designed}} to be used once and is discarded, and not recharged with electricity and reused like a secondary cell (rechargeable battery). In general, the electrochemical reaction occurring in the cell is not reversible, rendering the cell unrechargeable. As a primary cell is used, chemical reactions in the battery use up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity and is useless. In contrast, in a secondary cell, the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell with a battery charger to recharge it, regenerating the chemical reactants. Primary cells are made in a range of standard sizes to power <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> such as flashlights and portable radios.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{single-phase}} motor is the {{shaded-pole motor}} {{and is used}} in devices requiring low starting torque, such as electric fans, small pumps, or <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> In this motor, small single-turn copper [...] "shading coils" [...] create the moving magnetic field. Part of each pole is encircled by a copper coil or strap; the induced current in the strap opposes the change of flux through the coil. This causes a time lag in the flux passing through the shading coil, so that the maximum field intensity moves higher across the pole face on each cycle. This produces a low level rotating magnetic field which {{is large enough to}} turn both the rotor and its attached load. As the rotor picks up speed the torque builds up to its full level as the principal magnetic field is rotating relative to the rotating rotor.|$|E

40|$|Although principally {{favorable}} from a {{life cycle}} environmental impact perspective, recycling of plastics from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is not uncontested {{because of the potential}} dissipation of hazardous substances into new products. In a study commissioned by the Swiss Foundation for Waste Management (SENS) and the Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organization Technology (SWICO), the types of plastics occurring in WEEE products and their hazardous substance contents were identified through a literature survey. Considering the results of the survey, actual mass flows of the Swiss WEEE recycling systems and rough estimations of the value added of recycled plastics, large and <b>small</b> electrical <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> as well as cooling appliances appear to be the WEEE categories with the highest theoretical recycling potential.

40|$|Waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment {{is a complex}} waste stream and treatment options that work for one waste category or product may not be appropriate for others. A comprehensive case study has been performed for plastic-rich fractions that are treated in German dismantling centres.

40|$|The <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> in {{buildings}} have increased {{rapidly in the}} recent years. However, the surge withstanding capability of these <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> has not been increased. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} install surge protection device (SPD) to prevent serious damage of <b>household</b> electrical <b>appliances</b> caused by the in-rushing surges. In order to avoid the oscillation phenomenon, the effective protection distance of SPDs should be addressed before installing SPDs in the buildings. This paper discussed the influence of a group of common <b>household</b> electrical <b>appliances</b> connected in parallel on the effective protection distance of an SPD to a <b>household</b> <b>appliance.</b> The surges impinging on the <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> connected to a distribution system are analyzed using electromagnetic transient analysis software.

A total of 40. 7 % of this tonnage was made up of large household appliances with cooling appliances and <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> contributing to 15 % and 12. 1 % of this total respectively (Environment Agency, 2012). <b>Small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> (SHA) are items such as kettles and toasters and personal care appliances such as hair dryers. The increasing incorporation of technology into electronic products and their affordability means that they are replaced regularly, especially by people strongly influenced by fashion and advertising. Consequently there are increasing concerns about the sustainability of EEE manufacture, use and disposal both in terms of resource and energy use. It is widely recognised that we need to transition to a so-called âGreen Economyâ in order to deliver sustainable development (Williams and Kemp, 2013). For this to be achieved, the business community and consumers will need to reduce their impacts on the environment by changing what is produced and how it is produced and used. It is therefore essential that young people in developed nations who have been brought up on a diet of cheap international transport, fast food, high-speed communication and resource intensive consumable products, fully grasp the consequences of this transition in terms of adopting different ways of living and working. The same applies to younger generations of the emerging economies who will cast a powerful global influence in terms of future economic development and resource consumption. University students are part of the demographic of young adults who frequently buy electrical and electronic equipment and buy personal care appliances due the perceived importance of image in contemporary society. As they often live in high-density accommodation, student households may also consume more energy than a typical household. The aims of this study were to assess the attitudes and behaviours of young adults (university students) in relation to the use and disposal of <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and to quantify the frequency and period of use. The study employed an online questionnaire of students at the University of Southampton to assess the purchase, ownership, use and disposal of <b>small</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> An additional small-scale energy diary study was employed at 28 student households to assess the energy usage patterns of several household appliances.
