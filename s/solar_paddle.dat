50|$|On 28 August 1996, the {{satellite}} adjusted its attitude to control its orbit. As {{a result of}} this maneuver, the solar panel received sunlight from the rear. This caused the <b>solar</b> <b>paddle</b> mast to expand and the panel blanket to contract, placing tension on a soldered joint on the paddle, which eventually broke.|$|E

ALEXIS is a 113 -kg satellite that carries an ultrasoft x-ray telescope array and a high-speed VHF receiver/digitizer (BLACKBEARD), supported by a miniature spacecraft bus. It was launched by a Pegasus booster on 1993 April 25, but a <b>solar</b> <b>paddle</b> was damaged during powered flight. Initial attempts to contact ALEXIS were unsuccessful. The satellite finally responded in June, and was soon brought under control. Because the magnetometer had failed, the rescue required the development of new attitude control-techniques.

40|$|The Energetic Transient Array (ETA) is {{a concept}} for a {{dedicated}} interplanetary network of about 40 microsatellites ('space buoys') deployed in an about 1 AU radius solar orbit for the observation of cosmic gamma ray bursts (GRBs).

For each of about 100 bursts which would be detectable per year of observation by such a network, high resolution spectra could be obtained through the use of passively-cooled Ge gamma-ray detectors. Stabilization of each microsatellite would be achieved by a novel technique based on the radiation pressure exerted on 'featherable' <b>solar</b> <b>paddles.</b> It should be possible to have a fully functional array of satellites in place {{before the end of the}} decade for a total cost of about $ 20 M, exclusive of launcher fees...|$|R

40|$|The nutational {{stability}} of a dual-spin satellite {{under the influence}} of an applied reaction torque is analyzed. It is assumed that since the <b>solar</b> <b>paddle</b> attachments to the hub of the spacecraft are not rigidly locked, the effect of the solar panels can be replaced by a constant reaction torque acting on the hub of the spacecraft.

40|$|ABSTRACT: ADEOSwas {{launched}} on Dec., 2002. However, after about 10 months operation, {{it has lost}} most of its power due to the <b>solar</b> <b>paddle</b> failure. As a follow on of ADEOSmission, JAXA is now planning GCOM mission which is composed {{of a series of}} satellites. They are now called GCOM-W and GCOM-C satellites. Both satellites are composed of 3 satellites with 5 year lifetime. Hence, 13 years of continuous observation can be assured with 1 year overlaps. The first satellite of GCOM-W, i. e. GCOM-W 1 was {{launched on}} 18. May, 2012, and now is operating in the A-Train orbit. The first one of GCOM-C, i. e. GCOM-C 1 will be launched in fiscal 2016. GCOM-W 1 carries AMSR- 2 (AMSR F/O). AMSR- 2 is very similar to AMSR on ADEOSand AMSR-E on EOS-Aqua with some modifications. GCOM-C 1 will carry SGLI (GLI F/O). The SGLI will be rather different from GLI. The main targets of SGLI are atmospheric aerosols, coastal zone and land. In order to measure aerosols over both ocean and land, it will have an near ultra violet channel, as well as polarization and bi-directional observation capability. For, coastal zone and land observation, the IFOV of SGLI for these targets will be around 250 m. The instrument will be composed of several components. The shorter wavelength region will adopt push broom scanners, while long wavelength region will use a conventional whisk broom scanner. The orbit of GCOM-W 1 is A-train, while the orbit of GCOM-C will be similar to ADEOS. 1...|$|E
50|$|SAS-2 was {{launched}} from the San Marco platform {{off the coast}} of Kenya, Africa, into a nearly equatorial orbit. The orbiting spacecraft was {{in the shape of a}} cylinder approximately 59 cm in diameter and 135 cm in length. Four <b>solar</b> <b>paddles</b> were used to recharge the 6 amp-h nickel-cadmium battery and provide power to the spacecraft and telescope experiment. The spacecraft was spin stabilized, and a magnetically torqued commandable control system was used to point the spin axis of the spacecraft to any position in space within approximately 1 degree. The experiment axis lay along this axis allowing the telescope to look at any selected region of the sky with its plus or minus 30 degree acceptance aperture. The nominal spin rate was 1/12 rpm. Data were taken at 1000 bit/s and could be recorded on an onboard tape recorder and simultaneously transmitted in real time. The recorded data were transmitted once per orbit. This required approximately 5 minutes.|$|R

40|$|IMP 11 was {{launched}} on October 3, 1964 from Cape Kennedy, Florida, by the Delta 26 Launch vehicle. The apogee achieved w a s 51, 600 n. m., which was l e s s {{than one-half of}} the planned altitude. This problem was attributed to the suspected failure of the igniter assembly of the third-stage motor, occurring after about 16 seconds of normal burning. The angle between the spacecraft spin-axis and the ecliptic plane was reduced by the third-stage malfunction, resulting in {{a wider range of}} incident sun-angles during the satellite lifetime. This caused low power output from the <b>solar</b> <b>paddles</b> and over-heating of the silver-cadmium battery. Spacecraft performance was satisfactory until the + 50 "C tempera-ture environment (about two months after launch) caused the failure of the battery. Thereafter, the spacecraft operated only during periods of favorable incident sun-angles. In all, about five months of useful data was recorded. A s of mid- 1965, the spacecraft was operating intermit-tently with essentially no useful data being obtained. There is some possibility that perhaps as much as a month's more data might be'ob-tained in the future. ii r-...|$|R
50|$|The Standard System was {{designed}} to be capable of flights of one month's duration and into lunar orbit. This system was to consist of the minimum system and two additional modules, an Expansion Module (EM) and a Propulsion Module (PM). The EM was envisioned as a living space, used for a long-term space flights, roughly similar in purpose to the Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module (OM). The PM has rocket engine to facilitate orbit changes, and also a <b>solar</b> cell <b>paddle</b> for production of electricity.|$|R
50|$|The {{satellite}} {{was launched}} into a highly elliptical orbit with an initial local time of apogee of 2100 h. The satellite was spin-stabilized at 2.8 rps, with {{the direction of the}} spin axis having a right ascension of 217 degrees and a declination of 23 degrees. Four <b>solar</b> cell <b>paddles</b> mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit. Each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs, digital and analog. A UHF transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the TV signal. Two VHF transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal. The VHF transmitters were operated continuously. The UHF transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day. Only three of the <b>solar</b> cell <b>paddles</b> fully erected, and this occurred during spin up rather than prior to spin up as planned. Consequently, initial operation of the payload power supply was 63% nominal, and this decreased with time. The decreased power caused a lower signal-to-noise ratio affecting most of the data, especially near apogee. One VHF transmitter failed on September 11, 1959, and the last contact with the payload was made on October 6, 1959, at which time the solar cell charging current had fallen below that required to maintain the satellite equipment.|$|R
40|$|A {{data set}} {{containing}} more than 6  years (February 2009 to present) of radiance spectra for carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) observations has been {{acquired by the}} Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT, available at [URL]), nicknamed “Ibuki”, Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS). This paper provides updates {{on the performance of}} the satellite and TANSO-FTS sensor and describes important changes to the data product, which has recently been made available to users. With these changes the typical accuracy of retrieved column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO 2 and CH 4 (X CO 2 and X CH 4, respectively) are 2  ppm or 0. 5  % and 13  ppb or 0. 7  %, respectively. Three major anomalies of the satellite system affecting TANSO-FTS are reported: a failure of one of the two <b>solar</b> <b>paddles</b> in May 2014, a switch to the secondary pointing system in January  2015, and most recently a cryocooler shutdown and restart in August  2015. The Level  1 A (L 1 A) (raw interferogram) and the Level  1 B (L 1 B) (radiance spectra) of version V 201 described here have long-term uniform quality and provide consistent retrieval accuracy even after the satellite system anomalies.

5000|$|In {{common with}} Explorer 6 used the {{earliest}} known digital telemetry system used on spacecraft, codenamed [...] "Telebit"., which was a tenfold (or 10 dB) [...] improvement in channel efficiency on previous generation [...] "Microlock" [...] analog systems in use since Explorer 1 and the biggest single improvement in signal encoding on western spacecraft. The spacecraft received the uplink carrier at 401.8 MHz and converted it to a 378.2 MHz signal using a 16/17 coherent oscillator circuit. The telemetry system phase modulated a 512 Hz subcarrier, which was in turn amplitude modulated at 64, 8, or 1bit/s. The spacecraft was unable to aim its antennas, and so had no high-gain dish antenna common on later spacecraft. Instead, the system could introduce a 150W amplifier into its normally 5W transmitter circuit. It was powered by a battery of 28 F-size NiCd cells recharged by the <b>solar</b> <b>paddles,</b> allowing up to eight minutes of high power communications before risking damage to the batteries. [...] Each hour of 5W communications or five minutes of 150W communications required ten hours of recharging the batteries.

40|$|In {{case of a}} polar {{orbiting}} satellite, insulative surfaces {{located on}} the wake side of <b>solar</b> array <b>paddle</b> can be charged negatively by aurora electrons. We carried out laboratory experiments to evaluate risks of charging and arcing on thermal control film surfaces attached on a <b>solar</b> array <b>paddle</b> backside. We used two test coupons of different design. Both of them used the same materials of flight hardware as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and the Optical Inter-orbit Communications Engineering Test Satellite (OICETS), which are domestic polar orbiting satellites. When the thermal control film surface was insulated and a silver layer was not connected to coupon ground, the film surface was charged to a negative value 1 – 2 kV lower than the electron beam energy. Many primary arcs and flashover were observed {{at the edge of}} silver layer and film surface, respectively. Some areas of silver layer were destroyed by primary arcs. On the other hand, the film with conductive coating connected to a substrate with resistance of 106 – 109 Ω suppressed surface charging and flashover on the film under the electron flux of 1 × 1015 – 1. 4 × 1017 m- 2 s- 1, effectively. We made a new coupon which had three features to give improved performance of arcing and charging mitigation. (1) Connecting the silver layer to the substrate by conductive adhesive to suppress charging and arcing at the edge of silver layer. (2) Film surface coating by conductive material and connected with conductive adhesive to avoid charging. (3) Hiding all the edges of silver layer by conductive adhesive. This coupon suppressed any arcing and charging on the film surface up to 20 keV electron beam irradiation...|$|R
