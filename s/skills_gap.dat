However, little is known {{with regard to the}} key factors determining the accurate transmission of worker training requirements. Using one of the few linked employer-employee surveys in the world, the 2006 Irish National Employment Survey, this paper identifies the key factors determining the correct identification of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> within firms. The impact of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> on average training expenditures and labour costs is also measured. The research finds that both HRM and collective bargaining arrangements are important factors in facilitating the accurate identification of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> within firms. The analysis confirms that <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> are a key determinant of training expenditures and tend to raise average labour costs. Finally, the evidence suggests that employee perceptions of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> may be prone to higher levels of subjective bias relative to those based on the employers' views...|$|R

In this paper, we investigate the certificate-competence relationship, operationalized as <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> by level of educational attainment.

Higher levels of vertical stratification, by contrast, result in larger low-intermediate <b>skills</b> <b>gaps.</b> None of the two stratification aspects can however explain variations in the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> between intermediate and high educated adults.

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MBAThe software industry {{is one of the}} fastest evolving industries. The change is so rapid that all the stakeholders, who interact with the software industry, need to be ready for any change taking place, in order to survive in the global market. Since the software industry is knowledge driven, employees are the driving force of its success. As a result organizations need to make sure their employees are capable of handling or facing any challenge within the industry. Today, most of the industries have experienced <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> or <b>skill</b> shortage issues, worldwide and are trying to find solutions to mitigate it. It has become a predominant problem to the software industry. The {{purpose of this study is}} to conduct an analysis of the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> existing in the Sri Lankan software industry, to the benefit of all the stakeholders. It is focused on identifying factors that cause the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> their significance and skill deficiencies exist among employees, for programming & software engineering, testing & quality assurance and technical support job categories. Technology change, working experience and acquired training level were identified as the major factors to carry out a significant study of them, with respect to the existing <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> among employees in the industry. <b>Skills</b> <b>gaps</b> were identified in terms of soft skills, technical skills and core skills, according to each job category. Two questionnaires were used to collect data from non-managerial and managerial employees. The sample is then examined to get the results. The results of this study indicated that technology change has the most significant influence on the existence of the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> among the three factors. Also it proved that the lack of working experience and the lack of training level have impacted on the existence of the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> among employees, in the Sri Lankan software industry. In addition to that the study revealed a set of skills (soft, technical, core) lacking among employees, for each job category. Finally the study concludes with a list of recommendations that organizations, individuals and the government can adopt, in order to mitigate the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> in the Sri Lankan software industry...|$|R

40|$|Fit {{between an}} organization’s brand and its employees, {{sometimes}} referred to as employee brand identification, has been highlighted as an important element of delivering service quality. This paper examines the people management practices directed both at potential and current employees which enhance this ‘person-brand fit’ and proposes that effective management of this can help reduce the persistent problem of social <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> in service organizations. A study of managers and customer-facing employees in two hotel case studies – one reporting significant social <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> and the other reporting few gaps – showed that the hotel reporting fewer gaps had achieved greater employee identification with the brand. This hotel conducted recruitment and selection around person-brand fit, whilst the other hotel did not. The hotel reporting fewer social <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> also allowed greater employee agency in brand socialization, training and in the enactment of the brand on the job. The paper discusses the relevance of these findings for theory on how human resource management (HRM) practices may be linked to service brands in order to reduce social <b>skills</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{considers}} {{the nature and}} extent of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> in Papua New Guinea’s construction industry. It examines how <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> affect broader labor market efficiency and advances recommendations on how publicly funded infrastructure projects can be leveraged to narrow the <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> and make economic development more inclusive. The challenges of underperforming labor markets, persistent skill shortages, and lack of formal employment opportunities exist in a number of the Pacific island countries. These challenges affect a wide range of stakeholders, including domestic populations, development organizations, and the private sector. Addressing <b>skill</b> <b>gaps,</b> particularly in the construction industry, stands to generate considerable value for each of these groups, at minimal costs, and over a relatively short period of time. Regional cooperation in implementing these recommendations would strengthen and extend the scope of their outcomes, ultimately leading to more inclusive economic growth across the Pacific. Although the conclusions of this study are drawn from country-specific data, and case studies are based on projects financed by the Asian Development Bank, the study’s recommendations have broad potential applicability to other Pacific island countries and development partners...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and persistence}} of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> {{is becoming a}} concerning problem in most EU countries. Even if both economists and policy makers agree on {{the economic and social}} relevance of this problem, a comprehensive analytical (and policy) framework to deal with this issue is still lacking. Aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a simple method to get comparable estimates of the economic cost of the <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> across EU countries. Using a general equilibrium model perspective and the main results from previous empirical research, we first classify and discuss all the type of costs caused by the presence of <b>skill</b> <b>gap.</b> On the basis of this classification, we then propose and estimate a very simple model based on the Beveridge curve framework (the V-U diagram). The basic idea is that the total cost of the <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> can be divided into the cost of vacancies and the cost of unemployment. The cost of vacancies can be proxied by the loss of production due to having unfilled jobs for a certain period of time. The cost of unemployment can be further divided into: the net loss of earnings during the unemployment spell; the cost of unemployment benefits paid by the government; other indirect costs aimed at reducing unemployment duration. According to our preliminary estimates, the costs generated by <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> are quite remarkable, ranging on average from 6, 9 % to 7, 7 % of GDP in 1999. Our analysis clearly points out that the lack of comparable data at the EU level makes it quite difficult to estimate the cost of the <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> in most of the EU countries without collecting information from a number of different statistical sources and without making further assumptions. Information is particularly poor on vacancies and, also for this reason, it is likely that the actual cost of vacancies is underestimated in our model...|$|R
40|$|At {{any point}} in time, <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> mismatches, and {{shortages}} arise because of an imperfect correspondence between the singular sets of skills required by different open vacancies and the unique combinations of capabilities embodied in every job seeker - skills diversity in unity. This paper first constructs an abstract framework for defining and thinking about these phenomena in a unified, formal and objective way. The main building block is a discrete skills space in which the locations of vacancies and workers {{are determined by the}} vectors of skills characterizing them. We define <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> and mismatches as two different distance measures between them, and derive a condition for each vacancy that determines whether or not it experiences a skills shortage. We then develop a job matching model with imperfect information, in which skills mismatches influence the job application decisions of the workers, while <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> and shortages shape the competition for workers on the resulting bipartite job applications network. The tools proposed in this paper could in future work be employed as the main ingredients of an agent-based model used to investigate how <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> mismatches and shortages affect equilibrium outcomes in the context of skills diversity in unity and imperfect informatio...|$|R
