5|$|Thomas Bonham {{had been}} {{admitted}} to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning {{for it to be}} allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some <b>say</b> <b>at</b> Fleet Prison, and some <b>say</b> <b>at</b> Newgate Prison) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of habeas corpus, issued by the Court of Common Pleas, which freed him on 13 November.|$|E

In addition, one can easily check that the integrand is strictly positive for at least one point in the range of integration, <b>say</b> <b>at</b> 1/2. Since the integrand is continuous at that point and non-negative elsewhere, {{the integral}} from 0 to 1 must be strictly positive.|$|E

The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne {{experienced}} tremors {{for some}} years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May 2005, he {{found out it was}} actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne will have to take daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they <b>say.</b> <b>At</b> the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E

25|$|I want to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E
25|$|Akhtar's {{career has}} been plagued with injuries, controversies and accusations of poor attitude. After rising into {{international}} stardom {{at a young age}} due to his speed, due to his interesting personality and charisma glamour seemed to follow him, some <b>say</b> <b>at</b> the detriment of his sporting focus. Although he eventually crossed the 100mph barrier, his attitude took its toll on his reputation as well as his fitness. After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler Waqar Younis. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught ball tampering making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler Paul Adams, during a match against South Africa.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, 2010 in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Papp {{appeared}} before the Hon. Gary L. Lancaster, Chief U.S. District Judge, and pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs, specifically HGH and Erythropoietin (EPO). According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton, the retail value of the transactions brokered by Papp between Shandong Kexing Bioproducts Corp. and over 180 international clients approached $80,000USD from September 2006 to September 2007 None of the 187 customers, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, triathletes, mixed-martial artists and rowers, were identified in court. Houghton, Papp, and his attorney, William Ward, {{declined to comment on}} terms of the plea agreement, which had been sealed by the court – a measure often taken if a defendant is cooperating with the government in ongoing investigations, but neither Ward nor Houghton would <b>say</b> <b>at</b> the time if that was the case. In October 2011, Papp was finally sentenced to serve a six-month period of house arrest, followed by two and half years probation.|$|E

25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not enough for you {{to figure out what the}} hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E

500|$|In late 1269, {{after several}} months of {{deadlock}} during which the cardinals had met only intermittently, Ranieri Gatti, the Prefect of Viterbo, and Albertus de Montebono, the Podesta, ordered (some sources <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> the urging of Saint Bonaventure) the cardinals sequestered in the Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo until a new pope was elected. On June 8, 1270, the cardinals addressed a Diploma to the two magistrates asking that Henry of Segusio, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, be dismissed from the [...] "Palatio discooperto" [...] ("the uncovered Palace") owing to his ill health and his having already renounced his right to vote. Some sources say that a makeshift roof was reassembled after the cardinals threatened to put the entire city of Viterbo under interdict.|$|E
500|$|I am {{ashamed to}} relate what Gallienus used often to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid {{the ills of}} mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, {{he is said to}} have exclaimed [...] "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" [...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E
500|$|Critics also derided Benchley's writing.

[...] Writing for The Village Voice, Donald Newlove declared that [...] "Jaws has rubber teeth for a plot. It's boring, pointless, listless; if there's a trite turn to make, Jaws will make that turn." [...] An article in The Listener criticized the plot, stating the [...] "novel only has bite, so to <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> feed time," [...] and these scenes are [...] "naïve attempts at whipping along a flagging story-line." [...] Andrew Bergman of The New York Times Book Review felt that despite the book serving as [...] "fluid entertainment", [...] "passages of hollow portentousness creep in" [...] while poor scene [...] "connections [...] stark manipulations impair the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet geaster {{alludes to}} members of genus Geastrum, which also open to form star-shaped fruit bodies commonly called 'earthstars'. In the United States, Chorioactis geaster {{is commonly known as}} the Texas star, or the devil's cigar. Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented: [...] "Whether the name Devil's Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble a bloated cigar in form, as well as in color, or {{to the fact that the}} fungus appears to 'smoke' at maturity, we cannot <b>say...</b> <b>At</b> any rate, the name is very appropriate." [...] In 1997, Texan state Senator Chris Harris filed a bill to make C.geaster the official state fungus of Texas. The bill passed the Senate but did not succeed in the House. In Japan the mushroom is called kirinomitake (キリノミタケ), because the immature, unopened fruit body bears a superficial resemblance to the seed pods of kiri, the empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa).|$|E
500|$|A {{rough cut}} of the premiere was leaked onto the {{internet}} {{three weeks before the}} scheduled series premiere. This attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans, and caused interest in the show to skyrocket.

That's all I can <b>say</b> <b>at</b> this point because we don't know exactly what happened. It certainly wasn't done intentionally." [...] Asa Bailey, founder of the Viral Advertising Association, said that the BBC hired them for viral marketing strategies, and that he told them [...] "they should release things before their time", to create a [...] "cool factor". Both the BBC and CBC denied any involvement, but Bailey believes that to be disingenuous, saying that it is [...] "the best viral advert they could have done". The leak was ultimately traced to a third party company in Canada which had a legitimate preview copy. The employee responsible was fired by the company.|$|E

She found playing twelve characters equivalent to performing in twelve different films. She had to have a different look for each of them but had very little time to prepare and establish each character on screen, since each character had [...] "one song and about two scenes". Since all the characters except one were between ages eighteen and twenty-four, Chopra found it difficult to make every character look distinct. She said that there were not many options other than changing her hair and the characters' outfits to portray them. As a result, she chose to work on her body language and experimented with her voice and accent to make the characters distinct from one another, describing it as [...] "a real test".|$|E
