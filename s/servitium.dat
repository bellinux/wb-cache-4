But men must learn somewhere; and the new teachers mean no more than what they effect, {{as far as they}} succeed,--that is, to deprive men of the benefit of the collected wisdom of mankind, and to make them blind disciples of their own particular presumption. Talk to these deluded creatures (all the disciples and most of the masters) who are taught to think themselves so newly fitted up and furnished, and you will find nothing in their houses but the refuse of Knaves' Acre,--nothing but the rotten stuff, worn out in the service of delusion and sedition in all ages, and which, being newly furbished up, patched, and varnished, serves well enough for those who, being unacquainted with the conflict which has always been maintained between the sense and the nonsense of mankind, know nothing of the former existence and the ancient refutation of the same follies. It is near two thousand years since it has been observed that these devices of ambition, avarice, and turbulence were antiquated. They are, indeed, the most ancient of all commonplaces: commonplaces sometimes of good and necessary causes; more frequently of the worst, but which decide upon neither. Eadem semper causa, libido et avaritia, et mutandarum rerum amor.

5000|$|Conversely, a barony was [...] "over-enfeoffed" [...] {{where more}} knights had been enfeoffed than was {{required}} by the <b>servitium</b> debitum, and this indicated that the barony had been obtained on overly-favourable terms.|$|E

5000|$|On 2 June {{the same}} year, Grand was {{invested}} with the pallium in Avignon. Three weeks later Grand got the invoice, the papal treasurer demanded {{to pay the}} servitia minuta and the so-called <b>servitium</b> commune, the latter making up {{a third of the}} annual revenues of the See. Grand paid a <b>servitium</b> commune of 600 Guilders (Florins), thus Bremen's annual revenues only amounted to a 1,800 Guilders, while Lund yielded its archbishop 12,000 Guilders, and Riga, which he had doomed too poor, still brought 2,400 Guilders p.a. Maybe Grand accepted the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, because by his sister Ingefred Torbe(r)nsdatter (marr. with [...] ) he was related to the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein, whose county belonged to the diocesan territory of Bremen.|$|E
50|$|The {{privilege}} which {{balanced the}} burden of the <b>servitium</b> debitum was the baron's right to attend the king's council. Originally all barons who held per baroniam received individual writs of summons to attend parliament. This was a practical measure because the early kings almost continually travelled around the kingdom, taking their court (i.e. administration) with them.|$|E
5000|$|The feudal {{obligation}} {{imposed by}} the grant of a barony was termed in Latin the <b>servitium</b> debitum or [...] "service owed" [...] and was set as a quota of knights {{to be provided for}} the king's service. It bore no constant relation to the amount of land comprised by the barony, but was fixed by a bargain between the king and the baron.|$|E
5000|$|Where a baron had sub-enfeoffed fewer knights than {{required}} by the <b>servitium</b> debitum, the barony {{was said to be}} [...] "under-enfeoffed", and the balance of knights owing had to be produced super dominium, that is [...] "on the demesne". This does not mean they were resident within the baron's demesne, but that they had to be hired with the revenue arising from it.|$|E

50|$|After the Roman {{conquest of}} the area, {{it was part of}} the {{province}} of Dalmatia. During the twenties of the first century AD, Roman government built a road connecting Salona, a city on the coast with <b>Servitium,</b> a city at the peripanonic lowlands. Its route passed through the Livno Field where two road stations have been established. The station of Pelva was located at the area of village Lištani and in the area of Livno station Bariduo was based.|$|E
50|$|Area of the Šujica Valley was {{inhabited}} {{at least}} since the time of the Illyrians. Among the few remains of the Illyrian tribe Delmatae there are several tombs. More archaeological remains date from the time of Roman rule in this area.

50|$|Some {{time between}} the years 102 and 107, {{between the first and}} second Dacian wars, Trajan divided the {{province}} into Pannonia Superior (western part with the capital Carnuntum), and Pannonia Inferior (eastern part with the capitals in Aquincum and Sirmium). According to Ptolemy, these divisions were separated by a line drawn from Arrabona in the north to <b>Servitium</b> in the south; later, the boundary was placed further east. The whole country was sometimes called the Pannonias (Pannoniae).|$|E
5000|$|Conrad {{continued}} the Ottonian dynasty's policy {{of using the}} German Church {{as a vehicle for}} imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming [...] "divine right" [...] to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as protectors of the Church and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials. In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles. As such, the Church officials reported exclusively to the Emperor, acting as his personal vassals. As the Emperor's vassals, the Church officials were subject to providing two services to him: the <b>servitium</b> regis (royal service) and <b>servitium</b> militum (military service). Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.|$|E
50|$|In 1017, he won {{a dispute}} with the Ekkehardinger over the rights to Helmarshausen Abbey. A {{gathering}} of nobles under the king declared in his favour, though the sources give differing reasons for this. The most likely explanation appears be that because Helmarshausen was too poor to provide the proper <b>servitium</b> regis to the king and because it lay within the diocese of Paderborn, which meant the bishop already had episcopal responsibility for it, {{it made sense to}} make a formal grant of it to the bishopric so that the bishop could more effectively protect it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three basic}} {{services}} monasteries could owe to the sovereign in the Frankish realms were military service, an annual donation {{of money or}} work, and prayers for the royal family and the kingdom. Collectively, these were known by the technical term <b>servitium</b> regis ("king's service"). According to {{the evidence of the}} Notitia de servitio monasteriorum, list of monasteries and the services they owed drawn up around 817, the burden of military and monetary service was more severe in west Francia than in east Francia. Only four monasteries listed as [...] "beyond the Rhine" [...] (ultra Rhenum) owed these services: Lorsch, Schuttern, Mondsee and Tegernsee.|$|E
50|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1496 the enfranchised capitulars wanted a {{successor}} rich and thus independent enough and void of any princely aspirations. The {{majority of the}} canons of the cathedral chapters of Bremen and Hamburg (with only three votes) elected Rode archbishop on 30 January 1497, beating his election rivals John of Saxe-Lauenburg, brother of Magnus, and Otto of Oldenburg (a canon in Bremen and son of Gerhard VI). Family and friends among the capitulars helped Rode to gain the majority. On 28 April Pope Alexander VI confirmed Rode. This was accompanied by the papal invoice, the so-called servitia minuta and <b>servitium</b> commune, the latter making up {{a third of the}} annual revenues of a see.|$|E
50|$|Roman {{basilica}} {{have been}} found in Imljani and Javorani, and remains of the Roman road from <b>Servitium</b> (Banja Luka) to Levsaba (Travnik) were also found in the vicinity. Tombstones of the Stećak type date back to the 14th and 15th centuries, when the area was part of the Kingdom of Bosnia. In 1463 the town became part of the Ottoman Empire and Islam was to become the dominant religion of the region. The charitable endowment (vakuf) that is reflected in the town's traditional name Skender Vakuf (after Ali-dedo Skender) contributed to urbanization. The Old Mosque was significant {{and one of the first}} in the region. It was destroyed, along with the New Mosque, in 1992 during the Bosnian War.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} Republic {{penalties}} for sexuality were barely enforced if at all, {{and a new}} erotic ideal of romantic relationship emerges. Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and Augustan era declared their eagerness to submit to [...] "love slavery" [...] (<b>servitium</b> amoris). Catullus addresses a number of poems to [...] "Lesbia," [...] a married woman {{with whom he has}} an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized Clodia, sister of the prominent popularist politician Clodius Pulcher. The affair ends badly, and Catullus's declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites — rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia's behavior, Cicero's Pro Caelio.|$|E
5000|$|Having gotten counsel the [...] "most {{poisonous}} serpent" [...] {{prepared the}} banquet, where Eusebius became intoxicated {{and fell into}} a deep sleep. Straightway [...] "a raging mob of gentiles" [...] boarded the ship and placed Julia on the shore. Felix said: [...] "Sacrifice to the gods, girl. I will give your master as much as he likes and dissolve the bond of your state." [...] The tribunician power included manumission. However, Julia replied:"Libertas mea Christi <b>servitium</b> est, cui ego quotidie pura mente deservio. Ceterum istum vestrum errorem non solum non veneror, verum etiam detestor.""My liberty is the service of Christ, whom I serve every day with a pure mind. As for that error of yours, I not only do not venerate it, I detest it." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{three basic}} {{services}} monasteries could owe to the sovereign. Militia was military service. Dona was an annual gift, tax or service [...] "donated" [...] to the king. Orationes was {{the obligation to}} pray for the royal family {{and the state of}} the realm. Collectively, these were known by the technical term <b>servitium</b> regis ("king's service"), hence the servitio of the Notitias title. The service of prayer, although specified in the Notitia, appears to have been considered a general obligation of all ecclesiastical institutions in the empire. The burden of these services seem to have been more severe in west Francia than in east Francia. Only four monasteries east of the Rhine owed all three services: Lorsch, Schuttern, Mondsee and Tegernsee.|$|E
5000|$|The curie (singular curia) of the {{register}} were royal farmlands associated with manors, castles or towns. There were 20 recorded in Saxony, 21 in [...] "Franconia along the Rhine" [...] (Francia circa Rhenum, including Lotharingia), 12 in Bavaria and 28 in Lombardy. The register is divided between these four regions, but while its {{information on the}} German regions is detailed and consistent, that for Lombardy is uneven. It is not {{a complete list of}} lands owned by the crown, much of which was enfeoffed, nor even a complete list of crown lands that were directly exploited by the monarchs. No lands in Swabia or Alsace are included, possibly because these had been informally attached as an appanage to the Duchy of Swabia. This would place the date of composition of the Tafelgüterverzeichnis after the election of Conrad III of the Swabian House of Hohenstaufen in 1138. On the other hand, the total number of services (servitia) owed by the Saxon estates is greater than that owed by all the other estates combined. This is best explained by dating {{the register}} to the reign of Lothair III (1125-37), who was a Saxon and whose court was dominated by Saxons. A Saxon <b>servitium</b> consisted of [...] "thirty large pigs, three cows, five suckling pigs, fifty hens, fifty eggs, ninety cheeses, ten geese, five barrels of beer, five pounds of pepper, ten pounds of wax, wine from cellars all over Saxony." [...] The servitia in the other German regions consisted of the same products in different proportions, with the Bavarian and Franconian servitia being the same. The high burden of the servitia suggests they were for the support of an army or of the royal palace year-round, but there is no indication of the period of time which a <b>servitium</b> was supposed to cover.|$|E
5000|$|The {{action was}} {{originally}} paired in a Latin expression: [...] "per quod <b>servitium</b> et consortium amisit," [...] translated as [...] "in consequence {{of which he}} lost her society and services." [...] The relationship {{between husband and wife}} has, historically, been considered worthy of legal protection. The interest being protected under consortium, is that which the head of the household (father or husband) had in the physical integrity of his wife, children, or servants. The undertone of this action is that the husband had an unreciprocated proprietary interest in his wife. The deprivations identified include the economic contributions of the injured spouse to the household, care and affection, and sex. The action originated in the 18th century and was once available to a father against a man who was courting his daughter outside of marriage, {{on the grounds that the}} father had lost the consortium of his daughter's household services because she was spending time with her beau.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was at the}} {{discretion}} of the baron as to how these knights were found. The commonest method was for him to split his barony into several fiefs of between a few hundred acres possibly up to a thousand acres each, into each of which he would sub-enfeoff one knight, by the tenure of knight-service. This tenure gave the knight use of the fief and all its revenues, on condition that he should provide to the baron, now his overlord, 40 days of military service, complete with retinue of esquires, horses and armour. The fief so allotted is known as a knight's fee. Alternatively the baron could keep the entire barony, or a part of it, in demesne, that is to say [...] "in-hand" [...] or under his own management, using the revenues it produced to buy the services of mercenary knights known as [...] "stipendiary knights". A barony which could support more than the number of knights required by the <b>servitium</b> debitum had clearly been obtained from the king on favourable terms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{marriage}} to Mencía {{was either a}} late marriage for Fortún or a second one. It has been speculated {{that he had been}} married to a relative of García Ramírez of Viguera, and that it was in right of her that he succeeded to the territories formerly ruled by García Ramírez. The late {{marriage to}} Mencía may have been arranged by the king. In 1049 García Sánchez III conceded to Fortún certain heritable properties, some [...] "already in your power" [...] (hodie sunt in tua potestate), in Nalda, Leza, and Jubera, [...] "because of your good service which you have given me" [...] (propter tuum bonum <b>servitium</b> quod michi fecisti). At this time Fortún and Mencía were already married. Their marriage, perhaps in 1044, may have been responsible for Fortún's return to court that year, which in its turn may have facilitated preparations for the reconquest of Calahorra the next year (1045), by a joint Christian army under García. García's reference to good service is probably a reference to military service, most likely in the Calahorra campaign.|$|E
50|$|The Cartae Baronum ("Charters of the Barons") was {{a survey}} {{commissioned}} by the Treasury in 1166. It required each baron to declare how many knights he had enfeoffed and how many were super dominium, {{with the names of}} all. It appears that the survey was designed to identify baronies from which a greater <b>servitium</b> debitum could in future be obtained by the king. An example is given from the return of Lambert of Etocquigny:To his reverend lord, Henry, king of the English, Lambert of Etocquigny, greeting. Know that I hold from you by your favour 16 carucates of land and 2 bovates by the service of 10 knights. In these 10 carucates of land I have 5 knights enfeoffed by the old enfeoffment:*Richard de Haia holds 1 knight's fee; and he withheld the service which he owes to you and to me from the day of your coronation up to now, except that he paid me 2 marks.*Odo de Cranesbi holds 1 knight's fee.*Thomas, son of William, holds 1 knight's fee.*Roger de Millers holds 2 knight's fees.And from my demesne I provide the balance of the service I owe you, to wit, that of 5 knights. And from that demesne I have given Robert de Portemort 3/4 of 1 knight's fee. Therefore I pray you that you will send me your judgement concerning Richard de Haia who holds back the service of his fee, because I cannot obtain that service except by your order. This is the total service in the aforesaid 16 carucates of land. Farewell.|$|E
