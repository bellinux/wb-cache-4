40|$|WO 2007025519 A 2 UPAB: 20070504 NOVELTY - Producing an {{embossed}} {{structure on}} a substrate comprises positioning the substrate (7) {{on a plate}} (4) on a support (1) having suction channels (5), pressing an embossing tool (3) into {{the surface of the}} substrate by means of a <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> (2), moving the support and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> apart to separate the substrate from the plate, removing the plate, moving the support and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> together again, holding the substrate on the support by suction, and moving the support and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> apart again to separate the substrate from the tool. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for apparatus for producing an embossed structure on a substrate, comprising a support with integrated suction channels, a <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> for an embossing tool, a drive mechanism for pressing the tool into the surface of a substrate, and a control unit that controls the drive mechanism so that, after embossing the substrate, either the support and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> can be moved apart to remove an intermediate plate and then moved together again to hold the substrate on the support by suction and then moved apart again to separate to substrate from the tool, or the support and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> can be moved apart while the intermediate plate is held on the support by suction. USE - Producing an embossed structure on a substrate, especially for producing microfluidic, optical or mechanical polymer components, e. g. optical waveguides or gratings. ADVANTAGE - The plate prevents the support's suction channel pattern from being embossed onto the bottom of the substrate (compare EP 1068945) ...|$|R

Then, the 3 -D model is input into ANSYS, simulating the stress map and the nephogram of displacement deformation of the lathe tool fixture and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier,</b> which plays a important role in designing the lathe tool fixture and <b>tool</b> <b>carrier.</b> Intorduction The CNC Machine Tool for guide disc, which is mainly used in the guide disc producing in the product line of the hot rolling seamless steel tube, {{is a sort of}} special-purpose machine tool for metal cutting. Meanwhile, working face accuracy of the guide disc has a direct effect on the surface quality of seamless steel tube. Thereintoï¼Œlathe tool fixture is designed to fix the lathe tool, lengthen the arbor and enhance the strength of the arbor as well. It is fixed tightly in the <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> because of which the vibration caused by cutting can be lowered or absorbed in some case.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a system for accurately measuring in real-time, collecting and processing a high amount of geo-referenced data of soil physical-mechanical parameters, e. g. cone penetrometer resistance, index of soil compaction, and draft force. The system for measuring the soil cone penetrometer resistance is comprised of a load cell, connected to a rod, ending with a cone, and is mounted on a frame, fixed to the front part of a tractor. The system for measuring the draft force required to till the soil is comprised of a load cell, mounted on the hitch hook of a <b>tool</b> <b>carrier,</b> towed by the tractor. Moreover, in order to test the usefulness of the system with different types of linkage tractor-implement, two other load cells were mounted, respectively, on the top link and the right point of the three-point hitch of the <b>tool</b> <b>carrier.</b> A portable computer, by means of a Virtual Instrument, developed in LabVIEW environment, acquires the signals of the load cells and of a DGPS mobile receiver.
