5|$|The 2006 Riga <b>summit</b> or the 19th NATO <b>Summit</b> was a NATO <b>summit</b> {{held in the}} Olympic Sports Centre, Riga, Latvia from 28 to 29 November 2006. The most {{important}} topics discussed were the War in Afghanistan and the future role and borders of the alliance. Further, the <b>summit</b> focused on the alliance's continued transformation, taking stock {{of what has been}} accomplished since the 2002 Prague <b>Summit.</b> NATO also committed itself to extend further membership invitations in the upcoming 2008 Bucharest <b>Summit.</b> This <b>summit</b> was the first NATO <b>summit</b> held on territory of a former USSR republic.|$|E
5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, security measures during the <b>summit</b> were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the world}} gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W. Bush Administration, while the <b>summit</b> itself was blown off the front pages of the world press by the unexpected transfer of Iraqi sovereignty, coinciding with {{the first day of the}} NATO <b>summit</b> on June 28.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its <b>summit.</b> The eruptions originated about 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, when the <b>summit</b> of Mauna Kea was covered in ice.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible <b>summit</b> caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its <b>summit.</b> A former <b>summit</b> caldera may have been filled and buried by later <b>summit</b> eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's <b>summit</b> {{is one of}} {{the best}} sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The <b>summit</b> is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the <b>summit</b> and ensuring the air on the <b>summit</b> is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The <b>summit</b> atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

50|$|The Y8 and Y20 <b>Summits</b> - {{formerly}} G8 and G20 Youth <b>Summits</b> - are international youth conferences gathering young leaders. These <b>Summits</b> are {{the official}} youth counterpart to the Group of Eight (G8) and the Group of Twenty (20). The goal of these <b>summits</b> {{is to allow}} the young generation to speak up. Young adults are able to provide solutions to the global agenda, promote cross-cultural understanding and build global friendships. The conclusions of the <b>Summits</b> are then passed on to international policy-makers to make the young people heard. This is why the Youth <b>Summits</b> are always scheduled in parallel to the G8 and G20.|$|R

5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from the <b>summit.</b> It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to the <b>summit,</b> with the advantage that the <b>summit</b> is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the <b>summit,</b> from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the <b>summit.</b> An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} the <b>summit</b> leads {{through one of the}} ramps to the saddle between the main <b>summit</b> and its western trabant. The passage on the top cone is secured by ropes for {{unprepared}} tourists. One of the variants of the Polar Route follows the coast of Amerloq Fjord {{at the base of the}} southern wall of Nasaasaaq. The main <b>summit</b> is visited for its long-range view of the coast, although more limited to the north than that of Palasip Qaqqaa to the north of the town airport. An alternative {{route to the}} top of interest to mountaineers leads through the hard to find low pass to the east of the main <b>summit,</b> and from there directly on the <b>summit</b> cone ridge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>summit</b> area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual top is toward the northern corner and set back a little from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on the <b>summit</b> although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view from the <b>summit</b> of High Crag.|$|E

5|$|The <b>summit</b> {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the <b>summit</b> in an operation called Operation Peaceful <b>Summit.</b> This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{or not the}} <b>summit</b> is {{considered}} important for its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO <b>summit</b> between the leaders of the North-American and Western European states, and Eastern European states, states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the <b>summit,</b> opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became clear {{in the run-up to the}} 2006 Riga <b>Summit.</b> Secondly, the holding of the <b>summit</b> in Istanbul made it the most eastern <b>summit</b> in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the <b>summit</b> made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E
