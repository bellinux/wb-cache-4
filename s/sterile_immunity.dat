This approach {{has led to}} a number of efficient bacterial and viral vaccines, but it has yet to do so for parasitic pathogens. For malaria, a disease of global importance due to infection by Plasmodium protozoa, immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites uniquely leads to long lasting <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> against infection. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), {{an important component of the}} sporozoite's surface, remains the leading candidate antigen for vaccines targeting the parasite's pre-erythrocytic stages. Difficulties in developing CSP-based vaccines that reproduce the levels of protection afforded by radiation-attenuated sporozoites have led us to question the role of CSP in the acquisition of <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity.</b> We have used a parasite transgenic for the CSP because it allowed us to test whether a major immunodominant Plasmodium antigen is indeed needed for the induction of sterile protective immunity against infection. METHODOLOGY/MAIN FINDINGS: We employed a P. berghei parasite line that expresses a heterologous CSP from P. falciparum in order to assess the role of the CSP in the protection conferred by vaccination with radiation-attenuated P. berghei parasites. Our data demonstrated that <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> could be obtained despite the absence of immune responses specific to the CSP expressed by the parasite used for challenge. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that other pre-erythrocytic parasite antigens, possibly hitherto uncharacterised, can be targeted to induce <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> against malaria. From a broader perspective, our results raise the question as to whether immunodominant parasite antigens should be the favoured targets for vaccine development...|$|E

Here we evaluated the potential of a RVFV- 4 s variant lacking the NSs gene (4 s-ΔNSs) to induce protective immunity in sheep. Groups of seven lambs were either mock-vaccinated or vaccinated with 10 (5) or 10 (6) tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) of 4 s-ΔNSs via the intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) route.

In rodent models, CD 8 + T cells have been implicated as the principal effector cells, and IFN-gamma as a critical effector molecule.

DNA priming was required for protection, as 18 additional subjects immunized with Ad alone (AdCA) did not develop sterile protection. We sought to identify correlates of protection, recognizing that DNA-priming may induce different responses than AdCA alone. Among protected volunteers, two and three had higher ELISpot and CD 8 + T cell IFN-γ responses to CSP and AMA 1, respectively, than non-protected volunteers. Unexpectedly, non-protected volunteers in the AdCA trial showed ELISpot and CD 8 + T cell IFN-γ responses to AMA 1 equal to or higher than the protected volunteers. T cell functionality assessed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL- 2 likewise did not distinguish protected from non-protected volunteers across both trials.

Prolidase was required for IFNAR 1 maturation and accumulation, activation of IFNβ-stimulated gene induction, and IFN-I-dependent viral control.

However, there is currently no algorithm that can effectively identify the targets of protective T cell or antibody responses from genomic data. Furthermore, the identification of antigens that will stimulate the most effective immunity against the target pathogen is problematic, particularly if the genome is large. Malaria is an attractive model for the development and validation of approaches to translate genomic information to vaccine development because of the critical need for effective anti-malarial interventions and because the Plasmodium parasite is a complex multistage pathogen targeted by multiple immune responses. <b>Sterile</b> protective <b>immunity</b> can be achieved by immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites, and anti-disease immunity can be induced in residents in malaria-endemic areas.

Thus, there have been major efforts to develop malaria vaccines.

The complex life cycle of the Plasmodium spp. parasites and the extensive variability among strains of the same Plasmodium species dictate, however, that an effective malaria vaccine will probably need to induce protective antibodies as well as effector CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes specific for variants of multiple antigens expressed at different stages of the life cycle.

To advance malaria vaccine development, we have fabricated protein microarrays representing 23 % of the entire P. falciparum proteome and have probed these arrays with plasma from subjects with sterile protection or no protection after experimental immunization with radiation attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites. A panel of 19 pre-erythrocytic stage antigens was identified as strongly associated with sporozoite-induced protective immunity; 16 of these antigens were novel and 85 % have been independently identified in sporozoite and/or liver stage proteomic or transcriptomic data sets.

Protection is mediated by sporozoite/liver-stage immunity. In this study, the capacity of CPS-induced antibodies to interfere with sporozoite functionality and development was explored. Methods: IgG was purified from plasma samples obtained before and after CPS-immunization from two separate clinical trials. The functionality of these antibodies was assessed in vitro in gliding and human hepatocyte traversal assays, and in vivo in a human liver-chimeric mouse model. Results: Whereas pre-treatment of sporozoites with 2 mg/ml IgG in the majority of the volunteers did not have an effect on in vitro sporozoite gliding motility, CPS-induced IgG showed a distinct inhibitory effect in the sporozoite in vitro traversal assay. Pre-treatment of P. falciparum sporozoites with post-immunization IgG significantly inhibited sporozoite traversal through hepatocytes in 9 / 9 samples when using 10 and 1 mg/ml IgG, and was dose-dependent, resulting in an average 16 % and 37 % reduction with 1 mg/ml IgG (p = 0. 003) and 10 mg/ml IgG (p = 0. 002), respectively. In vivo, CPS-induced IgG reduced liver-stage infection and/or development after a mosquito infection in the human liver-chimeric mouse model by 91. 05 % when comparing 11 mice receiving post-immunization IgG to 11 mice receiving pre-immunization IgG (p = 0. 0008). Conclusions: It is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} CPS-immunization induces functional antibodies against P. falciparum sporozoites, which are able to reduce parasite-host cell interaction by inhibiting parasite traversal and liver-stage infection. These data highlight the functional contribution of antibody responses to pre-erythrocytic immunity after whole-parasite immunization against P. falciparum malaria...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the work}} of Bail (1) the edema fluid of {{cutaneous}} anthrax lesions {{has been known to}} contain an antigen capable of eliciting protective <b>immunity.</b> <b>Sterile</b> extracts of lesions were found to produce active immunity in rabbits, sheep, and guinea pigs, {{and to a lesser extent}} in hamsters and mice (2 - 4). Gladstone (5) demonstrated that the protective antigen was also elaborated during in vitro growth of the organism in blood plasma, and that culture filtrates as active as edema fluid could be produced under carefuUy controlled conditions. It was necessary that the inoculum be small and the incubation time short, otherwise the filtrates were inactive. It was suggested that the destruction of protective antigen which occurred when incubation of cultures was continued beyond 30 hours was due to activity of a protease also elaborated by Bacillus antkracis (5). Longer incubation of the culture was permissible and increased yields of the antigen were obtained if the culture was dialyzed against broth in a specialized apparatus during growth (6). The present report describes the isolation and properties of mutants of B. antkracis which do not elaborat...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} design P. falciparum preerythrocytic vaccine candidates, {{a library of}} circumsporozoite (CS) T and B cell epitopes {{displayed}} on the woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen (WHcAg) VLP platform was produced. To test the protective efficacy of the WHcAg-CS VLPs, hybrid CS P. berghei/P. falciparum (Pb/Pf) sporozoites were used to challenge immunized mice. VLPs carrying 1 or 2 different CS repeat B cell epitopes and 3 VLPs carrying different CS non-repeat B cell epitopes elicited high levels of anti-insert antibodies (Abs). Whereas, VLPs carrying CS repeat B cell epitopes conferred 98 % protection of the liver against a 10, 000 Pb/Pf sporozoite challenge, VLPs carrying the CS non-repeat B cell eptiopes were minimally-to-non-protective. One-to-three CS-specific CD 4 /CD 8 T cell sites were also fused to VLPs, which primed CS-specific as well as WHcAg-specific T cells. However, a VLP carrying only the 3 T cell domains failed to protect against a sporozoite challenge, indicating a requirement for anti-CS repeat Abs. A VLP carrying 2 CS repeat B cell epitopes and 3 CS T cell sites in alum adjuvant elicited high titer anti-CS Abs (endpoint dilution titer > 1 x 10 (6)) and provided 80 - 100 % protection against blood stage malaria. Using a similar strategy, VLPs were constructed carrying P. vivax CS repeat B cell epitopes (WHc-Pv- 78), which elicited high levels of anti-CS Abs and conferred 99 % protection of the liver against a 10, 000 Pb/Pv sporozoite challenge and elicited <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> to blood stage infection. These results indicate that immunization with epitope-focused VLPs carrying selected B and T cell epitopes from the P. falciparum and P. vivax CS proteins can elicit <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> against blood stage malaria. Hybrid WHcAg-CS VLPs could {{provide the basis for}} a bivalent P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria vaccine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInoculation {{with the}} {{neurotropic}} JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) {{into the central}} nervous system (CNS) of susceptible strains of mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis in which virus preferentially replicates within glial cells while excluding neurons. Control of viral replication during acute disease is mediated by infiltrating virus-specific T cells via cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity, however <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> is not achieved and virus persists resulting in chronic neuroinflammation associated with demyelination. CXCR 2 is a chemokine receptor that upon binding to specific ligands promotes host defense through recruitment of myeloid cells to the CNS as well as protecting oligodendroglia from cytokine-mediated death in response to MHV infection. These findings highlight growing evidence of the diverse and important role of CXCR 2 in regulating neuroinflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Immunization {{with live}} Plasmodium sporozoites under {{chloroquine}} prophylaxis (Spz plus CQ) induces <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> against sporozoite challenge in rodents and, more importantly, in humans. Full protection is obtained with substantially fewer parasites {{than with the}} classic immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. The sterile protection observed comprised a massive reduction in the hepatic parasite load and an additional effect at the blood stage level. Differences in the immune responses induced by the two protocols occur but are as yet little characterized. We have previously demonstrated that in mice immunized with irradiated sporozoites, immune responses against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major component of the sporozoite’s surface and the leading malaria vaccine candidate, were not essential for sterile protection. Here, we have employed transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites in which the endogenous CSP was replace...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} described that immunopotentiators, CVCVA 5, increased {{the efficacy of}} H 5 and H 9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens, ducks, and geese. In this study, we further investigated {{the effects of the}} CVCVA 5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines. The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA 5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL- 4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA 5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The <b>sterile</b> protective <b>immunity</b> was monitored with one- or a half-dose of adjuvanted ND vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted IBD vaccine, respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA 5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H 9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA 5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H 9). A half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75 % antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA 5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H 5 or H 9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines given a booster with H 5 –H 9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA 5 using 5 -day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFNγ and IL- 4 after the injection of the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines. Results indicated that the CVCVA 5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine, and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Immunization with {{radiation}} (c) -attenuated Plasmodia sporozoites (c-spz) confers <b>sterile</b> and long-lasting <b>immunity</b> against malaria liver-stage infection. In the P. berghei c-spz model, protection {{is linked to}} liver CD 8 + T cells that express an effector/ memory (TEM) phenotype, (CD 44 hiCD 45 RBloCD 62 Llo), and produce IFN-c. However, neither the antigen presenting cells (APC) that activate these CD 8 + TEM cells nor the site of their induction have been fully investigated. Because conventional (c) CD 8 a+ DC (a subset of CD 11 c+ DC) are considered the major inducers of CD 8 + T cells, {{in this study we}} focused primarily on cCD 8 a+ DC from livers of mice immunized with Pb c-spz and asked whether the cCD 8 a+ DC might be involved in the activation of CD 8 + TEM cells. We demonstrate that multiple exposures of mice to Pb c-spz lead to a progressive and nearly concurrent accumulation in the liver but not the spleen of both the CD 11 c+NK 1. 12 DC and CD 8 + TEM cells. Upon adoptive transfer, liver CD 11 c+NK 1. 12 DC from Pb c-spz-immunized mice induced protective immunity against sporozoite challenge. Moreover, in an in vitro system, liver cCD 8 a+ DC induced naı̈ve CD 8 + T cells to express the CD 8 + TEM phenotype and to secrete IFN-c. The in vitro induction of functional CD 8 + TEM cells by cCD 8 a + DC was inhibited by anti-MHC class I and anti-IL- 12 mAbs. These data suggest that liver cCD 8 a+ DC present liver-stage antigens to activate CD 8 + TEM cells, the pre-eminen...|$|R
40|$|Random-bred mice were immunized with a nonliving antigen {{prepared}} from mixed-blood {{forms of}} Plasmodium berghei, strain NYU- 2, {{in combination with}} Corynebacterium parvum and/or living BCG. A high proportion of intravenously immunized mice survived virulent challenge, but subcutaneous vaccination was less effective. Vaccinated mice developed a patent infection after challenge similar to that observed in normal controls. However, between days 12 to 20 postchallenge, infections in some vaccinated mice became subpatent, whereas infections in all normal controls progressed until death. The incidence of recrudescent infection was low and, eventually, a state of <b>sterile</b> <b>immunity</b> was established. The capacity of vaccinated mice to withstand P. berghei challenge was sustained at a fairly stable level for the 6 -month period of observation.
