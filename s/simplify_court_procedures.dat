Ever since the emergence of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in the 1970 s as a set of formal dispute resolution mechanisms and the profound impact of Professor Sander’s seminal lecture at the Pound Conference in which he proposed that ADR should be utilised to reduce reliance on conventional litigation, established civil justice systems have sought to integrate ADR mechanisms within their <b>court</b> <b>procedures.</b> Indeed, in their recent report Transforming Our Justice System, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals spoke of a new approach in <b>simplifying</b> <b>court</b> <b>procedure</b> which will be “designed to promote more conciliatory approaches to dispute resolution…” over expensive advaserialism.

40|$|Universities {{and colleges}} face an {{enormous}} variety of disputes in {{their roles as}} providers of education, be it with students, with employees or with suppliers. Out of <b>court</b> <b>procedures</b> will in many instances be more efficient in solving these disputes than litigation in the courts. Therefore universities and colleges should contemplate disputes settlement procedures, which do not involve the <b>courts,</b> including online <b>procedures.</b> Online procedures not requiring {{the presence of the}} disputants, is particularly suitable for parties located at a distance, in the university context, e. g. distance learning students. This paper will explain the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in out of court dispute resolution and define the notion of Online Dispute Resolution. It will furthermore set out the various forms of out of <b>court</b> <b>procedures.</b> The paper will then explain how ICT can improve these dispute resolution procedures and make them even more efficient. Finally it will examine the advantages (and disadvantages) of using out of <b>court</b> <b>procedures</b> and in particular the use of ICT in out of <b>court</b> <b>procedures.</b> The paper will conclude by three examples of Online Dispute Resolution.

But also: how can quality be improved by using ICT? So far, little research has been carried out into the legal implications which the use of ICT has for <b>court</b> <b>procedures.</b> Both for researchers, legislatures, policy makers and (potential) litigating parties as well as for the members of the Judiciary itself, it is important to obtain a greater insight into this meaning.

40|$|The ways <b>court</b> <b>procedures</b> can {{be avoided}} is a {{classical}} theme in socio-legal studies and criminology. The preface to a book published on that theme by the Erasmus School of Law in 1988, {{on the occasion of}} its 25 th anniversary, covers the then dominant view very well: ‘They [people who advocate out of court settlements, RvS] consider the judge as an ultimum remedium. And that is how it often should be’. Topics covered in that jubilee volume ranged from arbitration and administrative regulation to diversion and alternative dispute settlement. Now, however, it is striking to see that not only the topics in this issue of the Erasmus Law Review differ substantially from those of twenty years ago but that the tone is also quite different. The initial optimism and the belief that avoiding formal <b>court</b> <b>procedures</b> is essentially a good thing seem to have made way for a more sceptical attitude. Here it is questioned whether extra-legal regulations and out of court settlements actually do diminish the number of <b>court</b> <b>procedures</b> and whether this would be desirable. ...|$|R
