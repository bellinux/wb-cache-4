It appeared after locals {{came in contact with}} the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the Portuguese royal family fled in the early 19th century. There is actually a continuum between Vernacular countryside accents and the carioca <b>sociolect,</b> and the educated speech (in Portuguese norma culta, which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences, the nearest ones among the country's dialects along florianopolitano), so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said <b>sociolect,</b> but most carioca speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality, for example).|$|E

25|$|After the {{revolution}} of 1848 {{the languages of}} instruction at the University re-introduced Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time a certain <b>sociolect</b> developed in the city known as the Lw√≥w dialect. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. Most of the pleas were accepted twenty years later in 1861: a Galician parliament (Sejm Krajowy) was opened and in 1867 Galicia was granted vast autonomy, both cultural and economic. The University was also allowed to start lectures in Polish.|$|E

After the revolutions of 1848, the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain <b>sociolect</b> developed in the city known as the Lw√≥w dialect. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, it was the first European city to have street lights due to innovations discovered by Lviv inhabitants Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz and Jan Zeh. In that year kerosene lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.|$|E

25|$|African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is {{a variety}} (dialect, ethnolect, and <b>sociolect)</b> of the American English {{language}} {{closely associated with}} the speech of, but not exclusive to, African Americans. While AAVE is academically considered a legitimate dialect because of its logical structure, some of both whites and African Americans consider it slang or the result of a poor command of Standard American English. Many African Americans who were born outside the American South still speak with hints of AAVE or southern dialect. Inner-city African-American children who are isolated by speaking only AAVE sometimes have more difficulty with standardized testing and, after school, moving to the mainstream world for work. It is common for many speakers of AAVE to code switch between AAVE and Standard American English depending on the setting.|$|E

5000|$|The retroflex flap, , colloquially {{known to}} Norwegians as tjukk l ('thick l'), is a Central Scandinavian {{innovation}} {{that exists in}} Eastern Norwegian (including Tr√∏ndersk), the southmost Northern dialects, and the most eastern Western Norwegian dialects. It is supposedly non-existent in most Western and Northern dialects. Today there is doubtlessly distinctive opposition between [...] and [...] in the dialects that do have , e.g. gard [...] 'farm' and gal [...] 'crazy' in many Eastern Norwegian dialects. Although traditionally an Eastern Norwegian dialect phenomenon, it was considered vulgar, {{and for a long}} time it was avoided. Nowadays it is considered standard in the Eastern and Central Norwegian dialects, but is still clearly avoided in high-prestige <b>sociolects</b> or standardized speech. This avoidance calls into question the status of [...] as a phoneme in certain <b>sociolects.</b>|$|R

Caipira is the hinterland <b>sociolect</b> of much of the Central-Southern half of Brazil, nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them, that has a historically low prestige in cities as Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, and until some years ago, in S√£o Paulo itself. Sociolinguistics, or what by times is described as 'linguistic prejudice', often correlated with classism, is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of Adoniran Barbosa. Also, the [...] "Paulistano" [...] accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of S√£o Paulo, especially the Italians.|$|E

5000|$|Surzhyk (—Å—ÉÃÅ—Ä–∂–∏–∫, [...] ) {{refers to}} a range of mixed (macaronic) <b>sociolects</b> of Ukrainian and Russian {{languages}} used in certain regions of Ukraine and adjacent lands.

5000|$|Still, {{these sorts}} of [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] grammars differ in degree from broader diasystems, which are {{much less likely to}} be part of speakers' {{linguistic}} competence. Even Trudgill has argued against their cognitive reality, deeming the concept of a broad diasystem to be a [...] "theoretical dead-end." [...] Although the concept did not withstand scrutiny by research linguists, it nevertheless triggered a surge of academic work that used it in applied linguistics (e.g. for ESL education materials, composition texts for native speakers, basic linguistics texts, and in the application of linguistics to literary criticism). Diasystemic representations are also possible in dictionaries. For example, the Macquarie Dictionary reflects the pronunciation of four phonetically distinct <b>sociolects</b> of Australian English. Because these <b>sociolects</b> are the same phonemically, readers (at least, those from Australia) can interpret the system as representing their own accent.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout Brazil, {{deletion}} of the word-final rhotic is common, {{regardless of}} the [...] "normal" [...] pronunciation of the syllable-final allophone. [...] This pronunciation is particularly common in lower registers, although found in most registers in some areas, e.g., Northeast Brazil, and in the more formal and standard <b>sociolect.</b> It occurs especially in verbs, which always end in R in their infinitive form; in words other than verbs, the deletion is rarer and seems not to occur in monosyllabic non-verb words, such as mar. Evidence of this allophone is often encountered in writing that attempts to approximate the speech of communities with this pronunciation, e.g., the rhymes in the popular poetry (cordel literature) of the Northeast and phonetic spellings (e.g., am√°, sofr√™ in place of amar, sofrer) in Jorge Amado's novels (set in the Northeast) and Gianfrancesco Guarnieri's play Eles n√£o usam black tie (about favela dwellers in Rio de Janeiro).|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary critics {{noted that}} Koƒçiƒá's peasant {{characters}} deviated from the idyllic representations that were prevalent in 19th-century South Slavic literature, {{and that his}} stories instead depicted rural life as strenuous and hard. Koƒçiƒá was also noted for his extensive use of word play, usually for comedic effect. An example {{of this can be}} found in Sudanija, in which the main character, an illiterate peasant named ƒÜiko Trubajiƒá, incorrectly refers to the paragraphs in the Austro-Hungarian law code using a <b>sociolect,</b> paligrafi ("paligraphs"). In a number of stories, particularly Jazavac pred sudom, Koƒçiƒá repeatedly mocks the Austro-Hungarians for their poor grasp of Serbo-Croatian. In his speeches before the Sabor, he frequently lambasted the authorities for their supposed corrupting influence on the Serbo-Croatian language. The authority figures who frustrate the powerless Serb peasant's calls for justice are faceless, nameless individuals who have trouble understanding the nuances and subtleties of Balkan life. [...] "Koƒçiƒá's objections seemed directed not at political oppression as such," [...] Hajdarpa≈°iƒá contends, [...] "but rather specifically against the [...] "foreign" [...] character of the Habsburg administration." ...|$|E
5000|$|Individuals {{who study}} sociolects are called sociolinguists. Sociolinguists study {{language}} variation. Sociolinguists define a <b>sociolect</b> {{by examining the}} social distribution of specific linguistic terms. For example, a sociolinguist would examine {{the use of the}} second person pronoun [...] "you" [...] for its use within the population. If one distinct social group used 'yous' as the plural form of the pronoun then this could indicate the existence of a <b>sociolect.</b> A <b>sociolect</b> is distinct from a dialect because social class rather than geographical subdivision substantiates the unique linguistic features.|$|E
