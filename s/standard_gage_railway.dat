Thunderstorm rainfall in southern Arizona and New Mexico were analyzed using data from both recording and <b>standard</b> rain <b>gages.</b> The results were somewhat conflicting. Possibly because of more frontal activity and less distance from the Gulf of Mexico., the thunderstorms in eastern New Mexico can be more intense than those in southeastern Arizona. Recording rain gage records suggest that air-mass thunderstorms produce {{a larger number of}} more intense short-duration (about 1 hour or less) rains in southeastern Arizona than in other parts of southern Arizona. However, <b>standard</b> rain <b>gage</b> records from southern Arizona indicate that rainfall from individual air-mass thunderstorms may be greater in south-central Arizona than in se or sw Arizona. But frequency analysis of <b>standard</b> <b>gage</b> data from air-mass storms shows that the 100 -year point rainfall is about 3 inches in all 3 regions.
