40|$|The Freeform Thick Layered Object Manufacturing (FF-TLOM) {{process is}} very {{suitable}} {{for the production of}} very large objects. The technology is based on flexible blade cutting of thick foam layers, which are stacked to create a physical model. Positioning the tool under accurate cutting constraints is a complex and difficult task, since the tool setting is controlled by 6 degrees of freedom. The tool setting in combination with the blade matching with the required shape can be performed in many ways. In this paper the tool path is explored for convex and concave layer contours. Circle arcs approximate the contours, the circle arcs are combined into cone surfaces, the cone conditions are applied for feasible orientations of a <b>straight</b> <b>tool.</b> The orientation of the tool is fixed, next the flexible blade curve is matched with the local nominal shape curve and finally the tool position needs a correction.

This {{is dependent on the}} interactive properties of the tool (action affordances) and how we use the tool to interact with the environment (tool-use action schemas). We used saccadic reaction times (SRTs) to congruent and incongruent visual (LEDs) and tactile stimuli (vibrations to the index finger of each hand) as an indication of peripersonal space. Participants were trained to hold straight stick tools and press switches with their tips. In Experiment 1 participants used tools with proximal and distal ends delineated by colour i. e. there were no structural differences between ends. SRTs to tool-tips presented adjacent to visual stimuli were attained with tools in the same then in reversed orientation to training (the tool-tip became the end held by the participant). Despite training with a specific tip, reversing the <b>straight</b> <b>tool</b> was not associated with retraction of peripersonal space. These results suggest that tool-use action schemas generalized from the trained orientation to the non-trained orientation. In Experiment 2 participants were trained and tested with straight (uncoloured) tools. Participants then held a re-aligned tool that disambiguated the hemi-space of action (proximal end) from the hemi-space of effect (distal end) by presenting them on different sides of space. In the other hand they held one of the trained tools. SRTs suggested that peripersonal space extension occurred to the hemi-space of expected effect despite no tool-tip in this hemi-space. This indicates that grasping the tool may activate a tool-use action schema that enhances multisensory integration in the same side of space as the grasp...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Discovering {{interesting}} patterns from structural domains is {{an important}} task in many real world domains. In recent years, graph-based approaches have demonstrated to be a <b>straight</b> forward <b>tool</b> to mine structural data. However, not all graph-based knowledge discovery algorithms deal with numerical attributes in the same way. Some of the algorithms discard the numeric attributes during the preprocessing step. Some others treat them as alphanumeric values with an exact matching criterion, with the limitation to work with domains {{that do not have}} this type of attribute or discovering patterns without interesting numerical generalizations. Other algorithms work with numerical attributes with some limitations. In this work, we propose a new approach for the numerical attributes handling for graphbased learning algorithms. Our experimental results show how graph-based learning benefits from numerical values handling by increasing accuracy for the classification task and descriptive power of the patterns found (being able to process both nominal and numerical attributes). This new approach was tested with the Subdue system in the Mutagenesis and PTC (The Predictive Toxicology Challenge) domains showing an accuracy increase around 22 % compared to Subdue when it does not use our numerical attributes handling method. Our results are also superior to those reported by other authors, around 7 % for the Mutagenesis domain and around 17 % for the PTC domain...|$|R

50|$|Roads in SimCity {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} elements of the mechanics. Unlike previous SimCity games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a <b>straight</b> line <b>tool,</b> one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road. The act of road building creates a spline on which the SimCity Glassbox interacts with the simulation. When these splines intersect it becomes a reticulated spline which develops the underlying spline network.|$|R

During the period of drought known as the dirty thirties, farmland within the dry-belt, cultivated with mold-board plow and/or double disc and summer fallowed every other year, was subject to massive soil erosion. In 1935, while on a visit to California, Noble observed a sugar beet farmer using a <b>straight</b> blade <b>tool</b> to cut into the subsoil beneath the beets to loosen them for harvesting. He noticed that the blade was disturbing and killing weeds without burying them. Noble realized if he could apply a similar implement to the dry land back in Alberta thus leaving the crop stubble as [...] "trash" [...] on top to hold the soil and protect it from blowing the problem of soil erosion may be solved. He immediately fabricated a tillage implement patterned after the sugar beet harvesting tool. He called his invention the Noble blade. The next year he carried out all his summer fallow work using his invention. The results were so successful by 1937 he had fabricated 50 of the implements which he sold to friends and neighbors. By 1941 a factory was built within the village of Nobleford. Sales of the Noble blade occurred throughout the dry land farming areas of the world. The Noble blade is touted as one of the most important agricultural inventions of the 20th century. In 1982 the company that Noble had founded was sold to Versatile Manufacturing Ltd. Today, variations of the Noble blade, produced by all the major farm equipment manufacturers, have supplanted the mold board plow as the main tillage implement in use.|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} when {{applying}} Raman scattering in applied research is spectral interference from laser-induced fluorescence. Extensive {{work has been}} invested in developing spectral and polarization filters as well as modulation schemes to refine spontaneous Raman signals. This current work, however, focuses on utilizing the temporal domain using a picosecond laser system and ICCD cameras with relatively short decay of the camera gate to prevent the fluorescence tail from being captured in Raman experiments. Further, the approach of using an ICCD camera to perform temporal filtering is compared to earlier proposed detection schemes using streak cameras or Kerr gates. The temporal-filtering scheme is evaluated in a spectroscopic investigation where a background subtraction algorithm is presented. The temporal-filtering scheme was also evaluated for Raman imaging of a levitated water droplet surrounded by fluorescing toluene vapor. Furthermore, the temporal-filter detection scheme was simulated {{in order to provide}} <b>straight</b> forward evaluation <b>tools</b> to estimate the potential of performing temporal filtering with a laser/camera system considering: laser-pulse duration, time jitter, camera-gate characteristics, gate delay times, fluorescence lifetimes, and relative signal strength between the Raman and fluorescence signal.

These evaluation tools and experimental investigations may serve as guidelines for planning and performing Raman measurements in situations where traditional filter-rejection schemes are insufficient.

40|$|Surgical robots have proliferated {{in recent}} years, with {{well-established}} benefits including: reduced patient trauma, shortened hospitalisation, and improved diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcome. Despite these benefits, many challenges in their development remain, including improved instrument control and ergonomics caused by rigid instrumentation {{and its associated}} fulcrum effect. Consequently, it is still extremely challenging to utilise such devices in cases that involve complex anatomical pathways such as the spinal column. The focus of this thesis {{is the development of}} a flexible robotic surgical cutting device capable of manoeuvring around the spinal column. The target application of the flexible surgical tool is the removal of cancerous tumours surrounding the spinal column, which cannot be excised completely using the <b>straight</b> surgical <b>tools</b> in use today; anterior and posterior sections of the spine must be accessible for complete tissue removal. A parallel robot platform with six degrees of freedom (6 DoFs) has been designed and fabricated to direct a flexible cutting tool to produce the necessary range of movements to reach anterior and posterior sections of the spinal column. A flexible water jet cutting system and a flexible mechanical drill, which may be assembled interchangeably with the flexible probe, have been developed and successfully tested experimentally. A model predicting the depth of cut by the water jet was developed and experimentally validated. A flexion probe that is able to guide the surgical cutting device around the spinal column has been fabricated and tested with human lumber model. Modelling and simulations show the capacity for the flexible surgical system to enable entering the posterior side of the human lumber model and bend around the vertebral body to reach the anterior side of the spinal column.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, careful {{analysis}} of a large quantity of ceramic material found during excavation at Vinca has identified {{a significant number of}} ceramic fragments with clear use-wear traces. Recycled fragments of ceramic vessels are characterized by the presence of damage and deformation caused by abrasive processes i. e. contact of the fragments with hard material. All recorded recycled fragments can generally be divided into two basic groups: fragments representing tools with a working edge, and fragments with traces of abrasion on their outer surface. The largest group comprises fragments whose edges form the working edge of a tool, rounded or flattened through use and so becoming smooth. In contrast to so-called burnishers (the secondarily used, striped handles with traces of the action of water, manifesting in a uniformly rounded break) with ceramic tools only one edge of the fragment is rounded and used; the remaining edge indicates a completely normal break. In addition, most fragments also have abrasions directly beneath the working edge, which indicates holding the tool at a certain angle during use. That damage can occur both on the exterior and interior surfaces. It is striking that in a large group of fragments, the rim is used as a working edge. Tools are mostly fragmented, but it appears that their shape was not modified before use. In that sense, two <b>straight</b> polygonal <b>tools</b> can be distinguished (T. I/ 1 a-b), or tools which are rectangular in shape with rounded corners (T. II 4 a-b), preserved complete. In most cases, these are fragments of bowls, so tools usually have polished or burnished surfaces, but ornamental parts formed by burnished lines or channelling are also noticeable. Fragments of rough fabric were never used as tools, but only those with an admixture of fine sand. Very rarely, actually in two cases, fragments of amphorae were used as tools (T. IV/ 2, 5). Usually the upper parts of vessels were used, although there are several exceptions, where parts of the base and body were used as well (T. IV/ 3). Also, in the damaged area straight depressions can often be noticed, which apparently represent some kind of negative impression of the object on which they were used, or, in rare cases, the whole working surface is step-like. The second group of fragments do not generally differ from the first group as regards their form and the surface treatment. The difference {{can be seen in the}} distribution of damage. To be precise, the zone of intensive abrasion lies on the surface of fragments and is manifested by complete removal of original surface, while across it, marks caused by contact with hard material often result in deep incisions, which can be seen with the naked eye. These marks can be found on the most protruted parts of vessels i. e. on the shoulder, apart from two cases concerning the shoulder, or the thickened rim of an amphora (T. V/ 1, 5). Finally, we should emphasise the fact that not one ceramic tool has been found around an architectural structure. Specimens originate from archaeological layers or contexts which do not represent a specific zone of activity (destruction layers, ditch filling, posthole, levelling layers etc) but in contexts in which waste material was deposited. From that perspective, one example can particularly be distinguished, a tool with a working edge found near the ceramic substructure of a oven. By analysis of the distribution, shape and kind of damage, as well as the position and shape of the working edge, it is possible to reconstruct the direction of movement and position of the tool during use. Scraping tools show marks in the form of dense incisions, visible both macroscopically and microscopically. They can also be characterised by a pronouncedly rounded working edge. Bearing these characteristics in mind, tools from Vinca with rounded working edges can be categorized as tools for scraping away excess clay and for thinning the surface of unfired vessels. They were held at right angles or slanting in relation to the vessel, with the working edge horizontal or also at an angle or lateral to the working edge, so that the vessels walls were thinned by movements in various directions. Ceramic tools were not specialized, and were undoubtedly multi-functional. They could have been used for smoothing and polishing. This is supported by the fact that abrasion traces are parallel or distributed in various directions. A group of tools with a flattened working edge, judging by preserved marks, had a rather different function. There are indications that these were held at right angles to the vessel but that the movement was not lateral. The tool was probably held with the working edge in a vertical position, so that burnished decoration could be carried out by using up/down movements, when it was necessary to make thin burnished lines of uniform thickness and with clearly defined edges. Bearing in mind traces of 'negative' impressions of the item on which the tools were used, the tool could also have been used in a left-right direction, when it was used to execute the burnished zone typical for upper bowls' parts. One of the important characteristics of ceramic tools is the use of the rim of a broken vessel as a working edge. This is a very logical choice. Bowl rims have a naturally rounded and often symmetrical, sharpened shape. Thus, craftsmen got a ready-made thin, relatively sharp tool, so there was no need to modify a fragment or re-shape it for the working edge to obtain the desired shape. Likewise, as mentioned before, the existence of a negative impression on work edges, usually rims, makes it probable that such tools were used to shape and burnish the rims of vessels. It is an interesting fact that most of these tools comprise fragments of bowls, and this is not coincidental. Important role in the appearance and form of traces caused by abrasive processes is played by characteristics of the abrasive, i. e. tool, such as hardness and granulation. All bowls are characterised by their fine fabric and fine-sand admixture, thin walls, burnished or polished surfaces and firing in a reduced atmosphere. These characteristics are very significant regarding the reaction of material to mechanical stress. A reduced atmosphere during firing increases the hardness of ceramics. Ceramics with fine granulation and lower porosity show greater resistance to mechanical stress than ceramics of rougher fabric with larger quantities of a coarse admixture. Burnishing and polishing lead to the compression of particles on surfaces, which creates a hard, compact structure, resistant to abrasion. It was especially convenient to have tools made of materials with identical characteristics as material they were used on. Analysis of ceramic fragments from the early phase of the Late Neolithic settlement at Vinca indicated an exceptional number of recycled vessel fragments, shaped as tools and used in the process of shaping and modifying ceramic surfaces. Since this concerns a new class of archaeological finds, it is necessary to suggest a direction for future research, particularly experimental, which would, together with microscopic identification of use-wear traces, reveal completely the activities in which ceramic tools were used...|$|R
