500|$|The first {{proposal}} to test nuclear weapons against naval warships {{was made on}} August 16, 1945, by Lewis Strauss, future chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. In an internal memo to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, Strauss argued, [...] "If such a test is not made, there will be loose talk {{to the effect that}} the fleet is obsolete {{in the face of this}} new weapon and this will militate against appropriations to preserve a postwar Navy of the size now planned." [...] With very few bombs available, he suggested a large number of targets widely dispersed over a large area. A quarter century earlier, in 1921, the Navy had suffered a public relations disaster when General Billy Mitchell's bombers sank every target ship the Navy provided for the [...] ship-versus-bomb tests. The <b>Strauss</b> <b>test</b> would be designed to demonstrate ship survivability.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the subject}} of {{sensitisation}} in unstabilised ferritic/martensitic dual phase 11 - 14 %Cr steels has been investigated in some detail {{after a number of}} failures in service due to accelerated corrosion. It was found that sensitisation could occur due to a number of different mechanisms which were dependant on the heat treatment, the number of thermal cycles and the phases present in the material. All the detected modes of sensitisation could be prevented by stabilisation with titanium or niobium and suitable design of the material composition to produce a suitably high ferrite factor. However, these options could not readily be applied to thick gauge plate and therefore 12 %Cr material available in the market above 10 mm thickness still tends to be unstabilised. This project was initiated with the intention of determining how sensitisation would manifest itself during welding of thicker plates and whether the degree of sensitisation could be controlled to acceptable levels by appropriate control of the welding parameters. This was done in two phases, namely evaluation of actual welds produced using varying heat input parameters and by simulation of the thermal treatment using a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator. The samples were evaluated using standard immersion tests (<b>Strauss</b> <b>test)</b> and electrochemical techniques. Mode 2 sensitisation was found to occur on all samples and on all materials, irrespective of the welding parameters. This occurred at all points where the heat affected zone (HAZ) from one weld bead intersected with the HAZ from a previous bead. However, the sensitised regions were generally well {{below the surface of the}} material and would therefore not be exposed to the atmosphere and any corrosive environment. The exception to this rule occurred when very high heat input resulted in an excessively large HAZ or when poor weld bead positioning and inappropriate bead overlap resulted in sensitisation of the HAZ on the surface. Mode 3 sensitisation did not occur within the range of welding parameters investigated. Mode 4 sensitisation was found to occur on all materials but could not reliably be detected by the <b>Strauss</b> <b>test.</b> Electrochemical evaluation clearly showed that sensitisation was present in the subcritical HAZ on all materials, irrespective of welding conditions. However, the degree of sensitisation was very low. From a practical perspective, problems in service due to sensitisation are most likely to arise from very high heat input levels and welding defects such as excessive overlap of weld beads and incomplete fusion...|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} Meinhold’s novel Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe (1843) {{as an example}} of a literary hoax. Purporting to be an authentic seventeenth-century chronicle of a local witch trial, the text was conceived by Meinhold, a conservative Pomeranian cleric and novelist, as a challenge to the contemporary world of historical criticism, represented in particular by the theologian <b>Strauß.</b> The <b>test</b> was whether scholars truly had the skills to distinguish fact from fiction. While the hoax provoked controversy at the highest level and led ultimately to the discrediting of its author, this study seeks to accord Meinhold some overdue recognition for successfully crafting his work in such a manner as to deceive his readership, at least for a time. Analysis of Meinhold’s use of paratextual elements such as preface, footnotes, intertitles and epilogue to construct the form of an edited text, shows that his method was not without skill. It is argued that, as well as offering a window on the religious debates and cultural sensibilities of its nineteenth-century context, this novel indicates a considerable achievement in literary deception...|$|R
40|$|Com base em aspectos clínico-patológicos, epidemiológicos e sorológicos, bem como pelo isolamento de Burkholderia mallei, diagnosticaram-se focos de mormo em eqüídeos na Zona da Mata dos Estados de Pernambuco e Alagoas. Clinicamente observaram-se hipertermia, respiração ruidosa, inapetência, emagrecimento progressivo até caquexia, congestão nasal e descarga mucopurulenta, erosões, úlceras e cicatrizes na mucosa nasal. Os linfonodos mandibulares e cervicais superficiais apresentavam-se aumentados de volume, com abscessos e fístulas exsudando {{material}} purulento. Na pele, ao longo dos vasos linfáticos, havia formação de nódulos firmes e abscessos que, nos casos crônicos, fistulavam e ulceravam deixando cicatrizes estrelares. A histopatologia dos nódulos de diversos sítios, tanto dos eqüídeos como dos cobaios utilizados na prova de Straus, revelou lesões granulomatosas e piogranulomas. Os dados deste estudo evidenciam a emergência da doença nesta área e permitem recomendar inquéritos soro-epidemiológicos nos Estados de ocorrência dos surtos e nos Estados limítrofes. Based on clinical-pathological, epidemiological and serological aspects, {{as well as}} by {{the isolation}} of Burkholderia mallei, foci of glanders were diagnosed in equids of the "Zona da Mata" in the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas. Clinically there was hyperthermia, noisy respiration, loss of appetite, progressive loss of weight leading to emaciation, nasal congestion and muco-purulent discharge, erosions, ulcers and scars of the nasal mucosa. The size of submaxillary and cervical lymphonodes was increased, which contained abscesses and fistules exudating purulent material. In the skin, accompanying the lymph vessels, there were firm nodules and abscesses which in chronic cases fistulated and ulcerated leaving stellar scars. The histopathology of the nodules at various sites, from the horses as well as from the guinea-pigs used for the <b>Strauss</b> <b>test,</b> showed granulomatous lesions and pyogranulomas. The results of this study showed that glanders in the region was emerging and further sero-epidemiological studies are urgent for the eradication of the disease...|$|E
