5|$|Critics {{found the}} Game Gear port {{to be well}} done given the system's less {{powerful}} technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called {{it one of the}} best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis verions's playability came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> Treasure was able to create a fun 8-bit port.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{produced}} {{a list of}} nine manuscripts which were to be assigned to the Alexandrian text: C, L, K, 1, 13, 33, 69, 106, and 118. Codex Vaticanus was not in this list. In the second (1796) edition of his Greek NT, Griesbach added Codex Vaticanus as {{a witness to the}} Alexandrian text in Mark, Luke, and John. He <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> the first half of Matthew represented the Western text-type.|$|E
5|$|Additional collections, then <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> to be T.toomansis, {{were made}} from South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of {{unspecified}} Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E

5|$|Anning's discoveries became key {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of the bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to {{continue}} playing {{in lieu of}} backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to}} be {{nominated}} one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that a person could be possessed.|$|E
5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century medical system. A. T. <b>Still</b> <b>believed</b> that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.|$|E

5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> in the 16th century that {{the healing power}} was {{retained}} by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to be touched by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E

5|$|When the Treaty of Paris, {{under which}} Spain was to cede the Philippines to the United States, {{was made public}} in December 1898, Luna quickly decided to take {{military}} action. He proposed a strategy {{that was designed to}} trap the Americans in Manila before more of their troops could land by executing surprise attacks (guerrilla warfare) while building up strength in the north. If the American forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the Cordillera. This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that the Americans would grant full independence.|$|E
5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured. This was a consistent result across all age groups, genders and geographic locations. It also concluded that 41% of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue, and only 24% were satisfied. The remaining 35% were still undecided or had no opinion. As time progressed, 61% of Canadians <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military officials would have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.|$|E
5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach against the USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., against the USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights against the Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be {{in no position to}} challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further rapprochements with Japan, since he <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that Japan would join Germany in a future war against the Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding large parts of the Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and glitches in his review copy would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{quickly turned}} to riots, with Hutu gangs {{moving through the}} {{district}} attacking Tutsi homes as they went. The violence at this stage consisting primarily of arson rather than killing, except {{in cases where the}} Tutsi tried to fight back. First in Ndiza and then across the country, Hutu burned Tutsi homes to the ground primarily by igniting paraffin, a product widely available in Rwanda for use in lamps. Made homeless, many Tutsi sought refuge in Catholic Church missions and with the Belgian authorities, while others crossed into Uganda and the Congo, beginning what would become a mass exodus {{by the end of the}} revolution. The arsonists recruited local peasants to their ranks, ensuring the rapid spread of the revolt. Many Hutu <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> that the king was superhuman, and claimed that they carried out the attacks on his behalf. By 9 November violence had spread across the country, except for Gitera's home province of Astrida (Butare) and the far southwest and east. Rioting was heaviest in the northwest; in Ruhengeri, every Tutsi home was destroyed by fire.|$|E
