30|$|Since forces {{transmitted}} at {{the points}} of contact are composed of normal forces and frictional (tangential) forces (Johnson 1985), the slot walls support the <b>seal</b> <b>element</b> by both the normal component and the friction component. While the coarse particles set in place as the first barrier, the normal and frictional forces control the equilibrium of the seal. As discussed above, better force distribution improves both the normal and friction force distribution to be more uniform within the <b>seal</b> <b>element.</b> Improving the normal force distribution to the walls also improves the friction, and the better the friction the higher the <b>seal</b> <b>element</b> can withstand the load. Overall, the load can be transferred more uniformly toward the slot walls and better shared among the particles, resulting in higher seal integrity. The results from adding {{a good portion of}} fine particles such as adding hematite, barite or fine-sieved barite seem to coherently support this idea. Fine particles appear to stay everywhere they could occupy the void space and essentially contribute in stress distribution of the granular system, but more importantly, they should be the material properties that takes responsibility for the impermeable capability of the seal at the upstream surface.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the <b>sealing</b> <b>elements</b> are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the <b>sealing</b> <b>elements,</b> thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|R
