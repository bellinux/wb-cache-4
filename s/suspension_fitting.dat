40|$|Abstract: The European Directive 2002 / 44 /EC on {{the minimum}} Health and Safety {{prescriptions}} regarding {{the exposure of}} workers to vibrations, was implemented in Italy through the Legislative Decree 187 / 2005, recently amended by the Legislative Decree 81 / 2008. The Decrees contain legal obligations and minimum requirements for the evaluation by direct measurement, which is the reference method, although not always appropriate or necessary, and by means of vibration data banks or information provided by equipment manufacturers. The values assessed must {{be representative of the}} actual working environment: in order to adapt assessed values to real working conditions it may be useful to adopt some statistical models. Statistically significant relationships were observed by means of a multiple linear regression on a limited set of measures on different models of trucks, in different operating conditions and settings: the relative influence of predictor variables was then assessed. Finally a short digression about the evolution of the <b>suspension</b> <b>fitting</b> has been made in order to briefly describe the historical context of WBV exposure level reduction and {{the state of the art}} of industrial vehicle comfort improvement technologies...|$|E
40|$|This {{memorandum}} report {{covers a}} series of Water Tunnel tests of the Mk 13 - 2 A Torpedo equipped with three different devices designed to facilitate the suspension of the torpedo in standard aircraft bomb racks The <b>suspension</b> <b>fittings</b> tested were: (1) Torpedo Suspension Band Mk 11 (2) Suspension Beam for Mk 13 Air Flask, 30 " Centers (3) Suspension Beam for Mk 13 Air Flask, 14 " Centers The objective of these tests was to determine what effect the addition {{of each of these}} suspension devices would have on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the torpedo. The tests were made on 2 -inch diameter models (model scale ratio of 1 to 11. 21) in the High Speed Water Tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. The results of these tests are given in Table 1 and in the section on cavitation on Page 10 of this report...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{commentators}} have interpreted the compositional form and motifs of BWV 621 {{in terms of}} the themes of the Passiontide hymn, primarily concerned with the crucifixion. [...] wrote that Christs hanging on the cross [...] "is represented by the heavy, syncopated notes" [...] and takes this as [...] "evidence of a wonderfully true aesthetic feeling" [...] Bach, since [...] "that enforced quietude of direst anguish was no real calm." [...] Similarly for , the pedal line symbolises [...] "the drooping of the exhausted body of Jesus on the cross." [...] describes the dissonant <b>suspensions</b> as <b>fitting</b> for [...] "the tragic subject matter." [...] For [...] the syncopated bass line is a [...] "masterful" [...] way of evoking the dragging of the cross. Similar motifs and handling of voices occur at the close of Von Himmel hoch, da komm ich her, BWV 606: although that Christmas hymn primarily concerns the incarnation of Christ, later parts of the text foreshadow the crucifixion.|$|R
5000|$|The Altea Prototipo {{incorporates}} the new SEAT's design direction trend reflecting the [...] 'SEAT auto emoci√≥n' [...] philosophy, which was shown {{for the first}} time in the 2000 SEAT Salsa concept car, moreover featuring the characteristic for the brand lateral curved descending lines as well as the new front radiator grille. Other interesting points are the windscreen wipers resting at vertical position, the non-visible exterior rear door handles, and the Agile Chassis or Dynamic steering response (DSR) system meaning special <b>suspension</b> settings and <b>fittings</b> combined with an electronic programme that regulates power steering response according to driving and steering speed.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{method of}} {{attachment}} of prosthesis to the residual limb (<b>suspension)</b> and socket <b>fitting</b> is a critical issue {{in the process of}} providing an amputee with prosthesis. Different suspension methods try to minimize the pistoning movement inside the socket. The Seal-In (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by Ossur are new suspension liners that intend to reduce pistoning between the socket and liner. Since the effects of these new liners on suspension are unclear, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the pistoning effect of Seal-In (R) X 5 and Dermo (R) Liner by using Vicon Motion System. Methods: Six transtibial amputees, using both the Iceross Seal-In (R) X 5 and the Iceross Demo (R) Liner, participated in the study. The vertical displacement (pistoning) was measured between the liner and socket in single limb support on the prosthetic limb (full-weight bearing), double limb support (semi-weight bearing), and non-weight bearing on the prosthetic limb, and also under three static vertical loading conditions (30 N. 60 N, and 90 N). Findings: The results demonstrated that the pistoning within the socket when Seal-In (R) X 5 was used, decreased by 71 in comparison to the Iceross Dermo (R) Liner. In addition, a significant difference between the two liners under different static conditions was found (p< 0. 05). Interpretation: Participants needed to put in extra effort for donning and doffing the prosthesis with Seal-In (R) X 5; however, this type of liner provided less pistoning. The new approach that uses the motion analysis system in this study might be an alternative for measuring the pistoning effect in the prosthetic socket. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
