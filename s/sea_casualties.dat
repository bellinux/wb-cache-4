50|$|The Chinese {{failure to}} {{eliminate}} the 23d at Chipyong-ni effectively ended the Chinese effort to drive the American forces into the <b>sea.</b> UN <b>casualties</b> were 51 killed, 250 wounded, and 42 missing. The Chinese had lost about 2,000 killed and suffered about 3,000 wounded. The effect on the Eighth Army was tremendous. Shortly afterward the UN launched Operation Killer and then Operation Ripper which forced the Chinese back to the north. The result {{was the start of}} peace negotiations in July 1951.|$|R
5000|$|... 1935 was {{the first}} year {{recorded}} with a disastrous hurricane. This hurricane washed out the lower portion of the Overseas Highway, destroyed the ferry station, and washed the railroad out to <b>sea.</b> There were <b>casualties,</b> but the exact numbers are unknown and not very well documented. Most of the casualties were World War I veterans that were housed in tents while they constructed the overseas highway bridges. These veterans were hired to complete the Overseas Highway.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the <b>casualty,</b> <b>sea</b> water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{analyses}} {{the extreme}} event {{which took place}} on 4 November 1966, when a storm produced intense and persistent precipitation over northern and central Italy and an extreme surge in the northern Adriatic <b>Sea,</b> causing <b>casualties</b> and huge damages. Numerical simulations with a regional atmospheric model have been performed to reconstruct the phenomenology of the event. Results have been compared with observations. This study shows that {{the choice of the}} global fields for initial and boundary conditions is crucial for the quality of the reconstruction. The simulation is reasonably accurate if they are extracted from the NCEP re-analysis, while it is not satisfactory if ERA- 40 data are used, though fields have a higher resolution in the ERA- 40 than in the NCEP set of data. The internal physics of the model plays a smaller role in the reproduction of the dynamics of the event...|$|R

Basic data were increased through more reconnaissance flights and satellite pictures. No direct storm casualties or damage from storm winds or <b>seas</b> were reported. <b>Casualties</b> and damage resulting from the Arizona flood disaster were indirectly related to tropical storm Norma. The chronicle of hurricanes and tropical storms deals mainly with {{the relationship of the}} data to hurricane intensity and to physical processes within the various tropical cyclones. 1...|$|R
500|$|Debris {{remained}} in the inland waters of Alabama until at least August 12, 1997. Endangered or threatened sea turtles lived in these waters and were threatened by the debris. Specialized turtle exclusion devices, known as TEDs, or specialized nets that allowed the turtles to escape them, were required before Danny for shrimp trawlers. The Director of the Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said that the [...] "inordinate amount of debris is causing extraordinary difficulty {{with the performance of}} (TEDs) in these areas." [...] Therefore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency allowed an alternative to the TEDs, of shorter tow times with seasonal restrictions of a maximum of 55minutes from April 1 through October 31, and a maximum of 75minutes from November 1 through March 31. By making the shorter tow times the required alternative, the EPA intended to minimize any <b>sea</b> turtle <b>casualties</b> as a result of trawlers being allowed to remove the TEDs.|$|R
5000|$|The rescue {{operation}} was coordinated from the Bulgarian shore and involved eight Romanian ships, Motru , Tg. Bujor , Mărăşeşti , Căciulata , Gostinul , Grădiştea , Topliţa [...] and the Voinicul tugboat, five Bulgarian ships, Perun, Rusalka, Icar, Europa, and Kiten, two Soviet ships, Ianghi Iuli and Gordelivi, and rescue helicopters from Romania and Bulgaria. The Romanian ships Motru and Tg. Bujor each rescued 18 crew members, the Soviet ship Ianhghi Iuli rescued 5 {{and the last}} crew member, Gabriel Georgescu, was rescued by a Bulgarian helicopter after staying eight hours in the cold waters of the Black <b>Sea.</b> The only <b>casualty</b> was the ship's waitress Ganţă Elena.|$|R
50|$|The Quebec-class {{was plagued}} with {{problems}} caused by liquid oxygen evaporation. Their endurance was limited to 14 days due to continuous evaporation of the oxygen and lack of a re-liquefaction system, and the propulsion system led to several serious incidents. In 1957 two submarines were lost due to accidents caused by the oxygen system. M-256 suffered a fire off Tallinn in the Baltic, {{which led to the}} loss of 35 men, while M-351 sank in the Black <b>Sea</b> with no <b>casualties.</b> Other incidents caused oxygen-fueled flames to burst out from the boats, which led to their crews to nickname them zazhigalka ("lighters") or Zippos after the well-known cigarette lighter.|$|R
2500|$|The Trafalgar Cemetery is a {{cemetery}} in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Formerly {{known as the}} Southport Ditch Cemetery, it occupies a small area of land just {{to the south of}} the city walls, in what had been a defensive ditch during the period of Spanish rule of Gibraltar. Although it is named for the Battle of Trafalgar of 21 October 1805, only two victims of the battle are buried there. The remainder of the interments are mostly of those killed in other <b>sea</b> battles or <b>casualties</b> of the yellow fever epidemics that swept Gibraltar between 1804 and 1814. In addition, tombstones were transferred to the Trafalgar Cemetery from St. Jago's Cemetery and Alameda Gardens.|$|R
5000|$|Efforts to {{stem the}} Deepwater Horizon oil spill were ongoing {{from the time that}} the Deepwater Horizon {{exploded}} on April 20, 2010 until the well was sealed by a cap on July 15, 2010. Various species of dolphins and other mammals (61 casualties), birds (2,095 casualties), and the endangered <b>sea</b> turtles (467 <b>casualties)</b> have been killed either directly or indirectly by the oil spill. The Deepwater Horizon spill has surpassed in volume the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill as the largest ever to originate in U.S.-controlled waters; it is comparable to the 1979 Ixtoc I oil spill in total volume released (Ixtoc discharged [...] to as of mid-July 2010, Deepwater Horizon has spilled [...] to [...] ).|$|R

50|$|Smith {{was joined}} {{a week later}} by Duckworth, who {{observed}} the four bays of the Dardanelles lined with five hundred cannon and one hundred mortars as his ships passed towards Constantinople. There he found {{the rest of the}} Turkish fleet of twelve ships of the line and nine frigates, all apparently ready for action in Constantinople harbour. Exasperated by Turkish intransigence, and not having a significant force to land on the shore, Duckworth decided to withdraw on 1 March after declining to take Smith's advice to bombard the Turkish Arsenal and gunpowder manufacturing works. The British fleet was subjected to shore artillery fire {{all the way to the}} open <b>sea,</b> and sustaining <b>casualties</b> and damage to ships from 26-inch calibre (650 mm) guns firing 300-800 pound marble shot.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Navy {{currently}} operates {{boot camp}} at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at Naval Station Great Lakes, near North Chicago, Illinois. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other {{branches of the}} U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes {{that it is a}} processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the M9 pistol and Mossberg 500 shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the M16 in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, Uniform Code of Military Justice, recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at <b>sea,</b> mass <b>casualties,</b> shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various [...] "A" [...] Schools located across the United States—where they begin training to receive their ratings (jobs)—or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.|$|R
5000|$|A tornado, {{spawned by}} the hurricane, struck Goulds, Florida on September 10, moving inland from Biscayne Bay. It caused US$25,000 (1919 dollars) in damage. [...] Of the {{approximately}} 600-900 people officially reported {{killed in the}} storm, roughly 500 of them were aboard ten ships lost at sea. Communication was cut off for the entirety of Florida south of Miami following the storm's passage. By comparison, South Florida outside the Florida Keys remained relatively unscathed. Winds in Tampa only reached 26 mph (42 km/h) as the hurricane passed to the city's south. Despite otherwise minor damage in Miami, 17 houseboats and small craft sunk in Biscayne Bay {{as a result of}} rough <b>seas.</b> Damage and <b>casualties</b> on the Texas coast were also severe, in part due to false rumors that the storm had turned north into Louisiana, which warranted taking storm warnings in Corpus Christi down the day before landfall. [...] Though warnings were posted again early the following day, the citizens were ill-prepared when the hurricane made landfall south of the city as a major hurricane; the storm surge was as high as 16 ft.|$|R
