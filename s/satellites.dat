5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit <b>satellites.</b> The ground station communicated with the <b>satellites</b> in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit <b>satellites,</b> allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various <b>satellites</b> using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular <b>satellites</b> with {{prograde}} {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean <b>satellites</b> are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular <b>satellites</b> are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular <b>satellites</b> whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular <b>satellites</b> have not yet been named.|$|E

5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings.

5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} Titania and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six <b>satellites,</b> though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any <b>satellites</b> beside Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional <b>satellites</b> in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four spurious <b>satellites</b> were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel's four <b>satellites</b> were spurious, probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars {{in the vicinity of}} Uranus as <b>satellites,</b> and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.|$|E

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela <b>satellites,</b> which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 <b>satellites</b> detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela <b>satellites</b> were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different <b>satellites,</b> the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Inward of Triton {{are seven}} small regular <b>satellites,</b> {{all of which}} have {{prograde}} orbits in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among Neptune's rings. The largest of them is Proteus. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer irregular <b>satellites</b> other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular <b>satellites,</b> Psamathe and Neso, have the largest orbits of any natural <b>satellites</b> discovered in the Solar System to date.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four <b>satellites</b> in December 1962. However, before the {{launches}} could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet <b>satellites</b> was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their <b>satellites,</b> that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other <b>satellites</b> long range, along with ground based detection of <b>satellites.</b>|$|E
