40|$|Abstract — The roller racer, an undulatory {{locomotion}} system, is a toy {{which can}} be propelled forward by sitting on it and only oscillating the <b>steering</b> <b>handle.</b> A nonholonomic dynamic model and controllability analysis of the roller racer was first published by Krishnaprasad and Tsakiris in 1998. The model {{is derived from the}} usual assumption that all the wheels obey sticking (non-slipping) constraints, i. e., rolling without slipping. Controllability analysis shows that under these assumptions, the roller racer cannot be stopped once started. Yet physical prototypes do not exhibit this characteristic. In this paper, a high-fidelity model of the roller racer is presented by considering the finite static friction between the wheels and the ground, i. e., slipping will occur when constraint force exceeds the maximal allowable frictional force. It is proved that the system could be stopped from any state with only the steering angle control. Furthermore, based on group symmetry and motion primitives, a planner is designed to achieve motions between any two given positions and orientations with zero velocities. Experiments also show that front wheel slipping stops the system faster than joint frictions. I...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} geared towards the {{redesign}} {{and implementation of}} a crimping tool {{for use in the}} manufacturing of catheters produced by Medtronic Inc. Catheters require two steering cables to maneuver the end of the catheter through the body.

Additionally we are {{trying to get rid of}} a step in the manufacturing process that involves the adhesive, cyanoacrylate, being placed inside the sleeve to be crimped. The cyanoacrylate is added to increase the strength of the crimp from three to four pounds of force in shear to around eighteen pounds. However to simplify the manufacturing process we will need to come up with a crimp style for our device that will increase the allowable axial force to eighteen pounds with a metal to metal crimp alone and eliminate the need for an adhesive. The redesigned crimping tool will need high tolerance fit for each crimp as well as a repeatability of crimps for each cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} developed SensaScope ® is a hybrid intubation endoscope {{that has been}} designed and developed according to our clinical requirements for a safe, easy-to-handle, and effective video-assisted intubation. The attribute "hybrid" derives {{from the fact that}} the shaft of the instrument is combined by both, rigid and flexible parts. Its S-shaped rigid segment enables a very intuitive handling by one hand only, thus leaving the left hand free to operate a conventional laryngoscope. The tip of the device can be controlled via a <b>steering</b> <b>handle</b> in a similar fashion as fiberoptic endoscopes. Due to these attributes, the SensaScope® became a very versatile and effective tool to master the unanticipated difficult intubation in anesthetized and paralyzed patients. For this reason, in our institution it has been included as the first-line technique into our local failed intubation algorithm. The first clinical experience with the device and its standardized technique of use produced encouraging results; the success rate for novices was found to be at 97 % (in 194 of 200 patients) of all intubation attempts in both patients categories: those who were rated as having normal (84. 5 %) and in those showing difficult intubation conditions (15. 5 %). The technical development, the way of using the device, the suitable indications, and limitations are discussed here...|$|E

40|$|Body {{stiffness}} {{is one of}} is one of {{the characteristics}} of a passenger car affecting the <b>handling,</b> <b>steering</b> and ride comfort characteristics of the vehicle, but so far only limited aspects of mainly <b>steering</b> and <b>handling</b> has been analyzed. In this paper an extensive and detailed analysis of the influence of body stiffness on <b>steering,</b> <b>handling</b> and ride comfort is performed using a combination of laboratory and track testing of a physical prototype as well as sub-system and full vehicle multi-body simulation and finite element analysis. In this study it is found that the on-center, frequency response and primary ride are mostly affected by changes in body stiffness. For example, the torsional stiffness should be increased in order to improve roll balance in ride maneuvers. It is also found that the front and rear lateral stiffness should be raised in order to reduce dead band and steering wheel angle to yaw rate phase lags. Furthermore, maneuvers that combine handling and ride effects are proven to be particularly useful for defining body stiffness targets related to vehicle dynamics effects and one such maneuver is developed and evaluated in this paper. Finally, it is found that the difference between a rigid and flexibly vehicle model can be up to 13 % for certain metrics, meaning that assuming a rigid body can be a significant oversimplification...|$|R

40|$|Kampala, {{the capital}} of Uganda, {{is one of the}} fastest growing African cities with annual growth rates of 5. 6 %. The rapid urban growth causes major {{socio-economic}} and environmental problems that lower the quality of life of the urban dwellers. A better insight in the controlling factors of the urban growth pattern is necessary to develop and implement a sustainable urban planning. The recent urban growth of Kampala was mapped using LANDSAT images of 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2010. A spatially-explicit logistic regression model was developed for Kampala. Significant predictors in this model included: the presence of roads, the accessibility of the city centre and the distance to existing built-up area. These variables are used as <b>steering</b> <b>handles</b> to create future urban scenarios. Three alternative scenarios for future urban growth were developed: a business as usual, restrictive and stimulative scenario. Our model of growth was applied to these three scenarios to predict patterns of urban growth to 2030. The scenarios show that the alternative policy options result in contrasting future urban sprawl patterns with a significant impact on the local quality of life. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the present paper is {{on the design of}} a {{modified}} sky-hook control of a semi-active Macpherson suspension system by means of H∞ Output Feedback Control (OFC) theory. To this end, a new dynamic model, incorporating the kinematics of the suspension system, is used for the controller design. The combination of a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) solver and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is adopted to regulate the static output feedback control gain so that the stability conditions are fulfilled and control objectives are achieved. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional kinematic model of the system is incorporated to investigate the influence of the control force variation on the <b>steering,</b> <b>handling</b> and stability of the vehicle. A geometric relation of the vehicle roll center is employed to study one more extra aspect of the comfort and stability of the vehicle. The results show that the proposed controller improves the kinematic and dynamic performances of the suspension well compared with those of the passive system. Moreover, it is concluded that a superior stability of the vehicle during the cornering can be achieved by adjusting the height of the vehicle roll center passively so that the stability of the vehicle is improved while the forward motion specifications can be modified by an appropriate suspension control design.
