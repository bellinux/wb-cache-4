5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. He <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|After Marcello Lippi's reappointment as the {{national}} team's manager following Euro 2008, Totti {{announced that he would}} play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up; however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi about a possible comeback. For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for Italy's early exit was {{due to the lack of}} creative players like Totti in the team.|$|E
5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of launch, the access prices for RSPs were {{temporarily}} set at a flat rate of A$300 per premises with no ongoing monthly charges. Mike Quigley <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for the flat rate is the OSS and BSS systems was not built to make the process automatic. He continued if NBN Co charged a monthly charge without the systems, {{it would have been}} a 'very manually intensive process' and not a 'sensible proposition'. However, RSPs did charge a monthly fee to customers, to cover the cost of the trial.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) {{was formed}} by Taylor's former teammates, Lester and Frank Patrick. They {{encouraged}} Taylor to come west. In November 1912, {{it was announced that}} he would be paid $1,800 to join the Vancouver Millionaires. As he prepared to leave for the west coast, Taylor said he would not play in the NHA again under any circumstances. Before he left, Taylor <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two new Toronto teams in the NHA was owned by Lichtenhein, who was plotting to send Taylor to Toronto and prevent him from playing for Ottawa. The accusation was denied by the presidents of both Toronto teams and by Lichtenhein, who all said he had no ownership stake in either team.|$|E

Her first film for the studio was Hollywood Canteen (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. Crawford <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main reasons she signed with Warner Brothers was because she wanted to play the {{character}} [...] "Mattie" [...] in a proposed 1944 film version of Edith Wharton's novel Ethan Frome (1911).|$|E

500|$|Autumn wrote a novel {{entitled}} The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, {{which was}} self-published in 2010. Because of the book's nature and possible autobiographical parts, she claimed its release was delayed because some {{did not want}} it published. The book incorporated anthropomorphized rats and leeches, and the diary of a fictional Victorian-era asylum inmate named [...] "Emily". Autumn <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main messages was {{that many of the}} patients were not insane and that the subject of mental illness remains misunderstood.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Muransky, as {{owner of}} Muransky Co. and Southwoods Surgical Center in Boardman, Ohio, filed for {{monetary}} damages and dissolution {{of a joint}} venture intended to open a full-service, for-profit hospital in southern Mahoning County. Muransky told The Vindicator: [...] "I'm very disappointed for this community. There was an absolute opportunity to grow the health system ... In a few years, {{we are going to}} find ourselves having to drive to Akron and Pittsburgh and Cleveland for health care because it is no longer available here. I'm dumbfounded it has come to this." [...] Muransky <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons he came back to Youngstown was to use his skills to give back to the community.|$|E
500|$|Waddell did refuse Australian {{authorities}} {{permission to}} see if Australians were aboard the ship prior to sailing from Williamstown on February 18, 1865. Four Australians were arrested {{to prevent them from}} joining the Confederate ships, and Governor Darling allowed the Shenandoah to sail away, instead of firing upon it. [...] Waddell's official report said that on February 18 they [...] "found on board" [...] the 42 men, and made 36 sailors and enlisted six as marines. One of the original Confederate crewmen, midshipman John Thomson Mason, stated that they just happened to find the stowaways, of various nationalities, and enlisted them outside of Australian waters. [...] He further <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stowaways was the captain of an English steamer that was at Melbourne at the time; the Englishman became the captain's clerk.|$|E

500|$|The Jonas Brothers {{characters}} were voiced by Parker and Stone, with Parker providing the voices for Kevin and Nick, and Stone voicing Joe, {{although the two}} switched characters on some lines. Parker also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse in [...] "The Ring". Parker and Stone were inspired to make the episode by the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience film, which was released the previous month. Because they were unfamiliar with the band, they spent {{a large amount of}} time watching Jonas Brothers concert clips online, which they found unoriginal and not very enjoyable. Parker <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comedy Central employees told them that after she took her young daughter to see the concert film, the girl said, [...] "Mommy, my giney tickles". Parker thought the story was hilarious and worked the exact line into the episode.|$|E
500|$|For Tracy Draco, the {{producers}} wanted an established actress opposite [...] Lazenby. Brigitte Bardot was invited, but after she signed {{to appear in}} Shalako opposite Sean Connery the deal fell through, and Diana Rigg—who had already been the popular heroine Emma Peel in The Avengers—was cast instead. Rigg <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for accepting the role was that she {{always wanted to be}} in an epic film. Telly Savalas was cast following a suggestion from Broccoli, and Hunt's neighbour George Baker was offered the part of Sir Hilary Bray. Baker's voice was also used when Lazenby was impersonating Bray, as Hunt considered Lazenby's imitation not convincing enough. Gabriele Ferzetti was cast as Draco after {{the producers}} saw him in an Italian Mafia film, but Ferzetti's heavy Italian accent also led to his voice being redubbed by English actor David de Keyser for the final cut.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{references to}} The Beatles and McCartney's solo career. For instance, McCartney tells Lisa that playing his 1970 song [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] backwards will reveal [...] "a {{recipe for a}} really rippin' lentil soup". A {{modified version of the}} song plays in the final scene, then over the closing credits of the episode; when played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record the recipe, which was later added in reverse over the original song. McCartney thought it was [...] "very funny" [...] that the staff wanted to [...] "send up the whole cult thing" [...] of backmasking on the Beatles' songs. [...] "A secret lentil soup recipe seemed a nice parody of that", he <b>said.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backwards snippets says, [...] "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive", a reference to the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] urban legend.|$|E

500|$|The {{first public}} {{screening}} of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was on Jura on 23 August 1995 – exactly {{one year after}} the burning.

Two weeks later an advert appeared in The Guardian, announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at [...] "relevant locations". The second screening was at In The City music industry convention on 5 September in Manchester. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme [...] "Is It Rock'n'Roll?". A week later, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to Belgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled [...] "Is it a crime against humanity?" [...] An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.|$|E
500|$|Magness-Blake <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{dangerous}} parts of Thunder's job {{is at the}} beginning of the game when he leads the team onto the field, as there are cheerleaders ahead of him waving their pom-poms and a team of excited football players behind him. Ann Judge has also remarked about the team getting [...] "amped up" [...] with energy and excitement as Thunder leads them onto the field, explaining that [...] "To him, amped up means danger." [...] On one occasion, a person walked out unexpectedly in front of Thunder as he was leading the players onto the field. [...] Thunder stopped immediately, averting a potentially dangerous situation. Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run. [...] Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb, continuing to run forward onto the field, though he performed flying lead changes with each explosion.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{described}} the episode as [...] "kind of cute tonight, {{and kind of}} flat in places, and kind of sad." [...] Pastorek <b>said</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most interesting aspects of [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: [...] "After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight may be coming to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, {{and that may be}} causing a little tension." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was a [...] "solid offering", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into. Fickett said it was [...] "fun to watch Michael squirm" [...] both when he thought he was in trouble, and when he was robbed credit for his good idea; he also liked when Jim encouraged Dwight not to take the fall for Michael, and when the others in the office rallied around Dwight when David Wallace gave Dwight credit for the success.|$|E
