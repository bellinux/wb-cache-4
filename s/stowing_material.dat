Proper backfilling of mines using the waste materials from waste dumps {{could be a}} viable solution as it reduces mining subsidence, minimize spontaneous combustion, enhance reclamation, restore mined out surface land and create a safe working atmosphere. While taking a particular material for backfilling, assessment of the material's short term and long term geotechnical properties and likely response after the placement to determine the fill's ability to be act as <b>stowing</b> <b>material</b> is imperative. Important properties for the insitu fills are strength, deformability, capability to dissipate pore pressure, primary and secondary consolidation characteristics, durability and leachabilityetc. In this paper, the geotechnical properties of the coal and iron mine wastes have been investigated as to assessing and comparing their suitability for backfilling in opencast mines...|$|E

60|$|It was fortunate, in {{the present}} state of the weather, that the fiftieth course was in a {{sheltered}} spot, within the reach of the tackle of the winch-machine upon the bridge; a few stones were stowed upon the bridge itself, and the remainder upon the building, which kept the artificers at work. The <b>stowing</b> of the <b>materials</b> upon the rock was the department of Alexander Brebner, mason, who spared no pains in attending to the safety of the stones, and who, {{in the present}} state of the work, when the stones were landed faster than could be built, generally worked till the water rose to his middle. At one o'clock to-day the bell rung for prayers, and all hands were collected into the upper barrack-room of the beacon-house, when the usual service was performed.|$|R
