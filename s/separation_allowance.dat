6000|$|In {{any case}} the appeals to {{sentiment}} and fairness outlined above are hollow; for {{it makes no}} difference to the recipient of a <b>separation</b> <b>allowance</b> or a pension whether the State which pays them receives compensation on this or on another head, and a recovery by the State out of indemnity receipts is just as much in relief of the general taxpayer as a contribution towards the general costs of the war would have been. But the main consideration is that {{it was too late to}} consider whether the pre-Armistice conditions were perfectly judicious and logical or to amend them; the only question at issue was whether these conditions were not in fact limited to such classes of direct damage to civilians and their property as are set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of Annex I. If words have any meaning, or engagements any force, we had no more right to claim for those war expenses of the State, which arose out of Pensions and Separation Allowances, than for any other of the general costs of the war. And who is prepared to argue in detail that we were entitled to demand the latter? ...|$|E

6000|$|The reader may be interested, however, {{to have my}} {{estimate}} of the claim which can in fact be substantiated under Annex I. of the Reparation Chapter. In {{the first section of}} this chapter I have already guessed the claims other than those for Pensions and <b>Separation</b> <b>Allowances</b> at $15,000,000,000 (to take the extreme upper limit of my estimate). The claim for Pensions and <b>Separation</b> <b>Allowances</b> under Annex I. is not {{to be based on the}} actual cost of these compensations to the Governments concerned, but is to be a computed figure calculated on the basis of the scales in force in France at the date of the Treaty's coming into operation. This method avoids the invidious course of valuing an American or a British life at a higher figure than a French or an Italian. The French rate for Pensions and Allowances is at an intermediate rate, not so high as the American or British, but above the Italian, the Belgian, or the Serbian. The only data required for the calculation are the actual French rates and the numbers of men mobilized and of the casualties in each class of the various Allied Armies. None of these figures are available in detail, but enough is known of the general level of allowances, of the numbers involved, and of the casualties suffered to allow of an estimate which may not be very wide of the mark. My guess as to the amount to be added in respect of Pensions and Allowances is as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{perhaps the}} most decisive moment, in the {{disintegration}} of the President's moral position and the clouding of his mind, was when at last, to the dismay of his advisers, he allowed himself to be persuaded that the expenditure of the Allied Governments on pensions and <b>separation</b> <b>allowances</b> could be fairly regarded as [...] "damage done to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers by German aggression by land, by sea, and from the air," [...] in a sense in which the other expenses of the war could not be so regarded. It was a long theological struggle in which, after the rejection of many different arguments, the President finally capitulated before a masterpiece of the sophist's art.|$|R
5000|$|Moreau {{was born}} on 29 May 1897 near Norbiton Gate at Kingston upon Thames. His father worked in the stock {{exchange}} while his mother's family ran a baker's business in Kingston. The family name was derived from an ancestral French immigrant who had moved to Bayswater as a bookseller. In his autobiographical note published in the Ibis upon his death, he notes that nobody in his family had any academic interests or an interest in natural history. He went to a local preparatory school and became interested in birds through Cherry Kearton's books With Nature and a Camera and Our Bird Friends. He however did not relate to the birdlife around him. His secondary schooling was at the Kingston Grammar School. Around this time he injured his right wrist and {{had to learn to}} write with his left hand. His father was hit by the open door of a speeding train and the injury led to a nervous breakdown with periodic episodes of manic-depression. The burden of earning and care of the family now went to Moreau's mother but in 1907 they moved from Kingston to Rowledge on the edge of Alice Holt Forest and then in 1913 to Farnham. In his teens he began exploring the neighbourhood on bicycle and through the books of William Henry Hudson took an interest in observing the local birds. In 1914 he wrote the Executive Class Examination for entrance to the Home Civil Service and made it into the 99th place among 100 available positions although his bad eyesight and poor health made him nearly fail. He received a posting in September 1914 at a war office and his job was to scrutinize applications for <b>separation</b> <b>allowance.</b> A year later he was posted at the Army Audit Office in Aldershot. The clerical work {{for the next five years}} was interrupted by rheumatoid arthritis. His family doctor suggested that he needed a [...] "complete change". He applied for a transfer to the Army Audit Department in Cairo and got one in 1920.|$|E

5000|$|Bernadotte Schmitt {{writes that}} if [...] "pensions and <b>separation</b> <b>allowances</b> ... not been included, reparations would {{probably}} never {{have become the}} bogey that poisoned the post-war world for so many years. Taylor says, [...] "no doubt the impoverishment of Germany was caused by war, not by reparations. Not doubt the Germans could have paid reparations, if they had regarded them as an obligation of honour, honestly incurred." [...] However, he says, [...] "reparations ... kept the passions of war alive". Peter Liberman writes that while the Germans believed they could not meet such demands of them, the [...] "French believed that Germany could pay and only lacked the requisite will" [...] to do so. Liberman says this is [...] "a position that has gained support from recent historical research". In regard to Germany's capacity to pay, he focuses on coal and says that German coal consumption per capita was higher than France's despite coal shipments being consistently short. He also says, [...] "the reparations demanded at Versailles were not far {{out of proportion to}} German economic potential" [...] and that in terms of national income it was similar to what the Germans demanded of France following the Franco-Prussian War. Martin Kitchen also says the impression that Germany was crippled by the reparations is a myth. Rather than a weakened Germany, he states the opposite was true.|$|R
60|$|The {{reader will}} readily {{apprehend}} what a plausible {{case can be}} made out for the inclusion of these items of damage, if only on sentimental grounds. It can be pointed out, first of all, that {{from the point of view}} of general fairness it is monstrous that a woman whose house is destroyed should be entitled to claim from the enemy whilst a woman whose husband is killed on the field of battle should not be so entitled; or that a farmer deprived of his farm should claim but that a woman deprived of the earning power of her husband should not claim. In fact the case for including Pensions and <b>Separation</b> <b>Allowances</b> largely depends on exploiting the rather arbitrary character of the criterion laid down in the pre-Armistice conditions. Of all the losses caused by war some bear more heavily on individuals and some are more evenly distributed over the community as a whole; but by means of compensations granted by the Government many of the former are in fact converted into the latter. The most logical criterion for a limited claim, falling short of the entire costs of the war, would have been in respect of enemy acts contrary to International engagements or the recognized practices of warfare. But this also would have been very difficult to apply and unduly unfavorable to French interests as compared with Belgium (whose neutrality Germany had guaranteed) and Great Britain (the chief sufferer from illicit acts of submarines).|$|R
60|$|In {{proposing a}} {{modification}} of the Reparation terms, I have considered them so far only in relation to Germany. But fairness requires that so great {{a reduction in the}} amount should be accompanied by a readjustment of its apportionment between the Allies themselves, The professions which our statesmen made on every platform during the war, as well as other considerations, surely require that the areas damaged by the enemy's invasion should receive a priority of compensation. While {{this was one of the}} ultimate objects for which we said we were fighting, we never included the recovery of <b>separation</b> <b>allowances</b> amongst our war aims. I suggest, therefore, that we should by our acts prove ourselves sincere and trustworthy, and that accordingly Great Britain should waive altogether her claims for cash payment in favor of Belgium, Serbia, and France. The whole of the payments made by Germany would then be subject to the prior charge of repairing the material injury done to those countries and provinces which suffered actual invasion by the enemy; and I believe that the sum of $7,500,000,000 thus available would be adequate to cover entirely the actual costs of restoration. Further, it is only by a complete subordination of her own claims for cash compensation that Great Britain can ask with clean hands for a revision of the Treaty and clear her honor from the breach of faith for which she bears the main responsibility, as a result of the policy to which the General Election of 1918 pledged her representatives.|$|R
40|$|Policy G. S. 143 - 166. 41 {{provides}} for a special <b>separation</b> <b>allowance</b> for eligible law enforcement officers under age 62 at service retirement.

40|$|MBA Professional ReportWithin the Navy, married {{active duty}} service members and unwed single sailors with dependents are {{entitled}} to receive additional benefits compared to their single counterparts.

Surprisingly, the pay premium for being married or having dependents ranges from only 4 percent to only 10 percent for all enlisted ranks of E- 5 and above and for all officer ranks. This premium is well below the marriage premium in the civilian labor market. Also, it is far below the pay increment received from advancement to the next paygrade...|$|E
60|$|In Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7, however, {{an issue}} of immensely greater {{significance}} is involved.

Financially this adds to the Bill, as we shall see below, a very large amount, indeed about twice as much again as all the other claims added together.|$|R
