GPA and SPA offer a different degree of awareness of FUE performance and consequently impacts the MUE performance as well due to the tradeoff between their conflicting requirements in terms of spectral efficiency. More specifically, GPA and SPA implement a different selection mechanism of the interfering femtocells which are to apply the power adjustment and the amount of the power adjustment (increase or decrease). Besides, the associated power adjustment parameters to be introduced hereafter offer an additional leverage in managing the compromise between FUE and MUE performances.|$|R

Understanding these differences and estimating the cell-type makeup {{of a sample}} is {{an important aspect of}} studying DNA methylation. DNA from leukocytes in whole blood is simple to obtain and pervasive in research. However, leukocytes contain many distinct cell types and subtypes. We propose a two-stage model that estimates the proportions of 6 main cell types in whole blood (CD 4 + T cells, CD 8 + T cells, monocytes, B cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells) as well as subtypes of T and B cells. Unlike previous methods that only estimate overall proportions of CD 4 + T cell, CD 8 + T cells, and B cells, our model is able to estimate proportions of naïve, memory, and regulatory CD 4 + T cells as well as naïve and memory CD 8 + T cells and naïve and memory B cells. Using real and simulated data, we are able to demonstrate that our model is able to reliably estimate proportions of these cell types and subtypes. In studies with DNA methylation data from Illumina’s HumanMethylation 450 k arrays, our estimates will be useful both for testing for associations of cell type and subtype composition with phenotypes of interest as well as <b>for</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>purposes</b> to prevent confounding in epigenetic association studies.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a short dietary questionnaire, using weights to estimate nutrient intake. DESIGN: Using dietary data collected in 1993 - 1995 from a large cohort of French women, stepwise regression analysis was used to identify the food groups that best predicted nutrient intakes, resulting in a short list of twenty-three foods. This list was used to design a twenty-three-item dietary questionnaire. Nutrient intake was estimated from the answers to the twenty-three questions, applying weights to each response. Weights were calculated from the large database as regression coefficients of the nutrient intake against the twenty-three food groups. In 2005 - 2006, 103 women responded (at a 1 -year interval) to both the short questionnaire and a previously validated dietary history questionnaire. Intakes of twenty nutrients and energy estimated from these two questionnaires were compared. SETTING: French adult female population. SUBJECTS: For developing the instrument, 73 034 women aged 41 - 72 years; for testing, 103 women aged 55 - 80 years in 2005. RESULTS: Mean nutrient intakes generally differed by less than 10 % between the two methods. Correlation coefficients of nutrient intakes ranged from 0. 23 for vitamin D to > 0. 65 for Mg, vitamin B 3 and alcohol. For most nutrients, at least 70 % of subjects fell into the same or an adjacent quintile when classified by either of the two questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: In light of both its strengths and limitations, this short questionnaire could be used in French adult women to obtain some general nutritional information, notably <b>for</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>purposes</b> when response to an extensive questionnaire cannot be obtained...|$|R

One end of the axle protrudes, and has a short arm; when I push the arm back, the mirror is raised; when I push it forward it drops down. I used a swing-glass because the swing action is very true, and as my apparatus was merely a provisional working model made of soft wood, I {{did not like to}} use sliding arrangements which might not have acted truly, or I should certainly have employed a slide with a rectangular glass prism, on account of the perfect reflection it affords. And let me say, that a prism of 2 inches square in the side is quite large enough <b>for</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>purposes,</b> <b>for</b> it is only the face of the portrait that is wanted to be seen. I chose my looking-glass carefully, and selected a piece that was plane and parallel. It has not too high a polish, and therefore does not give troublesome double reflections. In fact, it answers very respectably, especially when we consider that perfection of definition is thrown away on composites. I thought of a mirror silvered {{on the front of the}} glass, but this would soon tarnish in the gaslight, so I did not try it. For safety against the admission of light unintentionally, I have a cap to the focusing-screen in the roof, and a slide in the fixed body of the instrument immediately behind the reflector and before the dark slide. Neither of these would be wanted if the reflector was replaced by a prism, set into one end of a sliding block that had a large horizontal hole at the other end, and a sufficient length of solid wood between the two to block out the passage of light both upwards and downwards whenever the block is passing through the half-way position.|$|R

Materials and Methods: In a case-control study, one hundred consecutive hemodialysis patientsreferred to Hemodialysis center of Noor hospital, Isfahan, were selected based on the inclusive andexclusive criteria and compared to one hundred normal people randomly selected from populationvisiting inpatients and they were matched with case group. Data collected by using a demographicquestionnaire and the Jalowiec Coping Scale, and then MANCOVA and co-variance were used toanalyze the data. Results: The findings of MANCOVA showed significant difference between two groups in copingstyles (P= 0. 0001). Also, the results of covariance indicated significant differences in three copingstyles including confrontive coping style (P= 0. 0001), evasive coping style (P= 0. 002) and palliativecoping style (P= 0. 001). However, there was no significant difference in other coping styles betweentwo groups. Conclusion: Generally, the findings confirmed that the hemodialysis patients have low tendency touse confrontive coping style. The commonly used coping strategies among the hemodialysis patientsin deal with stresses are evasive and palliative coping styles. Thus, it seems that the hemodialysispatients deal with challenges due to their illness and treatment predominately by using emotionorientedcoping styles. The findings emphasis the role of hemodialysis patients` psychologicalappraisal from challenges due to their illness and treatment, or new concept called “illnessrepresentation” in coping styles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Lasso, the Forward Stagewise {{regression}} and the Lars {{are closely}} related procedures recently proposed for linear regression problems. Each of them can produce sparse models {{and can be used}} both for estimation and variable selection. In practical implementations these algorithms are typically tuned to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. We show that, when the prediction accuracy is used as the criterion to choose the tuning parameter, in general these procedures are not consistent in terms of variable selection. That is, the sets of variables selected are not consistent at finding the true set of important variables. In particular, we show that for any sample size n, when there are superfluous variables in the linear regression model and the design matrix is orthogonal, the probability of the procedures correctly identifying the true set of important variables is less than a constant (smaller than one) not depending on n. This result is also shown to hold for two dimensional problems with general correlated design matrices. The results indicate that in problems where the main goal is variable selection, prediction accuracy based criteria alone are not sufficient <b>for</b> this <b>purpose.</b> <b>Adjustments</b> will be discussed to make the Lasso and relate...|$|R
