5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are <b>skimmed</b> off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be <b>skimmed</b> off.|$|E

50|$|The {{first ever}} inland skimboard event and {{competition}} {{was put on}} by GoSkate skate shop in 1985 at a <b>skim</b> spot named Rio located along the American River in Sacramento, California. The second inland skimboard event, <b>Skim</b> Fest, occurred in 1997 and was also held in Sacramento along the American River at a popular <b>skim</b> spot known as Paradise Beach. <b>Skim</b> Fest was created by <b>skim</b> pioneers Launie Porteous and Mark Robinson and the event has evolved into an annual competition since 1998 to present. It now holds the title as the longest running inland <b>skim</b> competition in the world.|$|R

5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in <b>skimmed</b> milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|On October3, {{the center}} of Onil <b>skimmed</b> the {{coastline}} of northwestern India; however, the center did not cross land. Around this time, the upper-level circulation detached from the low-level circulation, further weakening the storm. Early on October4, the JTWC stated that the system had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system. After executing a counter-clockwise loop, the depression slowly tracked south-southeastward, away from land. By October7, the system was reclassified as a tropical depression by the JTWC as it stalled several hundred kilometres southwest of Gujarat, India. The system maintained a relatively low intensity for the following several days before making landfall near Porbandar with winds of 45km/h (30mph). Within hours of moving inland, Onil dissipated early on October10.|$|E

40|$|Despite its prominence, {{especially}} in academic reading, <b>skimming</b> is much under researched {{with very few}} research papers devoted to it, of which only two are L 2 - related. Such research as there is suggests that <b>skimming</b> {{is most likely to}} be effective when the text is predictable, familiar and simple (in terms of content, structure, language or any combination of these). This study considers <b>skimming</b> within an L 2 context (specifically, <b>skimming</b> for the IELTS test). In particular, it investigates the specific characteristics of <b>skimming.</b> In addition, it considers the relationship between <b>skim</b> reading texts with familiar and unfamiliar content. The pedagogy-focused enquiry consists of an analysis of the way 14 textbooks cover <b>skimming</b> and a further analysis of 92 questionnaire responses from IELTS teachers. The learner-focused enquiry analyses 16 verbal protocols, collected from participants who had read texts with familiar and unfamiliar content. The textbooks examined implied that <b>skimming</b> is extremely useful for IELTS candidates, though there was no unanimity about the speed of <b>skimming</b> or its operationalisation. Similarly, the teachers surveyed almost unanimously endorsed the value of <b>skimming</b> for test-takers but varied greatly in their methods of teaching and even in their understanding {{of the extent to which}} it can be taught. Analysis of the verbal protocols revealed a number of strategies that were used by <b>skim</b> readers, a comparison with Anderson's (1991) list of strategies for normal reading indicating the particular emphasis of <b>skim</b> readers on time-saving and gist-yielding strategies. Comparison of quantitative data showed no major differences in scores between <b>skimming</b> texts of familiar and unfamiliar content, although the participants' perception of difference, with the text with unfamiliar content being perceived as far more difficult, was acute. It was concluded that there is a continuum from normal reading to skimming: thus <b>skimming</b> is a variant of normal reading and not a separate process from it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{document}} <b>skimming</b> environment for surveying documents in our research. Although {{there are a}} lot of on-line documents on our surroundings, people, generally, prefer printing out on-line research papers from computer screen. For this reason, although <b>skimming</b> is used for reading documents in our daily life, it is difficult for us to <b>skim</b> documents from computer screens. Therefore, we developed a document <b>skimming</b> environment. The environment has a <b>skimming</b> support system and a recommendation system. The <b>skimming</b> support system supports <b>skimming</b> documents from computer screens by the interface, which is applied the Fisheye effect and the Overview+detail effect. Focus points of the Fisheye effect are the sentences selected by the original sentence extraction algorithm based on the value of standard distribution, and the Overview interface is displayed automatically the generated table of contents. The recommendation system generates personalized summaries by the collaborate filtering, which use users' log of the <b>skimming</b> support system. Furthermore, evaluation results show as follows; The value of F-measure of our sentence extraction algorithm is higher than it of the sentence extraction algorithm based on TF or Japanese lexical chaining method, the <b>skimming</b> support system is more effective method to <b>skim</b> documents from computer screen than paper, and the <b>skimming</b> support environment is more effective method to product research proposal documents than paper...|$|R
5|$|Bradman {{initially}} {{struggled against}} the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly <b>skimmed</b> past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|Still annoyed {{about the}} town's lack of {{understanding}} of the monorail, Marge visits Lanley to question his motives, and discovers a notebook containing drawings which reveal Lanley’s intention to run off with bags of money <b>skimmed</b> from the monorail project while everyone else falls victim to his faulty train. Marge immediately drives to North Haverbrook, which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser of one of his monorails. She discovers that the town is in ruins. While exploring, Marge meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook monorail. Cobb explains that Lanley embezzled construction funds through shoddy workmanship and materials, and that the entire project was a scam. Realizing Marge believes him, he offers his assistance in helping to prevent the same fate from happening to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|The stern section {{remained}} aground, but did {{not pose}} a significant oil spill threat as {{the majority of the}} oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some remaining oil that was found on board was <b>skimmed</b> or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a ship breaking contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of the stern, their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed the stern should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging the stern removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that readers {{spend a great deal of}} time <b>skim</b> reading on the Web and that if readers <b>skim</b> read they reduce their comprehension of what they have read. There have been a number of studies exploring <b>skim</b> reading, but relatively little exists on the <b>skim</b> reading of hypertext and Webpages. In the experiment documented here, we utilised eye tracking methodology to explore how readers <b>skim</b> read hypertext and how hyperlinks affect reading behaviour. The results show that the readers read faster when they were <b>skim</b> reading and comprehension was reduced. However, the presence of hyperlinks seemed to assist the readers in picking out important information when <b>skim</b> reading. We suggest that readers engage in an adaptive information foraging strategy where they attempt to minimise comprehension loss while maintaining a high reading speed. Readers use hyperlinks as markers to suggest important information and use them to read through the text in an efficient and effective way. This suggests that <b>skim</b> reading may not be as damaging to comprehension when reading hypertext, but it does mean that the words we choose to hyperlink become very important to comprehension for those <b>skim</b> reading text on the Web...|$|R
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it <b>skimmed</b> the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of <b>skimmed</b> milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
