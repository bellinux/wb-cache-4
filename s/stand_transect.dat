40|$|The main aims of biogeographical {{research}} of ecotones in Trkmanka river catchment (the south-eastern {{part of the}} Czech Republic) {{is to examine the}} state and distribution of ecotones in the natural and cultural landscape, to carry out their typology and to propose their optimal distribution. The investigation performed suggests that the actual ecotones net in agricultural landscape has a greater density than the convergent and divergent borders among natural biocoenoses. The man-made ecotonal lines are typically dominated by ruderal species. Surprisingly, xerothermal ecotonal lines with high species diversity developed on 30 -year-old terraced slopes. Consequent phytocoenological and faunistic investigation on <b>stand</b> <b>transects</b> will contribute to precise typology and identification of ecotones...|$|R
30|$|Structural {{attributes}} {{were obtained}} from 10 0.01  ha circular plots in each of two T. occidentalis forest stands (n[*]=[*] 20 plots). Plot centroids were established every 10  m along a randomly placed <b>transect</b> in each <b>stand.</b> Each <b>transect</b> was situated at the mid-slope position and parallel to slope contours to avoid forest and environmental transitions. Two transects were adequate for data collection because both stands were oblong in extent and located on steep slopes. In each plot, species, diameter at breast height (dbh[*]=[*] 1.4  m) of all stems[*]≥[*] 2.5  cm dbh, and snag abundance were recorded. The point-quarter method was used at plot centroids to systematically select canopy trees for the collection of increment cores (Cottam and Curtis 1956). In some cases steep terrain restricted sampling to trees that could be safely cored at breast height. A total of 42 trees were examined in this research.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Species composition, detritus, {{and soil}} data from 97 boreal forest <b>stands</b> along a <b>transect</b> in central Canada were {{analysed}} using Correspondence Analysis {{to determine the}} dominant environmental/site variables that differentiate these forest stands. Picea mariana stands were densely clustered together on the understorey DCA plot, suggesting a consistent understorey species composition (feather mosses and Erica-ceae), whereas Populus tremuloides stands had the most di-verse understorey species composition (ca. 30 species, mostly shrubs and herbs). Pinus banksiana stands had several charac-teristic species of reindeer lichens (Cladina spp.), but saplings and Pinus seedlings were rare. Although climatic variables showed large variation along the transect, the CCA results indicated that site conditions are more important in determining species composition and differentiating the stand types.

40|$|Forest {{regeneration}} can be inhibited by {{competition for}} environmental resources (water, nutrients, light) between tree seedlings and some competitive {{species that are}} generally light-demanding species developing in gaps. The study's aim was to quantify the development of two competitive species (Rubus idaeus and Cytisus scoparius) present in the chaine des Puys, France, relatively to light in gaps inside Picea abies <b>stands.</b> On 29 <b>transects</b> linking the <b>stand</b> to the gap centre (223 points), light intensity was measured (0 - 80 % of relative light) and floristic measurements (cover and height of the different species) were done. Development of both competitive species is positively connected to fight, with a bell-shaped curve with a maximum of 40 - 50 % for R. idaeus and a quite constant increase to 80 % (maximum of light recorded in the experimentation) for C scoparius. These results are discussed relatively to understorey vegetation management in order to favour forest regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{management}} directly {{influences the}} population dynamics of tree species, like Copaifera spp. (copaíba), which provide oil-resin with ecological and economic importance. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in Pará state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were selected in managed and unmanaged <b>stands.</b> A <b>transect</b> of 10 × 100 m was centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration. Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011 and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in managed than unmanaged stands. About 5 % of Copaifera regeneration was found between 45 – 50 m from the Copaifera tree while ~ 73 % of regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} forest expansion, dynamics and recolonization of former crop lands, fallows and hayfields in a mountainous area (Corte Pogallo - 777 m s. l. m.) located within Val Grande National Park (VB - Italy). The site has been characterized by mountainous forests for ages, until the beginning of XXth century, when a timbering company was settled there. The whole area has been hardly deforested until the 1960, when the settlement has been completely abandoned. By matching historical (1954, 2000) aerial photographs with several test plots on the ground, the dynamic evolution of the area at the study site was analyzed using a multi-scale sampling method. To assess the <b>stand</b> structure, two <b>transects</b> were established starting from the crop fields (occurring at the valley floor) up to the beech coppice stand (occurring along the mountain slope). A mixed composition of pioneer forest species and fruit trees was found at the ecotone, while pioneer species became more and more dominant along the slope up to the beech coppice stand (the former forest margin before abandonment). Using a GIS software, pinpoint sample data and historical aerial photographs were combined and compared. Maps of land-use change revealed that forests have recolonized about 71...|$|R
40|$|AbstractForest {{ecosystem}} dynamics {{emerges from}} nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i. e., individual trees) {{and their relationship}} with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly {{in the context of}} rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality {{for a wide range of}} forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63. 4 % of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged <b>stands.</b> This <b>transect</b> experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} coastal bio-geomorphologic units and zonation {{patterns}} of coral reefs and mangroves and their bio-geomorphologic boundaries {{as determined by}} tidal levels was undertaken. 20 transects were surveyed at 6 different coral reef and mangrove study sites on the tropical coast of southern China. 14 transects were undertaken at 4 mangrove <b>stands,</b> and 6 <b>transects</b> were carried out at 2 fringing coral reef sites. Bio-geomorphologic units and zonation patterns of coral reefs and mangroves were established based on a comprehensive biophysical survey, including biological, geomorphologic, sedimentary, and hydrodynamic surveys, and a diving survey on the reef slope along coral reef transects. Typical bio-geomorphologic units include inner reef flat, outer reef flat and reef slope on fringing reefs, and mangrove flat on mangrove coast. Each is distinguished by biological community distributions, landforms, sediments and hydrodynamic conditions. The bio-geomorphologic boundaries of fringing reefs and mangroves were determined by leveling surveys along each transect and local tidal observation. The upper limit for the flat coral growth between inner and outer reef flats is Mean Lower Low Water of tropic tide. The limit for hard coral growth from scattered to luxuriant, {{as well as the}} break of slope from reef flat to reef slope, is the Theoretical Lowest Tide. The lower and upper limit of mangrove flats were the Mean Sea Level (or slightly above) and the Mean Higher High Water Level respectively. It seems that tidal level is a control factor for bio-geomorphologic zonation of fringing reefs and mangroves. The study results assist understanding of the structure, function and management of tropical biological coasts...|$|R

Rubni efekt u neofitskoj vegetaciji prikazan je s dva transekta. Također je istraživana povezanost navedenih neofita i pojedinih ptičjih vrsta. Brojnost i dominantnost trstenjaka mlakara (Acrocephalus palustris) ukazuje na to da neolitska vegetacija tvori najvažniju ekološku nišu za gniježđenje ove ptice u istraživanom području sjeverozapadne Hrvatske. Nešto slabije su zastupljene grmuša pjenica (Sylvia communis) i batić kovač (Saxicola torquata). On {{the basis}} of {{investigations}} of 12 <b>stands</b> and two <b>transects,</b> structural characteristics of the vegetation of Solidago gigantea and Helianthus tuberosus are described. As {{a result of the}} edge effect both communities are penetrated by various plant species, and thus the parts on the edges are characterized by higher diversity and equitability. The diversity and equitability decrease from the edge to the central parts of the stands. In the central (inner) parts of the vegetation only one species predominates, which by close interlacement of its roots, by the shade it casts and by allelopathic interactions prevents the growth and development of other plant species. Therefore, owing to less shade and less dense root system the marginal parts become places of the most intense succession of vegetation. Owing to its plant habitus and structural simplicity, the neophyte vegetation offers the possibility of nesting to very specific bird species, such as Acrocephalus palustris. Nesting birds of the species Sylvia communis, and at later stages also Sylvia atricapilla, Phylloscopus tro- chilus, Luscinia megarhynchos and others are found in the niches made by horizontal vegetational structures. Higher succession intensity and richer vegetation cover of the horizontal structures increase the number of bird species and consequently the diversity and equitability of the bird communities. However, with the disappearance of the neophyte vegetation, the predominance of the species Acrocephalus palustris decreases...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of spatial patterns of plant species diversity and {{the factors that}} drive those patterns is critical {{for the development of}} appropriate biodiversity management in forest ecosystems. We studied the spatial organization of plants species in human- modified and managed oak forests (primarily, Quercus faginea) in the Central Pre- Pyrenees, Spain. To test whether plant community assemblages varied non-randomly across the spatial scales, we used multiplicative diversity partitioning based on a nested hierarchical design of three increasingly coarser spatial scales (<b>transect,</b> <b>stand,</b> region). To quantify the importance of the structural, spatial, and topographical characteristics of stands in patterning plant species assemblages and identify the determinants of plant diversity patterns, we used canonical ordination. We observed a high contribution of ˟-diversity to total -diversity and found ˟-diversity to be higher and ˞-diversity to be lower than expected by random distributions of individuals at different spatial scales. Results, however, partly depended on the weighting of rare and abundant species. Variables expressing the historical management intensities of the stand such as mean stand age, the abundance of the dominant tree species (Q. faginea), age structure of the stand, and stand size were the main factors that explained the compositional variation in plant communities. The results indicate that (1) the structural, spatial, and topographical characteristics of the forest stands have the greatest effect on diversity patterns, (2) forests in landscapes that have different land use histories are environmentally heterogeneous and, therefore, can experience high levels of compositional differentiation, even at local scales (e. g., within the same stand). Maintaining habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales should be considered in the development of management plans for enhancing plant diversity and related functions in human-altered forest...|$|R
40|$|Title: Regeneration and Propagation of S. birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. Tree in Rashad Area at Nuba Mountains – South Kordofan State, Sudan A multi-location {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} for two seasons (2005 – 2006) to study the germination, establishment and survival of S. birrea artificially and in the natural state at Rashad locality (latitudes 10 ° and 13 ° N and longitudes 29 ° and 33 ° E), Nuba mountains, South Kordofan State. Three {{experiments were}} conducted in the above area. The first experiment was the assessment of natural regeneration of the species under natural <b>stand</b> where <b>transect</b> methodology was used. The second experiment consisted of the species regeneration by seed broadcasting in unploughed and protected land. The third experiment consisted of S. birrea regeneration by direct seed sowing and seedling transplantation in pits in land prepared by ploughing and/or furrowing. The results concerning the natural assessment indicated that {{there were significant differences}} between sites, aspects and elevations, in measured parameters (total number of trees, number of S. birrea trees, and survival rate). South Rashad site was richer than east Rashad concening the total tree density and the number of S. birrea trees and also the S. birrea seedling survival was higher in this site. The east aspect showed better seedlings survival rate than the other three aspects. The result showed that the middle altitude was the best in germination than the top and the bottom elevations. However, Seedling survival was better in the bottom location than in the higher elevations. Generally, S. birrea seedling survival did not exceed 10 % under natural conditions. x For the seed broadcasting experiment, S. birrea seed germination and seedling survival were better on the plateau than on the plain. Here S. birrea seedling survival reached up to 30 % in the plateau. With regard to direct seed sowing experiment, the result showed that all the soil preparation levels enhanced seed germination, so that hundred percent seed germination was obtained within a period of month. Significant differences were observed for the seedlings height and diameter between the treatments. The best seedling growth performance was occurred in the PF treatment for all the measured parameters. Seedling survival in these treatments ranged between 56 % and 78 %. Concerning the seedling transplantation treatments, the result showed that, there were significant differences in seedling height and diameter between NP and the two other treatments, while {{there were no significant differences}} in the parameters between P and PF treatments. The best seedling growth was recorded for the PF treatment. Seedling survival in these treatments ranged between 56 % and 86 %. In conclusion, S. birrea can be artificially well established by seeds or seedlings in protected and prepared land, particularly in ploughed and furrowed land. Concerning the site characteristics, this species is well established in the eastern aspect, mid-elevation and locations with good drainage. Natural establishment of the species is difficult because of its poor growth and susceptibility to damage by many factors and agents. To achieve a satisfactory establishment of this species in all cases good protection in all growth stages is obligator...|$|R
40|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} mutualism {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} and most influential of all terrestrial symbioses. As the primary method used by most plants to acquire nutrients from the soil, mycorrhizal fungi help to shape the structure and composition of many ecosystems. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi play an especially significant role because most EM fungi prefer a limited number of host taxa, and EM plant species likewise associate with {{only a fraction of the}} available EM fungi. This host preference issue, combined with the high diversity of EM fungi in forest ecosystems, complicates interspecies competition both among fungi and among plants, because these plant and fungal communities interact. Despite recent attempts at documenting mycorrhizal fungi in the context of ecological succession, many questions remain about the underlying causal relationships among EM fungi, soil conditions, and plant community assembly. The succession of mycorrhizal fungi often mirrors the succession of plants, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) community composition may affect the outcome of competition among trees during succession. In a pine-oak seral system, we tested the ability of Pinus taeda and Quercus alba seedlings to associate with EM fungi when planted under both conspecific and heterospecific adults. We found that EM communities under pine and oak canopy were distinct regardless of seedling identity, indicating that the fungal associations of adult trees determine which EM species are available in the soil. In addition, pine seedlings planted under oak canopy showed decreased mycorrhization and growth compared to those planted under pine canopy, while oak seedlings showed no negative effects of heterospecific planting. This impaired ability of pine seedlings to associate with the EM community established under oaks may deter pine recruitment and facilitate the late-seral replacement of pines with oaks. While EM fungal communities correlate with the dominant species of host tree, soil properties do as well, making it difficult to establish causality among these three variables. Soil was collected from oak- and pine-dominated stands and dried to kill off mature mycelium, leaving only the spore bank as a source of inoculum for pine and oak seedlings. EM root tips were collected for molecular identification of fungal species based on ITS barcoding, and soil samples from field and laboratory conditions were analyzed for fungal diversity using 454 sequencing. We found a reduced influence of canopy type and a more pronounced influence of seedling identity when compared to the EM communities on seedlings planted in the field, suggesting that adult trees do alter the availability of fungi by directly promoting the growth of their preferred EM associates. The availability of EM fungi can also affect seedlings at the interface between EM- an AM-dominated forest. We tested the hypothesis that seedlings of Dicymbe corymbosa which recruit outside of monodominant stands have limited access to EM symbionts compared with those which recruit inside D. corymbosa stands. EM root tips and rhizosphere soil were collected from seedlings along two <b>transects</b> inside monodominant <b>stands</b> and three <b>transects</b> in the transition zone into mixed forest dominated by AM associates. Seedlings inside monodominant stands yielded both a greater quantity of mycorrhized root tips and a higher diversity of EM species than transition zone seedlings. Of the fungal families commonly found on adult roots, the Boletaceae were notably underrepresented on all seedlings. In the transition zones, high-throughput sequencing of soil also detected a decrease in EM diversity with distance from the parent tree. Seedlings of D. corymbosa may benefit from recruiting within monodominant stands by tapping into common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) to acquire low-cost nitrogen and, potentially, photosynthates produced by conspecific adults. Leaves of stand adults, stand seedlings, and mixed-forest seedlings were collected for stable isotope analysis to track the transfer of nitrogen and carbon through CMNs. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N results contradicted each other, suggesting that more complicated interactions may be playing out among adults, seedlings, and fungi. Dissertatio...|$|R
