40|$|Abstract—Identification {{of small}} {{electrical}} appliances via power consumption requires accurate detection {{and evaluation of}} steady-state <b>sections</b> and transient <b>sections.</b> However, the steady-state <b>sections</b> and transient <b>sections</b> are extracted from low frequency sampled (1 Hz) power measurements. We gain the steady-state <b>sections</b> and transient <b>sections</b> by processing real and reactive power measurements with a robust bucketing technique and unsupervised clustering. Macroscopic features for detected steady-state <b>sections</b> and transient <b>sections</b> are then extracted. Besides, our method estimates the similarity of steady-state <b>sections</b> and transient <b>sections</b> and determines recurred <b>sections</b> accurately. The proposed method is applicable for an inexpensive, unsupervised learning of small electrical appliances in real time...|$|R

5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as <b>Section</b> A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, <b>Section</b> B was added. In the first stud books, the <b>Section</b> B was the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the Welsh Cob was <b>Section</b> C and <b>Section</b> D. The upper height limit for <b>Section</b> D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply <b>Section</b> C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered the Welsh Cob so valuable that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in <b>Section</b> C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E

50|$|The ER2 {{trainset}} {{consists of}} 2-car <b>sections,</b> {{each of which}} includes a power car and a trailer (either a driving trailer with an engineer's cab on one end, or an intermediate trailer without an engineer's cab). <b>Sections</b> with a driving trailer are called head sections; those with an intermediate trailer are called intermediate <b>sections.</b> The <b>sections</b> cannot operate independently; the minimum train length is 2 head <b>sections,</b> and the maximum is 6 <b>sections</b> (2 head <b>sections</b> and 4 intermediate <b>sections),</b> with a train 5 <b>sections</b> long (2 head and 3 intermediate) considered standard. Coupling more than 6 <b>sections</b> is unsafe due to overloading of motor-generators which power the engineer's controls.

5|$|<b>Section</b> 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from <b>Section</b> 5 preclearance in several ways.

Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from <b>Section</b> 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
