500|$|Early in her career, her {{prominent}} {{breasts were}} considered problematic, {{and led to}} her losing her first professional assignment—an advertising campaign for General Electric that depicted young women in bathing suits relaxing around a pool. Emmeline Snively, head of the Blue Book Model Agency, sent her to photographer Gene Lester, which led to her short-lived assignment in the General Electric commercial. In 1954, she auditioned at both Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. for a part in The Seven Year Itch, but failed to impress. She also auditioned at Paramount for Joan of Arc—a project that was never completed—and failed again. That year, she landed her first acting assignment in Lux Video Theatre, a series on CBS (An Angel Went AWOL, October 21, 1954). In the show, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the piano and delivered a few lines of dialogue for $300 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 2010, Gaga {{performed}} the song at the MAC AIDS Fund Pan-Asia Viva Glam launch in Tokyo where {{she wore a}} doily lace dress. She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in talcum powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over {{in one corner of the}} stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames pouring out of the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher from ABC News called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio. In May 2011, Gaga {{performed the}} song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the royal}} couple's favored {{craftsmen}} and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted {{the king and}} queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her dressing table. In 1788 the royal couple visited the Worcester Porcelain Factory (founded in 1751, and later to be known as Royal Worcester), where Queen Charlotte ordered a porcelain service that was later renamed [...] "Royal Lily" [...] in her honour. Another well-known porcelain service designed and named in her honour was the [...] "Queen Charlotte" [...] pattern.|$|E

2500|$|... {{reports that}} the Reubenite On son of Peleth joined Korah's conspiracy, but the text does not mention On again. Rav {{explained}} that On's wife saved him, arguing to him that no matter whether Moses or Korah prevailed, On would remain just a disciple. On replied that he had sworn to participate. So On's wife got him drunk with wine, and laid him down in their tent. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the entrance of their tent and loosened her hair, so that whoever came to summon him saw her and retreated {{at the sight of}} her immodestly loosened hair. The Gemara taught that [...] refers to On's wife when it says: [...] "Every wise woman builds her house."–10a1.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> home, sad and hungry, when a {{neighbour}} {{knocked at}} the door.|$|E

60|$|Another day <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> sunset whilst he was {{painting}} some pine-trees which caught the red glare from the west. He had been quiet.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} three-o'clock train {{back to the}} city. At nine <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the round table for dinner in the Café André. Nearly the same crowd was there.|$|E
60|$|<b>SHE</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the window}} {{watching}} the evening invade the avenue. Her head was {{leaned against the}} window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> {{him like}} a woman turned to stone. There was incredulity in her eyes, incredulity and horror.|$|R
6000|$|Unwittingly, I had {{hit upon}} a {{sovereign}} remedy for her tears. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>at</b> once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Oh, yes,' said I; 'she was {{pointing}} out those passes through which people {{go into the}} next county. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the other end of}} the table, didn't she? She was dressed in black.' ...|$|E
60|$|At length she thrust {{him from}} her and, taking {{him by the}} hand, {{led him to the}} seat beneath the elms, and bade him sit at one end of it, while <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the other.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>at</b> {{the table}} when he came out. She {{explained}} as she showed him his seat, [...] "Father and my aunt had breakfast long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not evident}} that Hetty quite {{understood}} him, for <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> {{the fire with}} hands crossed in her lap, and Sewell turned to Tomlinson.|$|R
60|$|Saying this, {{she drew}} {{him into a}} neat little {{apartment}} opening on the verandah, where <b>she</b> generally <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her sewing, within call of her mistress.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Louis,' said Mary Ponsonby, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> work {{beside him}} that afternoon, after an {{expedition}} to the new house at Dynevor Terrace, 'I want to know, if you please, how you have been acting like a gentleman.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his feet. He {{was still}} in the easy-chair into which he had sunk on his first coming into the room. He had been {{speaking}} in the House late, amidst all the excitement of a political crisis.|$|E
60|$|And so {{this second}} Calypso of a lovely isle set herself almost as unblushingly as her {{prototype}} {{to get our}} very unheroic Ulysses into her toils. And Penelope, poor Penelope, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> home and span, and defied her would-be lovers.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> {{the tiny}} bureau which filled one corner. When she looked round with the {{finished}} note Fleur was still touching the poppies with her gloved finger.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> and gazed <b>at</b> him awfully, her lips parted.|$|R
60|$|His answer {{softened}} her a little, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> him steadlly {{as he went}} on. The tears {{began to}} roll slowly down her cheeks. Her hands were clenched.|$|R
60|$|Nigel told {{to the old}} Knight {{all that}} had occurred, saying little of his own success and much of his own failure, yet {{the eyes of the}} dark woman burned the {{brighter}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her tapestry and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will begin}} at once, and show them that I don't mean to shirk my duty, though I do want to be nice," [...] thought she, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> supper one night and looked about her, {{planning}} her first move.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} loitered slowly [...] By the house {{three times that}} day; [...] She took her bird from the window: [...] "He need not look this way." [...] <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> her piano long, [...] And sighed, and played a death-sad song.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'm not {{drinking}} brandy,' she replied, and she sprinkled {{the last}} drops of her liqueur over his face. He gave an odd squeal. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> him, as if indifferent.|$|R
60|$|A smile, even, hovered on {{her mouth}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the breakfast-table, in the pretty negligee she had worn all night, and poured out Miss Lynde's coffee for her.|$|R
