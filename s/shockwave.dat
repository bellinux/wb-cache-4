5|$|Starscream, {{having been}} humiliated {{at the hands}} of Megatron, infiltrates Shockwave's towers and sabotages his lab equipment. In the lab he finds Grimlock being held prisoner. He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into the restraint controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named Hardshell, Kickback and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from <b>Shockwave</b> that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, <b>Shockwave</b> also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He recalls a name that Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that <b>Shockwave</b> has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to <b>Shockwave,</b> biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and <b>Shockwave</b> in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E
5|$|The Riddler's Revenge {{is one of}} four Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} at Six Flags Magic Mountain, joining , Scream, and Tatsu. The coaster is the park's second stand-up coaster; the first was a smaller coaster manufactured by Intamin, <b>Shockwave,</b> which operated from 1986 to 1988. <b>Shockwave</b> was relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure, preceding the installation of Green Lantern (Chang after being rethemed and relocated).|$|E

40|$|A {{seismograph}} {{was used}} {{in a series of}} tests to measure the <b>shockwaves</b> produced in the snowpack from the detonation of explosives. Two different explosives commonly used in avalanche work were tested. Different shot placements in relation to the snow surface were compared, different types of snowpack were compared, and different size charges were compared. The results showed that a two pound cast Pentolite booster and a 3 x 8 cartridge of ammonia gelatin dynamite produced almost identical <b>shockwaves.</b> Air blasts were shown to produce slightly larger <b>shockwaves</b> than surface blasts. While buried shots produced much smaller <b>shockwaves</b> than air or surface blasts. A charge detonated 25 cm (10 inches) below the snow surface produced <b>shockwaves</b> of approximately half the amplitude of a surface or air blast. Ground waves were shown to be insignificant, even when charges were detonated on the ground surface. When comparing different snowpacks, the results show that <b>shockwaves</b> penetrate deeper with less attenuation into a harder snowpack, than they do into a softer less dense snowpack. When comparing different size charges, it was shown that doubling the shot size would approximately double the area that was affected by the <b>shockwaves</b> to the same degree...|$|R

5|$|Skywatch, {{having lost}} control of Ravage and Laserbeak due to {{interference}} from Soundwave, reactivate Grimlock to use against the increasing Transformer activity. Due to Machination sabotage Grimlock escapes and is approached by Scorponok, who proposes an alliance. Grimlock refuses and is out gunned in the battle, but teleports to the Dynobot ship before Scorponok terminates him, still buried after the battle with <b>Shockwave,</b> vowing to bring the Machination down. Skywatch reactivate the other Dynobots, unaware the Machination are manipulating them into killing Grimlock. Finding the Skyfire, the Headmasters attack and manage to teleport Grimlock to Fallon, Nevada, {{in the midst of}} a pitched battle. Skywatch respond by moving in the other Dynobots as both Hot Rod and the combined form of Hunter and Sunstreaker locate the Machination. Hot Rod is almost killed by Scorponok, but kept alive as a witness to the Headmaster's plans. The battle in Fallon devastates the town, but the Dynobots are able to reassert their personalities. Scorponok sends in his Headmaster army as Skywatch head agent Red, now suspicious of the repeated control failures on the Transformers, confers with <b>Shockwave,</b> fitting him with a bomb and directing him to eliminate the Dynobots, Ravage and Laserbeak. In Fallon, the infighting Dynobots manage to fight off the Headmasters with aid from Grimlock's allies the Monsterbots. Hot Rod manages to escape as Sunstreaker and Hunter locate the main Machination facility, while <b>Shockwave</b> locates the stasis locked Soundwave, making a deal with him to deactivate the bomb in his head in return for freeing Soundwave from stasis lock. Sunstreaker saves Hot Rod (who then sends a distress call) but is blasted by Scorponok as the Dynobots and Monsterbots launch a full-scale assault on the Machination. Outclassed by the sheer numbers of Headmasters, they are saved when a grieving Hunter pulls the plug on Sunstreaker's original head, seemingly killing him and disabling the Machination forces. However, a vengeful Scorponok and the newly arrived <b>Shockwave</b> attack as Ultra Magnus, still searching for Scorponok, receives Hot Rod's signal. <b>Shockwave</b> and Scorponok battle each other. The Headmaster loses but Grimlock, finally accepting responsibility for his actions, battles <b>Shockwave,</b> and the other Dinobots aid him. Scorponok is permanently taken out when Hot Rod and Swoop disable his original head. Grimlock brings down the Machination compound on top of him and <b>Shockwave</b> as Magnus arrives to clean up the situation. Grimlock is arrested along with <b>Shockwave</b> and Scorponok, but the other Dinobots are no longer under suspicion, and repair the Skyfire to leave.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — <b>Shockwave</b> intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army <b>Shockwave</b> summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead Brainstorm. Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his new friend, Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws <b>Shockwave</b> into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to lose control of his chronal drive, setting his mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. Horrified at what he has become, <b>Shockwave</b> allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jazz, Sideswipe and Cliffjumper track Grimlock's {{signature}} to the Sea of Rust {{to locate}} {{him and his}} Lightning Strike Coalition Force composed of Slug, Sludge, Snarl and Swoop. After exploring the area and eliminating dozens of Decepticons, Jazz and Cliffjumper find Sludge's dead body and an enormous tower in a lake of Energon firing a bright beam into Cybertron's orbit. They find the Decepticon scientist <b>Shockwave</b> at the scene and discover it is a Space Bridge. <b>Shockwave</b> escapes the ensuing confrontation, and Cliffjumper becomes trapped, leaving Jazz to fight off the incoming Insecticon swarm. Cliffjumper overloads the tower, and he and Jazz are saved from the Tower's explosion by Sideswipe. They report back to Optimus, Ironhide, Ratchet and Perceptor.|$|E

5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) are locked in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as the Covenant. During the events of the 2004 video game Halo 2, the Covenant discover the location of Earth and launch an assault on the city of New Mombasa in Africa. Though the UNSC manages to repel most of the fleet, a large ship hovers over the city, depositing an invasion force. The ship eventually retreats via a slipspace jump, creating a massive <b>shockwave.</b> While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the <b>shockwave,</b> while the Covenant still occupy the city.|$|E

5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} <b>Shockwave</b> {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack <b>Shockwave,</b> {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E

In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid the universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
