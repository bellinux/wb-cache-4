5000|$|Regions were {{implemented}} for {{a subset of}} Java, and became {{a critical component of}} memory management in Real time Java, which combines them with ownership types to demonstrate object encapsulation and eliminate runtime checks on region deallocation. More recently, a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>system</b> was proposed for inferring regions in embedded real-time Java applications, combining a compile-time static analysis, a runtime region allocation policy, and programmer hints. Regions are a good fit for real-time computing because their time overhead is statically predictable, without the complexity of incremental garbage collection.|$|E

50|$|Due to a {{delay in}} the MICNS secure data link, the first {{prototype}} system was produced in a Block I configuration. This system used the same air vehicle (minus the MICNS and automated landing system), the same hydraulic launcher, the same hydraulically operated recovery system, and same Ground Control System. This system used an unsecure interim data link and an alternate <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>system</b> to guide the air vehicle into the net. This system flew 17 flights during July-November 1982. This system was then assigned to an Army Early Operational Capability (EOC) unit from July 1983-July 1984 which conducted 20 flights. This EOC effort was created to provide the field with a system to identify any system weakness and provide the user to refine his tactics, techniques, and procedures for using the technology.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the manual {{plotting}} system used to track aircraft at {{the cave and}} elsewhere throughout Germany was too slow and inaccurate for the quick responses necessary. Beginning in 1962, airmen trained in the new 412L air weapons control system began to arrive in Germany and at the cave. Over the next year, the new GE <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>system</b> was installed. When complete at the cave, the current air picture over East and West Germany, as well as parts of the eastern soviet bloc countries, was displayed on a 40-foot by 40-foot (12 x 12 m)screen with radar information provided by various 412L sites located throughout Germany. Senior U.S. staff monitored the dynamic display 24/7. Over the next several years, additional 412L sites throughout Germany joined the network until the manual system had been totally replaced.|$|E
50|$|The Rotary <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>system</b> 7A {{was chosen}} for public {{experiment}} in 1912 by the French Administration Postes Télégraphes Téléphones. The first semi-automatic Rotary 7A (McBerty design) was turned on in Angers in November 1915, and the second in Marseille in 1919 (Marseille-Colbert I). Only two Rotary 7A semi-automatic were installed in France. All the other Rotary exchanges in France were 7A1 fully automatic (Gerald Deakin mechanics). In 1927, The semi-automatic Rotary 7A of Marseille-Colbert 1 was fully automated, maximum capacity lines 10,000. Angers stayed semi-automatic only, capacity approx 3,000 lines.Rotary fully automatic 7A1 was deployed in Nantes, Marseille-town and Paris and Region of Paris in large and exclusive proportion. All the French Rotary 7A and 7A1 were exclusively manufactured in France, with French workers, essentially by ITT-LMT company, and, in subsidiary by French Ericsson Society and Society Grammont.|$|E

40|$|A {{vigilance}} {{experiment was}} performed on the characteristics of visual monitoring behavior in complex tasks like those found in modern <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>systems.</b> The activationist hypothesis, which contends that human alertness is a function qf stimulation level, served as framework for the experiment.

Environmental stimulation was man@ulated by requiring s ix or thirty-six visual s+fimulus ources t o be monitored fo r a 3 % observation period. Response-produced stimulation was a function of response complexity. No vigilance decre-ment was found for per cent of signals correct @ detected.

50|$|A facelifted {{version of}} the Rover 200, renamed the Rover 25 (internal codename Jewel) was {{launched}} in autumn 1999 for the 2000 model year. This version used similar frontal styling to the larger 75 model. The chassis had been uprated to give sportier handling (suspension and steering setup from 200vi) and the front end had been restyled {{to give it the}} corporate Rover look first seen in the range-topping 75, a number of safety improvements and interior changes were made, but the 25 was instantly recognisable as a reworked 200 Series. The 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L petrol engines as well as the 2.0 L diesel were all carried over from the previous range. CVT automatic gearboxes were carried over from the R3 200, with 'Steptronic' (later 'Stepspeed' post-BMW demerger) <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>system</b> available from late 2000. R65 manual gearboxes were again carried over but were later superseded by Ford 'IB5' units in mid-2003.|$|E
50|$|The Benelli M3 is {{an updated}} version of the Benelli M1 shotgun. The M3 uses the same inertia recoil <b>{{semi-automatic}}</b> <b>system</b> as the earlier Benelli M1, but adds another Benelli-patented feature, which allows the shooter to lock the semi-automatic action and switch to the manually operated pump-action mode and back in the matter of seconds. The action type switch is located at the forward end of the forearm, and is formed as an annular knurled ring. Rotation of this ring either engages the action rods of the pump system and locks the semi-automatic recoil system, or disengages the action bars, locks the forearm and allows the inertia recoil system to operate the action automatically. This greatly improves the versatility of the shotgun, allowing it to fire low-powered ammunition (mostly of special purpose, such as less-lethal rubber or tear-gas projectiles) in the manually operated pump action mode, and to fire full power combat loads with slugs or buckshot in rapid semi-automatic mode. An underbarrel tubular magazine usually holds 8 rounds for police or military versions, or less in some civilian models.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the impact}} of coupling a manual correction module to automatic methods for counting objects in digital images, effectively turning them into <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>systems.</b> This study aims to show that completely automatic counting methods often cannot achieve enough accuracy for certain applications and under certain conditions, and that in many cases the introduction of manual corrections is advantageous, despite the impact of this on the time spent by the whole counting process. The paper presents a thorough comparison between fully automatic, fully manual and semiautomatic approaches, using images containing a variety of objects and characteristics, so those approaches could be tested under a wide range of conditions, from the simpler one to the most challenging. It is shown that, {{with the exception of a}} few specific situations, the semi-automatic approach is advantageous over the manual counting in terms of time, and over the automatic counting in terms of accuracy. The situations in which the automatic or manual approaches should be preferred are also described. Keywords-object counting, digital images, <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>systems.</b> I...|$|R
