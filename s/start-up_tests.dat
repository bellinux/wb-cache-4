40|$|The shear {{response}} of soft solids can be modeled with linear elasticity, provided the forcing {{is slow and}} weak. Both of these approximations must break down when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their (un) jamming point – suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near jamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs remains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of stress relaxation and shear <b>start-up</b> <b>tests</b> in athermal soft sphere packings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain amplitude, strain rate, distance to jamming, and system size, we identify characteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of linear elasticity closes, and relate these scales {{to changes in the}} microscopic contact network...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{previously}} conducted {{research shows that}} in the case of automotive engines wear accompanying engine start-ups has significant contribution to the total wear of cylinder liner. Thus, it was assumed that wear of the liner measured after high number of start-ups can be representative for given conditions of engine operation in the vehicle and can be used to forecast engine life. The paper describes a new method of automotive engine durability prediction on the basis of wear measured after so called <b>start-ups</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>start-ups</b> <b>test</b> consists of series of repeatable cycles during which engine is started-up in precisely established temperature and operates for short time with no load and then is shut down and cooled down.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Partial shading of PV arrays {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes for reduced energy yield of many PV systems. However, up to now very little {{attention}} has been drawn on assessing the performance of MPP trackers due to the complexity and extensive measurement equipment required for this purpose. Against this background, the presented work fills this gap by determining the actual impact of non-ideal, irregular conditions on MPPTs and develops solutions for improved performance. In total 13 MPPTs integrated in state-of-the-art PV inverters were tested with I/V curves measured at a real, shaded PV array. While all inverters have a very high MPPT accuracy under steady state, ideal conditions, shaded conditions led to difficulties as the MPPTs tend to keep a local maximum as long as it exists and are not able to recognise the evolution of another maximum on the I/V curve. This local maximum might not be the overall MPP. In total, this resulted in a reduction of energy yield during a whole simulated day of 1 % to 2 %. In addition, <b>start-up</b> <b>tests</b> with single partially shaded I/V curves showed very low MPP match which led to a power loss of up to 70 %...|$|E

They are being considered for cooling of military combat vehicles and for spinning spacecraft. In order to investigate the effect of an accelerating force on LHP operation, a miniature LHP was installed on a spin table. Variable accelerating forces were imposed on the LHP by spinning the table at different angular speeds. Several patterns of accelerating forces were applied, i. e. continuous spin at different speeds and periodic spin at different speeds and frequencies. The resulting accelerations ranged from 1. 17 g's to 4. 7 g's.

To monitor the electrical grid, Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) are used. Each PMU is individually equipped with a GPS-receiver to precisely timestamp the data relative to the official time UTC. During the test, it is also of interest to timestamp the measurement signals from individual hydropower generators to later compare with PMU-data, and thus study the power grids impact on the generator.   The aim is to work out an appropriate method to make these measurements and to build a data acquisition system, capable of timestamp data relative to UTC, from a generator in one of Vattenfalls hydroelectric power stations. The problem is that the generator is located in an underground station which hampers the reception of GPS-signals and wiring should be avoided if possible.   Time synchronization has been solved by using Vattenfalls network, which is synchronized by the network protocol NTP. The network includes the concerned hydropower stations and thus can wiring from the surface be avoided. The maximum error for the server in the specific hydroelectric power station is bounded within [- 4. 62, 3. 18] ms relative to UTC. The conclusion is that Vattenfalls NTP-network meets the requirements to distribute time.

When the start-up was finished, the removal rate of COD by the reactor was about 80 %. In the zone I, biogas mainly revealed carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen (H 2). Methane was the main component in the zone 2 which ranged from 53 % to 59 % with an average of 55 %. The methane content in biogas increased from the zone I to II. It indicated that the methane-producing capacity of the anaerobic sludge increased.

There were some differences between the activities of the sludge in the two reaction zones of the integrated two-phase anaerobic reactor. The activity of protease was higher in the reaction zone I.

Various approaches were undertaken to lower viscosity, reduce particle aggregation, and improve flow resistance with emphasis on the role of polymer superplasticizers on particle-particle and particle-polymer interactions. Particle jamming was found to be dependent on particle size distribution and superplasticizer concentration with shear <b>start-up</b> <b>tests</b> used to analyze the degree of flow hindrance. Particle networks and hydroclusters were hypothesized to form for narrow and wide particle size distributions, respectively, based on effective side-chain density and side-chain overlap. Furthermore, the impact of non-adsorbed polymers on superplasticizer-stabilized suspensions was examined in terms of depletion flocculation and depletion stabilization based on concentration. Flow curves demonstrated a viscosity increase at low concentrations (10 - 20 % based on weight percent of adsorbed polymer) while viscosity increases were seen for depletion-aggregating high concentrations (30 – 50 % based on weight percent of adsorbed polymer). Additionally, a new class of lignin-based polymer, lignopolymers, was studied for their viscosity-reducing potential as alternatives to the commercially available comb-polymer. Concentrations as low as 0. 25 mg/mL of the polyacrylamide lignopolymer were shown to lower viscosity as much as the 2. 7 mg/mL industrial comb-polymer.

40|$|Hybrid linear {{stepping}} motors (HLSMs) {{are regarded as}} an excellent solution to positioning systems that require a high accuracy and rapid acceleration. The advantages such as high efficiency, high throughput, mechanical simplicity, high reliability, precise open-loop operation, low inertia of the system, etc. have made this kind of motor more and more attractive in such applications as factory automation, high speed positioning, computer peripherals, {{numerically controlled machine tools}} and welding apparatus. This motor drive is especially suitable for machine tools in which the positioning accuracy and repeatability are the key problems. Using the microprocessor controlled microstepping mode, a smooth operation with standard resolution of a few hundred steps/mm can be obtained. Although rotating hybrid {{stepping motors}} are well covered· by literature, {{there are only a few}} papers on HLSMs published so far. The objective of this thesis is to apply the reluctance network approach (RNA) and the finite element method (FEM) to performance calculations of HLSMs. A comparison with the experimental measurements is done to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of these two methods. The static characteristics show that the FEM demonstrates a better correlation with the experimental results than the RNA. The reason is that some assumptions have been made in order to obtain a simplified model in the RNA. The RNA, in general, tends to overestimate the forces. In the case of instantaneous characteristics simulation, both the FEM and RNA compare favourably with the experimental data though the FEM gives more accurate (albeit underestimated) results. However, the RNA is a very efficient approach considering the computation time. The optimisation of the finite element model is very important for obtaining the best possible results. The density of the finite element meshes, the aspect ratio of the elements and reducing the problem in size by using symmetry are vital considerations. The studied HLSM possesses a very small airgap, which made a judicious mesh scheme extremely important. Different methods of force calculations were analysed and it was found that both the Coulomb's approach and the Maxwell stress tensor are efficient and accurate methods to implement. The classical virtual work CVW method is very time-consuming since it requires two solutions. The determination of small incremental displacement is also difficult in the CVW. The experimental investigations of the small HLSM need a very high accuracy, Considerable efforts are needed to minimize all sources of noise and interference. It has been found that amplitude of instantaneous force ripple increases when the phase current amplitude increases. The superimposition of the 3 rd harmonic on phase current can effectively reduce the force ripple. The transient tests focused on the start-up and braking characteristics. The <b>start-up</b> <b>tests</b> show that the higher the load is applied the longer the start-up time is required. On the contrary, the braking time can be significantly reduced with an increase in load. It can also be concluded that the higher the step resolution, the less settling time is needed for both start-up and braking processes. The recommendations from this thesis for further research on the subject of the HLSM analysis are that the reluctance network model should be improved to take into account the magnetic saturation and edge effects and the FEM enhanced classical approach should be attempted to take advantages of the high accuracy of the FEM without significant increase in the solution time...|$|E

The <b>start-up</b> <b>test</b> was the only test for which there was no significant difference between the physicians and the technician, except for two ventilators. The physicians were slower than the technician to unlock the ventilator and change the ventilatory mode, with some complete failures during these tests and heterogeneous results between physicians and between ventilators. Mistakes occurred in close to 50 % of cases during the ventilatory mode and settings recognition test. The mean time for the most rapid of the physicians for all the tests was 58 ¡ 53 s, compared with 15 ¡ 9 s for the technician. In conclusion, trained intensive care unit physicians perform poorly when confronted with home mechanical ventilators without specific prior training. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the user-friendliness of home ventilators for other categories of users might be questionable...|$|R
40|$|Two {{dozen of}} {{bryophyte}} species was collected from native habitat types across Europe to test if the ethanol extract {{can affect the}} growth of various microorganisms. After <b>start-up</b> <b>test</b> the ethanol extract did not show any influence on growth and development to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Thus, the further tests focused on the Gram-positive bactreia. The ethanol extract of 5 g bryophyte material was macerated in liquid nitrogen, and then extract was evaporated till dry. The dry residue was dissolved in 5 ml of methanol. This was used in further analyses by MIC and MBC techniques. The result obtained showed the most effective extracts were those made from Pellia endiviifolia and Bazzania trilobata. Phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi C. albicans showed resistance to extracts of any bryophyte species tested. Gram-positive bacterias, namely Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19111) and Bacilus subtilis (ATCC 6633) were intolerant to extracts of liverworts P. endiviifolia and B. trilobata. MIC value for two above mentioned liverworts extract tested were 7 - 12 mm, while referent antibiotic (rifampicin) inhibitory zone were 15 - 35 mm. The most resistant to any bryophyte extracts was Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), while the most sensitive was B. subtilis (ATCC 6633) with MIC values obtained 0. 01 - 0. 19 mg/ml. The results obtained show clear antimicrobial potential of P. endiviifolia and B. trilobata, however further research are needed...|$|R
40|$|The Murmansk Initiative - RF'' is a tri-lateral project {{developed}} to support Russia's {{ability to meet}} the London Convention's prohibition on ocean disposal of radioactive waste. The Initiative, under a tripartite agreement, has upgraded an existing low-level liquid radioactive waste treatment facility, increasing capacity from 1, 200 m{sup 3 }/year to 5, 000 m{sup 3 }/year, and expanded capability to treat liquids containing salt (up to 10 g/L). The three parties to the agreement, the Russian Federation, Norway, and the United States, have all contributed the project. All construction has been provided by Russia. Construction of mechanical systems (piping and valves, pumps, sorbent columns, settling tanks, and surge tanks) is nearing completion, with instrumentation and control (I&C) systems currently being installed. Delays to the I&C installation have occurred because changes in system specifications required additional U. S. supplied computer control equipment to be purchased, and clearance through customs (both U. S. and Russian) has been slow. <b>Start-up</b> <b>testing</b> has been limited to testing of isolated sub-systems because of the delays in the I&C installation. The {{current state of the}} Russian economy and completion of a cementation unit, which {{was not part of the}} original tri-partite agreement, have hampered final construction activities. Russian regulatory authorities have stated that final licensing for expanded capacity (5, 000 m{sup 3 }/year) would not be given until the cementation unit was on-line. Completion of the project is now scheduled for August 1999...|$|R
