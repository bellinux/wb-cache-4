5000|$|The {{first step}} in making {{paraffin}} wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed {{with one or more}} solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil in the solution. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called [...] "product wax" [...] (or [...] "press wax") and [...] "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered (<b>semi-refined</b> versus fully refined). The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.|$|E
50|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding the petitioner's conviction were as follows. On December 20, 1965, Leary left New York by automobile, intending to take a vacation trip to the Mexican state of Yucatán. He was accompanied by his daughter and son, both teenagers, and two others. On December 22, 1965, the party drove across the International Bridge between the United States and Mexico at Laredo, Texas. They stopped at the Mexican customs station and, after apparently being denied entry, drove back across the bridge. They halted at the American secondary inspection area, explained the situation to a customs inspector, and stated that they had nothing from Mexico to declare. The inspector asked to search the car, examined its interior, and saw {{what appeared to be}} marijuana seeds on the floor. Small amounts of marijuana were also found on the car floor and in the glove compartment. A personal search of Leary's daughter revealed a silver snuff box containing <b>semi-refined</b> marijuana and three partially smoked marijuana cigarettes. Though Leary was arrested for violating the Marijuana Tax Act, it was also illegal in the state of Texas to possess marijuana. Hence, compliance under federal law would have provided self-incriminating evidence.|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from <b>semi-refined</b> oils (SRO) and waste frying oils (WFO) was studied using commercial CaO as heterogeneous catalyst. The methanolysis tests {{were carried out}} in mild reaction conditions (62 A degrees C, atmospheric pressure). With such conditions, SRO (soybean and rapeseed) allowed to produce a biodiesel containing 97 - 98 % of methyl esters (FAME), whereas WFO only provided 86 - 87 % of FAME. The lower FAME yield for WFO oil is ascribable to the partial neutralization of the catalyst by free fatty acids. Also, soaps formation from the WFO oil reduced the weight yield of the oil phase (containing FAME) obtained and increased the MONG content of the glycerin phase. The catalysts stability tests showed high stability even when WFO oil was processed. Catalytic tests performed with blends of WFO/semi-refined oils showed blending as a good strategy to process low value raw oils with minor decay of the catalyst performance.

Este por sua vez Ã motivado pela exploraÃÃo de matÃriasprimas menos processadas e de menor custo para produÃÃo do biodiesel. Portanto, o emprego de Ãleo semi-refinado de algodÃo pode vir a contribuir para a reduÃÃo nos custos de produÃÃo do biodiesel. As variÃveis estudadas no prÃ-tratamento do Ãleo bruto de algodÃo foram escolhidas tendo como referencial o processo de refino convencional (refino quÃmico) com soda cÃustica. Os experimentos foram realizados utilizando planejamento experimental e os resultados foram interpretados de acordo com a metodologia de superfÃcie de resposta. As variÃveis estudadas foram: concentraÃÃo e excesso de soda cÃustica (soluÃÃo de NaOH), temperatura inicial e final. As respostas foram avaliadas em funÃÃo de alguns dos mais importantes parÃmetros de qualidade do Ãleo semi-refinado obtido (cor, acidez e teor de sabÃo) e da quantidade do co-produto de refino (borra) produzido. O excesso de soda cÃustica e a temperatura inicial foram Ãs variÃveis que influenciaram de modo mais significativo as respostas analisadas, dentro do alcance experimental estudado. A eficiÃncia na conversÃo a Ãsteres metÃlicos mostrou-se dependente da qualidade (cor, acidez e sabÃo) do Ãleo semirefinado de algodÃo utilizado. A concentraÃÃo do pigmento gossipol que estÃ diretamente relacionado Ã cor do Ãleo de algodÃo, sugere que o mesmo pode estar influenciando na conversÃo da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo alcalina, por estar consumindo parte do catalisador. As condiÃÃes Ãtimas determinadas experimentalmente foram: concentraÃÃo e excesso de soda cÃustica 25 % (p/p) e 100 % (p/p), temperatura inicial e final 40 ÂC e 60 ÂC, respectivamente. Nessas condiÃÃes otimizadas o Ãleo semi-refinado obtido alcanÃou conversÃo de 94 % (p/p) a Ãsteres metÃlicos. Entretanto, o Ãleo obtido nas condiÃÃes otimizadas, por apresentar ainda uma elevada concentraÃÃo de sabÃo, foi submetido Ã lavagem com Ãgua, o qual reduziu seu teor de sabÃo.

This objective is motivated by the investigation of less processed or cheaper raw materials, for instance, <b>semi-refined</b> cotton oil, {{in order to reduce the}} cost of biodiesel production. The conditions of pre-treatment studied for the cotton crude oil of were chosen based on the conventional caustic soda refining process (chemical refining). The proposed process of biodiesel production was evaluated and the optimal operating conditions range was identified by application of the factorial design and response surface methodology. The studied variables were concentration and the caustic soda excess (solution NaOH), initial and final temperatures. The responses were evaluated according some of the most important quality parameters of <b>semi-refined</b> oil obtained (color, acidity and content of soap) and the amount of co-product of refining (soapstock) produced. The caustic soda excess and initial temperatures are the variables that most significantly influenced the responses analyzed within the experimental range studied. The efficiency of conversion to methyl esters was dependent on the quality (color, acidity and concentration of soap) in the <b>semi-refined</b> cotton oil used. Gossypol concentration was found to be highly correlated with color cottonseed oil,suggesting that it may influence the conversion in the alkaline transesterification reaction,consuming part of the catalyst.

H- 1 - 2 was a type of glucan, where chemical combination exists in the main chain between 1 → 4 linked glucose, and contains a small amount of 1, 6 -linked glucose, which was in the branched chain. In vitro HepG 2, 3 T 3 -L 1, and L 6 cells were used to assess cellular glucose consumption and cellular glucose uptake by glucose oxidase, and the transport of 2 -NBDG fluorescence probe results showed that H- 1 - 2 could clearly increase glucose uptake and utilization in muscle and adipose cells, which is beneficial to screen for in the discovery of anti-diabetes lead compounds.

40|$|Biodiesel is {{the main}} {{alternative}} to fossil diesel {{and it may be}} produced from different feedstocks such as <b>semi-refined</b> vegetable oils, waste frying oils or animal fats. However, these feedstocks usually contain significant amounts of free fatty acids (FFA) that make them inadequate for the direct base catalyzed transesterification reaction (where the FFA content should be lower than 4 %). The present work describes a possible method for the pre-treatment of oils with a high content of FFA (20 to 50 %) by esterification with glycerol. In order to reduce the FFA content, the reaction between these FFA and an esterification agent is carried out before the transesterification reaction. The reaction kinetics was studied in terms of its main factors such astemperature, % of glycerin excess, % of catalyst used, stirring velocity and type of catalyst used. The results showed that glycerolysis is a promising pretreatment to acidic oils or fats (> 20 %) as they led to the production of an intermediary material with a low content of FFA that can be used directly in thetransesterification reaction for the production of biodiesel.

The catalysts were calcined at 575 degrees C and 800 degrees C, for 5 h, to remove nitrate ions before reaction. The XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts, including the bare CaO, showed lines ascribable to CaO and Ca(OH) (2). The absence of XRD lines belonging to Li phases confirms the efficient dispersion of Li over CaO. In the tested condition (W-cat/W-oil = 5 %; CH 3 OH/oil = 12 molar ratio) all the fresh catalysts provided similar biodiesel yields (FAME > 93 % after 4 h) but the bare CaO catalyst was more stable. The activity decay of the Li modified samples {{can be related to}} the enhanced, by the higher basicity, calcium diglyceroxide formation during methanolysis which promotes calcium leaching.

In both trials, increasing dietary oil levels negatively influenced FI and positively FCR. Weight gain was similar among all treatments in EXP 1, whereas in EXP 2, WG was higher when 4 and 5. 5 % oil {{was included in the}} feed. RBO presented 94 % fat metabolizability, and crude energy and metabolizable energy levels of 9. 260 and 8. 714 kcal/kg, respectively. Carcass yield was not influenced by oil type; however, oil inclusion level negatively affected breast yield. The experimental treatments had no effect on meat oxidative stability. RBO can be used as an alternative to soybean oil in broilers diets...|$|E
40|$|Currently, <b>semi-refined</b> {{and refined}} {{vegetable}} oils are used as a feedstock in biodiesel production. However, due to competition with conventional fossil fuel, economic reasons, shortage supply of food and its social impact on the global scale has somewhat slowed the development of biodiesel industry. Studies have been conducted to recover oil from mill palm oil operation especially from the spent bleaching earth. Hence, {{the study was to}} investigate the potential recovery of oil from spent bleaching earth {{to be used as a}} feedstock for biodiesel production. The effect of different types of catalysts (sodium hydroxide alkali and sulfuric acid catalysts) on biodiesel yield was studied. In addition, the effect of volume addition of methanol to the weight of spent bleaching earth on the product yield was also studied. Furthermore, the effect of ratio of hexane to methanol was also carried out to determine its product yield. The studies were carried out in an in-situ biodiesel reactor system and the biodiesel product was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Result shows that the use of alkali catalyst produced the highest yield of biodiesel and the most optimum biodiesel yield was obtained when the methanol to spent bleaching earth ratio was 3. 2 : 1 (gram of methanol: gram of SBE) and hexane to methanol ratio of 0. 6 : 1 (volume of hexane: volume of methanol). © 2011 BCREC UNDIP.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{uncertainty}} quantification (UQ) that combines adaptivity {{in the physical}} (deterministic) space and the stochastic space is presented. The sampling-based method adaptively refines the physical discretizations of the simulations, along with adaptively building a stochastic model and adding samples. By adaptively refining the physical and stochastic models, errors from both spaces are balanced. The UQ method takes advantage of an active linear subspace to reduce the dimensionality of the stochastic space while retaining relevant interaction terms and anisotropy. Driven by low-cost error estimates, a particle-swarm optimization method explores the stochastic space and drives adaptation that results in an efficient stochastic approximation. The UQ method is compared to to two modern methods for three test functions in a 100 -dimensional space. The current method is shown to result in up to three orders of magnitude lower error and up to two orders of magnitude fewer samples. Next, a simulation is developed using the discontinuous Galerkin method which is well-suited to adaptivity. A transient multiphase flashing flow model is used to simulate the Edwards-O'Brien blowdown problem. The adjoint equations are successfully solved and used to drive a space-time anisotropic adaptation based on a complex output of interest. This results in an efficient phsyical discretization. Finally, the UQ method is used to assess modeling and discretization errors in a modified multiphase flow simulation. Based on an overall stochastic output of interest, the UQ method simultaneously drives adaptation of the stochastic and deterministic discretizations in order to balance the two sources of error. That is, terms {{are added to the}} stochastic model, samples are added, and the physical grid of each individual simulation is refined simultaneously. Error estimates based on <b>semi-refined</b> discretizations retain anisotropic accuracy, and a common grid is used to compare solutions from samples. The method for combined adaptivity performs well on the test problem, reducing the stochastic dimensionality from 20 to two and reducing deterministic errors on select samples. For about the same computational time, the method results in an order of magnitude less error and an order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom compared to three other methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Mars Aqueous Processing System (MAPS) is to {{establish}} a flexible process that generates multiple products that are useful for human habitation. Selectively extracting useful components into an aqueous solution, and then sequentially recovering individual constituents, can obtain a suite of refined or <b>semi-refined</b> products. Similarities in the bulk composition (although not necessarily of the mineralogy) of Martian and Lunar soils potentially make MAPS widely applicable. Similar process steps can be conducted on both Mars and Lunar soils while tailoring the reaction extents and recoveries to the specifics of each location. The MAPS closed-loop process selectively extracts, and then recovers, constituents from soils using acids and bases. The emphasis on Mars involves the production of useful materials such as iron, silica, alumina, magnesia, and concrete with recovery of oxygen as a byproduct. On the Moon, similar chemistry is applied with emphasis on oxygen production. This innovation has been demonstrated to produce high-grade materials, such as metallic iron, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, and calcium oxide, from lunar and Martian soil simulants. Most of the target products exhibited purities of 80 to 90 percent or more, allowing direct use for many potential applications. Up to one-fourth of the feed soil mass was converted to metal, metal oxide, and oxygen products. The soil residue contained elevated silica content, allowing for potential additional refining and extraction for recovery of materials needed for photovoltaic, semiconductor, and glass applications. A high-grade iron oxide concentrate derived from lunar soil simulant was used to produce a metallic iron component using a novel, combined hydrogen reduction/metal sintering technique. The part was subsequently machined and found to be structurally sound. The behavior of the lunar-simulant-derived iron product was very similar to that produced using the same methods on a Michigan iron ore concentrate, which demonstrates that lunar-derived material {{can be used in a}} manner similar to conventional terrestrial iron. Metallic iron was also produced from the Mars soil simulant. The aluminum and magnesium oxide products produced by MAPS from lunar and Mars soil simulants exhibited excellent thermal stability, and were shown to be capable of use for refractory oxide structural materials, or insulation at temperatures far in excess of what could be achieved using unrefined soils. These materials exhibited the refractory characteristics needed to support iron casting and forming operations, as well as other thermal processing needs. Extraction residue samples contained up to 79 percent silica. Such samples were successfully fused into a glass that exhibited high light transmittance...|$|E
