40|$|In recent years, {{intelligent}} {{transportation systems}} are under a continuous development {{which is the}} direct integration of the technology and traffic engineering aspects. These systems are extensively used {{in order to prevent}} driving at high speeds and violations of the traffic rules at different road sections, signalized and unsignalized intersections. These systems have capabilities of detecting the instantaneous and average speeds of vehicles along a roadway section, and red light violations. By the help of these sophisticated systems, road and security authorities can successfully carry out criminal sanctions against non-compliant drivers combined with plate reader cameras. In Turkey, these systems are called Traffic Electronic Control System (TECS) and they are considered under different categories such as intelligent intersection systems, vehicle counting systems, <b>safety</b> <b>strip</b> violation detection systems, speed violation detection systems, speed corridors, red light violation detection systems and parking violation detection systems. Within the scope of this study, the performance of a red light violation system installed at the 4 -leg signalized intersection at Antalya-Burdur highway entrance of Celtikci district belonging to the TECS was investigated by implementing a new proposed methodology.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In the past airfields were designed and built by architectural and engineering companies without due regard and consideration to flight operational requirements. This deficiency was recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA). Both leading aviation controlling bodies advocated the incorporation of flight operational considerations in the overall airfield layout and pavement design. Pertinent issues {{to be addressed in}} the paper include: approach light system design and consideration, aircraft maneuvering area design and construction, taxiway and runway markings, runway skid resistance, runway length and width consideration, runway end safety area (RESA) and <b>safety</b> <b>strip</b> considerations, rapid exit taxiway designs, apron lighting, taxiway design consideration and control over foreign object debris (FOD). Some case studies (e. g. King Shaka International Airport, OR Tambo International Airport, Lanseria International, Arusha and Mwanza Regional Airports, East London, Nairobi and Kilimanjaro International Airports) will be used to illustrate that by proper consideration to the flight operations factor, these airports could have been planned and designed/upgraded/maintained in a much more efficient and safe manner, that could have ensured an increased availability factor. Major high risk pavement failures have been recorded (asphalt surfacing being blown out and loose stones) by not considering aircraft related factors (jet blast, oil spillages).

40|$|AbstractRumble strip {{implementation}} {{has shown}} a constant increase with its <b>safety</b> benefits. Rumble <b>strips</b> are milled into the roadway shoulder to produce noise and vibrations when driven on. With the milling process, the pavement performance {{is expected to be}} negatively impacted by the decreased depth, though not mathematically quantified. Using methods defined by the Long-Term Pavement Performance Program, the severity of the shoulder site’s distresses, with and without shoulder rumble strips, will be quantified. The quantification would permit the design to compensate for the impact. This design compensation allows the implementation of hard shoulder running, the use of shoulder as a travel lane during congestion, and retains the shoulder rumble <b>strip</b> <b>safety</b> instead of removing, as suggested by some proposed projects. While hard shoulder running would not impact specific time periods, the safety benefit of rumble strips could be needed at any time.

According to Ambash, Vause Chapman's notable absence from the third season's final group scenes - as Vause is trapped with the man who has been sent to kill her, and Chapman is off tattooing herself in the chapel - symbolizes their heightened distrust in others and the prison system itself.

40|$|Purpose The study {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the effects of centreline milled rumble strips on rural two-lane roads in Sweden in a wide perspective. Traffic safety effects (i. e., fewer crashes and injuries), driver experience, and driver opinions of centreline milled rumble strip usage on rural roads are investigated. Methods To evaluate the traffic safety effects, an Empirical Bayes study comparing the outcome before and-after the introduction of rumble strips was conducted. This study is {{based on data from}} 2003 - 2012 from the Swedish national traffic accident database, STRADA. To capture driver experience and opinions about milled centreline rumble strips, focus groups and road-side interviews were performed. Results The results indicate a significant decrease in all types of severe injury crashes, a 20 % (+/- 13 %) {{reduction in the number of}} fatalities and seriously injured people (all crash types) and a 27 % (+/- 18 %) reduction in the number of fatalities and severely injured people in single-vehicle crashes. Participants in focus groups and road-side interviews generally favoured centreline rumble strips on rural roads, and up to 90 % of the interviewed motorcyclists and commuters stated that the rumble strips would help improve traffic <b>safety.</b> Conclusions Rumble <b>strips</b> in the centre of two-lane rural roads are a countermeasure to help drivers who are unintentionally about to leave the lane, for example, due to sleepiness or inattention. Based on the results of this study, installing centreline milled rumble strips on two-lane rural roads 8 - 10 meters wide is a measure to consider to increase safety.

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementDuring well {{drilling}} operation, {{there is a}} possibility of a kick (influx). When a kick is not controlled properly it will become a blow out. This is an uncontrolled and sudden flow of formation fluid that releases from a reservoir through a well bore into surface as a result of pressure difference in formation and well. The kick could flow to surface and create explosions causing fatality, environment damage and loss of asset resulting in high cost. There are procedures and methods to deal with the occurrence of kicks and blowouts in order to control a well flow. Moreover, well barriers should be established and designed based on the characteristics of the reservoir and rock formation. The last line of protection in well barriers is known as Blowout Preventer (BOP). It {{is one of the most}} important barriers to prevent unintentional hydrocarbon release when all well barriers in a well have failed. There are many factors that influence the performance of a BOP. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the criticality of components in BOP related to the redundancies they have during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation. By knowing the criticality of BOP components, we can assure which components that should be focused on for maintenance and testing. It will also indicate which components that gives redundancy to the BOP during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation, if one or more components are failed. A literature study is the main work of this thesis. Studying the principal, functions, operations and factors related to drilling activity with respect to the use of BOP. In addition, relevant regulations and standards are also describes to specify the required specification of BOP. The analysis of criticality is done by using risk tools such as reliability block diagram, FMECA, criticality matrix, redundancy and effect table. All of these risk tools complement each other to give the final conclusion of critical component in a BOP. The result of the analysis shows five critical components in a BOP with the prioritization start from shuttle valve (blind shear ram function), blind shear ram (ram piston), flange (BOP stack), gasket (BOP stack) and annular preventer (rubber housing) respectively. In the event of kick and well shut in is initiated, the above critical component is very critical to the <b>safety</b> of personnel. <b>Stripping</b> and snubbing operation also require the critical components to be function properly, but with less critical when well shut in has been done earlier. During BOP testing operation, the critical components might not be critical if it fail as there are many safety measure and procedure for safety...|$|R
