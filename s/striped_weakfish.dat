2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the isotopic {{composition}} in muscle of <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> Cynoscion guatucupa from Southwest Atlantic Ocean in order to evaluate a possible variation in δ 13 C and δ 15 N in response to dietary shifts that occur as animals grow. We also explored for isotopic evidence of differences between sample locations. The results showed an agreement between isotope analysis and previous conventional studies. Differences in the isotope composition between sampling location were not observed. A positive relation exists between isotope values and total body length of the animals. The Cluster analysis defined three groups of size classes, validated by the MDS. Differences in the relative consumption of prey species in each size class were also observed performing isotope mixing models (SIAR). Variation in δ 15 N among size classes would be associated with the consumption of a different type of prey as animals grow. Small <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> feed on small crustaceans and progressively increase their consumption of fish (anchovy, Engraulis anchoita), increasing by this way their isotope values. On the other hand, differences in δ 13 C values seemed to be related to age-class specific spatial distribution patterns. Therefore, large and small <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> remain specialized but feeding on different prey at different trophic levels. These results contribute to the study of the diet of <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish,</b> improve the isotopic ecology models and highlight on the importance of accounting for variation in the isotopic composition in response to dietary shifts with the size of one of the most important fishery resources in the region...|$|E
40|$|Absonifibula estuarina sp. n. (Diclidophoridae, Absonifibulinae), is {{described}} from the gills of juvenile <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish,</b> Cynoscion guatucupa (Cuvier), from the southwestern Atlantic, Argentinean coast. This marine fish mi-grates to estuarine areas to spawn where exclusively juveniles are found parasitized; adult fish in marine water were never {{found to be}} parasitized by this monogenean. A. estuarina sp. n. is characterized mainly by the pedunculate clamps dissimilar in size, the shape of anterior jaw with sclerite ‘a ’ attached to a sub-trapezoidal lamellate extension and fused to sclerites ‘c ’ and ‘d’. It differs from Absonifibula bychowskyi Lawler & Overstreet, 1976, the only known species of the genus, in the shape and arrangement of the genital corona, which is armed with six similar hooks dis-posed in circle and the sub-trapezoidal shape of lamellate extension (‘b’). The restriction to juvenile sciaenids is a shared feature among the Absonifibulinae indicating an estuary-dependent life cycle...|$|E

40|$|Two {{stocks of}} <b>striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> Cynoscion guatucupa in the {{south-west}} Atlantic Ocean, were identified using parasites as biological tags. A total of 297 fish caught in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, contained 29 species of metazoan parasites. Univariate analysis on parasite popula-tions, {{as well as}} multivariate discriminant analysis, calculated for juvenile and adult fish sepa-rately, allowed {{the identification of the}} two stocks, one from Argentina and Uruguay and the other from Brazil, to be made. Southern samples were characterized by higher prevalences and abundance of larval endohelminths, whereas in the northern stock, gastrointestinal and ectopar-asitic species were common. Discriminant analyses on parasite infracommunities of Brazilian fish showed notable differences between juvenile and adult hosts; no such trend was observed in fish from Argentina and Uruguay, despite differences between juveniles and adults at the population level. Different oceanographic conditions and their influence on the distribution of parasites as well as of other hosts involved in their life cycles could be key factors for the differences observed among stocks of C. guatucupa. # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: biological tags; Cynoscion guatucupa; south-west Atlantic; stocks...|$|E
40|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion guatucupa) and whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) are {{important}} commercial and recreational species found in abundance along the South American Atlantic coast. In recent years otolith chemical composition {{has been used}} as a tool for identifying fish stocks for several species. The chemical composition of C. guatucupa and M. furnieri otoliths was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) in samples from coastal sites (Partido de La Costa, Mar del Plata and San Blás Bay). Significant differences in the ratios of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca and Sr/Ca for C. guatucupa otoliths and Cd/Ca, Cu/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca for M. furnieri otoliths suggest the existence of two different fish stocks, one originating in the north (including Samborombón Bay and Partido de La Costa fisheries) and another originating in the south (including “El Rincón” and San Blás fisheries). These results agree with previous studies on the same species using different methodologies. These stocks may be separated by an oceanographic barrier, the “Frente El Rincón”. Otolith chemical composition has not been previously used in South America for identifying fish stocks and may be a simple, quick and useful tool for the sustainable exploitation and management of commercial species...|$|E
40|$|The diet of the South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) and its {{seasonal}} variation during the 2005 and 2006 non-reproductive {{seasons in the}} Uruguayan Atlantic coast was analyzed. Diet was assessed by the analysis of pellets collected in the Rocha lagoon sandbar, a major tern roosting area in Uruguay, aiming to analyze the hypothesis that terns feed mainly on the Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) during the wintering period. A total of 844 pellets were collected, 442 in 2005 and 402 in 2006. Diet was composed of fish (88 %), insects (9 %) and crustaceans (3 %). The main fish species consumed was the Argentine Anchovy (77. 7 %), followed by Marini's Anchovy (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) and the <b>Striped</b> <b>Weakfish</b> (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Insects and crustaceans were the main items {{in two of the}} groups of pellets collected during the study period. Despite this temporal variation in the diet, the Argentine Anchovy was the main prey item consumed during both seasons. These results support the hypothesis that South American Terns strongly depend on anchovies as trophic resource. En este trabajo se analizó la dieta del Gaviotín Sudamericano (Sterna hirundinacea) y su variación estacional durante las temporadas no reproductivas de 2005 y 2006 en la costa atlántica uruguaya. La dieta fue estudiada por medio del análisis de bolos colectados en la barra de la laguna de Rocha, una importante zona de descanso para la especie en Uruguay, con el propósito de analizar la hipótesis de que el gaviotín se alimenta principalmente de Anchoíta Argentina (Engraulis anchoita) durante el período de invernada. Un total de 844 bolos fueron colectados, 442 en 2005 y 402 en 2006. La dieta estuvo compuesta por peces (88 %), insectos (9 %) y crustáceos (3 %). La principal presa consumida fue la Anchoíta Argentina (77. 7 %), seguida de la Anchoa (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) y la Pescadilla de Red (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Los insectos y los crustáceos fueron el ítem principal en dos de las muestras (grupos de bolos) colectadas durante el período de estudio. A pesar de esta variación temporal en la dieta la Anchoíta Argentina fue la presa principal durante las dos temporadas de estudio.

40|$|Targett, Timothy E. Estuarine {{habitat loss}} and {{fragmentation}} {{are among the}} most serious threats facing coastal fisheries. A major component of habitat loss is coastal development in the form of shoreline hardening, the process of placing hardened structures along soft shorelines to reduce erosion and protect upland property. Shoreline hardening drastically alters morphology of the intertidal zone, and has been shown to disrupt local patterns of habitat usage among shore zone biota. Several types of hardening structures are becoming more common within the Mid-Atlantic, and coastal population growth coupled sea level rise will further increase the demand for shoreline stabilization in the future. In this context, it is crucial to determine the importance of the shore zone as fish habitat, and the effects of anthropogenic modification. This study will assess differences in the usage, value, and function of unhardened shorelines relative to hardened shorelines for estuarine nekton communities within the Delaware Bay. In {{the first part of this}} study, I used quantitative sampling to measure species composition, overall density, and densities of individual species among natural (beach) and hardened (riprap) shorelines to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in the estuarine shore zone assemblage associated with shoreline modification. Fishes and crabs along the western shoreline of Delaware Bay were sampled from June through late September, 2012 and 2013. During 2013, the shore zone assemblage at one site in lower Delaware Bay was also sampled during both day and night hours. Over the two years of this study 14, 198 fish and crabs were captured within the shore zone in total, comprised of 51 individual species. Overall nekton density was higher along beach shorelines at 2 of 3 locations. Nekton density was also higher at night along both beach and riprap shorelines. Habitat preference between hardened and unhardened shorelines existed among several abundant species. Usage of shore zone habitat also changed among several abundant species between day and night hours. Distinct assemblages of fish and crabs were present among beach and riprap shorelines at 2 of 3 locations and among day and night hours. In general, the results demonstrate altered usage of shore zone habitat along hardened shorelines and changes to overall use of shore zone habitat between day and night hours. Chapter 2 addressed changes in the feeding habits of top piscivorous fish species within the Mid-Atlantic estuarine food web. Diet composition and stomach fullness were measured in <b>weakfish,</b> bluefish, and <b>striped</b> bass captured during shore zone sampling. <b>Striped</b> bass and <b>weakfish</b> diets did not show changes in prey composition or feeding intensity among shoreline types. However, weakfish diet composition shifted among sites, indicating an effect of location on either prey selectivity or availability. Bluefish diet reflected differences in the predation of prey species associated with shoreline type in the month of July, with individuals captured along the beach foraging on fish prey and those captured along the riprap foraging on mysid shrimp. Bluefish captured in August exhibited similar diet composition overall, but different stomach fullness values indicating a difference in feeding intensity. In general, these findings show that shoreline hardening has the potential to alter shore zone habitat use and function for estuarine fishes, and that these effects appear to be inconsistent among species and size-classes.
