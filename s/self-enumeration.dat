5000|$|The census {{was not a}} success. It was {{hampered}} {{by the fact that}} World War II was ongoing and by India's literacy and education standards. Those standards made it unfeasible to permit <b>self-enumeration</b> by the respondents but the costs and time involved in training enumerators to act on their behalf had not been offset against the perceived benefits of adopting the sampling method. Very little data was produced other than figures for total population and, says Mitra, [...] "The tabulations of the sampled results on machines were so botched and delayed that even by 1954, no complete tabulations ... had been made. The final results defied coherent interpretation at the state or national level." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{multi-model}} {{data collection}} approach was first {{adopted in the}} 2011 Population Census (11 C) in Hong Kong where respondents were allowed to provide the required information by <b>self-enumeration</b> {{in addition to the}} traditional mode of face-to-face interview by enumerators. In the 11 C, electronic questionnaire (e-Q) was available for both long form and short form questionnaires for <b>self-enumeration</b> whereas questionnaire in paper form for postal return was only available for short form questionnaire. About 13 % of the households had used e-Q for data reporting. This paper aims to study the characteristics of these households. The logistic regression model technique is used to identify the major factors affecting the e-Q usage and examine the substitution effects between the paper mode and the e-Q mode for households of different characteristics...|$|E

40|$|A general double {{sampling}} scheme model which employs {{a combination of}} an error-free measurement process and a faulty measurement process is developed. The model allows estimation of measurement error variance and elimination of measurement process bias. The model is applied to two specific survey situations, a <b>self-enumeration</b> survey and an interviewer conducted survey. Using a cost function which reflects the relative cost of the error-free measurement process and the faulty measurement process, optimum values for the sample sizes are derived and the optimum number of interviewers is indicated. For various values of the parameters the DSS model is compared to using only the faulty measurement process or only the error-free measurement process and the preferred sampling scheme is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activity}} {{is considered to}} be a key factor contributing to the worldwide decline in shorebird populations. In order to minimize human disturbance to shorebirds it is important to determine public awareness of shorebirds and shorebird conservation issues so that effective management can be implemented. In this study, we used <b>self-enumeration</b> questionnaires to survey beach users in coastal central Queensland, Australia, to gain an understanding of the awareness and attitudes of beach users. Results show that beaches were visited on a daily basis indicating that there is considerable potential for human disturbance of shorebird populations. Fifty-six percent of participants spent more than an hour at the beach per visit and 57 % of participants spent most of their time at or in the low tide area. Most participants visited the beach to undertake a variety of activities, of which walking/jogging/running was the most frequently reported activity (38 %). The survey results indicate that shorebird conservation is considered important, with most people believing that shorebirds and people can co-exist (90 %). In terms of raising awareness of shorebird conservation issues, inconsistencies were found to exist between how participants reported they learn and which sources they considered to be most effective. Therefore, we conclude that implementing communication strategies that incorporate multiple media types such as signage supported by TV/radio or newsprint will be most effective at promoting shorebird awareness and conservation...|$|E
