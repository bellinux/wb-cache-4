40|$|Vitoria Bay is a 20 km long estuary, morphologically narrow, with a {{microtidal}} regime and, {{as other}} modern estuaries, was formed {{during the last}} post-glacial transgression. The estuarine bed morphology is characterised by a main natural channel limited by tidal flats with developed mangroves. Original radiocarbon dates were obtained for the site. Five radiocarbon ages ranging from 1, 010 to 7, 240 years BP were obtained from two sedimentary cores, which represent a 5 m thick stratigraphic sequence. The results indicate that, until about 4, 000 cal. yrs BP, environmental conditions in Vitoria Bay were still of an open bay, with a free and wide connection with marine waters. During the last 4, 000 yrs, the bay has experienced a major regression phase, by becoming more restricted in terms of seawater circulation and probably increasing tidal energy. Three main stratigraphic surfaces were recognised, which limit trangressive, trangressive/highstand and regressive facies. The present channel morphology represents a tidal <b>scouring</b> <b>surface</b> or a tidal diastem, which erodes and truncates regressive facies bedding. Foraminiferal biofacies, which change from marine to brackish and mangrove tidal-flat environments, support the seismic stratigraphic interpretation. Absence of mangrove biofacies {{at one of the}} two cores is also an indication of modern tidal ravinement...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sequence stratigraphic {{concepts}} {{for making}} predictive lithologic models {{are based on}} relative sea-level changes, which for lower-rank cycles of 1 Ma or 400 ka {{are considered to be}} driven by eustasy. This study of an incised-valley fill of the lower Miocene Addit Member, Billund Formation, Denmark, shows that this is an oversimplification and that the distribution of lithology differs from that commonly used in sequence stratigraphic models. The incised-valley fill is composed of up to 60 m of fluvial deposits with intercalated lacustrine and marine sand and mud. A regional subaerial erosional surface separates the incised-valley fill into two distinct units that together constitute a compound fill. This second boundary clearly shows a stepped erosional pattern characteristic for a regional composite <b>scoured</b> <b>surface</b> (RCS). The <b>scouring</b> shows a systematic migration towards the east. The main incision and the twofold development of the valley fill are interpreted to be strongly influenced by the eustatic sea-level changes that occurred during the end of the Aquitanian (early Miocene), the so-called Mi 1 a glacial event. The development of systems tracts also follows the standard sequence stratigraphic model. However, inversion tectonism and continued uplift of the hinterland resulted in the upstream widening of the valley morphology and the systematic eastward migration of incision of at least the second regional composite <b>scour</b> <b>surface.</b> The presence of gravel clasts (, 5 cm) indicates a relatively steep dip for the fluvial system. As only minor local climatic changes have been detected during the incision and filling of the valley, local climate is not considered to have been important...|$|R

The migration of bend (C) was downwards, whereas that of bend (D) was {{in the opposite direction}} (Fig.  7 c-D). The results indicate that bend (C) migrated with the expansion and rotation mode, deviating away from the meandering belt axis, whereas bend (D) migrated with the same mode but in the opposite direction.

Three-dimensional exposures of trough limbs can be measured and treated statistically on a stereographic plot to determine the average trough-axis orientation.

40|$|Scours {{are common}} {{features}} of modern deep-marine seascapes, particularly downstream of {{the mouths of}} slope channels within channel-lobe transition zones (CLTZs). Their dimensions can exceed hundreds of metres in width and length, and tens of metres in depth. However, the stratigraphic architecture of the infill of these erosional bedforms is rarely described from the rock record and no large (> 100 m width) scours have been described in detail from exhumed CLTZs. Here, the infill of two erosional features (0. 5 - 1 km long and 15 - 20 m thick) from the Permian Karoo Basin succession, South Africa, are presented from palaeogeographically well- constrained CLTZs; one from Fan 3 in the Tanqua depocentre and one from Unit A 5 in the Laingsburg depocentre. The basal erosion surfaces of the features are asymmetric with steep, undulating, and composite upstream margins, and low gradient simple downstream margins. The basal infill consists of thin-bedded siltstone and sandstone beds cut by closely-spaced scours; these beds are interpreted as partially reworked fine grained tails of bypassing flows with evidence for flow deflection. The erosional features are interpreted as giant scour-fills. The internal architecture suggests different evolutionary histories for each case. The Unit A 5 scour-fill shows a simple cut-and-fill history with lateral and upward transitions from siltstone- to sandstone-prone deposits. In contrast, the Fan 3 scour-fill shows headward erosion and lengthening of the <b>scour</b> <b>surface</b> suggesting temporal changes in the interaction between turbidity currents and the <b>scour</b> <b>surface.</b> This relationship could support the occurrence of a hydraulic jump during part of the fill history, {{while the majority of}} the fill represents deposition from subcritical flows. Diversity in scour preservation mechanisms could explain the variety in depositional histories. The architecture, sedimentary facies and palaeoflow patterns of the scour-fills are distinctly different to well documented adjacent basin-floor channel-fills at the same stratigraphic levels. The recognition of scour-fills helps to constrain their sedimentological and stratigraphic expression in the subsurface, and to improve our understanding of the stratigraphic architecture of channel-lobe transition zones...|$|R
40|$|Mudrock-dominated channel fills {{are common}} {{features}} of the fluvial Palaeogene Willwood Formation of Wyoming. These fills are small, on average 30 m wide and 3 m deep, and they vary from simple plugs to more lithologically complex fills with internal <b>scour</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Some fills preserve plant material, and others show pedogenic modification. All fills are located within metre-thick intervals of weakly pedogenically modified mudstones that surround ribbon sandstones. The intervals have previously been attributed to channel avulsion; the fine-grained channel fills are interpreted as crevasse-splay feeder channels within these avulsion deposits. Variation in fill type, particularly the presence of pedogenic features, appears {{to be related to}} floodplain drainage. Possible factors that influenced drainage were basin position of the fills and Palaeogene climate fluctuations, although the role of either is not unequivocal.

Sets of experiments have been performed to investigate time-dependent characteristics of scour holes around cylindrical and square piers and vertical-wall abutments under clear water conditions with uniform bed materials. In the course of the experiments, temporal variations in scour depth and scour contours were measured.

40|$|Some {{characteristic}} {{features of}} fluvioglacial deposits and a glacial drift {{in the coastal}} ice-free areas on the Soya Coast, Lutzow-Holm Bay are described and discussed {{on the basis of}} the data obtained by field survey in 1981. Two types of fluvioglacial deposits in the Langhovde area indicate that the ice sheet would have receded from the area, leaving small ice masses in small rock basins, and that the flood plain type deposits were deposited during the last 6000 years, considerably later than the former event. A glacial drift found in a part of the Skarvsnes area is notably thick in comparison with those in other areas and is thought to have been deposited by the ice sheet as lodgement till on the basis of its depositional facies.

30|$|In {{the study}} area, nearshore subaqueous fans {{developed}} in the Shaobo, Xiaoliuzhuang, and Zhouzhuang areas during the E 2 d 1 period, and these can be further divided into three microfacies: inner fan, middle fan, and outer fan. The inner fan subfacies is characterized by {{one or a few}} main channels which can be described as undercompensated incised valleys (Liu 2003). The main channel consists of poorly sorted mottled conglomerates and sandy conglomerates that have complex compositions and are commonly matrix-supported and/or grain-supported. Those that are matrix-supported are interpreted to have been deposited by debris flows, characterized by gravels floating randomly in a fine-grained matrix (appearing structureless) (Fig.  3 f). Resultant successions have sharp boundaries or <b>scour</b> <b>surfaces</b> at their base and load structures developed towards the underlying unit. Grain-supported conglomerates, on the other hand, are thought to have been deposited by high-density turbidity currents. Deposits of such turbidity currents (turbidites) are typified by normal and reverse graded bedding, occasional crude cross bedding, and slump deformation structures. The corresponding SP curve of such successions displays a jagged bell- or cylinder-shaped pattern.|$|R

30|$|Fan deltas occur {{mainly in}} the {{southern}} steep slope of the Gaoyou Depression, with three subfacies: fan delta plain, fan delta front, and profan delta. The fan delta plain subfacies is the subaerial part of the fan delta and contains distributary channels and back swamps. It is comparable with high-energy gravel-rich braided river facies (Blair and McPherson 1994; Lin et al. 2003; Krézsek et al. 2010). Distributary channels, which are the dominant microfacies of the fan delta plain, consist of gray or mottled conglomerate, gray conglomeratic sandstone, and coarse sandstone. The conglomerate gravels are common poorly sorted, subangular to subrounded in shape, and randomly distributed in a matrix of fine- to coarse-grained sands which indicate proximal deposition. Also, they have complex compositions, which include siliceous rocks, phyllite, limestone, mud pebbles and gypsum, and have diameters ranging from 1 to 8  cm. The structureless conglomerates overlie basal <b>scour</b> <b>surfaces</b> and progressively change upwards into parallel-bedded conglomeratic sandstones and coarse-grained sandstones. These characteristics suggest deposition from waning high-density flows. The spontaneous potential logs (SP) are jagged with low to moderate amplitudes. The brown mudstones and silty mudstones are interpreted as deposits of a back-swamp environment.|$|R

Dark regions are interpreted as smooth and bright regions are interpreted as rough. Of the 518 features, 256 are centered on impact craters (crater haloes), 53 are centered upon small central disturbances (disrupted splotches), {{and the remaining}} 209 exhibit no central structure (craterless splotches). Most researchers interpret these features as airburst scars. Previous models of airburst formation only reproduced subsets of the observations. Models of splotch and halo formation were often mutually exclusive and no previous model connected them despite their similarities. I rectify this problem with a model that successfully reproduces 514 of the 518 patterns given appropriate airburst altitude and energy conditions combined with erosion. In my model, dark zones are pulverized rock, and bright zones are <b>scoured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> More complicated patterns are obtained with modification of the initial dark/bright pattern. Small impactors that do not penetrate the atmosphere cannot cause surface damage. Large impactors that penetrate the atmosphere without disruption create an impact crater without an associated airburst scar. Only intermediate-size impactors, partially or wholly disrupted in the near-surface zone, form airburst scars.

The wells were located at Pukearuhe Beach, Taranaki, New Zealand and were situated along strike of the palaeoslope. The formation isinterpreted as a slope fan setting and the interval logged {{was dominated by}} a major channel that incised into older channel-levee and overbank fan facies. The <b>scour</b> <b>surface</b> and the distinctive channel-fill enabled the two wells, Pukearuhe Central and Pukearuhe North, to be correlated with the local outcrop. The sedi-mentary deposits within the studied section were divided into three facies associations: channel-fill, channel levee and overbank deposits. The channel deposits exhibited similar facies in both wells. The dip data from the image logs indicate that he original channel was in-filled by sedimentation dipping towards the NW, the same orientation as the regional palaeoslope. In contrast, analysis of the levee and overbank deposits indicated little correlatability between the two wells, with beds dipping, locally up to 10 ~ in directions ranging from up-slope (SE) to oblique (NE) to the palaeoslope. The variation in dip directions in the levee and overbank deposits is attributed to scouring and infilling of irregular topography atand beyond the channel margin. As a reservoir prospect the thicker channel sands would be a preferential play to the laterally discontinuous thin beds...|$|R

The area is beneath the strongly flowing Loop Current. The bedforms have not been adequately sampled but probably consist of winnowed siliciclastic-foraminiferal sands. The size (about 200 m from wingtip to wingtip) {{and shape of the}} large barchans is consistent with a previously observed peak current speed of 30 cm/s, measured 25 m above the seabed. The types of small-scale bedforms and the <b>scoured</b> <b>surfaces</b> of chemical crusts, seen on nearby bottom photographs, indicate that near-bed currents in excess of 30 cm/s may sometimes occur. At the time of the survey the sand transport direction was to the northwest, in the opposite direction to the Loop Current but consistent with there being a deep boundary current along the foot of the Florida Escarpment. Some reworking of the underlying sandy turbidites and debris flow deposits is apparent on the sidescan sonar records. Reworking by deep-sea currents, resulting in erosion and in deposits characterised by coarsening upwards structures and cross-bedding, is a process that has been proposed for sand found in cores in shallower parts of the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine grain size {{distribution}} over dunes at the White Sands dune field, 1214 geolocated surficial samples were collected and analyzed by laser diffraction. Local variations in dunes such as neighboring interdune types {{and the presence of}} vegetation, deflation features, and granule ripples on the dunes were noted. This study indicates that recrystallization of gypsum and the generation of fresh sediments is occurring in significant quantities within interdunes, providing both high and low anomalies in grain size distribution through much of the central portion of the dune field. Other local variations as previously mentioned such as <b>scour</b> <b>surfaces</b> on dunes and local topographic alteration of air movement all overprint more field-scale effects. Coarse sands are found in granule ripples in troughs and swales and in avalanche deposits on the slipface apron. Saltating sand samples selected by microscopy from the stoss face of dunes showed a general coarsening trend with relative elevation. Samples collected to the lee of dune crests were generally finer-grained than those on the stoss side, and interdune samples collected within 60 m of the slipface aprons may indicate a lee sheltering influence extending well across the interdune. Patches of finer-grained sediments were found on dunes downwind of vegetated interdunes, and where it was present on dunes, vegetation was associated with deposition of comparatively finer grains in its immediate vicinity. To effectively model transport, these variations will all have to be taken into account. ...|$|R
