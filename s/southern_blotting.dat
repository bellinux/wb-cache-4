25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or {{sieving medium}} during electrophoresis, {{the movement of}} a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but {{may be used as}} a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting</b> for further characterization.|$|E
25|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are selectable marker genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during {{the development of the}} construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA into plants from its Ti plasmid, and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting.</b> The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion.|$|E

40|$|Gelsolin is a plasma and cytoskeletal {{protein that}} severs actin {{filaments}} and is regulated by both Ca+ 2 and polyphosphoinositides. The {{two forms of}} gelsolin are encoded by a single gene and derived through alternative message splicing. By <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal localization, we demonstrate that the gelsolin gene is present on human chromosome 9 in bands q 32 -q 34. In situ hybridization of gelsolin to cells containing a Philadelphia chromosome [(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) ], as well as <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis of K 562 cell DNA, indicates that gelsolin is centromeric to the ABL locus in 9 q 34. <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis of NotI-digested, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-separated DNA indicates the gelsolin gene is {{greater than or equal}} to 40 kb centromeric to ABL.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer cases with defective mismatch repair (ie, Lynch syndrome) have large genomic deletions or duplications in the mismatch repair genes, hMLH 1 and hMSH 2, {{which can be}} challenging to detect by traditional methods. For this study, we developed and validated a novel <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis method that allows for ascertainment {{of the extent of}} the dosage alterations on an exon-by-exon basis and compared this method to a second novel technique, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). From a total of 254 patients referred for Lynch syndrome testing, 20 of the 118 MLH 1 cases and 42 of the 136 MSH 2 cases had large genomic alterations, as detected by <b>Southern</b> <b>blot.</b> MLPA and <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> results were concordant with the exception of three major discrepancies: one {{because of a lack of}} MLPA probes for the region altered, another because of a point mutation near the MLPA probe ligation site, and another that was unexplained. Compared to <b>Southern</b> <b>blot,</b> MLPA has a shorter turn-around time, the analysis is less costly, less time-consuming, and less labor-intensive, and results are generally clear and unambiguous. However, concerns with MLPA include the presence of false-negatives and -positives because of positioning of probes and DNA variants near the probe ligation site. Overall, both <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> and MLPA provide important tools for the complete evaluation of patients with Lynch syndrome...|$|R

Thus far all information about the physical state of HBV in mononuclear blood cells comes from <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis and in situ hybridization. In this study we focused our attention on the presence of HBV DNA sequences in PBMCs of 30 patients with acute type B hepatitis and 6 patients with chronic active hepatitis by utilizing both <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis showed no HBV DNA sequences in PBMCs of the acute hepatitis patients, although the sensitivity of our method enabled us to detect as little as 1 pg of cloned HBV insert.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) amplification of T cell receptor (TCR) beta and gamma chain genes {{as a means of}} demonstrating monoclonality in T cell lymphomas using histological samples; to compare the performance of PCR with <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. METHODS [...] TCR-beta, TCR-gamma and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes were analysed using PCR in 55 cases of T cell lymphoma (28 frozen tissue and 27 paraffin wax embedded samples), diagnosed using morphological and immunohistochemical criteria. The 28 frozen samples were subjected to <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis using TCR-beta, TCR-gamma and IGH gene probes. Twenty five B cell lymphomas and 21 non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue samples were used as controls. RESULTS [...] Using TCR-beta PCR, monoclonality was detected in 24 (44 %) of 55 T cell lymphomas compared with 43 (78 %) of 55 using TCR-gamma PCR and in 82 % with both techniques. Five (9 %) of 55 T cell lymphomas were IGH PCR positive. None of the non-neoplastic lymphoid control samples were PCR positive. All B cell lymphomas showed a polyclonal pattern with TCR-beta PCR while a single B cell lymphoma was positive using TCR-gamma primers. With TCR-beta PCR, a monoclonal result was seen in 12 (43 %) of 28 frozen samples of T cell lymphoma, compared with 23 (82 %) of 28 using <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. With TCR-gamma PCR, 19 (68 %) of 28 frozen tissue samples were positive, compared with 26 (93 %) of 28 using <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. A single case showed IGH rearrangement by <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. CONCLUSION [...] TCR-gamma PCR should be the method of choice for analysis of clonality in paraffin wax embedded sections of lymphoproliferative lesions, as TCR-beta PCR has a high false negative rate. <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis remains the most successful technique when sufficient fresh tissue samples and resources are available...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of N-myc DNA amplification in human neuroblastoma tumors {{has been shown}} to be an independent prognostic factor predicting rapid progression of disease. <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis has been used previously to detect N-myc amplification in these tumors. The authors report an analysis of N-myc gene expression by in situ hybridization in 28 human neuroblastoma tumors previously studied by <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. In the LA-N- 5 human neuroblastoma cell line known to be amplified for N-myc, reaction conditions favoring RNA-RNA hybridization yielded an optimal signal. Using these hybridization conditions, in situ hybridization analysis of N-myc expression in 28 human neuroblastoma tissues correlated perfectly with N-myc DNA amplification in these tumors as detected by <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. In particular, there were no tumors in which N-myc RNA expression was found by in situ hybridization analysis in the absence of DNA amplification detectable by <b>Southern</b> <b>blot,</b> nor were there tumors that had DNA amplification in the absence of RNA expression. Heterogeneity of N-myc RNA expression was observed both among cells in any given tumor area, as well as within different areas of a single tumor. N-myc expression by in situ hybridization analysis was not observed in those tumors with more neuronally differentiated, ganglioneuroma histology. It is concluded that in situ hybridization of tissue sections is as effective as <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis of tumor cell DNA in identifying human neuroblastoma tumors in which the N-myc gene is of prognostic significance...|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} DNA fragments containing nonribosomal repetitive sequences {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} genome of Aspergillus fumigatus and tested as potential DNA fingerprinting probes.

Individual clones from two families were tested and were found to generate complex <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization patterns which are stable within a single strain over many generations, which vary among unrelated strains, and which are amenable to computer-assisted analyses involving large numbers of strains in epidemiological studies. Clones from three of the families clustered a majority of test strains {{in a similar fashion}} in individual dendrograms based on similarity coefficients computed from band positions in <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization patterns.
