50|$|The {{perspective}} of historical embeddedness {{is composed of}} two main ideas: {{the idea that a}} relationship exists between an individual's development and the <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting</b> around them, and also how this setting evolves over time. During the time of adolescence, Baltes believed the <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting</b> in which an individual develops plays a distinct {{role in the development of}} their personality. This has been exemplified in numerous studies, including Nesselroade and Baltes’, who showed that the level and direction of change in adolescent personality development was influenced as strongly by the socio-cultural settings at the time (in this case, the Vietnam War) as age related factors. The study involved individuals of four different adolescent age groups who all showed significant personality development in the same direction (a tendency to occupy themselves with ethical, moral, and political issues rather than cognitive achievement). Similarly, Edler showed that the Great Depression was a setting that significantly affected the development of adolescents and their corresponding adult personalities, by showing a similar common personality development across age groups. Baltes’ theory also states that the historical <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting</b> had an effect on the development of an individual's intelligence. The areas of influence that Baltes thought most important to the development of intelligence were health, education, and work. The first two areas, health and education, significantly affect adolescent development as a healthy child, who is educated effectively, will develop a higher level of intelligence. The environmental factors, health and education, have been suggested by Neiss and Rowe to have as much effect on intelligence as inherited intelligence. The second idea of historical embeddedness is that this <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting</b> evolves over time. Therefore, during adolescence, when intelligence is influenced significantly, advances in the areas of health, education, and type of work available to adolescents will show an effect that persists into adulthood. This effect of intelligence not only changing with time (as people age), but also varying by the historical time period a person developed in, was shown in a study by Schaie on adults only ten years apart in age. This study showed that intelligence levels change by cohort, or historical time.|$|E
50|$|Asuravithu (The Demon Seed; 1972) {{which is}} set in a fictional Valluvanadan village named Kizhakkemuri can be {{considered}} almost as a sequel to Naalukettu. It has the same geophysical and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting.</b> The novel describes the plight of the protagonist Govindankutty, the youngest son of a proud Nair tharavadu, as he is trapped between the social scenario, social injustice and his own inner consciousness. In Asuravithu there are clear indications of the damaging impact of an alien culture in the pollution of the indigenous culture and the disintegration of the family and the community. These two early novels—Naalukettu and Asuravithu—depict a phase in which the economic and cultural scenario of Kerala manifested symptoms which were to develop into dangerous ecocidal tendencies at a later stage.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{historical}} and socio-cultural context of Korean political economy and its relationships with {{important aspects of}} Korean business environment. The work dedicates significant space to chaebols as specific business organizational structures {{and the application of}} Korean paradigm of rationality to the reform following 1997 International Monetary and Financial Crisis. The main part of the thesis focuses on the analysis of Korean political economy from the viewpoint of its institutional comparative advantage, through which Korean cultural characteristics influence commodity structure of Korean international trade and Korea's patent specialisation profile. The main contribution of the thesis lies in its effort to document mutual relationships and links among various aspects of Korean political economy. The findings of the thesis show that Korea's socio-cultural characteristics still represent an important factor influencing Korean business environment and local form of capitalism. The continuing existence and success of chaebols in current economy implies that the socio-cultural and economic sources of their existence still prevail despite the increasing number of conglomerates of non-chaebol types operating in Korea since post-crisis reform. The application of "Eastern paradigm" to the post-crisis reform reveals that the reform was based on "Western paradigm" of highly liberal Anglo-American form of capitalism and crisis management was thus ethnocentrically biased. Regarding the institutional comparative advantage, the thesis concludes Korea can be regarded as a group coordinated market economy where mutual links among various agents of its political economy are of outmost importance, with some aspects of liberal market economies. The main coordination mechanism of Korean political economy can be characterised as thick networks of highly particularistic socio-economic relationships based on Korean socio-cultural characteristics. This institutional and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>set</b> up provides Korean companies with capacities that favour companies'preference of incremental innovation production strategies.

40|$|Summary Based on a {{qualitative}} study contrasting a gender-relationally restrictive <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>setting</b> with a rather liberal one, we explain how social norms shape resource negotiation for women seeking modern healthcare. A system of "protection and dependency" covers them in principle for obviously serious illness, {{as far as}} household resources permit. In both settings, however, women must have "well behaved" and justify less-obvious needs in an unequal bargaining process with ambivalent recourse opportunities. Consequently, women may suffer delays in or exclusion from healthcare. Moreover, their self-esteem may lower and the domestic power imbalance may increase. The results suggest sectoral and sector-crosscutting solutions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Much of the {{literature}} on the relationship between conflict-related trauma and high risk sexual behaviour (HRSB) often focuses on refugees and not mass in-country displaced people due to armed conflicts. There is paucity of research about contexts underlying HRSB and HIV/AIDS in conflict and post-conflict communities in Uganda. Understanding factors that underpin vulnerability to HRSB in post-conflict communities is vital in designing HIV/AIDS prevention interventions. We explored the socio-cultural factors, social interactions, socio-cultural practices, social norms and social network structures that underlie war trauma and vulnerability to HRSB in a post-conflict population. Methods We did a cross-sectional qualitative study of 3 sub-counties in Katakwi district and 1 in Amuria in Uganda between March and May 2009. We collected data using 8 FGDs, 32 key informant interviews and 16 in-depth interviews. We tape-recorded and transcribed the data. We followed thematic analysis principles to manage, analyse and interpret the data. We constantly identified and compared themes and sub-themes in the dataset as we read the transcripts. We used illuminating verbatim quotations to illustrate major findings. Results The commonly identified HRSB behaviours include; transactional sex, sexual predation, multiple partners, early marriages and forced marriages. Breakdown of the social structure due to conflict had resulted in economic destruction and a perceived soaring of vulnerable people whose propensity to HRSB is high. Dishonour of sexual sanctity through transactional sex and practices like incest mirrored the consequence of exposure to conflict. HRSB was associated with concentration of people in camps where idleness and unemployment were the norm. Reports of girls and women who had been victims of rape and defilement by men with guns were common. Many people were known to have started to display persistent worries, hopelessness, and suicidal ideas and to abuse alcohol. Conclusions The study demonstrated that conflicts disrupt the <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>set</b> up of communities and destroy sources of people's livelihood. Post-conflict socio-economic reconstruction needs to encompass programmes that restructure people's morals and values through counselling. HIV/AIDS prevention programming in post-conflict communities should deal with socio-cultural disruptions that emerged during conflicts. Some of the disruptions if not dealt with, could become normalized yet they are predisposing factors to HRSB. Socio-economic vulnerability as a consequence of conflict seemed to be associated with HRSB through alterations in sexual morality. To pursue safer sexual health choices, people in post-conflict communities need life skills. </p...|$|R

Centrally, I consider how different forms of knowledge can inform our interpretations of security.

I argue {{that it is necessary to}} prioritise context when using theoretical concepts in order to fully situate our research. Adopting an interpretive approach not only in relation to Kyrgyzstan, but also securitization theory, I highlight the pluralities and contradictions of how security means in different settings and on different analytical levels.

The dramatic political change {{in the aftermath of the}} 30 September 1965 coup attempt was crucial in the development of Islam in West Java.

40|$|Research work {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of how the present results of the agrarian transformation in the New States have - since unification - created starting conditions for a prospering economic and <b>socio-cultural</b> development. <b>Setting</b> social transformations aside, the development in the agricultural sector results to a greater part from the agrarian policies in the former Soviet Zone of Occupation and GDR. At the onset, a critical ideological analysis of above all the ideas of the former German Social Democracy and Marxism is presented, as they were the ideological justification for the first agrarian transformation. Land reform began in the summer of 1945. All farms larger than approx. 2. 5 British acres were nationalised without compensation. A greater part of the confiscated land was cut in to very small fields. Large farms continued to exist above all in Saxony and Thuringia. Political directives of the SED (East German Communist Party) {{led to the creation of}} agrarian co-operatives (LPG) in 1952. They followed the model of the Soviet kolkhoz. The LPG's were no coherent with the idea of a co-operative as they were a kind of state farm, with farmers as agrarian employees. In general, functionaries of the SED were in charge. A massive process of agro-industrialisation followed in the decades after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Latifundiums of up to 25. 000 acres resulted. A law dealing with adjustments in the agrarian sector was passed after the economic and political collapse of the GDR. The aim was the adjustment of the East German agricultural sector to a social market economy. The law on restitution and compensation payments (EALG) passed in 1994 was meant to compensate the victims of the communist land reform. The law determined that affected persons could purchase equivalent land at reduced prices. Yet, specific clauses within the law made a fair compensation in reality impossible. The agro-industrial structures that had resulted from the forced collectivising of the SED-dictatorship were in general maintained. Up to 90 % of farming land in the Ostvorpommern Region analysed in this study are today the private property of former SED agro-functionaries. There are over 1. 600 large farms in the New States that incorporate more than 2. 500 acres of agricultural area. A hand-over of power by the regional elite's has not taken place. The new socio-political developments of 1989 / 90 in the GDR have to a much smaller extent established themselves in today's rural areas compared to the urban centres. Rather more, it must be established, that the previous cadre structures have remained and in some cases continue to act as 'secret societies'. Economic initiatives under these conditions did not fulfil the expectations. The result was a considerable migration of the work force. As a result, the study presents suggestion for law reform...|$|R
40|$|Journalistic {{translation}} research (JTR) is {{a fairly}} young research discipline. It emerged mostly in the 1990 s, and more contributions from 2000 onwards installed JTR as a dedicated field of study, as attested by chapters in The Routledge Handbook of Translation Studies (2013) and Handbook of Translation Studies (2010 and 2012), a special issue of Language and Intercultural Communication devoted to the topic (Bassnett 2005), the publication of Translation in Global News in 2009 (Bielsa and Bassnett), and important contributions by reputed translation scholars such as Gambier (2010) and Schäffner (2005, 2012 a, 2012 b).

This process is usually carried out by journalists who are mostly not professional translators, and for whom the more strictly defined trade of interlingual translation is a second-rate aspect of a much more comprehensive and complex journalistic process (cf. Van Doorslaer’s 2012 term journalators, and cf. Gambier 2010, Valdeon 2010). The process of journalistic interlingual translation and the immediate context in which this is carried out has become the subject of some extensive studies {{in the last five}} years, following Bielsa and Bassnett’s (2009) discussion of ethnographic approaches to translation practices in major news agencies. These include Davier’s work (2012, 2014) on the role and visibility of translation in the Swiss headquarters of AFP and the Swiss agency ATS, as well as the study of the journalistic translation process on a micro-level using techniques such as keystroke logging and eye tracking by Perrin and Ehrensberger-Dow (2013). The current paper, however, focusses on the translation products resulting from a non-professional didactic context. Thus, with this paper we aim to gain some insight into the techniques and skills to be acquired by students, and investigate (ways to promote and measure) their creativity in the process of journalistic written adaptation or localization. The preliminary investigation is based on 60 Ba 3 students’ translations from English into Dutch of opinion columns and longer articles written by specialists on the topics of Muslim attacks in Europe, devolution and science. The required interdisciplinary skills are related to both translation and writing, but also – it has been argued by Bassnett (2005) - to interpreting. The criteria which are included for the assessment of the translated articles are situated on the textual level (cf. editing and the organization of textual content), and relate further also to perspective and repositioning of readership. Creativity is gauged with reference to the students’ transadaptation of metaphors and culture specific references (including popular culture), use of explicitation / rephrasing or deletion, word choice (including Anglicisms), the translation of multi-hyphenated ad hoc formations (e. g. a publish-and-be-damned devil-may-care attitude), syntax (cf. syntactic borrowing), and transadaptation of headlines. It is argued in this paper that adaptation to the intended function of the journalistic article in the new <b>socio-cultural</b> target <b>setting</b> can only be effected if the journalistic translator or transeditor balances a creative writer’s choices with both a translator’s and an interpreter’s rendering of a source text’s intended function.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades of the 1900 ’s, {{businesses}} started to - in a broader sense than before - acknowledge the economic relevance of intangible components, such as emotional experiences, of products and services. This dissertation explores how the so-called lifestyle hotel segment reflects the <b>socio-cultural</b> currents that <b>set</b> the conditions for these changes in the Western economy. The aim {{of the study is}} to show the work of the mechanisms of this emotional production, in place and by means of tangible tools. The methodological thrust is that of cultural analysis; i. e. micro-studies of small events and limited milieus as reflections of broader societal and cultural contexts. Examples of empirical sources are interviews, observations, newspaper clippings, Internet sites and digital discussion fora. The study dissects the phenomenon of lifestyle hotels into some central elements that are central to the “cultural economy” at large; elements such as otherness, uniqueness, singularity, rebellion, estrangement, individualism, innovation, boldness and newness. The thesis analyses the logics and practices through which the cultural economy is materialized – what it feels, smells, sounds and looks like. The dissertation discusses the linking capacities of the lifestyle hotels, and describes how hotel operators apply a number of selective strategies {{in order to maintain the}} guest group as homogenous and representative for the hotel’s image as possible. A great deal of the analysis circles around an emotional charge that is significant to the world of lifestyle hotels. The text describes how lifestyle hotel operators call forth the vision of their hotels as imaginary dream worlds, spiritual and emotional experiences, in order to make them attractive to the market. Partly, the dissertation discusses the aesthetic strategies used by lifestyle hotel operators and the visitor’s emotional response to this visual communication of the hotel. The dissertation also analyses the charging of products and services with “specialness”. This charging seems to be connected to an emotional competence – in order to make their hotels appear as special and unique, the operators need to possess an ability to evoke feelings. Lastly, the dissertation discusses how the ideals and logics that steer the cultural construction of a lifestyle hotel are being reproduced and transmitted by means of what could be called two management tools, or translation processes: imitation/inspiration and the writing of scripts for how to create the unique and special...|$|R
