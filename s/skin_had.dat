5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the <b>skin,</b> <b>had</b> a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E

A medical examination revealed Beineman had been extensively beaten about the face and body, with some lacerations inflicted being so severe sections of <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been removed, exposing subcutaneous tissues. She had received extensive skull and brain injuries which had been inflicted with a blunt instrument, {{had been forced to}} ingest a caustic substance, and her neck, shoulders, nipples and breasts had been burned with the same caustic agent. As had been the case with previous victims, her killer had placed a section of cloth in her throat to muffle her screams throughout her torture.|$|E
25|$|The early reptile-like {{amphibians}} {{were mostly}} aquatic, the first highly terrestrially adapted groups being the Seymouriamorpha and the Diadectomorpha. The seymouriamorphs were small to medium-sized animals with stout limbs, their remains are sometimes found {{in what has}} been interpreted as dry environments, indicating their <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> a water-tight epidermal horny overlay or even scales as evident in Discosauriscus. Their skeletons are very similar to those of early reptiles, though finds of seymouriamorph tadpoles have shown they retained an amphibian reproduction. The Diadectomorphan families are generally considered to be the closest known relatives of modern amniotes. They too are thought to have been on the amphibian side of the divide, despite no known diadectomorph fossil tadpoles. Analysis of new finds and composition of larger trees do however indicate the phylogeny may not be as well understood as traditionally thought.|$|E

25|$|Love's musical career {{started with}} a brief {{position}} as a singer in Faith No More. Love also founded the all-female group Babes in Toyland with Kat Bjelland, though she {{was kicked out of}} the band. Love formed Hole in 1989, and the band released their debut album Pretty on the Inside in 1991. Love married Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in 1992, and the same year their child Frances Bean Cobain was born. The band's next album, Live Through This, was released in 1994 a week after Cobain's death. Live Through This became the band's best-selling album, topped the annual Village Voice Pazz & Jop critic's poll and was listed by Time in a 100 best albums list. Hole's third album, Celebrity <b>Skin,</b> <b>had</b> lower U.S. sales than Live Through This, but received critical acclaim, and the album's title track garnered them their first No. 1 single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.|$|E
25|$|Metallurgist Terry Heaslip of the Canadian company Accident Investigation and Research Inc. {{examined}} the aircraft {{skin from the}} tail and found signs of overheating, specifically that the <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been repeatedly flexed, through a phenomenon known as flutter. This caused investigators to further scrutinize {{the tail of the}} aircraft. Furthermore, the investigation team found that the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), which was in the tail, generated heat which melted certain plastic parts, indicating that the APU was operating during the flight even though it normally would not be. The mechanic who had inspected the aircraft {{on the day of the}} accident flight told the investigators that one of the aircraft's two main generators had failed and that he was not able to repair the faulty generator. The investigators discovered that the pilots had noted in the flight log that they operated the APU during the flight, since two power sources are required for flight. They also discovered that the front APU mount was broken, which allowed it to vibrate excessively.|$|E

Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.|$|E
500|$|A {{specimen}} {{was captured}} in 1929 during the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine to Madagascar, but the rodents obtained by the expedition were never studied in detail. It {{was not until the}} 1970s that Karl Koopman and Guy Musser recognized that the animal—whose <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> landed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while the skull was at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris—represented an otherwise unknown species. However, they never published their results. In 1993, Steven Goodman rediscovered the species on Madagascar and in 1996 he and Michael Carleton finally published a formal description. They named the animal Monticolomys koopmani, as the sole member of a new genus. The generic name Monticolomys means [...] "mountain-dwelling mouse" [...] and refers to the animal's montane habitat, and the specific name koopmani honors Karl Koopman for his many contributions to mammalian systematics. Common names in use for the animal also include [...] "Koopman's Montane Voalavo" [...] and [...] "Malagasy Mountain Mouse".|$|E
500|$|The {{healing of}} the blister under the silver {{electrode}} {{was of no}} importance for a counter-irritation procedure, but it suggested to Bird that the electric moxa might be used for treating obstinate leg ulcers. [...] This was a common complaint among the working classes in Bird's time, and hospitals could not admit {{the majority of cases}} for treatment. [...] The moxa improved the situation by enabling sufferers to be treated as outpatients. The silver electrode of the moxa was applied to the ulcer to be healed, while the zinc electrode was applied a few inches away to a place where the upper layer of <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been cut away. [...] The whole apparatus was then bandaged in place as before. [...] The technique was successfully applied by others on Bird's recommendation. [...] Thomas Wells later discovered that it was unnecessary to damage the skin under the zinc plate. [...] He merely moistened the skin with vinegar before applying the zinc electrode.|$|E

500|$|Polynesian peoples {{often did}} not {{recognize}} Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the Tuamotu Archipelago it was known as Hiro, meaning [...] "twist as a thread of coconut fiber", and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro ("great paunch of Hiro"), which was either {{a name for the}} modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena (after a goddess), on Mangaia and Puanga-hori (false Puanga, the name for Rigel), in New Zealand. In the Society Islands, Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally [...] "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the [...] "pillar for elocution". The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into gum trees in the dreamtime.

500|$|The first specimen, AMNH 5240, was {{discovered}} in 1911 by Barnum Brown in Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada, and secured by him in the Fall of 1912. As well as an almost complete skeleton, the find was notable because impressions {{of much of the}} creature's <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> also survived. The specimen came from the Belly River Group of the province. The left or underside of the skeleton was preserved in carbonaceous clay, making it difficult to expose the skin. The skeleton was articulated, and only missing about the last [...] of the tail and the forelimbs. Both scapulae and coracoids are preserved in position, {{but the rest of the}} forelimbs are gone, except for phalanges and pieces of humeri, ulnae and radii. Apparently the remaining forelimbs were weathered or eroded away. Impressions of the integument were preserved covering over a large part of the skeletons outlining, and shows the form of the body. Another specimen, AMNH 5338, was found in 1914 by Brown and Peter Kaisen. Both specimens are now housed in the American Museum of Natural History in their original death poses.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been a medium-brown color {{during his}} youth, {{but from the}} mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{was born}} on May 21, 1917 at the Buffalo Horn Ranch in Clayton, New Mexico. His parents were Hilbart Alexander Anderson (1883–1952) and [...] Mary Frances Anderson (née Smith, 1886–1973). Regarding his ethnic ancestry, he later stated that [...] "I am mostly Irish and Spanish with some Native American, {{including}} Polynesian". He also claimed that his maternal great-grandmother {{had been one of}} the Blue Fugates, a community living in Appalachia whose <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> a blueish coloration due to methemoglobinemia. Anderson became almost completely blind when he was two years old, either because of an accident or untreated diabetes. By 1920, the family were living in Burkburnett, Wichita County, Texas, where a sister, Elsie Glenan Anderson, was born in February. Here, Hilbart worked as a floor worker on some of the many oil rigs in the town. From there they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they were recorded as living in the 192324 directory, and where Anderson later claimed that he had made many friends among Mexican migrant children. Anderson's later wife claimed that he was also instructed in how to use his etheric vision by [...] "Mexican Witches" [...] during childhood. The family next moved to Olustee, Oklahoma, where Hilbart's brother resided.|$|E
500|$|As Elizabeth aged {{her image}} {{gradually}} changed. She was portrayed as Belphoebe or Astraea, {{and after the}} Armada, as Gloriana, the eternally youthful Faerie Queene of Edmund Spenser's poem. Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic icons that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been scarred by smallpox in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics. Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss {{to such an extent}} that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech. André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, reported an audience with the queen, during which he noticed, [...] "her teeth are very yellow and unequal... and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." [...] Yet he added, [...] "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal." [...] Sir Walter Raleigh called her [...] "a lady whom time had surprised". However, the more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it.|$|E
500|$|A {{year later}} a further {{discovery}} {{was made at}} Lindow Moss, just [...] south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who {{had been involved in}} the discovery of Lindow Woman, took {{what he thought was a}} piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine. He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination. Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body, which later became known as Lindow Man. Some <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6 August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District General Hospital for storage. As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated. The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to London.|$|E

500|$|... 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a {{scheduled}} flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a [...] "thump". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected {{there had been}} a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden [...] "severe" [...] vibration began throughout the aircraft. The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the <b>skin</b> <b>had</b> become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The (AAIB) concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.|$|E
500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My <b>Skin,</b> <b>had</b> deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
