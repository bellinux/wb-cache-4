5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E

She became the first singer {{signed on to the}} label, followed by Glee actor Matthew Morrison, Mexican artist Diego Boneta and The Voice season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca.

5|$|Roddenberry {{had some}} {{difficulties}} with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols.

After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show, but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.|$|E
5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the SS Vina, a cargo steamer built in 1894, {{can be seen at}} low tide.

The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E

5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} November 7, the Northwest Signal, local paper for nearby Napoleon, Ohio, {{reported}} that Deshler merchants were considering taking up a collection to send Cole to Washington; {{the following day}} the paper editorialized that she, along with whoever actually made the sign, be sent to Washington to see the inauguration. On November 19, 1968, campaign special assistant and longtime Nixon advisor Murray Chotiner proposed inviting the Cole family to the inauguration and having Vicki Cole ride the theme float. The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee. Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the theme float in the inaugural parade.|$|E

5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> to portray Ro {{as a main}} {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Justin Timberlake {{became the}} first to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> to the project. He was soon {{followed}} by Mila Kunis when she landed the female lead opposite him. Approximately two months later, Variety magazine announced that an ensemble cast consisting of Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman were set to join them in the film. Three days after principal filming began, Bryan Greenberg completed the cast. The film features cameo appearances from Shaun White, Jason Segel, and Rashida Jones. Production locations were set up as early as July 13, and principal filmography commenced on July 20, 2010 in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City.

5|$|Invited to the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral in July 1981, Livingstone – {{a republican}} {{critical}} of the monarchy – wished the couple well but turned down the offer. He also permitted Irish republican protesters to hold a vigil {{on the steps of}} County Hall throughout the wedding celebrations, both actions that enraged the press. His administration supported the People's March for Jobs, a demonstration of 500 anti-unemployment protesters who marched to London from Northern England, allowing them to sleep in County Hall and catering for them. Costing £19,000, critics argued that Livingstone was illegally using public money for his own political causes. The GLC orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Thatcher's government, in January 1982 erecting a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the top of County Hall – clearly visible from the Houses of Parliament – stating the number of unemployed in London.|$|E

5|$|Janet Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American pop singer-songwriter and actress, who is {{considered}} to be a gay icon.

5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity.

In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the shoulders of their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL.
