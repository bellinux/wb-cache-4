40|$|ABSTRACT—TransLink {{currently}} has <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> in its security policy making it vulnerable to {{attacks in the}} form of fraud and fare evasion. Exploitation of the newly celebrated U-pass program may be approached from several levels. The economic implications of these losses significantly impact TransLink’s business model. Hence, to drive revenue opportunities while upgrading quality of service, a smart card TransLink system is proposed. Smart cards are by evolution more functionally secure and scalable than magnetic stripe technologies currently utilized by TransLink. They also address other transit challenges such as rate of passenger processing and validation of fare. An implementation of a secure smart card system will both transform a legacy security system and enhance Translink’s value proposition to customers.

40|$|Many product {{innovation}} studies have described key determinants that {{should lead to}} successful incremental {{product innovation}}. Despite numerous studies suggesting how incremental product innovation should be successfully undertaken, many firms still struggle {{with this type of}} innovation. In this paper, we use an institutional perspective to investigate why established firms in the financial services industry struggle with their complex incremental product innovation efforts. We argue that although the impact of micro institutional forces is often overlooked in innovation studies, these forces matter for innovation success. Our study complements the existing innovation literature and provides an additional explanation why incremental product innovation is highly complex and suffers from <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> in established firms. Using qualitative data from the Dutch financial services sector collected over the period 1997 - 2002, the paper illustrates how micro institutional forces at the business unit level affect complex incremental product innovation and how the interaction of these forces delivers their impact. complex incremental product innovation;financial services sector;micro institutional forces;neo-institutional theory...|$|R

[...] He also cited Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.

2500|$|Having {{established}} liability, {{the litigation}} {{turned to the}} remedy. [...] In 1999, McCurn ruled on the appropriate method to calculate damages. [...] The court rejected the state's arguments that damages {{should be limited to}} the fair market value of the land {{at the time of the}} transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the original conveyances as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, the jury would not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damagesonly the economic value of the land.|$|E
2500|$|All {{directors}} owe {{the same}} fiduciary duties and directors each have joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference. [...] Independent {{research has found}} that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships. [...] This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.” [...] This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio. [...] Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time. [...] It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.|$|E

40|$|Quantifying {{economic}} capital and optimally allocating it into portfolios of financial instruments are two key topics in the asset–liability management of an insurance company. In general, {{these problems are}} studied in the literature by minimizing standard risk measures such as the value at risk and the conditional VaR. Motivated by Solvency II regulations, we introduce a novel optimization problem to solve for the optimal required capital and the portfolio structure simultaneously, when the ruin probability is used as an insurance solvency constraint. Besides the generic optimal required capital and portfolio problem formulation, we propose a two-model hierarchy of optimization models, where both models admit the so-called second-order conic reformulation, in turn making them particularly well suited for numerics. The first model, albeit naively asserting the normality of the returns on assets and liabilities, under minor further simplifications admits a closed-form solution—a set of formulas, which {{may be used as}} simple decision-making guidelines in the analysis of more complex scenarios. A potentially more realistic second model aims to represent the ‘heavy-tailed’ nature of an insurer's liabilities more accurately, while also allowing arbitrary distributions of asset returns via a semi-parametric approach. Extensive numerical simulations illustrate the sensitivity and robustness of the proposed approach relative to the model's parameters. In addition, we explore the potential of insurance risk diversification and discuss if combining <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> into a single insurance portfolio may always be beneficial for the insurer. Finally, we propose an extension of the model with an expected return on capital constraint added. 31 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The remark has {{occasionally}} {{been made}} {{that there is nothing}} that can accurately be called a 2 ̆ 2 law of tort 2 ̆ 2 {{in the sense of a}} systematic and logically coherent body of legal principles which disclose a consistent policy in the protection of those interests which it is the function of tort law to protect. This is partly or at least superficially true. Certainly legal literature does not reveal that quantity of analysis and systematic development of legal conceptions in the field of tort that has characterized the development of the law of contract. This may, in part, be explained by the somewhat checkered history of tort law, as compared with that of contract law. The diverse origins of the various 2 ̆ 2 torts, 2 ̆ 2 and the tardy ripening of the idea of negligence as a source of liability, together with the difficulties of rationalizing the <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> without fault are obvious impediments to the growth of a uniform and logical structure. What is perhaps more important, the wide range of interests that are protected by tort law and the varying shades of protection required therefor indicate a slow growth of the rational side of this branch of law as compared with the almost unitary interest protected by the law of contracts. Whereas the latter is concerned with the shaping of a consistent policy to protect the interest in the security of promised advantages, the former must work out adequate protection for the interests in bodily security and freedom, security of property, reputation, privacy, marital and other domestic relations, mental and emotional interests, pecuniary interests connected with transactions and trade and business generally...|$|R

In Spain, there is jurisprudence in civil jurisdiction based on the LOE to acquit or convict building agents, who are defined in the courts as “constructive managers” or similar. For this reason, courts could establish in the future <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> for the lean construction specialist and other agents of the project, depending on their actions and based on the implementation of the lean project delivery system, the target value design and the integrated project delivery.

The creation of the following agents is proposed: design manager, construction manager and contract manager, definitions that are developed in this study. These agents are loosely defined, because any project manager, building information modeling manager or similar may act as one or as more-than-one of them. Finally, the creation of the lean construction manager is also proposed, as the agent who takes on the role of the design manager, construction manager and contract manager, but focused on the lean production principles...|$|R

In Italy, the law n. 221 / 2012 has pushed forward a renewed interest for this topic, since it introduces the idea of “certified” incubator of start-ups, by listing a set of requirements that qualify a “good” incubator. Despite the recent activity of the policy makers and the large number of scholars’ contributions, there is still a lack of understanding about how incubation processes impact on {{the development of the}} start-ups and there is not a clear assessment of the effectiveness of incubators’ contribution (Tavoletti, 2013) in the innovation landscape. Given this background, our research aims at understanding whether or not mediation services offered by certified incubators help start-ups to develop early business-relationships. We want to shed light on the link between the characteristics of incubation process and the development of early market-relationships of the hosted start-ups. This topic is particularly relevant as the creation of early market-relationships is considered a “critical” step in newventures’ development, due to both an under-developed marketing function (Aaboen, Dubois, & Lind, 2011; La Rocca, Ford & Snehota, 2013) and <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> that affect start-ups (Roseira, Ramos, Maia, & Henneberg, 2014).
