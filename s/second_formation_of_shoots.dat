40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} the hormone concentration on bud and <b>shoot</b> multiplication <b>of</b> date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cv. Sukry was investigated. The results indicated that low hormones promoted the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> bud and <b>shoot</b> while high hormones inhibited the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> and buds. High hormones concentration resulted in abnormal growth and no sign <b>of</b> budding or <b>shoot</b> <b>formation.</b> The height <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> was severely decreased by increasing the hormone concentration.

40|$|Plants form shoot meristems in the {{so-called}} boundary region, and these meristems are necessary for normal morphogenesis of aerial parts of plants. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems are not fully understood. We report here that expression of a chimeric repressor from TCP 3 (TCP 3 SRDX), a member of TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, CYCLOIDEA, and PCF (TCP) transcription factors in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulted in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> ectopic <b>shoots</b> on cotyledons and various defects in organ development. Expression of TCP 3 SRDX induced ectopic expression of boundary-specific genes, namely the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes, and suppressed the expression of miR 164, whose product cleaves the transcripts of CUC genes. This abnormal phenotype was substantially reversed on the cuc 1 mutant background. By contrast, gain of function of TCP 3 suppressed the expression of CUC genes and resulted in the fusion of cotyledons and defects in <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoots.</b> The pattern <b>of</b> expression of TCP 3 did not overlap {{with that of the}} CUC genes. In addition, we found that eight TCPs had functions similar to that of TCP 3. Our results demonstrate that the TCP transcription factors play a pivotal role in the control <b>of</b> morphogenesis <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> organs by negatively regulating the expression of boundary-specific genes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} the protein <b>of</b> rolB affects <b>shoot</b> <b>formation</b> and whether this potential relationship depends on the developmental stages of the plant and/or on the culture conditions. Thin cell layers (TCL) and leaf explants were excised from tobacco plants in the vegetative and flowering stages and cultured under various hormonal conditions. In TCLs of vegetative-stage plants, the expression of rolB enhanced the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoot</b> buds under hormone-free conditions and with specific concentrations of auxin and/or cytokinin, Histological examination showed that the induction <b>of</b> the <b>shoot</b> meristemoids was particularly enhanced by rolB protein and that meristemoid growth was accelerated. In leaf explants from vegetative-stage plants, the expression of rolB increased the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> buds in the presence of 1 mu M IAA plus 1 or 10 mu M cytokinin, With BA alone, at a 0, 1 mu M concentration, shoot formation occurred in the transgenic explants only, whereas with concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to in mu M, it was higher in these explants than in controls. RolB protein enhanced the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> buds in TCLs from flowering plants under all hormonal conditions. In the presence of 1 mu M IAA and kinetin, the protein also increased the flowering response. In leaf explants from flowering plants, the expression of rolB increased the number <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> buds in the presence of 1 mu M IAA with 10 mu M BA, In conclusion, rolB protein promotes shoot formation; it seems to have a positive interaction with cytokinin and an effect on the induction of the meristematic condition...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a study}} concerning the influence of environmental factors on the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> summer <b>shoots</b> in young plants of Pinus silvestris L. grown in plastic green houses. A close relationship is found between the studied factors: CO 2, water, nutrients and the occurrence <b>of</b> summer <b>shoots.</b> Poor environmental conditions {{during the first year}} followed by improved conditions in the following year resulted in a great number of plants with summer shoots, whereas favourable conditions during the first year resulted in a low number of plants with summer shoots the following year. According to these results the conclusion is drawn that environmental conditions and especially those of the preceding year have a great influence on the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> summer <b>shoots</b> and on the shoot growth as well. As a hypothesis it is discussed that carbohydrates in the plant may influence the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> summer <b>shoots</b> and that this influence is mediated by growth regulators...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of climatic conditions was investigated on flowering behaviour of pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium Vis.). At low temperatures {{high numbers of}} plants initiated high numbers of flower heads. Both {{the development of the}} initiated flower heads and the vegetative development of the plants were stimulated by higher temperatures. The second aspect was the development of methods of vegetative propagation in vivo and in vitro. Through a culture of peduncle explants in vitro detailed information was obtained about the initiation and development of adventitious roots. With these data the process <b>of</b> adventitious root <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> cuttings in vivo was optimalized. In practice this method of vegetative propagation in vivo may be useful for a fast multiplication of selected healthy plants with high yields of pyrethrins.
