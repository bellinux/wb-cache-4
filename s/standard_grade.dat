25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an igloo design. The igloo {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a ready made apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber box frame design and were clad with galvanised iron, but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various igloo designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used <b>standard</b> <b>grade</b> Group C hardwood timber.|$|E

This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from <b>standard</b> <b>grade</b> Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E

40|$|The LYM {{property}} of a finite <b>standard</b> <b>graded</b> poset {{is one of}} the central notions in Sperner theory. It is known that the product of two finite <b>standard</b> <b>graded</b> posets satisfying the LYM properties may not have the LYM property again. In 1974, Harper proved that if two finite <b>standard</b> <b>graded</b> posets satisfying the LYM properties also satisfy rank logarithmic concavities, then their product also satisfies these two properties. However, Harper's proof is rather non-intuitive. Giving a natural proof of Harper's theorem {{is one of the}} goals of this thesis. The main new result of this thesis is a characterization of rank-finite <b>standard</b> <b>graded</b> LYM posets that satisfy rank logarithmic concavities. With this characterization theorem, we are able to give a new, natural proof of Harper's theorem. In fact, we prove a strengthened version of Harper's theorem by weakening the finiteness condition to the rank-finiteness condition. We present some interesting applications of the main characterization theorem. We also give a brief history of Sperner theory, and summarize all the ingredients we need for the main theorem and its applications, including a new equivalent condition for the LYM property that is a key for proving our main theorem...|$|R
