25|$|In 1971, an IBM {{team was}} {{assembled}} for an intensive planning session, thrashing out, 12 to 18 hours a day, how the technology would be deployed and operate cohesively across the system, and <b>scheduling</b> a <b>roll-out</b> plan. By 1973, the team were meeting with grocery manufacturers {{to introduce the}} symbol that {{would need to be}} printed on the packaging or labels of all of their products. There were no cost savings for a grocery to use it, unless at least 70% of the grocery's products had the barcode printed on the product by the manufacturer. IBM projected that 75% would be needed in 1975. Yet, although this was achieved, there were still scanning machines in fewer than 200 grocery stores by 1977.|$|R

[...] The critical reviews were mainly negative, with 186 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes showing only 21% of them were positive; typically the film {{was found to be}} [...] "heavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base".

5000|$|Writing {{about the}} album's release in The Guardian, Andrew W.K. {{stated that he}} wanted 55 Cadillac [...] "to sound like freedom," [...] {{partially}} inspired {{by the end of}} legal troubles that had plagued the release of his third album Close Calls with Brick Walls, continuing: [...] "The sound of a piano being played by a free man - nothing more, nothing less. This was the first chance in almost 10 years where I was allowed to simply play and record an instrument - no songwriters, no lyrics to learn, no overdubs, no slow fixes, no remixes, no video shoots or interview practice - just the sound of someone sitting in room playing piano for the sake of it. No one telling me what to play, or how to play it. And no masterplans, high-concept visions, worldwide goals with <b>roll-out</b> <b>schedules.</b> No style consultants or acting coaches. No more meetings with sponsors or computerized yelling. No more threats." ...|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, 99p Stores {{replaced}} their Torex electronic {{point of}} sale system with one provided by Futura to operate their touchscreen Intelligent Registers (IRs). As well as allowing the retailer to understand which products customers are buying, through up-to-date tracking {{of the most popular}} products, it will also allow stock to be moved around the business quickly. Other functionality includes its allocation and replenishment capabilities, helping to ensure constant stock via automated ordering. Following a successful pilot (in which the company tested the new system in a select number of stores before committing to it), Futura <b>scheduled</b> an ambitious <b>roll-out</b> programme at the end of 2009 to change both software and platform, reducing the normal roll-out period from six months to two months. The Futura team installed the system with Digipos touch-screen tills each evening after trading, enabling the store to start trading the very next day. Simultaneously, new chip-and-pin capability is being introduced, to ensure the company is PCI compliant, with contactless payments to follow.|$|R
