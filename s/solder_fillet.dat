25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess <b>solder</b> <b>fillet</b> height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{visual inspection}} {{system has been}} developed for use with surface mount devices (SMDs) on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). The system is capable of inspecting minute solder joints of fine pitch components as small as 0. 3 mm pitch QFP leads. A solder joint is judged using a height image and an intensity image that are detected by a unique confocal height sensor. A solder joint is classified based on the extracted features of <b>solder</b> <b>fillet</b> shape and correlation between a lead and its pad position. Therefore, accurate recognition of these components from the images is extremely important for reliable inspection. However, the shape of a <b>solder</b> <b>fillet</b> varies greatly, depending on factors such as the soldering process, material of the lead and the solder itself. Furthermore, the height sensor sometimes detects erroneous height data, observed as spike noise caused by insufficient reflection light from the inclined specula surface of a <b>solder</b> <b>fillet.</b> The present authors developed a unique noise reduction algorithm that utilizes a model shape of a solder joint as well as a statistical edge detection algorithm based on highest probability to recognize a solder joint without influence of noise. Each component of a solder joint is recognized by a method customized for the type of it, in order to achieve reliable recognition of various shapes of solder joints. Evaluation of the system confirms that it realizes a 100 % defect detection rate and a very low false alarm rate (0. 16 %). The present paper describes the employed inspection algorithm and briefly explains the developed automated inspection system...|$|E
40|$|Chip {{components}} {{mounted on}} the printed circuit board are rapidly being miniaturized. Furthermore, the fillet-less chip soldering technique, which does not use a <b>solder</b> <b>fillet,</b> is widely used in portable products such as mobile phones. However, there is no method to inspect the soldering of fillet-less chip mounting. In this paper, we propose an automated X-ray inspection technique for fillet-less chip mounting. It extracts three inspection parameters from the X-ray image. In the experiments, we evaluate the repeatability and inspecting ability of the technique and confirm that sufficient information for failure detection is obtained. An automated X-ray inspection system using this technique is now in operation at some factories, so in conclusion our automated method would be useful in practice. 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was performed}} which examined {{the aging of}} surface mount solder joints assembled with 91. 84 Sn- 3. 33 Ag- 4. 83 Bi solder. Defect analysis of the as-fabricated test vehicles revealed excellent solderability, good package alignment, and a minimum number of voids. Continuous DC electrical monitoring of the solder joints did not reveal opens during as many as 10, 000 thermal cycles (0 C, 100 C). The solder joints exhibited no significant degradation through 2500 cycles, based upon an absence of microstructural damage and sustained shear and pull strengths of chip capacitors and J-leaded solder joints, respectively. Thermal cycles of 5000 and 10, 000 resulted in some surface cracking of the <b>solder</b> <b>fillets</b> and coatings. In a few cases, deeper cracks were observed in the thinner reaches of several <b>solder</b> <b>fillets.</b> There was no deformation or cracking in the solder located in {{the gap between the}} package I/O and the circuit board pad nor in the interior of the fillets, both locations that would raise concerns of joint mechanical integrity.

The pur-poses are to numerically simulate the formation of solder joints, analyze the shape of solder joints and its influential factors and provide an efficient tool for design and manufacturing engineers to improve the integrity of solder interconnections. The formation of solder joints is numerically simulated through a surface evolver program and the calculation is automated with an additional con-troller. A datafile generator is developed in which the potential en-ergies, geometry of the conjunction and boundary conditions of the initial solder joint can be generated visually and transferred into evolver syntax automatically.

It is well known that in surface mount technology (SMT), thermal strains in electronic assemblies are induced in the solder joints by the mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the components, substrate and solder, both during their processing and in service. Therefore, thermo-mechanical damage is likely to occur in the solder and the principle reliability hazard in SMT assemblies is the resulting fatigue cracking of the <b>solder</b> <b>fillet,</b> caused by cyclic thermal stresses. These stresses may be caused by both cyclic variations in power dissipation within equipment and by external environmental temperature changes. Most work reported to date has focused on the effects of environmental temperature changes, although for many types of equipment power cycling may result in significant stresses. The present paper describes the experimental determination of the actual temperature distribution in a chip resistor assembly when it is powered. The paper also discusses the significance of such experimentally determined non-uniform temperature distributions in electronic assemblies to fatigue damage accumulation due to both power cycling and to cyclic variations in the ambient temperature whilst the chip resistor is powered. This fatigue damage accumulation study is carried out using finite element analysis...|$|E

BLP (Bottom Leaded Plastic) [2] {{which is not a}} type of thin out-line surface mount device(SMD) without the side lead is widely used in manufacturing of new generation memory such as SDRAM RDRAM DDR. For this non-lead SMD, the shape and reliability of solder joint is the focus of the study. In this paper, we select the C-BLP of 28 -pin device as the research object, complete the forming model of solder joint shape based on minimum energy principle and the solder joint shape theory by using Surface Evolver software, and analyze two critical process parameters (solder volume and solder pad width) impacting on the solder joint shape. The study results show that the solder volume and pad width {{have a significant impact on}} the three-dimensional shape of BLP solder joint. The law of which is that: in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the solder volume, solder joint surface gradually changes from the relatively flat to the convex, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and solder joint heights are gradually decreased; in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the pad in width, the solder joint surface gradually changes from the convex to the flat, solder joint gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and solder joint heights are gradually decreased. The actual solder joint shape designs of BLP devices can be instructed based on predicted results...|$|E
40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are known}} to be susceptible to cracking when subjected to excessive printed circuit board (PCB) flexure, which is called "flex cracking". The bending of the printed circuit board causes stresses to be transmitted through the solder fillets to the surface mount capacitors. These stresses are the highest {{at the bottom of the}} capacitor, where the termination bands end. In order to reduce the amount of stress that is transmitted to the brittle ceramic body of MLCCs through end terminations, a flexible termination system which incorporates a silver-loaded epoxy in end-terminations was developed by some MLCC manufacturers. With the transition to lead-free materials in the electronics industry there is a concern that MLCCs assembled on PCBs with lead-free solder have different susceptibility to flex cracking than those assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder. In this study, the flex cracking of MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) was compared with those assembled with eutectic tin-lead (Sn 37 Pb) solder and differences in the results were explained in terms of solder mechanical properties and solder solidification temperature. Tin-silver-copper lead-free solders and eutectic tin-lead solder have different mechanical properties, which affect the stresses that are transmitted to the ceramic body of the capacitor through the <b>solder</b> <b>fillet.</b> The higher solidification temperature for lead-free solder leads to increased residual compressive stresses after the reflow cool-down process for MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder compared with those assembled with tin-lead solder. In this work, the effects of dielectric material, capacitor size, solder assembly process, solder material, and end-termination type on flex cracking of MLCCs were determined for MLCCs from different manufacturers. Since some flexible- and standard-termination MLCCs are made with precious metal electrodes (silver-palladium), there is a possibility of electrochemical silver migration under bias and humidity. In this study, the effects of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of flexible-termination MLCCs were characterized and compared with standard-termination MLCCs. In addition, the effect of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of MLCCs with base metal electrodes was compared to that for precious metal electrode capacitors...|$|E

Such structures are called expendable Canary devices and can be used to predict the solder joint fatigue failure of regular electronic components in the actual field conditions.
