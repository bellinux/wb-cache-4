The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.|$|E
5|$|A northwestward moving {{tropical}} wave {{moved out}} the Caribbean Sea on September 1 {{and became a}} tropical depression on September 2 after crossing southern Florida. <b>Still</b> <b>moving</b> northwestward, the tropical depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on September 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the tropical depression to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on September 7.|$|E
5|$|Humberto {{continued}} to intensify {{on the morning}} of the 23rd as the central dense overcast became well defined, despite the lack of a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while <b>still</b> <b>moving</b> west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E

5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. <b>Still</b> <b>moving</b> westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined. Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, but the impacts at those locations were not nearly as severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, <b>still</b> <b>moving</b> around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|From September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall {{on the east coast}} of the United States. The forecasters indicated there was a possibility that Ophelia could strengthen further to Category 3 strength, though they felt this was unlikely. On September 12, the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while <b>still</b> <b>moving</b> only slowly and fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the inner core of convection collapsed, possibly due to passing over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the inner core of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115miles (185km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85mph (140km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout September 14–15, but the strongest winds remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} steadily strengthened as {{it moved}} towards the northwest around the western periphery of the Azores High on September 25. Encountering the anticyclone situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, Helene began to curve slightly towards the west. The lack of strong steering currents in the storm's vicinity caused the hurricane to move very slowly throughout the day, giving the hurricane time to significantly intensify. By 0000 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with a minimum pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Moving slowly towards The Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified. A recon flight reported a minimum pressure of 948 mbar (hPa; 28.00 inHg), a drop of 40 mbar (hPa; 1.18 inHg) from the previous day. As the hurricane neared the coast, its eye became apparent on coastal long-range WSR-57 weather radar images. By 1800 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane and then to a Category 4 hurricane the following day. The major hurricane continued to strengthen before reaching its peak intensity on September 27 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). However, Helene's lowest barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg) was recorded earlier during the day. <b>Still</b> <b>moving</b> northwestward due to the influence of the Azores High, the hurricane came within 10 mi (15 km) of the US East Coast before recurving towards the northeast out to sea.|$|E

The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are <b>still</b> <b>moving</b> in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Magnifying {{narrow-band}} imaging (M-NBI) is {{more accurate}} than white-light imaging for diagnosing small gastric cancers. However, it is uncertain whether moving M-NBI images have additional effects in the diagnosis of gastric cancers compared with still images. DESIGN: A prospective multicenter cohort study. METHODS: To identify the additional benefits of moving M-NBI images by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of still images only with that of both <b>still</b> and <b>moving</b> images. <b>Still</b> and <b>moving</b> M-NBI images of 40 gastric lesions were obtained by an expert endoscopist prior to this prospective multicenter cohort study. Thirty-four endoscopists from ten different Japanese institutions participated in the prospective multicenter cohort study. Each study participant was first tested using only still M-NBI images (still image test), then tested 1 month later using both <b>still</b> and <b>moving</b> M-NBI images (moving image test). The main outcome was {{a difference in the}} diagnostic accuracy of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between the still image test and the moving image test. RESULTS: Thirty-four endoscopists were analysed. There were no significant difference of cancerous versus noncancerous lesions between <b>still</b> and <b>moving</b> image tests in the diagnostic accuracy (59. 9 % versus 61. 5 %), sensitivity (53. 4 % versus 55. 9 %), and specificity (67. 0 % versus 67. 6 %). And there were {{no significant difference in the}} diagnostic accuracy between <b>still</b> and <b>moving</b> image tests of demarcation line (65. 4 % versus 65. 5 %), microvascular pattern (56. 7 % versus 56. 9 %), and microsurface pattern (48. 1 % versus 50. 9 %). Diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the <b>still</b> and <b>moving</b> image tests in the subgroups of endoscopic findings of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of moving M-NBI images to still M-NBI images does not improve the diagnostic accuracy for gastric lesions. It is reasonable to concentrate on taking sharp still M-NBI images during endoscopic observation and use them for diagnosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Umin. ac. jp UMIN-CTR 000008048...|$|R
