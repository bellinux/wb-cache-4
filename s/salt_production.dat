5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for <b>salt</b> <b>production,</b> an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman <b>salt</b> <b>production</b> also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is more likely that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E

Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of <b>salt</b> <b>production</b> was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|From the Han dynasty to {{the early}} Tang dynasty, Hong Kong {{was a part of}} Bao'an County.

In 736, the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang established a military stronghold in Tuen Mun to strengthen defence of the coastal area. The nearby Lantau Island was a <b>salt</b> <b>production</b> centre and salt smuggler riots occasionally broke out against the government. In c. 1075, The first village school, Li Ying College, was established around 1075 AD in modern-day New Territories by the Northern Song dynasty. During their war against the Mongols, the imperial court of Southern Song was briefly stationed at modern-day Kowloon City (the Sung Wong Toi site) before their ultimate defeat by the Mongols at the Battle of Yamen in 1279. The Mongols then established their dynastic court and governed Hong Kong for 97 years.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{chromate}} <b>salts</b> cleaner <b>production</b> technology, a pressure leaching process for chromite ore in 50 wt% KOH solution was studied {{for the first time}} and the results were presented in this manuscript. It was found out that the chromium extraction rate increased significantly with the increase of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, and the kinetics study confirmed that the leaching process was controlled by the surface chemical reaction. The iron in chromite ore was oxidized to form crystalline Fe 2 O 3 particles with compact surface which was different from the conventional amorphous residue. The effect of the KOH solution concentration on the leach residue was investigated, and the characteristics of the leach residues were determined and compared. When the concentration of KOH solution was 60 wt% or less, the leach residues mainly consisted of crystalline particles, and the residual chromium (VI) contents met the disposal standard for chromium-containing waste. The reaction conditions of the pressure leaching process were investigated, and the preferred reaction parameters in 50 wt% KOH solution were determined. In summary, this leaching process exhibited significant advantages over the traditional roasting and other hydrometallurgical methods with respect to both environmental protection and process economy, providing an attractive alternative to upgrade the current chromate <b>salts</b> <b>production</b> processes.

5|$|Land {{ownership}} was important. Most of {{the growers}} were tenant farmers and {{were given the}} right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. <b>Salt</b> <b>production</b> and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were the most important.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single hollowed out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. <b>Salt</b> <b>production</b> was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for <b>salt</b> <b>production.</b> In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E

40|$|AbstractProduction of {{hydrogen}} from the aluminum and its alloys powder with aqueous alkaline solutions is studied. In this process, {{it is based}} on aluminum corrosion, consuming only water and aluminum which are cheaper raw materials than other compounds used for in situ hydrogen generation, such as chemical hydride. In principle, this method does not consume alkali because the aluminum <b>salts</b> <b>production</b> in the hydrogen generation undergoes a decomposition reaction that regenerates the alkali. As a result, this process could be a feasible alternative for hydrogen production to supply fuel cell. The results show that an increase of base volume and working temperature produced an increase {{of hydrogen}} production amount. Furthermore, an improvement of hydrogen production rate and yield was observed by varying aluminum particles size and by adding the accelerant. The development of this idea could improve yields and reduce costs in power units based on fuel cells which use hydrides as raw material for hydrogen production...|$|R
