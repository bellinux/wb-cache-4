50|$|Imidacloprid is a {{systemic}} insecticide {{that acts as}} an insect neurotoxin and belongs to a class of chemicals called the neonicotinoids which act on {{the central nervous system}} of insects, with much lower toxicity to mammals. The chemical works by interfering with the transmission of stimuli in the insect nervous system. Specifically, it causes a blockage of the nicotinergic neuronal pathway. By blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, imidacloprid prevents acetylcholine from transmitting impulses between nerves, resulting in the insect's paralysis and eventual death. It is effective on contact and via <b>stomach</b> <b>action.</b> Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is more toxic to insects than to mammals.|$|E

5000|$|Methiocarb is a {{carbamate}} pesticide {{which is}} used as a bird repellent, insecticide, acaricide and molluscicide [...] since the 1960s. Carbamates are widely used in agriculture as insecticides and herbicides. They are preferred instead of organochlorines because organochlorines are long lasting persistent in crops. Methiocarb has contact and <b>stomach</b> <b>action</b> on mites and neurotoxic effects on molluscs. Seeds treated with methiocarb also affects birds. Like the other carbamates, methiocarb inhibits reversibly acetylcholinesterase activity resulting in a cholinergic stimulation making methiocarb a potent neurotoxin. It can even cause acute toxicity in humans if exposed {{for long periods of time}} or a sufficient dose. It is not listed as a carcinogen. [...] Methiocarb is also a known poison to water organisms.

50|$|Imidacloprid is a nicotine-derived {{systemic}} insecticide, {{belonging to}} a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids. Although it is off patent, the primary producer of imidacloprid is the German chemical firm Bayer CropScience. The trade names for imidacloprid include Gaucho, Admire, Merit, Advantage, Confidor, Provado, and Winner. Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that is selectively toxic to insects relative to vertebrates and most non-insect invertebrates. It acts as an agonist on the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of motor neurones in insects. This interaction results in convulsions, paralysis, and eventually death of the poisoned insect. It is effective on contact and via <b>stomach</b> <b>action.</b> Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. As a systemic pesticide, imidacloprid translocates or moves readily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and guttation fluid of plants. Bees may be exposed to imidacloprid when they feed on the nectar, pollen, and guttation fluid of imidacloprid-treated plants.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} on dietary antioxidants misses the so-called non-extractable polyphenols (NEPP), {{which are not}} significantly released from the food matrix either by mastication, acid pH in the <b>stomach</b> or <b>action</b> of digestive enzymes, reaching the colon nearly intact. NEPP, not detected by the usual analytical procedures, {{are made up of}} macromolecules and single phenolic compounds associated with macromolecules. Therefore, NEPP are not included in food and dietary intake data nor in bioavailability, intervention or observational studies. The present paper aims to provide an overview of dietary NEPP - nature, occurrence in diet, metabolic fate and possible health effects. NEPP are a relevant fraction of dietary polyphenols exerting their main biological action in the colon, where they are extensively fermented by the action of microbiota, giving place to absorbable metabolites. NEPP exhibit different potential health-related properties, in particular in relation to gastrointestinal health, such as increases in antioxidant and antiproliferative capacities, reduction of intestinal tumorigenesis and modification of gene expression, as observed in different animal models.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in gastric function and mucosal {{damage has been}} defined. 5 -HT also potentiates lesion formation in animals. The current study investigated further whether these actions are mediated through 5 -HT 3 receptors in rats. Ondansetron, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, was given subcutaneously, 2 or 4 mg/kg, 30 min before the gastric parameters were measured. The higher dose of ondansetron, 4 mg/kg, significantly increased gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) and also basal acid and Na+ secretion. However, it did not affect pepsin output. 5 -HT time dependently reduced GMBF and pepsin secretion, but not that of acid and Na+. These actions were not altered by ondansetron pretreatment. The drug, however, dose dependently reduced ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions in the 5 -HT-treated animals. These findings indicate that 5 -HT 3 receptors regulate not only basal GMBF, but also acid and Na+ secretion in stomachs. However, the depressive action of 5 -HT on GMBF and pepsin secretion is most likely not mediated through 5 -HT 3 receptors. Ondansetron also modulates the toxicities of ethanol in the <b>stomach</b> and this <b>action</b> {{is likely to be}} mediated through the preservation of GMBF. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the <b>stomach</b> by the <b>action</b> of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} the third leading cause of cancer-related {{mortality}} worldwide. Despite progress in understanding itsÂ development, challenges with treatment remain. Gastrin, aÂ peptide hormone, is trophic for normal gastrointestinal epithelium. Gastrin also {{has been shown to}} play an important role in the stimulation of growth of several gastrointestinal cancers including gastric cancer. We sought to review theÂ roleÂ of gastrin and its pathway in gastric cancer and itsÂ potential as a therapeutic target in the management ofÂ gastric cancer. In the normal adult stomach, gastrin is synthesized in the G cells of the antrum; however, gastrin expression also is found in many gastric adenocarcinomas ofÂ the <b>stomach</b> corpus. Gastrinâs <b>actions</b> are mediated through the G-proteinâcoupled receptor cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) on parietal and enterochromaffin cells of the gastric body. Gastrin blood levels are increased in subjects with type A atrophic gastritis and in those taking high doses of daily proton pump inhibitors for acid reflux disease. In experimental models, proton pump inhibitorâinduced hypergastrinemia and infection with Helicobacter pylori increase the risk of gastric cancer. Understanding the gastrin:CCK-B signaling pathway has led to therapeutic strategies to treat gastric cancer by either targeting the CCK-B receptor with small-molecule antagonists or targeting the peptide with immune-based therapies. In this review, we discuss the role of gastrin in gastric adenocarcinoma, and strategies to block its effects to treat those with unresectable gastric cancer.

40|$|Ghrelin is a newly {{discovered}} orexigenic peptide originating from the <b>stomach.</b> However, its <b>action</b> in regulating the fed and fasted motor {{activity of the}} digestive tract is not fully understood. In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) and intravenous (i. v.) injection of ghrelin on the physiological fed and fasted motor activities in the stomach and duodenum of freely moving conscious rats. i. c. v. and i. v. injection of ghrelin induced fasted motor activity in the duodenum in normal fed rats, while i. v. injection of ghrelin induced fasted motor activity in both the stomach and duodenum in vagotomized rats. The effects of i. c. v. and i. v. injected ghrelin were blocked by growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) antagonist given by the same route and also blocked by immunoneutralization of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the brain. The effects of i. v. injected ghrelin were not altered by i. c. v. injection of GHS-R antagonist in vagotomized rats. Injection of GHS-R antagonist blocked the fasted motor activity in both the stomach and duodenum in vagotomized rats but did not affect the fasted motor activity in normal rats. Low intragastric pH inhibited the effect of ghrelin. The present results indicate that ghrelin is involved in regulation of fasted motor activity in the stomach and duodenum. Peripheral ghrelin may induce the fasted motor activity by activating the NPY neurons in the brain, probably through ghrelin receptors on vagal afferent neurons. Once the brain mechanism is eliminated by truncal vagotomy, ghrelin might be primarily involved in the regulation of fasted motor activity through ghrelin receptors on the stomach and duodenum. The action of ghrelin to induce fasted motor activity is strongly affected by intragastric pH; low pH inhibits the action...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{action is}} known to {{influence}} the abundance and distribution of intertidal organisms. Wave action will also determine the duration and suitability of various foraging windows (high-tide and low-tide, day and night) for predation and can also affect predator behaviour, both directly by impeding prey handling and indirectly by influencing prey abundance. It remains uncertain whether semiterrestrial mobile predators such as crabs which can access intertidal prey during emersion when the effects of wave action are minimal, are influenced by exposure. Here, we assessed the effect of wave action on the abundance and population structure (size and gender) of the semi-terrestrial intertidal crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus on rocky shores in Portugal. The activity of P. marmoratus with the tidal cycle on sheltered and exposed shores was established using baited pots at high-tide to examine whether there was activity during intertidal immersion and by low-tide searches. Because prey abundance varies along a wave exposure gradient on most Portuguese shores and because morphology of crab chelipeds {{are known to be}} related to diet composition, we further tested the hypothesis that predator stomach contents reflected differences in prey abundance along the horizontal gradient in wave exposure and that this would be correlated with the crab cheliped morphology. Thus, we examined phenotypic variation in P. marmoratus chelipeds across shores of differing exposure to wave action. P. marmoratus was only active during lowtide. Patterns of abundance and population structure of crabs did not vary with exposure to wave <b>action.</b> <b>Stomach</b> contents, however, varied significantly between shores of differing exposure with a higher consumption of hardshelled prey (mussels) on exposed locations, where this type of prey is more abundant, and a higher consumption of barnacles on sheltered shores. Multivariate geometric analysis of crab claws showed that claws were signifocantly larger on exposed shores. There was a significant correlation between animals with larger claws and the abundance of mussels in their stomach. Variation in cheliped size may have resulted from differing food availability on sheltered and exposed shores...|$|R
