In 215 BC Qin Shi Huang ordered General Meng Tian to begin its construction {{with the assistance of}} 300,000 men. Other sources suggest that he ordered 720,000 unpaid laborers to build his tomb according to his specifications. Again, given John Man's observation regarding populations at the time (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>above),</b> these historical estimates are debatable. The main tomb (located at [...] ) containing the emperor has yet to be opened and there is evidence suggesting that it remains relatively intact. Sima Qian's description of the tomb includes replicas of palaces and scenic towers, [...] "rare utensils and wonderful objects", 100 rivers made with mercury, representations of [...] "the heavenly bodies", and crossbows rigged to shoot anyone who tried to break in. The tomb was built at the foot of Mount Li, 30 kilometers away from Xi'an. Modern archaeologists have located the tomb, and have inserted probes deep into it. The probes revealed abnormally high quantities of mercury, some 100 times the naturally occurring rate, suggesting that some parts of the legend are credible. Secrets were maintained, as most of the workmen who built the tomb were killed.|$|E

50|$|On May 10, 1993, {{there was}} a major fire at the Kader Toy Factory, a joint venture, almost 80% owned by Kader, in Thailand. 188 people were killed, and over 500 were seriously injured. Most of the victims were young female workers from rural families. More people were killed in this {{industrial}} accident than in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire; {{making it one of the}} worst industrial disasters in history. Despite this fact, it received little media attention outside of Thailand. This could be due to the factory's role as a child labor camp or possibly Kader's connections to other major corporations, such as Disney, Hasbro, and Mattel (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>above).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Apologists {{proposal}} for a partial solution: In the 7th year of his reign, {{in the month of}} Kislev (December/January 598/97), Nebuchadnezzar himself left Babylon and undertook the subjection of rebellious Judah. In that same month, King Jehoiakim died in Jerusalem. (On the basis of a comparison with 2 Kings 24:6,8,10ff, with the Babylonian Chronicle, Wiseman 73, lines 11-13, Kislev is the ninth month. In the twelfth month, Adar, Jerusalem was taken. Jehoiachin's reign falls in these three months.) It is not impossible that he was murdered by a political faction who thereby sought more mild treatment for their country. His 18-year-old son Jehoiachin was raised to the throne (2 Kings 24:8). Three months later Jerusalem was entirely surrounded by Babylonians. Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to the city of Judah (al-ya-ahu-du), and {{on the second day of}} the month of Adar he comquered the city and took its king prisoner. Also F.F. Bruce writes that Jehoiakim died in Juda before the siege of Jerusalem began. This would mean that Jehoiakim was desecrated after his death and in this way the prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled. The passage in [...] does not speak explicitly about Jehoiakim's death. Thus, it can be seen as a parallel to [...] which speaks about an event in the lifetime of the king of Judah (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>above).</b> , nevertheless, remains unclear.|$|E

This extraction form was pretested by two authors (SG and JM) independently, {{in a set}} of ten articles. This test enabled to identify items needing rewording to avoid any confusion. Disagreements were discussed with an epidemiologist (last author, FT), to ensure similar understanding. Once all litigious points were settled, two reviewers (SG and JM) independently extracted the following data from the selected articles (using the full text and the Additional file 1): general data (funding source, geographical origin, topic, number of centers), methods (intervention assessed, study design, randomization design), quality assessment (by use of the risk of bias tool [16]), trial characteristics (inclusion period, length of follow-up, number of randomized patients) and outcomes (time from randomization to assessment for primary outcome, type and characteristic of all outcomes, <b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>above).</b>|$|E

30|$|The soluble {{fractions}} at pH  5 and pH  7 {{account for}} 73 % and 90 % {{of the total}} humic material, respectively. These fractions are particularly rich in aromatic and aliphatic groups and exhibit a very low polar group content as indicated by both the NMR results and the low O/C ratio. The {{fact that most of}} the polar molecules were no longer present in this typical humic material, but precipitated as organo-mineral associations (<b>see</b> the <b>above</b> <b>paragraph),</b> suggests that contrary to the usual assumption, they were not strongly bound to the humic acid.|$|R
50|$|The ICJ {{outlined}} the legal {{rationale for the}} supporters of this view in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004. It noted:...under customary international law as reflected (...) in Article 42 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 (hereinafter “the Hague Regulations of 1907”), territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed {{under the authority of}} the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. The territories situated between the Green Line (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> 72 <b>above)</b> and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the Mandate were occupied by Israel in 1967 during the armed conflict between Israel and Jordan. Under customary international law, these were therefore occupied territories in which Israel had the status of occupying Power. Subsequent events in these territories, as described in paragraphs 75 to 77 above, have done nothing to alter this situation. All these territories (including East Jerusalem) remain occupied territories and Israel has continued to have the status of occupying Power.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} {{decision}} the court, concluded with a 6 to 1 vote stating, [...] "there was no violation of Article 10". This case was heard by judges, Mr. J. Cremona, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. F. Gölcüklü, Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. B. Walsh and Mr. B. Gomard {{in the city of}} Strasbourg and a decision was made in February 1989. It was stated in the case, [...] "The Court cannot accept this argument. The lay judges exercised judicial functions. The impugned statement was not a criticism of the reasoning in the judgment of 28 January 1981, but rather, as found by the High Court in its judgment of 3 July 1984, a defamatory accusation against the lay judges personally, which was likely to lower them in public esteem and was put forward without any supporting evidence (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> 13 <b>above).</b> In view of these considerations, the political context in which the tax case was fought cannot be regarded as relevant for the question of proportionality". Due to the fact that Mr. Barfod allegedly attacked the judges' personally, which could ruin their reputation and call into question their credibility, he was charged with the crime.|$|R

Private school or homeschool students may request the test at the school that would be their local school, according to LAUSD's schoolfinder. Students in LAUSD-affiliated charter schools are also eligible for testing but the school needs to pay LAUSD $50 per test because the school already received funds that would normally be allocated to LAUSD's GATE program.

The use of [...] rather than [...] in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it {{may have to do}} with their acoustic similarity to other words that do contain [...] before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued {{that there has been a}} phonemic split in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.|$|R
