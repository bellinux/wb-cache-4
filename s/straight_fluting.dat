25|$|An {{additional}} use of unibits is deburring holes left {{by other}} bits, as the sharp increase {{to the next}} step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the <b>straight</b> <b>flute</b> is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.|$|R

Spiral flutes have the advantage of clearing the swarf automatically but are also available with <b>straight</b> <b>flutes</b> as the amount of swarf generated during a reaming operation should be very small.|$|R

50|$|Indexable {{drill bits}} are {{primarily}} used in CNC and other high precision or production equipment, {{and are the}} most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length. Like indexable lathe tools and milling cutters, they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate {{the need for a}} tool grinder. One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius. The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task. The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable. Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage.

5000|$|A screw {{extractor}} {{is a tool}} for removing broken or seized screws. There are two types: one has a spiral flute structure, commonly called an easy out after the trademarked name EZ-Out; [...] the other has a <b>straight</b> <b>flute</b> structure. Screw (and bolt) extractors are intentionally made of hard, brittle steel, and, if too much torque is applied, can break off inside the screw {{that is trying to}} be removed. Since the extractor is an extremely hard material, and a typical home shop drill bit {{will not be able to}} drill into it, a larger element of difficulty is added to the original screw extraction project. One way to avoid this added difficulty is to drill the hole completely through the screw or bolt (if there is access to the back). That way if it breaks a punch can be used to drive the easy out of the screw or bolt.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Numerous {{operations}} in manufacturing industries require a length-to-diameter ratio greater than 5 times tool diameter. These types of operations, known as deep drilling, normally need {{the use of}} special tools and devices. The deep drilling {{is a process of}} high complexity due to its special difficulties such as cutting in a closed and limited space, high cutting temperature and the difficulty of chip formation and removal. Such conditions involve the chip formation and the flow difficulty, the tool overhang length, the surface quality and the hole geometric and form tolerances. This work presents an experimental and an analysis of the performance of carbide drill geometry in drilling of GG 25 gray cast iron. The experiments have been carried out in line of production and laboratory, using tungsten carbide drills with <b>straight</b> <b>flutes</b> and internal cutting fluid. The aim of this experimental and analytical research is to identify the parameters which enable the prediction of surface roughness in drilling by integrating expert system. Fuzzy expert system were used to analyze the best fit model in predicting the quality of the deep drilled holes. With the results obtained in this work it was possible to acquire a major knowledge on the deep drilling process of gray cast iron, which allow improvements in the production of pieces in industrial scale.

40|$|Abstract: As an {{important}} internal thread machining method, tapping is frequently among the final operations performed on elaborately transformed manufactures. The added value is often near its peak when the tapping operation is carried out. Consequently, conservative cutting conditions often are employed to avoid costly tap failure. Taps and tapping also are amongst {{the most complex}} and least understood cutting tools and processes. In this paper, the geometry and specification of <b>straight</b> <b>flute</b> taps are discussed, followed by an outline {{of the development of}} computer-aided predictive models for side force, thrust force, and torque in machine tapping, based on Armarego’s ‘Unified-Generalized Mechanics of Cutting Approach’. This approach allows processes to be modelled based on their cutting action and geometry only, with material properties provided from a generic database. Unlike other tapping modelling approaches, this is a truly predictive methodology. The models allow for the transient and steady stages and they include all the tap and tapping geometrical variables and the tapping conditions, as well as the tool–workpiece material prop-erties. The models are verified through extensive numerical studies and a comprehensive exper-imental testing programme. Good qualitative and quantitative correlations are found between the predicted and measured average force components and torque. These models allow tool designers and process planners to optimize the generation and use of taps, thereby improving the competitiveness of this vital manufacturing operation. The results provide further evidence of the validity and generic nature of the unified-mechanics of cutting approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Polymer matrix composites, {{particularly}} {{carbon fiber}} reinforced polymers (CFRPs) {{are widely used}} in various high technology industries, including aerospace, automotive and wind energy. Normally, when CFRPs are cured to near net shape, finishing operations such as trimming, milling or drilling are used to remove excess materials. The quality of these finishing operations is highly crucial {{at the level of}} final assembly. The present research aims to study the effect of cutting tool wear on the resulting quality for the trimming process of high performance CFRP laminates, in the aerospace field. In terms of quality parameters, the study focuses on surface roughness and material integrity (uncut fibers, fiber pull-out, delamination or thermal damage of the matrix), which could jeopardize the mechanical performance of the components. In this study, a 3 / 8 inch diameter CVD diamond coated carbide tool with six <b>straight</b> <b>flutes</b> was used to trim 24 -ply carbon fiber laminates. Cutting speeds ranging from 200 m/min to 400 m/min and feed rates ranging from 1524 mm/min to 4064 mm/min were used in the experiments. The results obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed increasing defect rates with increased tool wear. The worst surface integrity, including matrix cracking, fiber pull-out and empty holes, was also observed for plies oriented at- 45 degrees. For the surface finish, it was observed that for the studied cutting length ranges, an increase in tool wear resulted in a decrease in surface roughness. Regarding tool wear, a lower rate was observed at lower feed rates and higher cutting speeds, while a higher tool wear rate was observed at intermediate values of our feed rate and cutting speed ranges...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} to increase the proportion of thread milling operations, among other ways of tapping, which is associated with increasing number of CNC machines, flexibility and versatility of the process. Developments presently existing in the RF and used in the thread mills deal, mainly, with the thread milling cutter designs, to process internal and external thread with <b>straight</b> <b>flutes</b> made from high-speed steel. The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the tapping part of thread milling cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the thread cutter designs made of solid carbide. There are solid and interlocking side milling cutters, which use a tapping part both as a single-disk and as a multi-disk one; chip flutes are made to be both as direct and as screw; solid designs of cutters are made from carbide with a diameter of up to 20 [...] . 25 mm; thread cutters can be left- and right-hand cutting; Designs of the combined thread mills are proposed; internal channels are used for coolant supply. It is shown that the purpose of the external diameter of the tapping part of the thread mill should take into account the effect of the thread mill diameter on the milling process performance, precision of thread profile received, taper thread, tool strength, and the volume of flutes. The analysis has shown that when choosing the external diameter of the thread mill it worth taking its maximum diameter to improve the char-acteristics of the process under the restrictions imposed on the accuracy of the formed thread. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{development}} of a mathematical dynamic system model is necessary for analysing vibrational motion during the metal  cutting processes. The mathematical model of the dynamic system is considered to be defined if the system parameters that  unambiguously determine its state are known and the alteration of  its state over time is specified. Considering the above mentioned, each study of vibrational motion must be preceded by a  determination of the parameters of the oscillator circuits of the  mathematical model. The working part of the metal cutting tool  consists in a shank having a complex profile, which makes such  calculations very difficult to carry out. There are no sufficiently rigorous and, at the same time, acceptable formulae for  engineering practice in the literature data. Therefore, data on the  characteristics of the metal cutting tool – in particular, its stiffness  and moment of inertia – scatter significantly. The aim of the study is to obtain calculated dependences that meet these requirements and  determine the limits of their applicability for different cutting tool  diameter ranges. Methods. Approaches referring to the theory of elasticity are used for the calculations. Results.   Engineering formulae for the calculation of stiffness and  polar moment of inertia of the metal cutting tool are obtained; in  particular, three- and four-blade taps with <b>straight</b> <b>flutes</b> as well as  drills.  It is established that to increase the dynamic stability of the  metal cutting tool, it is necessary to increase the moment of inertia  of the section. This can be achieved by increasing the diameter of  the core. As the flute helix angle increases, the stiffness of the tool  decreases significantly. High stiffness of the metal cutting tool can be achieved by employing a flute with a variable helix angle.   Conclusion.   The calculated dependences allow the parameters of  the Machine-Device-Tool-Part (MDTP) system to be set with an  acceptable accuracy when analysing metal processing dynamics  using metal cutting tools. The influence of the sharpening angles on  the moment of inertia is demonstrated; the account given for the  latter will significantly increase the reliability of the results of the  analysis of the process dynamics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyse the {{grinding}} processes and develop a search system of database for cutting tools. Design/methodology/approach: A tool grinding software with open architecture was used to analyse the grinding processes of square end mills, tapered square end mills, ball nose end mills, tapered ball nose end mills, radius end mills, tapered radius end mills, <b>straight</b> <b>flute</b> reamers, helical flute reamers, flat drills, twist drills, and step drills. According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end mill, tapered radius end mill, twist drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and uses tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. However, it is very difficult for users to design new cutting tools. Utilizing the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools, and the search system of the database provides more flexible options to develop new cutting tools. Originality/value: The database and search system of cutting tools were presented in this paper. We can save time for production line change, tool design, and tool grinding by employing this kind of system. It also gives more convenience. That is, company’s productivity and benefit can be improved...|$|R
40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread milling cutter shaving with a <b>straight</b> <b>flutes,</b> made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread milling cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of helical flutes ω) for thread milling cutters, made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a <b>straight</b> <b>flutes,</b> in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|R
