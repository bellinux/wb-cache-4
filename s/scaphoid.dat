25|$|A {{condition}} called scapholunate instability can {{occur when the}} scapholunate ligament (connecting the <b>scaphoid</b> to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted. In this state, {{the distance between the}} <b>scaphoid</b> and lunate bones is increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{carpal bones}} {{function}} as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The <b>scaphoid</b> is also involved in movement of the wrist. It, along with the lunate, articulates with the radius and ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist. The <b>scaphoid</b> serves as {{a link between the}} two rows of carpal bones. With wrist movement, the <b>scaphoid</b> may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular.|$|E
25|$|Clicking of the <b>scaphoid</b> or no {{anterior}} translation can indicate scapholunate instability.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scaphoid</b> bone {{is one of}} the {{carpal bones}} of the wrist. It is {{situated}} between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The <b>scaphoid</b> bone is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately {{the size and shape of}} a medium cashew.|$|E
25|$|Fractures of the <b>scaphoid</b> are {{the most}} common of the carpal bone injuries, because of its {{connections}} with the two rows of carpal bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{abductor}} pollicis brevis (APB) originates on the <b>scaphoid</b> tubercle and the flexor retinaculum. It inserts to the radial {{sesamoid bone}} and the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the median nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|After {{losing his}} place, Ainscough {{continued}} {{to play in the}} reserves, although in August it was confirmed he had suffered <b>scaphoid</b> wrist damage and as a result would possibly be out {{for the rest of the}} 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|The lunate is stabilised by a medial {{ligament}} to the <b>scaphoid</b> and a lateral ligament to the triquetrum. Ligaments between the radius and carpal bone also stabilise {{the position of}} the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scaphoid</b> is {{situated}} between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones. It {{is located on}} the radial side of the wrist, and articulates with the radius, lunate, trapezoid, trapezium and capitate. Over 80% of the bone is covered in articular cartilage.|$|E
25|$|The lunate bone (semilunar bone) is a carpal bone in {{the human}} hand. It is {{distinguished}} by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated {{in the center of}} the proximal row carpal bones, which lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. The lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral <b>scaphoid</b> bone and medial triquetral bone.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximal}} {{surface of}} the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating with the radius. The lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic facet for articulation with the <b>scaphoid.</b> The medial surface possesses a smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral. The palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface is broad and rounded. The distal {{surface of the}} bone is deep and concave.|$|E
25|$|The palmar {{surface of}} the <b>scaphoid</b> is concave, and forming a tubercle, giving {{attachment}} to the transverse carpal ligament. The proximal surface is triangular, smooth and convex, and articulates with the radius and adjacent carpal bones, namely the lunate, capitate, trapezium and trapezioid. The lateral surface is narrow and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. The medial surface has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone, and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate {{with the head of}} the capitate bone.|$|E
500|$|Following the stage, however, it was {{announced}} by Trek Factory Racing that Stuyven had suffered a broken <b>scaphoid</b> in the first major crash and {{he was forced to}} withdraw from the race. Sagan was also forced to abandon the Vuelta after the stage, as he had suffered cuts and burns on his left side and a contusion in his left arm. Sagan was also fined [...] for his behaviour following the crash, while the rider of the motorbike was excluded from the remainder of the Vuelta.|$|E
500|$|The race {{returned}} to the mountains on stage 6 with a third-category summit finish. This was again won by Chaves, who therefore regained the race lead. He retained this the following day on the first first-category summit finish of the race. This was won by riders from a breakaway; the significant general classification changes were the several seconds won by Fabio Aru (...) and the time lost by Chris Froome (...) , {{the winner of the}} 2015 Tour de France. Another hilly stage followed: this was won by Jasper Stuyven (...) from a sprint, despite breaking his <b>scaphoid</b> earlier in the stage. Several other riders crashed during the stage, including Sagan, who was hit by a race motorbike. The ninth stage was the first before the Vuelta's first rest day and was another first-category summit finish. It was won by Dumoulin just ahead of Froome; Dumoulin took back the red jersey.|$|E
500|$|He {{completed}} {{the course in}} a time of 54' 19", and his time held for around an hour before his teammate Lieuwe Westra assumed top spot; despite being ten seconds down on Larsson at the second intermediate time point, Westra {{completed the}} final portion of the course some twenty seconds quicker, and recorded a time of 54' 09". 's Tony Martin, the world champion, was the next rider to assume the top spot, setting the first time underneath 54 minutes; he set a time of 53' 40", despite riding with a fractured <b>scaphoid</b> bone in his left wrist and suffering a flat tyre in the opening [...] of the stage. Fabian Cancellara of [...] improved the quickest time benchmark; he set the fastest time at each of the two intermediate time points on the stage, and having passed the rider who started three minutes before him on the road, 's Bauke Mollema, Cancellara established a time for the course of 52' 21", beating Martin's time by 1' 19".|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{stage was}} the most {{significant}} uphill finish of the race so far, finishing on the climb of the Alto de Capileira. It was won by Bert-Jan Lindeman (...) from the breakaway. Most of the general classification favourites finished together, though Fabio Aru gained seven seconds in the final kilometre and Chris Froome lost nearly half a minute. The following stage was a moderately difficult stage: it was too difficult for the pure sprinters to reach the finish line with the main group of riders, but not difficult enough to create gaps between those riding for the overall victory. The most notable event was a large crash [...] from the finish. Four riders were immediately forced {{to withdraw from the}} race with injuries, including Dan Martin, {{who had been in the}} top ten. The stage was won in a reduced bunch sprint by Jasper Stuyven (...) , who had been among the riders injured in the earlier crash. He was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken <b>scaphoid.</b> Stage 9 ended with a difficult climb. There was a series of attacks on the early part of the mountain, with many riders dropped from the lead group. Tom Dumoulin eventually took a solo win in the stage, two seconds ahead of Chris Froome, and took back the red jersey as Chaves lost significant time. Froome had originally been dropped, but rode at a steady tempo and came close to the stage victory. Stage 10, the final stage before the first rest day, ended in another bunch sprint, which was won by Kristian Sbaragli (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{etymology}} of the <b>scaphoid</b> bone (...) {{is derived}} from the Greek skaphos, which means [...] "a boat," [...] and the Greek eidos, which means [...] "kind". The name refers to the shape of the bone, supposedly reminiscent of a boat. In older literature about human anatomy, the <b>scaphoid</b> {{is referred to as the}} navicular bone of the hand, since there is also a bone in a similar position in the foot which is called the navicular.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>scaphoid</b> can be slow to heal {{because of}} the limited {{circulation}} to the bone. Fractures of the <b>scaphoid</b> must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation {{increases the likelihood of}} the bone healing in anatomic alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. Delays may compromise healing. Failure of the fracture to heal ("non-union") will lead to post-traumatic [...] osteoarthritis of the carpus. One reason for this is {{because of the}} [...] "tenuous" [...] blood supply to the proximal segment. Even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.|$|E
2500|$|The lunate is a {{crescent-shaped}} carpal bone {{found within}} the hand. The lunate is {{found within the}} proximal row of carpal bones. Proximally, it abuts the radius. Laterally, it articulates with the <b>scaphoid,</b> medially with the triquetral, and distally with the capitate. The lunate also articulates on its distal and medial surface with the hamate bone.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>scaphoid</b> can be palpated at {{the base}} of the {{anatomical}} snuff box. It can also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. [...] Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar eminence. [...] When palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.|$|E
2500|$|Following on {{from the}} tumultuous third stage, the fourth stage began without two of the {{overnight}} top ten riders in the general classification. Fifth-placed Arnold Jeannesson (...) failed to start the stage due to a knee injury, {{as a result of}} a crash during the third stage. He was joined on the sidelines by eighth-placed Jakob Fuglsang of , who fractured his <b>scaphoid</b> on the same stage and as a result had to abandon the race on his 27th birthday. The stage itself was also delayed from its original start time after five teams were snowed in on the Port Ainé, following yesterday's racing. Once the stage commenced, [...] rider Julián Sánchez made it into the breakaway for the second time in three days, with [...] represented once again, this time through Jesús Rosendo; and the breakaway was completed by Belgium's Romain Zingle, riding for the [...] team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} is an {{anatomical}} compartment {{located at the}} base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles {{at the base of}} the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the <b>scaphoid</b> tubercle and trapezium {{at the base of the}} thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan's cardinal line. [...] This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 {{season was}} to be the first one of his career in which he would not achieve a victory. He joined the newly formed , {{following}} the Schleck brothers, Fabian Cancellara and four other riders coming from his 2010 team, [...] Kim Andersen was the creator of that new team, being himself a former Saxo Bank manager. In the spring, he took part to Paris-Nice, taking the sixth place of the first stage, and then went on to help his team-mate Fränk Schleck win the Critérium International. In May, he suffered a fracture to his <b>scaphoid</b> in a crash during the Tour of California, riding a whole stage with the injury before doctors discovered it with X-Rays. He healed in time for the Tour de France, ready to sacrifice himself and put any personal ambitions aside to help his leaders, the Schleck brothers. He played a pivotal role in helping the pair reach the second and third steps of the podium behind 's Cadel Evans. In August, Voigt went to the USA Pro Challenge, and had some good results by taking the fifth place of the prologue and then finishing eighth in the individual time trial. Designated to lead his squad in the Tour of Britain, Voigt suffered his second broken bone of the year in that race, this time a finger bone. The injury occurred in a crash on the first stage and he had to abandon. The healing process was a slow one since it took almost a month for a complete recovery to be achieved.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scaphoid</b> {{non-union}} fractures changes <b>scaphoid</b> bone shape, {{which leads}} to abnormal joint kinematics. Due to lack of stability from the distorted <b>scaphoid,</b> a DISI can be developed.This process is known as SNAC. As in SLAC, this will lead to degenerative osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|An {{anatomical}} anomaly in the vascular {{supply to}} the <b>scaphoid</b> is the area to which the blood supply is first delivered. Blood enters the <b>scaphoid</b> distally. Consequently, {{in the event of}} a fracture the proximal segment of the <b>scaphoid</b> will be devoid of a vascular supply, and will—if action is not taken—avascularly necrose within a sufferer's snuffbox. Due to the small size of the <b>scaphoid</b> and its shape, it is difficult to determine, early on, whether or not the <b>scaphoid</b> is indeed fractured with an x-ray. Further complications include; carpal instability (ligament disruption) and fracture-dislocations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>scaphoid</b> {{fracture}}, {{a fracture}} of the <b>scaphoid</b> bone {{also known as}} the carpal navicular, is {{the most common type of}} carpal bone fracture. <b>Scaphoid</b> fractures usually cause pain at the base of the thumb accompanied by swelling in the same area. <b>Scaphoid</b> fractures usually cause pain and sensitivity to palpation in the anatomic snuffbox at the base of the thumb accompanied by swelling in the same area. These are also called navicular fractures (the <b>scaphoid</b> also being called the carpal navicular) as navicular is the traditional name for the <b>scaphoid</b> bone, although this can be confused with the navicular bone in the foot. Treatment depends on the location of the fracture.|$|E
50|$|Non union {{can also}} occur from undiagnosed or undertreated <b>scaphoid</b> fractures.Arterial {{flow to the}} <b>scaphoid</b> enters via the distal pole and travels to the {{proximal}} pole. This blood supply is tenuous, increasing the risk of nonunion, particularly with fractures at the wrist and proximal end. If not treated correctly non-union of the <b>scaphoid</b> fracture can lead to wrist osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|Preiser disease, or (idiopathic) {{avascular}} necrosis of the <b>scaphoid,</b> {{is a rare}} condition where ischemia and necrosis of the <b>scaphoid</b> bone occurs without previous fracture. It {{is thought}} to be caused by repetitive microtrauma or side effects of drugs (e.g., steroids or chemotherapy) in conjunction with existing defective vascular supply to the proximal pole of the <b>scaphoid.</b> MRI coupled with CT and X-ray are the methods of choice for diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{scapholunate}} ligament is ruptured, the <b>scaphoid</b> and lunate are not longer connected. This {{results in}} a larger space between the two bones, {{also known as the}} Terry Thomas sign. A space larger than 3 mm is suspicious and a space larger than 5 mm is a proven SLAC pathology. <b>Scaphoid</b> instability due to the ligament rupture can be stactic or dynamic. When the X-ray is diagnostic and there is a convincing Terry Thomas sign it is a static <b>scaphoid</b> instability. When the <b>scaphoid</b> is made unstable by either the patient or by manipulation by the examining physician it is a dynamic instability.|$|E
5000|$|A {{condition}} called scapholunate instability can {{occur when the}} scapholunate ligament (connecting the <b>scaphoid</b> to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted. In this state, {{the distance between the}} <b>scaphoid</b> and lunate bones is increased.|$|E
5000|$|The radius and <b>scaphoid</b> {{articulate}} deep to the snuffbox to {{form the}} basis of the wrist joint. In the event of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH), this is the area through which the brunt of the force will focus. This results in these two bones being the most often fractured of the wrist. In a case where there is localized tenderness within the snuffbox, knowledge of wrist anatomy leads to the speedy conclusion that the fracture is likely to be of the <b>scaphoid.</b> This is understandable as the <b>scaphoid</b> is a small, oddly shaped bone whose purpose is to facilitate mobility rather than confer stability to the wrist joint [...] In the event of inordinate application of force over the wrist, this small <b>scaphoid</b> {{is likely to be the}} weak link [...] <b>Scaphoid</b> fracture is one of the most frequent causes of medico-legal issues.|$|E
5000|$|Original Description by Watson:"The {{patient is}} {{approached}} by the examiner {{as if to}} engage in arm wrestling, face to face across a table with diagonally opposed hands raised (right to right or left to left) and elbows resting on the surface in between. With the patient's forearm slightly pronated, the examiner grasps the wrist from the radial side, placing his thumb on the <b>scaphoid</b> tuberosity (as if pushing a button to open a car door) and wrapping his fingers around the distal radius. The examiner's other hand grasps at the metacarpal level, controlling the wrist position. Starting in ulnar deviation and slight extension, the wrist is moved radially and slightly flexed with constant thumb pressure on the <b>scaphoid.</b> This radial deviation causes the <b>scaphoid</b> to flex. The examiners thumb pressure opposes this normal rotation, causing the <b>scaphoid</b> to shift {{in relation to the}} other bones of the carpus. This <b>scaphoid</b> shift may be subtle or dramatic. A truly positive test requires both pain {{on the back of the}} wrist (not just where you are pressing on the <b>scaphoid</b> tuberosity), and comparison with the opposite wrist is essential." ...|$|E
