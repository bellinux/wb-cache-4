5000|$|Related to mesylate, is the mesyl, an {{abbreviation}} for methanesulfonyl or CH3SO2 (Ms) functional group. For example, methanesulfonyl chloride {{is often referred}} to as mesyl chloride. Whereas mesylates are often hydrolytically labile, mesyl groups, when attached to nitrogen are robust with respect to hydrolysis. [...] This functional group appears in a variety of medications, particularly cardiac (i.e. “antiarrhythmic”) but as sulfonamide moiety.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the hemodynamic effects of intravenous <b>sematilide</b> hydrochloride, a selective class III antiarrhythmic agent, in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Background. Class I antiarrhythmic agents, which primarily slow conduction, can depress ventricular function, particularly in patients with heart failure. In contrast, pure class III agents, which selectively prolong repolarization, do not adversely affect hemodynamic variables in animal models, {{but there are no}} data evaluating their hemodynamic effects in humans. Methods. In 39 patients with congestive heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction 25 % and in patients with cardiac index < 2 or ≥ 2 liters/min per m 2. Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (n = 1) and excessive QT prolongation (n = 4) were seen during the high dose. Conclusions. <b>Sematilide,</b> in the doses administered, prolonged repolarization but did not alter hemodynamic variables in patients with heart failure. These data suggest that class III antiarrhythmic agents, which selectively prolong repolarization, are not cardiodepressant but may be proarrhythmic in humans, especially at high doses...|$|E
40|$|Marked {{prolongation}} {{of cardiac}} action potentials and of QT intervals {{has been associated}} with early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in vitro and with ventricular tachycardia in vivo. Because the antihypertensive potassium channel activators pinacidil and cromakalim are known to accelerate repolarization in cardiac tissues, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to test the hypothesis that these agents would block the arrhythmogenic effects of delayed repolarization. Early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity were elicited in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers driven at cycle lengths of 4 seconds or more (K., 2. 7 mM) during superfusion with quinidine, cesium, or <b>sematilide,</b> a methylsulfonylamino parasubstituted analogue of procainamide with class III antiarrhythmic activity. The potassium channel activators invariably (17 of 17) abolished this form of abnormal automaticity. This effect was observed at low concentrations that did not alter action potential characteristics at shorter cycle lengths. Intravenous Cs ' (total dose, 4. 5 mM/kg) was used to produce ventricular arrhythmias in anesthetized rabbits randomly pretreated in a double-blind fashion with either low-dose pinacidil (0. 2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Pinacidil pretreatment resulted in significantly fewer total ventricular ectopic beats (168 ± 157 versus 582 ± 448, p< 0. 005) and episodes of ventricula...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} if {{and to what}} extent murine stem cell-derived beating cardiomyocytes within embryoid bodies {{can be used as a}} broad screening in vitro assay for neurotoxicity testing, replacing for example in vivo tests for marine neurotoxins. Effect of nine model compounds, acting on either the Na+, K+, or Ca 2 + channels or the Na+/K+ ATP-ase pump, on the beating was assessed. Diphenhydramine, veratridine, isradipine, verapamil and ouabain induced specific beating arrests that were reversible and none of the concentrations tested induced cytotoxicity. Three K+ channel blockers, amiodarone, clofilium and <b>sematilide,</b> and the Na+/K+ ATPase pump inhibitor digoxin had no specific effect on the beating. In addition, two marine neurotoxins i. e. saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin elicited specific beating arrests in cardiomyocytes. Comparison of the results obtained with cardiomyocytes to those obtained with the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay revealed that the cardiomyocytes were generally somewhat more sensitive for the model compounds affecting Na+ and Ca 2 + channels, but less sensitive for the compounds affecting K+ channels. The stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were not as sensitive as the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay for saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that the murine stem cell-derived beating cardiomyocytes provide a sensitive model for detection of specific neurotoxins and that the neuroblastoma neuro- 2 a assay may be a more promising cell-based assay for the screening of marine biotoxin...|$|E
40|$|Class III {{antiarrhythmic}} drugs show {{promise as}} effective treatments for {{the suppression of}} potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Dofetilide (UK- 68, 798), is a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent that is presently under clinical investigation. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether [3 H]dofetilide could be used as a specific radioligand for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K ' channel of the heart. We find that [3 H]dofetilide binds to high-affinity sites on guinea pig cardiac myocytes. Competition studies using unlabeled dofetilide indicate that binding is characterized by an IC 50 of 100 ± 30 nM (mean+SD, n= 13). Scatchard analyses of binding indicate a Kd of 70 ± 6 nM and a maximal binding capacity of 0. 30 ± 0. 02 pmol/mg protein. [3 H]Dofetilide is displaced from guinea pig myocytes by dofetilide, clofilium, quinidine, sotalol, and <b>sematilide</b> with a rank order of potency that correlates with functional blockade of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K ' current (correlation coefflicient, 0. 951; slope, 0. 99 ± 0. 19; p= 0. 014). High-affinity [3 H]dofetilide binding is not detected in rat myocytes, which are devoid of delayed rectifier K ' current. We conclude that [3 H]dofetilide specifically binds to sites associated with the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K ' channel of guinea pig myocardium.
