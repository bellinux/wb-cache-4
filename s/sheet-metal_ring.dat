In 1929 the NACA reported the results of some tests in which the cylinders were enclosed by a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>ring</b> or cowling, which {{became known as the}} NACA cowling. This cowling reduced the drag of the radial engine to less than 20% of its original value and gave sufficient cooling for flight operation. In order to improve the cooling available with this cowling, deflectors or baffles were used to guide the airflow close to the cylinders. With the combination of baffles and cowling, a large gain over the exposed engine in both cooling and drag was realized. At that stage of development, cut-and-try methods were largely used in cowling design. Often a supposed improvement in design resulted in a decrease in performance and cooling. In 1935 NACA mounted a comprehensive investigation of the cowling and cooling problem, the general purpose of which was to furnish data on the physical functioning of the propeller-nacelle-cowling unit under varied flight conditions. The information obtained embodies the detailed principles ofoperation. If a complete understanding of the cowling and cooling problem is obtained, determining the installation dimensions becomes simple. Since an airplane designer has neither the time nor the opportunity to acquire a detailed knowledge of every part of the airplane, he wants a simple method of obtaining the optimum cowling dimensions, and some of the more important reasons for selecting these dimensions. It is the purpose of this report to present such a method and to illustrate the method by working a few examples.|$|E

The magnitude of the distortions in a test fuel element was determined from strains measured with airflow conditions simulating those expected during engine operation. The measured vibratory strains were low enough to indicate the improbability of failure by fatigue. A conservative estimate of the radial deflection that accompanied peak strains in the outer ring was + 0. 0006 inch...|$|R
