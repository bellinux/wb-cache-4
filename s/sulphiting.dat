50|$|Quebracho {{produces}} tannins {{that can}} be extracted in quebracho sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and white quebracho (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a <b>sulphiting</b> process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E
40|$|David Yisa of Minna, Nigeria, asks 'how to {{maintain}} the natural colour of sun dried tomatoes and peppers, and avoid blackening. We heard of <b>sulphiting,</b> but {{do not know the}} amounts to be safe to consumers'. Several practitioners on the Internet suggest the following. Before sun drying the fruit, make a solution of one gallon (4. 5 litres) of clean cold water with one tablespoon (tbs) of sodium bisulphite (or 2 tbs of sodium sulphite, or 4 tbs of sodium metabisulphite). Soak the fruit for 5 minutes, rinse in clean cold water, pat dry and lay out for drying. Remember that sun drying will not work well when humidity is above 20 %.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Food Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2010. <b>Sulphiting</b> is {{considered}} {{as the most}} reliable and understood preservation technique in the wine industry. Since sulphur dioxide (S 02) {{has been associated with}} possible health risks, legislation as well as consumers, are becoming more reluctant about the general use of S 02 in wine production. In order to avoid economic losses due to spoilage, the wine industry is seeking feasible techniques to possibly reduce the levels of S 02 in wine. The purpose of this study was, therefore to determine the efficacy of ultraviolet radiation (UV) -C (254 nm) as an alternative technology to inactivate microorganisms in white and red grape juices and wines...|$|E
40|$|On the grape, a large {{variety of}} {{micro-organisms}} coexist {{in an organized}} system including the principal species useful for winemaking. After pressing, interactions ensure alcoholic fermentation and fermentations. After <b>sulphiting,</b> the evolution of residual species suggests that interactions persist. Their understanding is necessary and needs a global view of the microbial diversity. Each technological operation and fermentative process influences this diversity. The system is gradually simplified because the wine {{becomes more and more}} deprived and toxic. Among the most resistant species, there are O. oeni and B. bruxellensis. Strains collections have been constituted for these species. The instraspecific diversity is shown by phenotypic and genetics studies in the first one.

40|$|Tomato, {{sweet pepper}} and okra are {{vegetables}} which are grown and consumed daily by all classes {{of the population}} in Western Africa generally and Nigeria specifically. These vegetables are consumed fresh during the season and dried during off-season. In this study some nutritional content of fresh and locally sun-dried samples of tomato, sweet pepper and okra were analyzed and changes evaluated. The nutritional contents analyzed are ascorbic acid, vitamin A (β-carotene), calcium, potassium and sugar. The study shows that β-carotene retention in sun-dried vegetables were quite lower in all the vegetables studied, with tomato recording the highest percentage loss of 80 %, sweet pepper 65 % and 50 % for okra. The traditional method of sun drying which does not involve blanching and <b>sulphiting</b> causes ascorbic acid loss in all analyzed vegetables ranging from 46. 5 % in okra, 69. 67 % in sweet pepper with tomato recording the highest difference of 74 %. Calcium and potassium changes were low, while sugar concentrations in sun-dried vegetables were high. This shows that adult’s intake of carotene and ascorbic acid from dried tomato, pepper and okra, which are used in most Nigerian diet at non-production seasons will be inadequate after cooking compared to recommended daily allowances...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThis work {{investigated}} the chemical composition of cocoyam corms and cormels {{and the effect}} of processing and particle size on the physicochemical and organoleptic properties of the flours for use as soup thickener. Fresh cocoyam corms and cormels were peeled, sliced, washed, divided into four parts that were variously blanched, sulphited and sulphited/blanched. The control was not treated. The slices were sun dried (32 ± 2 °C, 3 days), milled and classified with standard sieves into particle sizes of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 mm. The flour samples and fresh corms and cormels were analyzed for the proximate composition, ascorbic acid, anthocyanin and oxalic acid contents. The flours were also analyzed for the pH, bulk density, water and oil absorption capacities and the sensory properties of colour and texture. On dry weight basis, the protein, fat, crude fibre, ash and carbohydrate contents of the corms, cormels and flours were the same (p> 0. 05). Ascorbic acid, anthocyanin and oxalic acid contents were respectively reduced from averages of 30. 35, 31. 58 and 173. 88 mg/ 100 g (dry weight) in the corm/cormel to ranges of 8. 95 — 16. 28, 9. 58 — 15. 90 and 141. 69 — 160. 68 mg/ 100 g in the flours. Bulk density was increased (p< 0. 05) by blanching and particle size. The water and oil absorption capacities were increased (p< 0. 05) by blanching. Colour preference was improved by <b>sulphiting,</b> blanching and decreasing particle size. Texture preference was only affected by particle size. Acceptablility of soups from flours were not affected by treatments and particle sizes...|$|E
40|$|Reports {{have shown}} that over 25 % of fruit are lost during their season and {{virtually}} {{out of the market}} during off season due to their high moisture content couple with poor preservation methods practiced in Nigeria. Smooth cayenne pineapple specie obtained from Ajanla Farms, Ibadan was used for the study. A two factor-factorial experimental design of 3 -levels of 3 pre-treatment methods (sucrose, blanching and <b>sulphiting)</b> and 3 -levels of drying conditions (80 o C/ 8 h, 70 o C/ 10 h and 50 o C/ 16 h) resulting into 81 treatments was used. The treatments were reduced to 18 by stratified sampling method from the results of the moisture and ascorbic acid content obtained from the pre-treated slices before drying. The slices were dried in a cabinet dryer; the moisture and ascorbic acid content of the dried slices were monitored during drying and after. All the samples exhibited combinations of falling and increase in drying with increasing in drying time. The dried slices were stored for 18 weeks, at which they were analyzed at 3 week intervals. The results obtained revealed that there were significant effects (p o CB/ 2500 ppm SO 2 at 70 o C/ 10 h had the least value of moisture content of 8. 75 % and 25. 16 mg/ 100 g of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, the results indicated that drying at 70 o C/ 10 h is suitable for drying of pineapple slices than other drying conditions. During storage, there was continuous reduction in moisture content during the early weeks of storage. However, after 9 weeks of storage the moisture content of the samples increased showing significant differences between the mean values of the samples at different weeks of storage. Though, the samples pretreated with SO 2 showed a little variation over the storage period. Drying condition of 70 o C/ 10 h and pre-treatment of 2500 ppm SO 2 / 60 % sucrose was found to have minimal reduction of quality and thus the most appropriate treatment for air-oven drying of pineapple slices. The study therefore, recommends that production of pre-treated dried fruit slices could be used to reduce the enormous post-harvest losses of fruits...|$|E
