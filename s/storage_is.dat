40|$|When a {{combined}} heat and power plant produces heat and power it often faces {{a deficit of}} heat load during the summer or other periods of time. This heat is often unnecessarily cooled away or the power production has to be reduced or shut off. If it is possible to store heat from periods with low heat demand to periods with high heat demand one can get many benefits. Among these benefits are: increased power production, decreased operation with partial load, uniformly distributed load. To be able to store heat in situations like this long-term thermal heat <b>storages</b> <b>are</b> needed. In this thesis five different types of stores are presented: rock cavern storage, tank storage, pit water storage, borehole storage and aquifer storage. In this thesis the principles of the different <b>storages</b> <b>is</b> presented and experiences from operation in Sweden, Germany and Denmark are also presented. The thesis contains a calculation of costs for the types of thermal heat <b>storages</b> that <b>are</b> suitable for use in {{a combined}} heat and power plant. To be able to function in a {{combined heat and power}} plant, a long-term thermal heat <b>storage</b> must <b>be</b> able to handle a high charge and discharge output. Storages that can meet these demands use water as store medium. The conclusion is: Pit <b>storages</b> <b>are</b> interesting if the capacity is below 20 000 m^ 3. For capacities between 20 000 to 50 000 m^ 3, tank <b>storages</b> <b>are</b> most suitable. Rock cavern <b>storages</b> <b>are</b> interesting if the capacity is larger than 100 000 m^ 3. For capacities between 50 000 to 100 000 m^ 3, either rock cavern storages or connected tank <b>storages</b> <b>are</b> appropriate...|$|R

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm <b>storage)</b> <b>is</b> opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy <b>storage</b> <b>is</b> finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged.

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly.

If refrigerated <b>storage</b> <b>is</b> not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E
