The DMX 512 specification requires that DMX packets begin with the <b>start</b> <b>code.</b> The default <b>Start</b> <b>Code</b> is 0x00(also known as the Null <b>Start</b> <b>Code).</b> By using the <b>start</b> <b>code</b> 0xCC, RDM packets can be safely inserted between DMX data packets without older non-RDM aware devices attempting to read them.|$|E

50|$|In {{other systems}} (e.g., IP/RTP systems), the coded data is carried in packets that are {{framed by the}} system {{transport}} protocol, and identification of the boundaries of NAL units within the packets can be established without use of <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefix patterns. In such systems, the inclusion of <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefixes in the data {{would be a waste}} of data carrying capacity, so instead the NAL units can be carried in data packets without <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefixes.|$|E

Immediately after the <b>start</b> <b>code,</b> a house code (A-P) appears, and after the letter code comes a function code. Function codes may specify a unit number code (1-16) or a command code, the selection between the two modes being determined by the last bit where 0=unit number and 1=command.

50|$|Some systems require {{delivery}} of the entire or partial NAL unit stream as an ordered stream of bytes or bits within which the locations of NAL unit boundaries need to be identifiable from patterns within the coded data itself.For use in such systems, the H.264/AVC and HEVC specifications define a byte stream format. In the byte stream format, each NAL unit is prefixed by a specific pattern of three bytes called a <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefix. The boundaries of the NAL unit can then be identified by searching the coded data for the unique <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefix pattern. The use of emulation prevention bytes guarantees that <b>start</b> <b>code</b> prefixes are unique identifiers of {{the start of a}} new NAL unit.A small amount of additional data (one byte per video picture) is also added to allow decoders that operate in systems that provide streams of bits without alignment to byte boundaries to recover the necessary alignment from the data in the stream.Additional data can also be inserted in the byte stream format that allows expansion of the amount of data to be sent and can aid in achieving more rapid byte alignment recovery, if desired.|$|E
