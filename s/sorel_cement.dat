40|$|Magnesium oxysulphate cement (MOC, Magnesia / <b>Sorel’s</b> <b>Cement),</b> {{discovered}} by <b>Sorel</b> S. T. in 1867 and has versatile cementing characteristics. It is {{prepared by the}} reaction of magnesium sulphate with magnesia in aqueous solution. Dolomite is used as inert filler to absorb the heat evolved during the exothermic formations of oxysulphate cement. Additives {{play an important role}} to modify the properties of <b>Sorel’s</b> <b>cement</b> by nullifying the harmful effects of the impurities present in the matrix. Incorporation of Portland cement in increasing quantities in magnesium oxysulphate cement improves the compressive strength of the cement remarkably. Water tightness of <b>Sorel’s</b> <b>cement</b> increases with the increase in quantities of the additive (15 %, 20 %). Portland cement accelerates initial setting process and retards final setting process of oxysulpahte cement. An insignificant contraction in the length of the trial beams after mixing Portland cement in oxysulphate cement was an encouraging finding of the study...|$|R

5000|$|Although not {{the first}} {{artificial}} substance {{to be used for}} the balls (e.g. <b>Sorel</b> <b>cement,</b> invented in 1867, was marketed as an artificial ivory), John Wesley Hyatt invented a composition material in 1869 called nitrocellulose for billiard balls (US patent 50359, the first American patent for billiard balls). It is unclear if the cash prize was ever awarded, and there is no evidence suggesting he did in fact win it. [...] By 1870 it was commercially branded Celluloid, the first industrial plastic. Unfortunately, the nature of celluloid made it volatile in production, occasionally exploding, which ultimately made this early plastic impractical. Urban legend has it that celluloid billiard balls themselves would occasionally explode during rough play, but no reliable sources have been found that can substantiate this.|$|E

40|$|The {{published}} literature on magnesite is extensively reviewed {{as regards the}} properties, uses, production, occurrence and genesis of the mineral. Despite opposition from the producers of sea water magnesia in recent years, magnesite still finds a ready market for the manufacture of refractory materials, particularly in the steel industry. Less important uses include the manufacture of magnesium metal, carbonic acid gas, <b>Sorel</b> <b>cement,</b> paper, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers. Large bodies of cryptocrystalline magnesite occur in Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey and India, while the deposits in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Russia and China produce {{most of the world}} supply of crystalline material. Four types of magnesite bodies may be distinguished: quartz-magnesite deposits, talc-magnesite occurrences, magnesite associated with sedimentary rocks and sagvandite, a magnesite-bronzite rock. Most South African deposits, including the Aapiesboomen body, belong to the first type. Experimental, field and textural evidence indicates that the quartz-magnesite deposits may form from serpentine under a wide range of hydrothermal and supergene conditions below about 400 °C and between very low and very high concentrations of co 2 in the fluid phase. Above 400 °C talc is produced at the expense of quartz. Sedimentary magnesite has been observed t o form in present day saline lakes, but the large size of the older crystalline deposits associated with limestones and dolomites has been used as an argument against the use of the same principle to explain the genesis of the latter bodies : much controversy still surrounds the sedimentary-hydrothermal debate concerning their origin. It seems probable thet sagvandites are produced by a process of CO 2 - metasomatism...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{argue that}} a dry mixture {{composed}} of caustic magnesite and a microsilica additive represents a binding material which contributes to formation of a durable and water resistant artificial stone. The results of the research of the artificial stone performed {{through the application of}} the Fourier IR spectroscopy method are provided. Interaction between magnesium oxide (MgO) as the basic oxide and microsilica as an acidic oxide is proposed. This interaction makes it possible to add water to <b>Sorel</b> <b>cement</b> instead of the magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) solution. Compressive strength of the dry mix containing 10 % of microsilica has been measured. In the event of hydraulic hardening, the compressive strength of the dry mix is 11. 5 MPa, while the compressive strength of the water-saturated mix is equal to 12. 0 MPa. In the aftermath of the air-setting procedure, the compressive strength of the dry mix is 10. 0 MPa, while the compressive strength of the water-saturated mix is 21. 0 MPa. The IR spectra of the specimen exhibit vibrations at 1100 - 400 cm- 1 that correspond to the area of Si-O and Si-O-Me stretching vibrations, a peak at 1121 - 1119 cm- 1 that can be assigned to Si-O-Si bond vibrations, and a peak at 474 - 472 characteristic of Si-O-Mg stretching vibrations. The areas of 3700 - 3000 cm- 1 and 1650 - 1600 cm- 1 are assigned to stretching and deformational vibrations of OH groups, respectively.

40|$|Preserving ancient Roman and Greek {{structures}} at {{archaeological sites}} safeguards cultural heritage. However, {{this is a}} challenging task when the structure is partially or fully collapsed and structural interventions are necessary despite the design limitations proposed by international guidelines. In recent decades, a commonly used and well researched method for anastylosis (i. e. reconstruction of ancient structures) has been titanium reinforcement embedded in cementitious binders to join stone elements. This method came {{as a response to}} the earlier detrimental interventions with iron or steel reinforcement and lead or <b>Sorel</b> <b>cement</b> mortar as binders. Recently, glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebar embedded in epoxy resin was offered as an alternative because it is a cost effective alternative to titanium. However, there is not sufficient research to justify the use of GFRP with stone, particularly with respect to the durability of these materials in Mediterranean climates with high heat and salt water exposure. The main goal of this project is to investigate GFRP, grout, and epoxy for their durability after being exposed to high heat and salt water, while maintaining a weaker connection-strong base material balance when placed in anastylosis scenarios. To achieve this goal, laboratory tests were done with a base material of marble, GFRP as the connector, and two types of binders: an epoxy and an ultrafine white cementitious grout. Experiments included flexure, shear, and flexural bond tests. Behavior of the control specimens were compared to those that were environmentally conditioned simulating temperature cycles and salt exposure akin to those in the coastal Mediterranean regions. After an in-depth statistical analysis of the experimental results, it is concluded that GFRP connectors with ultrafine white grout is a better option for the reconstruction of ancient structures when compared to GFRP with epoxy. Adverse environmental conditions did not have an influence on the grout or GFRP, and grout protected the marble from failing before the GFRP failed. Although the epoxy had no statistically significant adverse reactions to the salt solution or heat, the epoxy agent bled into the marble and lead to detrimental failure of marble, violating international guidelines of historical conservation. ...|$|E
