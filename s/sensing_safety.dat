40|$|BackgroundHand hygiene (HH) is a {{key factor}} in {{hospital}} infection prevention and patient safety. The objectives of this article were to examine patients' observations concerning compliance with selected procedures for hospital hygiene among medical personnel and assess the correlation between patients' key demographic characteristics and their awareness and <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> associated with hospitalization. MethodsThe study was conducted in January 2012 on a sample of 491 subjects by means of a standardized 10 -minute computer-assisted telephone interview survey. ResultsThere was a statistically significant correlation between the <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> associated with hospitalization declared by patients and their observation of HH practices among health care personnel. A positive correlation was also found between the respondents experiencing personal complications in the form of health care–associated infections themselves or among their family members and the <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> associated with hospital treatment. ConclusionsPerforming HH among hospital staff is one of the factors affecting patients' increased <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> during their hospitalization; therefore, HH contributes to the perception of good quality of service provided. Knowledge of the risk of HH does not affect the patients' <b>sense</b> of <b>safety,</b> in contrast with their real-life experiences...|$|R

40|$|The {{acknowledgment}} {{of the use of}} tacit knowledge as a safety praxis in the mining industry has been in existence for over half a century. This is referred to as pit sense. On the contrary, the use of tacit knowledge and common <b>sense</b> for site <b>safety</b> is only gathering steam in the construction industry. As a relatively new concept and one that conflicts with official practices and policies, this type of knowledge still receives resistance from individuals in managerial roles. Common sense in construction and pit sense in coalmining substantial similarities including their heavy dependence on self-preservation and the use of a bottom-up approach i. e. both focusing on the discretion of the workers. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed light on common <b>sense</b> <b>safety</b> in the construction industry as an approach to safety while juxtaposing with coalminers’ pit sense approach. Non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data on the practices of workers of micro construction firms in relation to common <b>sense</b> <b>safety.</b> This data was analysed in comparison to secondary data on coalminers’ pit <b>sense</b> <b>safety.</b> Findings from this study indicate that unlike common sense, pit sense has evolved from being regarded as a mere informal practice to being acknowledged by managers as a way of workers taking responsibility and accountability for their own safety. Thus even turning a blind eye to practices that fall outside the scope of official practices. Common sense and pit sense are both recognised as safety practices that are not formally taught but acquired through continuous practice. They are both situational knowledge that are gained through informal techniques and close interactions amongst workers. Lastly, in both schools of thought, it is widely known that experienced workers are proud to possess and demonstrate pit sense and common sense respectively...|$|R

Driver’s <b>safety</b> <b>sense</b> to {{different}} speed is not same, so it should be considered by speed limit standard. Through field experiment, the data of driver’s perception speed at daytime and night were obtained. The data at daytime and night were compared. The deviations of perception speed were analyzed under different conditions of driving speed and highway alignment at daytime and night. Driver’s <b>safety</b> <b>senses</b> were classified as four levels of very safe, safe, dangerous and very dangerous. The relation between driver’s <b>safety</b> <b>sense</b> level and perception speed was analyzed.

40|$|Conference Theme: Crime Geography and Spatio-temporal AnalysisThe back alley {{is common}} but often {{neglected}} urban space in high density cities. There {{are thousands of}} back alleys in Hong Kong, {{and many of them}} are avoided by citizens, especially females. The image of the back alley is often connected to being unhygienic, grey, chaotic, and encouraging crime and violence. In fact, many alleys have the potential to be valuable, benign spaces that can bring multiple benefits to citizens who are living in barren, crowed inner city. This photo-questionnaire study investigated possibilities of revitalizing the alleys on the basis of people’s perception of safety. One photo of existing site was shot and 15 photo simulations were produced for each of 5 back alleys. Then we randomly assigned 30 out of 80 photographs to each of 218 participants (125 online and 93 on-site; 124 females and 94 males) to obtain data on perceived safety. Data analysis show four main findings: green landscape can promote <b>sense</b> of <b>safety,</b> but the effect is limited; green landscape with formal style can promote greater <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> than that of natural style; presence of exercise facilities, shop, café or pocket park had significant effects on promoting <b>sense</b> of <b>safety.</b> Also, we found females had a lower <b>sense</b> of <b>safety</b> on existing back alleys than males.
