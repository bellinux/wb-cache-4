50|$|A {{reduction}} in deep-water circulation will {{eventually lead to}} a serious decrease in deep-water oxygen concentrations due to biochemical oxygen demand associated with the {{decay of organic matter}} that sinks into the deep-sea as a result of export production from surface waters. Oxygen depletion in bottom waters then favours the enhanced preservation of the sinking organic matter during burial in the sediments. Organic-rich sediments may also form in well-ventilated settings that have highly productive surface waters; here the high <b>surface</b> <b>demand</b> simply extracts the oxygen before it can enter the deep circulation currents so depriving the bottom waters of oxygen.|$|R
2500|$|While {{there are}} hazards {{specifically}} associated with solo diving, {{most of these}} can be planned for and their consequences mitigated {{by the use of}} appropriate equipment. In technical diving, where redundancy of critical equipment is standard policy, self-sufficiency is emphasised and taught more extensively than in recreational diving. This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically {{takes the form of a}} pony bottle, or for more <b>demanding</b> <b>diving,</b> a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup dive mask. The diver must be [...] familiar with the equipment configuration used and be able to access the equipment easily if it is needed. A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency. Finally, the solo diver may dive a more conservative dive plan than he/she might dive with an equally competent buddy diver.|$|R

The measurement process involves the following main steps: registration, definition of measurement points, probe path generation, path optimisation and verification, and measurement. By employing the CAD model at every step, the implemented methodology maximises the measurement accuracy and achieves accurate control of the overall measurement process. In addition, the implemented tools for probe path simulation and verification provide a high level of confidence when dealing with complex engineering component geometry...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate a methodology for designing and evaluating the operational planning for interplanetary exploration missions. A primary question for space exploration mission design is how to best design the logistics required to sustain the exploration initiative. Using terrestrial logistics modeling tools that have been extended to encompass the dynamics and requirements of space transportation, an architectural de-cision method has been created. The model presented in this paper is capable of analyzing a variety of mission scenarios over an extended period of time with the goal of defining in-teresting architectural scenarios for space logistics. This model can be utilized to evaluate different logistics trades, such as a possible establishment of a push-pull boundary, which can aid in commodity pre-positioning.

5000|$|Professional {{grass-cutting}} equipment (used {{by large}} establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually {{take the form}} of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a [...] "gang-mower"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed <b>surfaces</b> <b>demand</b> the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to 12 ft. These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high-speed over the grass surface, and rapid turn-around at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.|$|R

40|$|Paraxial {{light rays}} {{incident}} in air on alternate refracting surfaces of a thick lens can yield complementary powers. This paper aims to test when these powers are invariant as surface refractive powers interchange in the expression. We solve for relevant surface powers. Potential anticommutators yield {{the nature of}} surface principal refractions along obliquely crossing perpendicular meridians; commutators yield meridians that align with those on the next surface. An invariant power component orients relative meridians or {{the nature of the}} matrix power on each noncylindrical <b>surface</b> <b>demands</b> that the other component varies. Another component of lens power aligns relative meridian positions for distinct principal powers. Interchanging surface power matrices affects this component. A symmetric lens power results if perpendicular principal meridians are associated with meridians on an opposite rotationally symmetric surface. For thin lenses, meridian alignment may be waived. An astigmatic contact lens can be specified by symmetric power despite having separated surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Carrier {{collection}} in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is usually achieved by doped amorphous silicon layers {{of a few}} nanometers, deposited at {{opposite sides of the}} crystalline silicon wafer. These layers are often defect-rich, resulting in modest doping efficiencies, parasitic optical absorption when applied at the front of solar cells, and high contact resistivities with the adjacent transparent electrodes. Their substitution by equally thin doped nanocrystalline silicon layers has often been argued to resolve these drawbacks. However, low-temperature deposition of highly crystalline doped layers of such thickness on amorphous <b>surfaces</b> <b>demands</b> sophisticated deposition engineering. In this paper, we review and discuss different strategies to facilitate the nucleation of nanocrystalline silicon layers and assess their compatibility with SHJ solar cell fabrication. We also implement the obtained layers into devices, yielding solar cells with fill factor values of over 79 % and efficiencies of over 21. 1 %, clearly underlining the promise this material holds for SHJ solar cell applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of silent road <b>surfaces</b> <b>demands</b> {{a detailed analysis}} of the tire/road interaction mechanisms basically determining the noise radiation of flowing traffic. Such an analysis is of significant importance to identify and characterize the relevant effects which affect the acoustic properties of the pavements.

A variety of novel materials and road constructions is investigated to validate the model, to design optimized pavements, and to explore their application potential. The practical use of the results will be finally checked by implementing and monitoring test tracks. The research activities cover asphalt as well as concrete construction techniques and focus in particular on measures to reduce the noise nuisance in agglomerations.
