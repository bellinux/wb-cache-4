50|$|The {{beginnings}} of smelting {{go back to}} the start of mining in the Upper Harz in the Early Middle Ages. In medieval metallurgy, so-called nomadic smelting (Wanderverhüttung) predominated. The smelting sites were only used for a few weeks and followed the logging of the requisite wood. For the charcoal that was needed for the reduction of the ore, oak and beech wood were especially well-suited. The billets of wood were located near the smelting sites. The low shaft kilns (Schachtöfen) were built of natural rock and earth from the vicinity, and were by no means simple in their construction. They could only be used for a few days of continuous furnace campaign. Fixed buildings were not erected. Over 200 slag sites and smelting sites have been archaeologically recorded from this <b>smelting</b> <b>period.</b> Since the 1980s the mining archaeology team of Lothar Klappauf and Friedrich-Albert Linke have carried out excavations and undertaken a considerable amount of archeological and archaeometallurgical research. The high medieval smelting technology of the 10th to 12th centuries at the Rammelsberg was well established and complex. The wood dweller (Silvani), i.e. those who were doing the smelting in the woodlands, were able to produce copper, lead and silver from the poly-metallic ores of the Rammelsberg.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has greatly increased {{our knowledge of}} early human impacts on the environment. Records of fossil charcoal and chemical elements from a bronze smelting site at Huoshiliang, in the Hexi corridor of northwest China, provide material with which to estimate the extent of smelting activity {{and its impact on}} the environment. Analysis of the microstructure of wood fossil charcoal is used to identify the types of charred wood and to reconstruct the local vegetation present during the period of smelting. Four wood types were used as firewood for smelting: Tamarix, Populus, Salix, and Polygonaceae. The assemblages of fossil charcoal showed that Tamarix was the most dominant shrub and was widely used as firewood, as a percentage of charcoal it increased from 89 % to 97 % over the <b>smelting</b> <b>period.</b> Populus. Polygonaceae and Salix were much less common and finally disappeared completely. When the trees and shrubs were used as fuel, the vegetation cover was reduced and erosion rates increased. This erosion increase was recorded in the higher values of the Rb/Sr ratio in the lacustrine sediment of Tiaohu lake, located near the Huoshiliang site. The deforestation caused by smelting activity sharply reduced the vegetation coverage and had serious impacts on the environment. When the available fuel wood ceased to meet the needs of smelting and human settlement, the Huoshiliang site was eventually abandoned in about 1860 BC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|During Period IA, {{the hill}} {{settlement}} was rebuilt. The structures included kilns for <b>smelting</b> bronze. In <b>Period</b> II, dated to LH3A1, a villa-type structure was built of a terrace formed from previous building material further {{down to the}} south. It was probably two-story, megaron-type, with [...] "less substantial walls" [...] but [...] "a massive foundation for {{what could be a}} defense tower." [...] It was connected to the top by stairs. Period III, LH3A2-LH3B2, begins with 150 years of apparent abandonment and then a limited reconstruction of a one-story structure on the terrace. The staircase was blocked. The entire ridge was intensely occupied leaving a profusion of Mycenaean pottery. At the end of LH3B2 is a destruction level. The villa was burned. Two burials in rubble nearby are of persons who appear to have died violently. Occupation of the hill went on through the Greek Dark Age, reducing to a shrine in the Archaic and Classical Periods, the Menelaon. Dedications to Menelaus and Helen are found in its vicinity starting the Archaic Period.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} geochemical {{records of}} metalliferous enrichment of soils and isotope analysis of metal finds at Iron Age and Romano-British period settlements in North Ceredigion, Mid Wales, UK. The research {{sets out to}} explore whether North Ceredigion?s Iron Age sites had similar metal-production functions to other sites along the Atlantic fringe. Six sites were surveyed using portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF), a previously unused method in the archaeology of Mid Wales. Also tested was the pXRF (Niton XLt 700 pXRF) with regard to how environmentally driven matrix effects may alter its in situ analyses results. Portable x-ray fluorescence was further used to analyse testing a range of certified reference materials (CRM) and site samples to assess target elements (Pb, Cu, Zn and Fe) for comparative accuracy and precision against Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for both in situ and laboratory sampling. At Castell Grogwynion, one of the Iron Age sites surveyed recorded > 20 times Pb enrichment compared to back ground values of 110 ppm. Further geophysical surveys confirmed that high dipolar signals correlated to the pXRF Pb hotspots were similar to other known Iron Age and Roman <b>period</b> <b>smelting</b> sites, but the subsequent excavation only unearthed broken pottery and other waste midden development. Broken pottery remains were dated to no earlier than the medieval period suggesting a re-occupation, possibly for Pb prospection. It was established that Pb and metal rich soils within the villa footprint have similar isotope signatures to local ores found ca. 4 km east, suggesting local ores were used in its construction, possibly with some evidence of in situ metal working.
