Leakage tests with a sandwich arrangement of mica paper and embossed metallic profiles show leak rates of < 1 x 10 (- 4) mbar l/mm s under an applied normalized compressive load of 2. 7 N/mm (0. 7 MPa).

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing technologies for the 3 rd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) {{that is being}} designed to enter service around the year 2025. In particular, NASA's Glenn Research Center (GRC) is working on advanced high temperature structural seal designs including propulsion system and control surface seals. Propulsion system seals are required {{along the edges of}} movable panels in advanced engines, while control surface seals seal the edges and hinge lines of movables flaps and elevons on the vehicle. The overall goal is to develop reusable, resilient seals capable of operating at temperatures up to 2000 F. High temperature seal preloading devices (e. g., springs) are also being evaluated as a means of improving seal resiliency. In order to evaluate existing and potential new seal designs, GRC has designed and is installing several new test rigs capable of simulating the types of conditions that the seals would endure during service including temperatures, pressures, and scrubbing.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the concept of}} {{hydraulic}} amplification {{as a means of}} stroke amplification is explored for applications in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). Building on the batch fabrication technologies of the semiconductor industry, MEMS technology could enable the simultaneous fabrication of multiple microhydraulic systems of which hydraulic amplifiers would form part. Precision lithography would furthermore make dense arrays of microhydraulic systems possible, with the eventual goal being to create high power density microscale actuation and power generation systems. This document provides an overview of the design considerations required for a successful microfabricated hydraulic amplifier, and proceeds to discuss the techniques developed to successfully fabricate, assemble and test such a device. Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) techniques were developed for creating strong tethered membrane structures using Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technology. Bonding techniques included silicon-silicon fusion bonding of fragile wafers and silicon-glass anodic bonding and alignment on the wafer and die level to produce multi-layered structures. Liquid filling of micromachined dead volumes through micron-size channels was performed. Static sealing techniques for leak-free sealing of micromachined, filled dead volumes with minimal <b>seal</b> <b>compression</b> and dynamic sealing techniques when quasi-static actuation is not a prerequisite were successfully developed. Using these techniques, several hydraulic amplification devices have been produced. Testing of these devices revealed good correlation with theoretical predictions. Stroke amplification ratios as high as 48 : 1 have been observed. In addition, natural frequencies of up to 10 kHz were measured. In conclusion, this work verifies the viability of hydraulic amplification for applications in microscale actuation systems. by J. Lodewyk Steyn. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing the X- 38 vehicle {{that will be}} used to demonstrate the technologies required for a potential crew return vehicle (CRV) for the International Space Station. This vehicle would serve both as an ambulance for medical emergencies and as an evacuation vehicle for the Space Station. Control surfaces on the X- 38 (body flaps and rudder/fin assemblies) require high temperature seals to limit hot gas ingestion and transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures to prevent over-temperature of these structures and possible loss of the vehicle. NASAs Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Glenn Research Center (GRC) are working together to develop and evaluate seals for these control surfaces. This paper presents results for compression. flow, scrub, and arc jet tests conducted on the baseline X- 38 rudder/fin seal design. Room temperature <b>seal</b> <b>compression</b> tests were performed at low compression levels to determine load versus linear compression, preload. contact area, stiffness. and resiliency characteristics under low load conditions. For all compression levels that were tested, unit loads and contact pressures for the seals were below the 5 lb/in. and 10 psi limits required to limit the loads on the adjoining Shuttle thermal tiles that the seals will contact. Flow rates through an unloaded (i. e. 0 % compression) double arrangement were twice those of a double seal compressed to the 20 % design compression level. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over relatively rough Shuttle tile surfaces. The seals were able to disengage and re-engage the edges of the rub surface tiles while being scrubbed over them. Arc jet tests were performed to experimentally determine anticipated seal temperatures for representative flow boundary conditions (pressures and temperatures) under simulated vehicle re-entry conditions. Installation of a single seat in the gap of the test fixture caused a large temperature drop (1710 F) across the seal location as compared to an open gap condition (140 F) confirming the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location. The seal acted as an effective thermal barrier limiting heat convection through the seal gap and minimizing temperature increases downstream of the seal during maximum heating conditions...|$|E
