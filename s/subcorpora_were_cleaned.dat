The extraction tool consists {{of a set of}} batch files for use with the Corpus Query Processor (CQP), {{which is part of the}} IMS corpus workbench (cf. Christ 1994 a,b). A macroprocessor has been developed that allows the user to specify in a simple input file which <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> to be created for a given lemma. The resulting <b>subcorpora</b> can <b>be</b> used (1) to provide evidence for the subcategorization properties of a given lemma, and to facilitate the selection of corpus lines for lexicographic research, and (2) to determine the frequencies of different syntactic contexts of each lemma...|$|R

The Wikipedia index database is created and used to automatically generate the user profile from the user document collection. The problem-oriented Wikipedia <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> created (using knowledge extracted from the user profile) for each topic of user interests. The index databases of these <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> applied to filtering information flow (e. g., mails, news). Thus, the analyzed texts are classified into several topics explicitly presented in the user profile. The paper concentrates on the indexing part of the approach. The architecture of an application implementing the Wikipedia indexing is described. The indexing method is evaluated using the Russian and Simple English Wikipedia.

This paper presents the results of a pilot study on building a sense-tagged parallel corpus, part of ongoing construction of aligned corpora for four languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian) in four domains (story, essay, news, and tourism) from the NTU-Multilingual Corpus. Each <b>subcorpus</b> <b>is</b> first sensetagged using a wordnet and then these synsets are linked. Upon the completion of this project, all annotated corpora will be made freely available.

40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the analysis of}} a corpus of health brochures in Spanish, contrasting the way this particular genre is formed and understood in the United States and Mexico. The corpus {{is made up of}} two subcorpora: a collection of health brochures published in the United States (translated from English into Spanish), and a collection of brochures from Mexico (written originally in Spanish). These <b>subcorpora</b> <b>were</b> analyzed and compared from many different angles, providing a comprehensive view of how the texts are structured and organized. Analysis at the microlinguistic level, grounded in Speech Act Theory, shows differences in the linguistic realization of the persuasive interactional goals in the two text types. At the macrolinguistic level, a factor analysis reveals differences between the two text types in terms of the patterning and co-occurrence of linguistic features serving the overall informational and persuasive functions characteristic of the health brochure. These differences are attributed to the interpersonal relations and cultural and social contexts in which the two text types are embedded. A subset of texts from both <b>subcorpora</b> <b>was</b> field tested with the aim of assessing the impact of the two text types on readers, in addition to readers' perceptions of the texts. Fifty-four Spanish-speaking adults from Mexico participated {{in this part of the}} study. Field testing involved a three pronged approach: a pretest-posttest protocol, recall protocol, and interviews. Responses provide a look at the brochures from the perspective of the reader, and shed light on the role of the two text types in the Mexican community. Results of both parts of this study contribute to the fields of translation studies, translator training, contrastive rhetoric, corpus linguistics, genre analysis, cross-cultural communication, and health education and communication...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an initial and {{necessary}} {{step toward the}} construction of a Pan-Chinese lexical resource. We investigated the regional variation of lexical items in two specific domains, finance and sports; and explored how much of such variation is covered in existing Chinese synonym dictionaries, in particular the Tongyici Cilin. The domain-specific lexical items were obtained from subsections of a synchronous Chinese corpus, LIVAC. Results showed that 20 - 40 % of the words from various <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> unique to the individual communities, and as much as 70 % of such unique items are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin. The results suggested great potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource for Chinese language processing. Our next step would be to explore automatic means for extracting related lexical items from the corpus, and to incorporate them into existing semantic classifications. ...|$|R

One of the main points of CADS lies in the importance given to the systematic observation of naturally occurring data over and above the study of isolated data picked out from individual texts. This approach is particularly useful in the investigation of particular discourse types, text types or genres, to confirm intuitions which are part of the competent native speaker’s knowledge, but it can also help to reveal underlying attitudes and make explicit persuasive devices. Here, two small <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> compared in order to identify the differences in evaluative styles with particular reference to textual interaction, priming, and the resources of engagement...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reported}} {{on in this}} article set out {{to test the hypothesis}} that linguistic operationalisations of the features of translated language will demonstrate significant differences in the work of experienced and inexperienced translators. A custom-built comparable English corpus was used, comprising three subcorpora: translations produced by experienced translators, translations by inexperienced translators, and non-translated texts. A number of linguistic operationalisations were selected for three of the features of translated language: explicitation, simplification and normalisation. The differences in these linguistic features in the three <b>subcorpora</b> <b>were</b> analysed, using parametric or non-parametric ANOVA, and T-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests as post-hoc tests where applicable. The findings of the study indicate substantial (though not unqualified) support for the hypothesis.

Results show that by far the most frequent general extenders occurring in the two <b>subcorpora</b> <b>are</b> ‘and so on’ and ‘etcetera’, which Overstreet (1999) has found to be typical of formal settings. In keeping with Terraschke and Holmes (2007), who investigated the use of general extenders in conversations, this study shows that general extenders have similar functions in the two subcorpora. From a formal point of view, the form [adjectives + general extender] appears exclusively in the native subcorpus, albeit in three cases, which may indicate a greater conformity to the norm on the part of non-native speakers...|$|R
