25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 3rd millennium BC until the Middle Ages, seals of various kinds were in production in the Aegean islands and mainland Greece. In the Early Minoan age these were formed of soft stone and ivory and show particular characteristic forms. By the Middle Minoan age a new set for seal forms, motifs and materials appear. Hard stone requires new rotary carving techniques. The Late Bronze Age is the time par excellence of the lens-shaped seal and the <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> which continued into the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, in the form of pictorial engraved gems. These were a major luxury art form and became keenly collected, with King Mithridates VI of Pontus the first major collector according to Pliny the Elder. His collection fell as booty to Pompey the Great, who deposited it in a temple in Rome. Engraved gems continued to be produced and collected until the 19th century. Pliny also explained the significance of the signet ring, and how over time this ring was worn on the little finger.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} grab {{and place the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>rings</b> of battery lid quickly and accurately, an {{automatic}} assembling system for <b>sealing</b> <b>rings</b> based on machine vision is developed in this paper.

A Numerical {{method of}} {{frictional}} {{behaviors in the}} microscale is presented to meet the simulation demands of the tribological characteristics for composite <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> in the transmission of heavy-duty vehicle.

40|$|Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) has {{a unique}} {{regulatory}} role in <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation and bone resorption in osteoclasts. Here, using the TAT-transduction method, we show the possible role of WASP domain(s) in <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation and bone resorption. Transduction of TAT-fused full-length WASP peptide induced Arp 2 / 3 complex formation, F-actin content, <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation and bone resorption. Transduction of WASP peptides containing basic, verpolin-central, pTyr 294, and proline-rich regions inhibited the processes listed above at various levels. The ability to resorb bone by WASP peptides containing basic, verpolin-central, and proline-rich regions was reduced and the resorbed area matched {{the size of the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>ring.</b> However, osteoclasts transduced with WASP peptide containing pTyr 294 aa demonstrated the following: a) a considerable decrease in the interaction and phosphorylation of c-Src with endogenous WASP; b) total loss of sealing ring-like structures; c) formation of actin-rich patches at the peripheral edge that contains filopodia-like projections; d) reduced capacity for bone resorption in vitro. These findings suggest that modulation of phosphorylation state of pTyr 294 aa assists in integrating multiple signaling molecule and pathways that partake in the assembly of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the exact mechanism(s) by which cytoskeletal structures are modulated during bone resorption. In this study, we have shown the possible role of different actin-binding and signaling proteins in the regulation of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation. Our analyses have demonstrated a significant increase in cortactin and a corresponding decrease in L-plastin protein levels in osteoclasts subjected to bone resorption for 18 h in the presence of RANKL, M-CSF, and native bone particles. Time-dependent changes in the localization of L-plastin (in actin aggregates) and cortactin (in the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring)</b> suggest that these proteins may be involved in the initial and maturation phases of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation, respectively. siRNA to cortactin inhibits this maturation process but not the formation of actin aggregates. Osteoclasts treated as above but with TNF-α demonstrated very similar effects as observed with RANKL. Osteoclasts treated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α displayed podosome-like structures in the entire subsurface and at the periphery of osteoclast. It is possible that TNF-α and RANKL-mediated signaling may play a role in the early phase of <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> configuration (i. e. either in the disassembly of podosomes or formation of actin aggregates). Furthermore, osteoclasts treated with alendronate or αv reduced the formation of the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> but not actin aggregates. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanistic link between L-plastin and cortactin in <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> formation. These results suggest that actin aggregates formed by L-plastin independent of integrin signaling function as a core in assembling signaling molecules (integrin αvβ 3, Src, cortactin, etc.) involved in the maturation process...|$|R
