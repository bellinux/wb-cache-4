50|$|A BTO {{system does}} not mean that all {{suppliers}} in the supplier chain should be producing only when a customer order has been confirmed. Clearly, it would not make economic sense for a manufacturer of low value high volume parts to employ BTO. It is appropriate that these should be identified and built to a <b>supplier</b> <b>order,</b> effectively BTS. Part of the challenge in a BTO supplier network is in the identification of which suppliers should be BTO and which BTS. The point in the supply chain when this change occurs is called the ‘decoupling point’. Currently, the majority of automotive supply chains lack a decoupling point and the dominant BTS approach has resulted in billions of dollars of capital being tied up in stock in the supply chain.|$|E
50|$|Risks of Operation| edit sourceSupply-Side Risk| edit sourceSupply-side risk is a {{category}} that includes risks {{accompanied by the}} availability of raw materials which effects {{the ability of the}} company to satisfy customer demands4. Several issues can arise from operating a global supply chain. Common supply side risks are often the fact that {{it takes a long time}} to receive products from around the world, and suppliers may not necessarily operate to the same quality standards. Outsourcing suppliers may provide a business several benefits but alot of risk comes attached to it. One major risk is the fact that global currencies are constantly changing, a small change in foreign currency could have a large impact on the overall profit a business receives. <b>Supplier</b> <b>order</b> processing time variability is another supply-side risk that comes increasingly risky when outsourcing suppliers. This risk is defined by the fact that the time it takes a supplier to fulfill an order can change for every order. Businesses are exactly sure how the supplier is going to deal with the order and whether they will be able to deliver products on time.|$|E
40|$|Flexibility {{and data}} {{handling}} are two hot topics in current research on business process models. However, {{these issues are}} tackled separately through declarative languages and artifact-centric approaches, respectively. It follows that the situations in which {{the choice of the}} task to perform is a human decision affected by the presence of suitable input entities are not adequately handled; unfortunately, these situations are common in several industrial processes such as build-to-order ones. An integrated approach able to combine flexibility and data handling is needed and to this end this paper presents a notation named ENTA (ENtities and TAsks) : it makes both business entities and tasks first-class citizens in process models and it provides high-level descriptions of tasks in terms of intended effects and constraints to be met. Some examples of order handling processes are used to explain the issues of entity selection and task selection: deciding which customer orders can be associated with the same <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> is a case of entity selection while deciding whether to generate a new <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> for the customer orders selected or to add them to an existing <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> is a case of task selectio...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{devise a}} {{framework}} for obtaining the optimal ordering policy in a single location, continuous review inventory system with arbitrary inter-demand times. We show that it is optimal to order at demand arrival epochs only if the inter-demand time has constant or decreasing failure rate (CFR or DFR). When the inter-demand time has increasing failure rate (IFR), we show that the optimal policy is to delay the order. We then extend this policy to multi-echelon distribution systems consisting of one supplier and many retailers. Both decentralized and centralized systems are considered. We derive expressions and procedures {{for the evaluation of}} total cost and the computation of optimal delay in all settings considered. More importantly, we study the impact of our delay policy in all the settings. The numerical results indicate that for the single location model, the optimal delay can reduce the total cost significantly. Results from the single location model {{can be applied to the}} decentralized multi-echelon system, where the upstream supplier acts as a single location system. The <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> delay can also have a significant impact (either positive or negative) on the retailers ’ total cost as well as the system’s total costs. Finally, the impact of <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> delay is minimal in the centralized multi-echelon setting. We offer an intuitive explanation for this observation. - 2 - 1...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} is an inherent part of supplier selection. While companies are enjoying {{the benefits of}} outsourcing, risks brought by this practice {{should be taken into}} account in the process of decision making. This paper presents a multiobjective stochastic sequential supplier allocation model to help in supplier selection under uncertainty. Demand for products, capacities at suppliers as well as transportation and other variable costs are the main sources of uncertainty and are modeled using probability distributions. Disruptions are exogenous events and the model provides proactive mitigation strategies against disruptions by assigning backup suppliers who can be used in case of a default at a primary supplier. When there is no disruption, the model's solution is an optimal <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> assignment, considering operational risks.

40|$|Supplier {{selection}} is deemed {{as a crucial}} strategic decision-making activity in building a competitive edge. Firms prefer to operate with a few trusted suppliers, selected from a bigger pool of vendors. The chosen suppliers are the ones whose commitments are best oriented in realising the business goals of the company. At the same time enterprise targets cannot be achieved {{in the absence of}} cost-effective inventory management policies. This has created the inevitable need for aggregate production and distribution planning. Even more competitive strategy would be integrating procurement planning with production-distribution scheduling. We address the problem of integrated procurement, production and shipment planning for a supply chain, spanning over three echelons. <b>Supplier</b> <b>order</b> scheduling is combined with a production-shipment planning process to realise a minimum cost operations policy. Two recently developed swarm heuristics are employed to search for the near optimal solution of the mathematical model, which is developed to capture the aggregate planning problem.

40|$|In this paper, the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) {{concept has}} been applied to develop and present a new {{two-stage}} supplier evaluation and verification methodology, based on product manufacturing policy and technology intensity. According to the presented methodology for products with medium to high technology intensity and make-to-order (MTO) and engineer to-order (ETO) manufacturing policy, suppliers are first evaluated {{on the basis of the}} enablers in two general and professional evaluation steps and then verified in accordance with the obtained results of prototype approval and <b>supplier</b> <b>order</b> fulfilment capability. This methodology has been utilised for assessing welding suppliers in gas turbine industry as a case study. It has been shown that the developed multi-disciplinary methodology as an efficient and responsive decision-making tool provides an accurate supplier evaluation stage while considers supplier performance verification to reach the long-term partnership, leading to a more accurate and reliable supplier selection process. supplier evaluation; supplier verification; EFQM based methodology; technology intensity; manufacturing policy; industrial gas turbines; case study; European Foundation for Quality Management; make-to-order; MTO; engineer to-order; ETO; welding suppliers; supplier selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{dematerialization}} {{of business}} processes {{is one of}} the main challenges of the current decade. The concept of e-invoicing does not mean only the production and management of electronic invoices but often represents only a part of the entire financial value chain and supply chain dematerialization (for its non-commodity component). Indeed the two value chains are now even more integrated and re-cent studies have shown significant monetary savings. The research question is now to understand which is a reliable set of indicators, which is also able to capture and to synthesize the interactions between the Financial Value Chain and the Supply Chain. In this paper we propose and validate among experts a set of Key Performance Indicators able to monitor these value chains from the financial, strategic, <b>supplier,</b> <b>order</b> and delivery perspectives. The model has been validated through a survey that has been submitted to a number of players operating in different Italian value chains.

40|$|With system dynamics, we {{establish}} three-closed-loop {{supply chain}} distribution network system model {{which consists of}} supplier, manufacturer, two retailers, and products (parts) recycler. We proposed that recycler make reflect for the government policy by adjusting the recycling ratio and recycling delay. We use vensim software to simulate this model and investigate how the products (parts) recyclers behavior influences the loop supply chain distribution system. The result shows that (1) when recyclers respond positively to government policies, recycling will increase the proportion of recyclers. When recyclers respond negatively to government policy making, recycling will reduce the proportion of recyclers. (2) When the recovery percentage of recyclers improves, manufacturers, Retailer 1, and Retailer 2 quantity fluctuations will reduce and the bullwhip effect will diminish. (3) When the proportion of recycled parts recyclers is lowered, manufacturers, Retailer 1, and Retailer 2 inventory fluctuation will increase and the bullwhip effect will be enhanced. (4) When recyclers recycling product delays increased, volatility manufacturers order quantity will rise, {{but there is little}} change in the amount of fluctuation of orders of the two retailers.
