2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber.</b> The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{detector}} consists {{primarily of}} a scintillator inside a Faraday cage inside the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> of the microscope. A low positive voltage {{is applied to}} the Faraday cage to attract the relatively low energy (less than 50 eV by definition) secondary electrons. Other electrons within the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> are not attracted by this low voltage and will only reach the detector if their direction of travel takes them to it. The scintillator has a high positive voltage (in the nature of 10,000 eV) to accelerate the incoming electrons to it where they can be converted to light photons. The direction of their travel is focused to the lightguide by a metal coating on the scintillator acting as a mirror. In the light pipe the photons travel outside of the microscope's vacuum chamber to a photomultiplier tube for amplification.|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{annoying}} obstacle to acquiring SEM micrographs, in particular higher magnification micrographs {{taken with the}} ambition of resolving the finest observable details, {{may be said to}} be carbonaceous contamination “highlighting” the previous field of view with a black rectangle contoured by an even darker frame. This contamination is generated by decomposition of adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules with incident electrons leaving a crosslinked of carbon atoms as a surface coating. The darker contours come from high surface mobility of hydrocarbon molecules from outside the field. The situation has been improved in recent decades by a lower pressure and dryer vacuum in <b>specimen</b> <b>chambers,</b> but even under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions the phenomenon occurs due to hydrocarbon molecules deposited on the specimen when loaded. Therefore, only in-situ cleaning with an producing an ion beam solves this problem in UHV, while some plasma cleaners have also started appearing in standard-vacuum SEM chambers. The goal of complete removal of hydrocarbons is motivated by the supposed unavoidability of their decomposition with primary electrons. However, we have found hydrocarbon molecules being released, rather than their decomposition, when the energy of the impinging electrons drops beneath 50 eV or so...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> {{sustaining}} the high-pressure gaseous environment {{is separated from}} the high vacuum of the electron optics column {{with at least two}} small orifices customarily referred to as pressure-limiting apertures (PLA). The gas leaking through the first aperture (PLA1) is quickly removed from the system with a pump that maintains a much lower pressure in the downstream region (i.e. immediately above the aperture). This is called differential pumping. Some gas escapes further from the low pressure region (stage 1) through a second pressure limiting aperture (PLA2) into the vacuum region of the column above, which constitutes a second stage differential pumping (stage 2). A [...] shows the basic ESEM gas pressure stages including the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber,</b> intermediate cavity and upper electron optics column. The corresponding pressures achieved are p0>>p1>>p2, which is a sufficient condition for a microscope employing a tungsten type of electron gun. Additional pumping stages may be added to achieve an even higher vacuum as required for a LaB6 and field emission type electron guns. The design and shape of a pressure limiting aperture are critical in obtaining the sharpest possible pressure gradient (transition) through it. This is achieved with an orifice made on a thin plate and tapered in the downstream direction as shown in the accompanying [...] of a gas flowing through the PLA1. This was done with a computer simulation of the gas molecule collisions and movement through space in real time. We can immediately see in the figure of the isodensity contours of gas through aperture that the gas density decreases by about two orders of magnitude over the length of a few aperture radii. This is a quantitatively vivid demonstration of a first principle that enables the separation of the high-pressure <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> from the low pressure and vacuum regions above.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of available instruments vent their <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> to the ambient pressure (100 kPa) with every specimen transfer. A {{large volume of}} gas has to be pumped out and replaced with the gas of interest, usually water vapor supplied from a water reservoir connected to the chamber via some pressure regulating (e.g. needle) valve. In many applications this presents no problem, but with those ones requiring uninterrupted 100% relative humidity, {{it has been found}} that the removal of ambient gas is accompanied by lowering the relative humidity below the 100% level during specimen transfer. This clearly defeats the very purpose of ESEM for this class of applications. However, such a problem does not arise with the original prototype ESEM using an intermediate specimen transfer chamber, so that the main chamber is always maintained at 100% relative humidity without interruption during a study. The specimen transfer chamber (tr-ch) shown in the diagram of ESEM gas pressure stages contains a small water reservoir so that the initial ambient air can be quickly pumped out and practically instantaneously replaced with water vapor without going through a limited conductance tube and valve. The main <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> can be maintained at 100% relative humidity, if the only leak of vapor is through the small PLA1, but not during violent pumping with every specimen change. Once the wet specimen is in equilibrium with 100% relative humidity in the transfer chamber, within seconds, a gate valve opens and the specimen is transferred in the main <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> maintained at the same pressure. An alternative approach involving controlled pumping of the main chamber may not solve the problem entirely either because the 100% relative humidity cannot be approached monotonically without any drying, or the process is very slow; inclusion of a water reservoir inside the main chamber means that one cannot lower the relative humidity until after all of the water is pumped out (i.e. a defective control of the relative humidity).|$|E

The type, intensity and distribution of signal-gas interactions vary. It is fortunate that generally the time-constant of these interactions is compatible with the time-constant required for the formation of images in the ESEM. The establishment of this compatibility constitutes the basis of the invention of GDD and the leap from particle physics to electron microscopy. The dominant signal-gas interactions are those by the BSE and SE, as they are outlined below.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} {{arises from}} the limitation of the distance in the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> over which the electron beam remains usable in the gaseous environment. The useful distance of the specimen from the PLA1 {{is a function of}} accelerating voltage, beam current, nature and pressure of gas, and of the aperture diameter used. This distance varies from around 10 mm to a fraction of a millimeter as the gas pressure may vary from low vacuum to one atmosphere. For optimum operation, both the manufacturer and the user must conform, in the design and operation, to satisfy this fundamental requirement. Furthermore, as the pressure can be brought to a very low level, an ESEM will revert to typical SEM operation without the above disadvantages. Therefore, one may trade-off the ESEM characteristics with those of SEM by operating in a vacuum. A reconciliation of all these disadvantages and advantages can be attained by a properly designed and operated universal ESEM.|$|E
40|$|The {{cell culture}} unit (CCU) is being {{designed}} to support cell growth for long-duration life science experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). The CCU is a perfused loop system {{that provides a}} fluid environment for controlled cell growth experiments within cell <b>specimen</b> <b>chambers</b> (CSCs), and is intended to accommodate diverse cell specimen types. Many of the functional requirements depend on the fluid flow field within the CSC (e. g., feeding and gas management). A design goal of the CCU is to match, within experimental limits, all environmental conditions, other than the effects of gravity on the cells, whether the hardware is in microgravity (micro g), normal Earth gravity, or up to 2 g on the ISS centrifuge. In order to achieve this goal, two steps are being taken. The {{first step is to}} characterize the environmental conditions of current 1 g cell biology experiments being performed in laboratories using ground-based hardware. The second step is to ensure that the design of the CCU allows the fluid flow conditions found in 1 g to be replicated from microgravity up to 2 g. The techniques that are being used to take these steps include flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Flow visualization using the injection of dye has been used to gain a global perspective of the characteristics of the CSC flow field. To characterize laboratory cell culture conditions, PIV is being used to determine the flow field parameters of cell suspension cultures grown in Erlenmeyer flasks on orbital shakers. These measured parameters will be compared to PIV measurements in the CSCs to ensure that the flow field that cells encounter in CSCs is within the bounds determined for typical laboratory experiments.

5000|$|In typical {{laboratory}} use, {{a sample}} {{is placed in}} the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Because the SEM uses a beam of electrons to illuminate the sample and produce the three dimensional images often seen in lay news reports and publications as well as professional journals, the sample must be able to conduct electricity. If the sample is metallic, electron conduction is already present because of the natural electrical conductivity of metal. It is non-metallic, the sample is usually coated with a layer of gold and platinum approximately twenty nanometers deep. This is sufficient for the sample to be conductive without being so thick as to [...] "hide" [...] elements present within the sample. When the electrons emitted by the SEM collide with electrons in the atoms of the sample, the physics of typical electron-electron collisions apply, such that sample electrons having less energy in their orbital shells than the energy setting of the SEM (kev setting), will be displaced from their orbits by the higher energy SEM electrons. This leaves the atom in an unstable state, which is remediated by higher energy electrons in the sample [...] "dropping" [...] down to occupy the electron shells previously ejected by the higher energy SEM electrons. In order to accomplish this, the higher energy electrons within the atom must relinquish the excess energy that exists between the ejected electrons and the higher energy electrons. One way of doing this is by the creation of photons of xray energy. This energy can be detected by the electron spectrometer with a detector placed within the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber</b> of the SEM, and the electrons can be identified as to the elements from which they were emitted. This gives a qualitative picture of which elements are present within the sample, because the energy dispersive spectrometer can scan the entire group of elements present up to the kev setting of the SEM, which is user controlled by simply switching a knob or pressing a button to set the upper limit of the kev power of the SEM's electron beam. It should be noted that by coating non-conductive samples with gold and platinum as described above, significant peaks will appear on the graph at the kev points of gold and platinum. These peaks can usually be easily removed from the graph by the software of the spectroscopy system should they overshadow areas where naturally occurring elements are present. If these elements include gold or platinum, the problem can be sidestepped in the beginning by using carbon as the coating agent. Carbon is electrically conductive but sufficiently [...] "light" [...] such that the typical energy dispersive spectrometer {{will not be able to}} detect it within its usual range of detection, which often goes down to sodium but has difficulty detecting lighter elements without the use of a separate wavelength detector.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the use of}} {{differential}} pumping, an electron beam is generated and propagated freely in the vacuum of the upper column, from the electron gun down to PLA2, from which point onwards the electron beam gradually loses electrons due to electron scattering by gas molecules. Initially, the amount of electron scattering is negligible inside the intermediate cavity, but as the beam encounters an increasingly denser gas jet formed by the PLA1, the losses become significant. After the beam enters the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber,</b> the electron losses increase exponentially at a rate depending on the prevailing pressure, the nature of gas and the accelerating voltage of the beam. The fraction of beam transmitted along the PLA1 axis {{can be seen by}} a set of [...] for a given product p0D, where D is the aperture diameter. Eventually, the electron beam becomes totally scattered and lost, but before this happens, a useful amount of electrons is retained in the original focused spot over a finite distance, which can still be used for imaging. This is possible because the removed electrons are scattered and distributed over a broad area like a skirt (...) surrounding the focused spot. Because the electron skirt width is orders of magnitude greater than the spot width, with orders of magnitude less current density, the skirt contributes only background (signal) noise without partaking in the contrast generated by the central spot. The particular conditions of pressure, distance and beam voltage over which the electron beam remains useful for imaging purposes has been termed oligo-scattering regime in distinction from single-, plural- and multiple-scattering regimes used in prior literature.|$|E

The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the <b>specimen</b> <b>chamber.</b> The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image.

Nine piezocone penetration tests were conducted at different rates in calibration <b>chamber</b> <b>specimen</b> P 1 (mixture of 25 % clay and 75 % sand) and eight penetration tests were carried out in calibration <b>chamber</b> <b>specimen</b> P 2 (mixture of 18 % clay and 82 % sand). From the results of the penetration tests in the calibration chamber, a cone resistance backbone curve, with qc plotted versus normalized penetration rate, was established. Guidelines were proposed for when to interpret CPT tests, whether in estimating soil properties or in estimating pile resistances, in soils for which penetration takes place under conditions that cannot be established as either drained or undrained a priori...|$|R

This paper {{test sound}} {{absorption}} coefficient of different air voids <b>specimen</b> in reverberation <b>chamber</b> and low noise pavement field testing, which gets main frequency band range of pavement noise is 315 ~ 5000 Hz, noise arrives {{at the peak of}} about 500 Hz; the relationship of microphone height and sound pressure level is not obvious; the porous asphalt mixture which air voids is more than 20 % has the upper {{sound absorption coefficient}} at the frequency of 400 ~ 1000 Hz, and its noise reduction effect is obvious; There is a linear relationship between the air voids and the maximum absorption coefficient of asphalt mixture, increasing air voids can cause larger absorption coefficient; sound-absorbing property of the low noise asphalt pavement is one of the dominant mechanism of mitigation traffic noise. ...|$|R
40|$|Zebrafish larvae {{are ideal}} for {{toxicology}} and drug screens due to their transparency, small size and similarity to humans on the genetic level. Using modern imaging techniques, cells and tissues can be dynamically visualised and followed over days in multiple zebrafish. Yet continued imaging experiments require specialized conditions such as: moisture and heat control to maintain <b>specimen</b> homeostasis. <b>Chambers</b> that control the environment are generally very expensive and are not always available for all imaging platforms. A highly customizable mounting configuration with built-in means of controlling temperature and media flow would therefore be a valuable tool for long term imaging experiments. Rapid prototyping using 3 D printing is particularly suitable as a production method as it offers high flexibility in design, is widely available and allows {{a high degree of}} customizing. We study neural regeneration in zebrafish. Regeneration is limited in humans, but zebrafish recover from neural damage within days. Yet, the underlying regenerative mechanisms remain unclear. We developed an agarose based mounting system that holds the embryos in defined positions along removable strips. Homeostasis and temperature control is ensured by channels circulating buffer and heated water. This allows to image up to 120 larvae simultaneously for more than two days. Its flexibility and the low-volume, high larvae ratio will allow screening of small compound libraries. Taken together, we offer a low cost, highly adaptable solution for long term in-vivo imaging...|$|R
