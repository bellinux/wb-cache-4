This <b>pressing</b> <b>machine</b> is suitable for small farmers who may possess some hundreds of wild palm trees or only a few hectares of selected species. This equipment operates in a continuous chain: on one side, hot nuts are introduced producing oil through the cylinder, while fibres and nut shells are discharged on the other side. The machine {{has the advantage of}} offering both functions: pressing and removing the pulp. In the case of selected species. Around twenty litres of oil are obtained from one hundred kilos of clusters. Though developed by the company Altech this equipment can be manufactured locally.

Moreover, a binder agent is {{needed in order to}} keep the RDF in a similar shape and form. A novel design and manufacturing technology for a hydraulic hot <b>pressing</b> <b>machine</b> has been established and can produce high-quality RDF without any binder.
