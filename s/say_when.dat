5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} <b>say</b> <b>when</b> and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to <b>say</b> <b>when</b> someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, writing the book and lyrics. McCollum did not <b>say</b> <b>when</b> he expected it to premiere but hoped it would eventually play on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not <b>say</b> <b>when.</b> Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

25|$|Although the axes of the unprimed frame are {{orthogonal}} and the axes of the primed frame are inclined, {{the frames}} are actually equivalent.

25|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{has been observed}} when Orcaella was forced inshore and excluded by more specialised dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins (Sonsa chinensis) and Irrawaddy dolphins were held together, reportedly the Irrawaddy dolphins were frequently chased and confined to {{a small portion of}} the tank by the dominant humpbacks. In Chilika Lake, local fishers <b>say</b> <b>when</b> Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to <b>say</b> <b>when</b> the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, for the thermodynamical {{description}} of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired {{to consider the}} effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to <b>say,</b> <b>when</b> they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, Haaretz {{reported}} that in 1992, Olmert took a loan from U.S. businessman Joe Almaliah, but never repaid it, and concealed the true size of the loan from the State Comptroller. In March 2003, State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg asked Olmert to submit the wealth-declaration statement required of all cabinet ministers. Olmert disclosed {{that he had taken}} a loan from Almaliah, but did not <b>say</b> <b>when</b> it was due. In 2004, Olmert conceded that he had taken $75,000, and stressed that Almaliah had not asked for repayment of the loan. At Goldberg's insistence, Olmert signed a contract with Almaliah undertaking to repay the loan in January 2009. According to an indictment, Olmert had actually taken another $100,000 from Almaliah, which was deposited into his personal bank account. The State Prosecutor's office said that it was not aware of Olmert's repayment of either loan.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2013 Republican {{primary in}} that year's special {{election}} {{for the state}} assembly seat vacated by Annie Rabbitt, later elected county clerk, members of United Monroe, a local group that organizes and coordinates political opposition to the village and those local officials it believes support it, asked the county's Board of Elections to assign them to Kiryas Joel as election inspectors, who verify that voters are registered before allowing them to vote. The board's Democratic commissioner, Sue Bahrens, initially agreed to appoint six {{to serve in the}} village, but later reversed that decision. The six sued the county, alleging religious discrimination; it responded that they had no standing to sue. Village Manager Gedalye Szegedin said the citizens were entitled to have inspectors who spoke Yiddish and understood their culture and customs. A state court justice dismissed the discrimination claim but ruled that the United Monroe inspectors had been dismissed arbitrarily and capriciously and were entitled to their appointments, but did not <b>say</b> <b>when</b> or where.|$|E

25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to <b>say</b> <b>when</b> he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
25|$|The Nicholsons {{were a very}} numerous, {{though not}} a {{powerful}} family, who in the 16th century lived in the Reddish district. Their names occur frequently in the early Parish Registers which were first begun in 1584. Their main home was Wood Hall, Sandy Lane. The family originated in Cumberland (Cumbria) and, after a century or two at Reddish, the main branch moved on to become landowners in Essex, but left behind numerous relatives. William Nicholson, born probably in 1561 was a former Master of the School. He attend Caius College, Cambridge in June 1581, then changed to Jesus College, where he took his B.A. in 1585 and M.A. in 1588. No-one can <b>say</b> <b>when</b> he was appointed Master of Stockport Grammar School because {{the records of the}} Goldsmiths’ Company are missing from 1579 to 1592, but {{it is likely to be}} 1587, after the death of Francis Low. He died in office and was buried at Stockport in September 1597.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century {{what was}} {{recognised}} as the Great Schism {{took place between}} Rome and Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine Churches, now the Orthodox. There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and {{the authority of the}} Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding Papal supremacy, the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralization of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to Papacy approvals. It used to be that the Emperor would at least have <b>say</b> <b>when</b> a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism.|$|E
