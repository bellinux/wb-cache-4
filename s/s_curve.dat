40|$|The X-ray sources {{observed}} in nearby galaxies show brightness distributions (log(N(> <b>S))</b> –log(S) <b>curves)</b> {{which can be}} described as single or broken power laws. Single power-law distributions are often found for sources in galaxies with vigorous ongoing star-formation activity, while broken power laws are found in elliptical galaxies and in bulges of spiral galaxies. The luminosity break can be caused by a population of X-ray binaries which contain a neutron star accreting at the Eddington limit or by aging of the X-ray binary population. We show that a simple birth-death model can reproduce single and broken power-law log(N(> <b>S))</b> –log(S) <b>curves.</b> We have found that power-law log(N(> <b>S))</b> –log(S) <b>curves</b> are a consequence of smooth continuous formation of X-ray binaries and a luminosity break is the signature of a starburst episode in the recent past. The luminosity break is robust and is determined by the lifespans of the X-ray binaries relative to the look-back time to the starburst epoch. The model successfully explains the different forms of log(N(> <b>S))</b> –log(S) <b>curves</b> for the disk and bulge sources in the spiral galaxy M 81.
