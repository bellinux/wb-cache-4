500|$|Huyck and Katz {{spent four}} days at Skywalker Ranch for story discussions with Lucas and Spielberg in early 1982. They later said the early plot {{consisted}} of two notions of Lucas': that Indy would recover something stolen from a village and decide whether to give it back, and that the picture would start in China and work its way to India. Huyck says Lucas was very single-minded about getting through meetings, while [...] "Steve would always <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about visual stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{opening the}} Victorian Returned Services League Conference {{shortly before his}} {{retirement}} as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who {{had served in the}} Vietnam War. [...] "People who throw stones at Americans," [...] he said, [...] "should <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> where we would have been in 1942 without the Americans." [...] Such remarks earned him a rebuke from the then acting State Opposition Leader, Frank Wilkes, as [...] "untactful" [...] for a representative of the Crown.|$|E

500|$|Gianfranco Berardi {{praised the}} plot, stating that it [...] "isn't just good {{background}} noise like in most games." [...] He {{added that he}} found the plot involving, and that it can cause the player to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about their actions. Matt Peckham described the plot as [...] "fantastic and original", and praised the game's replayability. Ken Newquist compared the game's setting to the pen and paper role-playing game Gamma World, and stated [...] "players get a huge world to explore and—thanks to {{the intricacies of the}} game's plot—re-explore." ...|$|E
500|$|Later reviews have {{generally}} been more positive. In 1955 Johns wrote that Belenggu was a [...] "great advance on any previous work", with which the Indonesian novel came to maturity; he praises the structure, plot, and presentation. Siregar, writing in 1964, praised the novel's diction, noting that Pane handled technical discussions especially well. Jassin wrote in 1967 that, although he found the characters still came across as caricatures, the novel was capable of making readers <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about modern conditions. In 1969, Indonesian writer and literary critic Ajip Rosidi wrote that the novel was more interesting than earlier works because of its multi-interpretable ending. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas wrote in 1976 that Belenggu was [...] "in every respect the best novel of pre-war Indonesian literature". In his 1980 book on Indonesian literature, Teeuw wrote that despite several flaws in the psychological portrayal of the main characters, Belenggu was the only novel from before the Indonesian National Revolution in which a Western reader would feel truly involved; he also called the novel Pane's greatest contribution to Indonesia literature. Tham, writing in 1981, described the novel as the best reflection of the then-growing consciousness that Western values, such as individualism and intellectualism, contradicted traditional values.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't think she could find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

Regarding windfarms, he {{says that in the}} future, they will be described as [...] "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet". Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate, but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying [...] "let's just <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> for a moment what the consequences might be.

2500|$|Jasek {{revealed}} to TV Week's Jackie Brygel that {{planning for the}} [...] "dramatic" [...] episodes began six weeks before the crash scenes were filmed. The shoot took sixteen hours to complete and the scenes were filmed over two nights at Melbourne's METEC Driver Training Centre. James Mason (Chris Pappas) told Brygel that the crew put {{in a lot of}} time and effort into getting the scenes right. He revealed that when scenes are usually filmed on location, two cameras are used, but for the crash storyline the crew used five to six cameras at the same time to capture the different angles. He called the shoot [...] "fantastic" [...] and later explained to Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis, [...] "It looked like a movie set, with lots of emergency vehicles, and it was shot at night so the place was lit up like a Christmas tree. We used two identical cars, since we had to virtually destroy one of them." [...] A stunt performer who specialises in car crash scenes also worked on the shoot. Jordy Lucas (Summer Hoyland) commented that being off-site was [...] "pretty exciting" [...] because the cast film everything but the street scenes at the show's Nunawading studio. Jordan Smith (Andrew Robinson) added that filming the scenes affected the cast members, saying [...] "It made us all <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think.</b> I think we all drove home pretty slowly that night!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> about the narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E

Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered. A crowd of warriors rushed to his rescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of [...] "Hurry up with them! Kill them all!" [...] I saw American Horse walk out of the agent's office and calmly face the excited mob. [...] "What are you going to do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Stop, men, <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>think</b> before you act! Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an instant. He went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, but what will you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end of your people. Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling. [...] "I think they are in the cellar. These fools outside had almost caught us asleep, but I think it is over now." ...|$|E
