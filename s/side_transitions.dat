The Children's section operates training groups only but from intermediate level there are age-grouped teams. Between under-11 and under-12 level, the teams play in a seven-a-side football competition, although the latter <b>side</b> <b>transitions</b> to 11-a-side after Christmas. Thereafter, the under-12s and under-13s play on a modified pitch which is slightly smaller with reduced sized goals than regulation play but from under-14 level onward all Academy teams play on normal pitches. All players from under-8 to under-15 are schoolboys, however, from Senior level many sign contracts to become professional youth players.The U11 to U17 age groups play in the SFA Club Academy Scotland programme at ‘Elite’ level.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortification}} lies on {{the southeastern}} edge of a broad, east-west oriented hill ridge in the forested area of Altenburg. The east and south sides of the site drop fairly steeply to the valley floor of the Hirtenbach stream which lies at around 80 metres above sea level. To {{the west of the}} fortifications is a terrain saddle. The north <b>side</b> <b>transitions</b> almost on the level into the hill ridge. The two vulnerable sides, in the west and north, were protected by what is now a very low semi-circular rampart guarded by a ditch. The western end of the rampart transitions into a step in the terrain on the hillside. The rampart still has a height of up to 1.3 metres and a width of five metres; the ditch is the same width. The height difference between the floor of the ditch and crest of the rampart is 1.7 metres. About 25 metres behind the rampart, a second parallel stone rampart was built; it too is very low today. The inner rampart has no visible link to the outer one {{at the edge of the}} defensive position. In the west and north there are gaps in the rampart; the ditch has also been levelled at these points. These entry points have probably been created relatively recently.|$|E
40|$|In {{a quantum}} theory of gravity spacetime behaves classically when quantum probabilities are high for {{histories}} of geometry and field that are correlated in {{time by the}} Einstein equation. Probabilities follow from the quantum state. This quantum perspective on classicality has important implications: (a) Classical histories are generally available only in limited patches of the configuration space on which the state lives. (b) In a given patch states generally predict relative probabilities for an ensemble of possible classical histories. (c) In between patches classical predictability breaks down and is replaced by quantum evolution connecting classical histories in different patches. (d) Classical predictability can break down on scales well below the Planck scale, and with no breakdown in the classical equations of motion. We support and illustrate (a) -(d) by calculating the quantum transition across the de Sitter like throat connecting asymptotically classical, inflating histories in the no-boundary quantum state. This supplies probabilities for how a classical history on one <b>side</b> <b>transitions</b> and branches into a range of classical histories on the opposite side. We also comment on the implications of (a) -(d) for the dynamics of black holes and eternal inflation. Comment: 37 pages, 5 figures, minor corrections, results not change...|$|E

30|$|Density {{anomalies}} vary significantly {{between the}} two sides of the north–north-east-trending Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone in the eastern NCC. The anomalous body A 2 on the west side of the fault zone exhibits notable characteristics, whereas the block on the east side of the fault zone exhibits no significant density anomalies. At the depths of 10 – 42  km (Fig.  12 a–c), the anomalous body A 2 on the west side exhibits significant low-density anomalies. At larger depths of 42 – 60  km, the maximum amplitude of the density anomalies in the anomalous body A 2 on the west side decreases, while the body A 3 exhibits no density variations. At the depth of 60  km, the density change of the anomalous body A 2 and A 3 is relatively gentle, and both the anomalous body A 2 on the west side and the anomalous body A 3 on the east side exhibit low-density anomalies, but the density characteristic of the body A 3 is not evident as the A 2 obviously. At depths of 80 – 120  km, the anomalous body A 2 on the west <b>side</b> <b>transitions</b> from a low-density anomalous body to a high-density anomalous body, whereas the A 3 still exhibits no obvious density variations. These results show that there is always a significant difference in the density distribution between the blocks on {{the two sides of the}} Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone and that the Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone has already penetrated the lithosphere.|$|E

40|$|Ion {{equation}} of state in the quasi-parallel collisionless shock is deduced from simulation results. The simulations were performed for theta(bn) = 10 deg, beta = 0. 5 and M sub A {{in the range from}} 1. 2 to 8, where M sub A is the Alfven Mach number, beta is the upstream ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, and theta(bn) is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field. The {{equation of}} state can be approximated by a power law with different exponents in the upstream and downstream sides of the shock transition region. The exponent in the upstream <b>side</b> of the <b>transition</b> region is much greater than the adiabatic value of 5 / 3 and increases with M sub A.

In the middle 1920 s, the theories of Hinshelwood, Rice/Ramsperger, and Kassel were developed {{at a time when}} little was known about potential energy surfaces.

In fact, in those early days, before the development of gas phase free radical mechanisms for unimolecular reactions, the latter were assumed to be non-free radical dissociations. They were realized, in the 1930 s, to be, largely, dissociations, followed by subsequent free radical reactions. (Hinshelwood received the Nobel Prize for this free radical work.) On the theoretical <b>side,</b> <b>transition</b> state theory emerged in the mid 1930 s, and in 1951 – 1952 I was involved in blending it and RRK theory together [9] and [10], resulting in what later became known as RRKM theory...|$|R

Transition apparently arising from two mechanisms was observed: transition along the centerline suspected to arise from the amplification of second-mode waves in the inflected boundary layer, and transition roughly halfway between the centerline and leading edges {{probably due to the}} breakdown of crossflow vortices. Reducing noise level from conventional (root-mean-square pressure 3 % of the mean) to quiet (root-mean-square pressure less than 0. 1 % of the mean) substantially delayed transition due to both mechanisms.

40|$|Background Left-right {{asymmetry}} is {{a fundamental}} organizing feature of the human brain, and neuro-psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia sometimes involve alterations of brain asymmetry. As early as 8 weeks post conception, the majority of human fetuses move their right arms more than their left arms, but because nerve fibre tracts are still descending from the forebrain at this stage, spinal-muscular asymmetries are likely {{to play an important}} developmental role. Methods We used RNA sequencing to measure gene expression levels in the left and right spinal cords, and left and right hindbrains, of 18 post-mortem human embryos aged 4 - 8 weeks post conception. Genes showing embryonic lateralization were tested for an enrichment of signals in genome-wide association data for schizophrenia. Results The left side of the embryonic spinal cord was found to mature faster than the right <b>side.</b> Both <b>sides</b> <b>transitioned</b> from transcriptional profiles associated with cell division and proliferation at earlier stages, to neuronal differentiation and function at later stages, but the two sides were not in synchrony (p = 2. 2 E- 161). The hindbrain showed a left-right mirrored pattern compared to the spinal cord, consistent with the well-known crossing over of function between these two structures. Genes that showed lateralization in the embryonic spinal cord were enriched for association signals with schizophrenia (p = 4. 3 E- 05). Conclusions These are the earliest-stage left-right differences of human neural development ever reported.
