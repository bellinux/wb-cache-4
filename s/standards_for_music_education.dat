40|$|When {{you hear}} reggae music {{you might imagine}} scenes from a Caribbean beach or the feeling of balmy ocean breezes.

This {{seemingly}} cheerful music is noteworthy for music educators, because there can be great value in the study of “folk-turned-pop ” music.

40|$|Singing {{has been}} a basic {{activity}} of general music since music was first included in the United States public school curricula in 1838.

However, since some children {{do not seem to}} sing naturally, teachers are continually searching for means of helping all children learn to sing. Researchers have also had an interest in this perplexing problem, and numerous studies have been conducted to determine effective strategies for helping children learn to sing.

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the importance of teaching improvisation to string musicians. This paper will discuss the history of improvisation, the importance of improvisation, the importance of creativity in the classroom. The results include lesson plans designed to teach improvisation to string players in grades seven and eight. Improvisation is the spontaneous act of creating music that is an important aspect of many types of music. A student uses knowledge of style, time period, technique and skill to create music spontaneously. The art of improvisation is a study that can help a musician to better understand a certain genre of music as well as to help creatively express ideas. The National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Education,</b> a document created in 1994 as a curriculum guide, states that students should be able to improvise melodies, variations, and accompaniments. To create music using improvisation is a valuable experience that develops in quality with study and practice for all musicians...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide music {{educators}} with suggestions of {{how to make the}} blues a part of their instruction and present this unique art form as a vibrant and ‘living’ genre critical to the understanding of our own American musical heritage. This thesis explores the music, history and culture, viewing ‘music as culture,’ and the African-American tradition whose contribution defines so much of our American music. It discusses {{the ways in which the}} blues can fit into a comprehensive and discipline-based approach to music education that satisfies the goals as set forth by the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Education</b> and, in so doing, broaden educators’ pedagogical approach to teaching the blues. This discussion stresses the importance of creating a classroom culture that parallels the way music is learned and practiced in the blues community, fostering an authentic understanding of the blues through singing, listening, movement, improvisation, composition, and, ultimately, performing. It is shown how a study of the blues can provide our students with new practical possibilities and perspectives for experiencing and generating music. Music EducationMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

This study examined these issues through an online survey intended to probe the attitudes and abilities of low brass teachers with regard to delivering a standards-based curriculum. The survey included forced choice survey items created from research questions, single- and multiple-answer questions, and free-response inquiry. Themes that emerged from the free response questions were organized into categories and reported. The findings are consistent with previous research. Standard 3 (improvisation) and Standard 4 (composition) are implemented less frequently than the other standards. Also consistent with previous research, the respondents indicated limitations of resources and instructional time. To address these concerns, recommendations for teaching and future research were presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examined {{characteristics of}} {{a select group of}} tonal patterns to identify features that may affect the initial acquisition of skill in sight-singing pitch. Second graders (N = 193) individually read and sang 25 tonal patterns on a sight-singing pretest, posttest, and retention test. Between the pre- and posttest, the students practiced 15 of the patterns during general music classes, with one new pattern introduced and all previously presented patterns reviewed each session. Ten patterns not included in the instruction were read and sung only during tests. No pattern practice occurred for 8 weeks between the posttest and retention test. Sight-singing performance was assessed for pitch accuracy and contour accuracy. Pattern difficulty indices and difficulty rankings were determined {{on the basis of the}} results. Specific pattern features are considered in relation to these data, with some characteristics affecting accuracy with pitch and contour differently.

A multicultural approach to music teaching has become increasingly important in music education. Due to a lack of materials about Taiwanese songs in the United States, I designed music curriculum materials for American teachers to implement multicultural music education with four Taiwanese children's songs. Each song has four activities for different age levels of elementary students. These curriculum materials are designed based on the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Education.</b> Included are an introduction to Taiwan, Taiwanese society, and the characteristics and cultural backgrounds of Taiwanese children's songs, so that American children may learn about Taiwanese culture and Taiwanese children's songs through these curriculum materials.

40|$|Pressures from {{education}} reforms {{have contributed to}} the need for music educators to embrace new and diverse instructional strategies to enhance the learning environment. Music teachers need to understand the pedagogy of teaching and learning and how these affect their praxis. The purpose of this multiple case evaluative study was to investigate the instructional methods used in 10 middle school general music programs to assist students in obtaining the National <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Music</b> <b>Education.</b> Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s revised taxonomy was the theoretical framework used to evaluate the teaching praxis of the participating teachers. The research questions for the study addressed the effectiveness of the instructional strategies in the music classroom and how they align with the National Standards Music Education and Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Revised Taxonomy. Data were collected from an open ended survey, individual interviews, and unobtrusive documents from 10 general music teachers from suburban, rural, and urban school districts. A line-by-line analysis was followed by a coding matrix to categorize collected data into themes and patterns. The results indicated that standards-based metacognitive instructional strategies can assist music teachers in their classrooms and unite cognitive, affective, and kinesthetic experiences applicable beyond the music classroom. It is recommended that music teachers use alternative teaching techniques to promote and connect critical thinking skills through musical learning experiences. Implications for positive social change include training music educators to create learning environments that support and motivate students to learn and achieve academic success...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{presents a}} curriculum for beginning percussion {{as a part}} of a beginning band program that incorporates the guidelines and recommendations found in the National Core Music Standards. The presentation of this curriculum is divided into three chapters, each of which of contains practical information for music educators charged with the instruction of beginning percussionists. 	The first of these chapters describes how the <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> were developed and outlines the information contained within the National Core Music Standards as well as the additional standards that accompany this information. In the second chapter, the information from Chapter I is adapted to meet the specific needs of a beginning percussion curriculum. Finally, in Chapter III, the principles outlined in the preceding chapter are used to develop a daily lesson plan and a year-long curricular schedule. 	Much of the information used to produce this thesis comes directly from the authors of the music education standards and their governing organization, the National Association for Music Educators. The remaining sources of data for this project include pedagogical texts and teaching tools. 	While the curriculum presented in this thesis is designed for use in the beginning percussion classroom, many of the governing principles can be adapted for use in other areas of study as well. If used correctly, this curriculum will allow to teachers to easily plan lessons that are high enjoyable and effective. Also, the use of this curriculum will produce students who enjoy playing music and who are well-rounded percussionists as well as strong musicians...|$|E
