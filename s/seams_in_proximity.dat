40|$|Bituminous coal <b>seams</b> <b>in</b> <b>proximity</b> to or {{in direct}} contact with red beds bodies of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) are found to be altered by {{oxidation}} and elevated temperature. This paper is concerned with oxidative altered coal from Doubrava Mine and Landek Hill where coal seams crop out at the surface. Characteristics of coal in seams exposed to the surface (Landek Hill) are similar to altered coal from Doubrava Mine. Namely it is: high concentrations of oxygen, retrogradely formed humic acids, low concentration of hydrogen and low caloricity heat. The difference between these coals is in presence of sulphate mineralization and in considerable increase of trace elements (B, As, Sr, Ba) and ammonia in coal occuring near red beds. In light of earlier geological studies, the similar characteristics of coals from Doubrava Mine, Landek Hill and the laboratory results, the postdepositional oxidation under low thermal conditions (up to 150 °C) as a possible process of coal alteration is proposed for coal from Doubrava Mine.

40|$|Highwall mining is a {{mechanized}} {{and productive}} method compared to conventional underground mining methods. It leads to added recovery of coal which is otherwise {{lost in the}} pit below the highwall. The major challenge envisaged is however the designing of web pillars in complex Indian geomining conditions, invariably comprising of multiple <b>seams,</b> some <b>in</b> close <b>proximity,</b> and multiple-pass extractions <b>in</b> thick <b>seams.</b> The method has been recently introduced in India in December 2010 with the operation of ADDCAR Continuous Highwall Mining Machine at Ramagundem Opencast Project-II (OCP-II) of Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL). After successful extraction of two seams at OCP-II, the machine is now extracting at neighbouring Medapalli Opencast Project (MOCP) of SCCL. In this paper, hybrid empirical and numerical techniques employed to design web pillars <b>in</b> multiple <b>seam</b> scenario of MOCP Mine is discussed in detail. The paper explains the procedure adopted to design web pillars for the two blocks demarcated in MOCP considering maximum coal recovery and long-term stability. The paper also reviews the general prospects of Highwall Mining in India taking cues from the MOCP mine. Copyright 2013 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association...|$|R

50|$|Because the {{coalfield}} {{developed in}} isolation from the Potteries coalfield, the seam names {{are different from those}} in use in the Potteries. However, as stated earlier, the seams were correlated together in the 1950s by the analysis of marine bands. Below are the <b>seams</b> <b>in</b> the Cheadle Coalfield, the shallowest at the top. However, the shallow <b>seams</b> <b>in</b> the Potteries don't exist in Cheadle, having been washed away millions of years ago. The equivalent <b>seam</b> <b>in</b> the Potteries coalfield is shown in brackets, and the approximate thickness is shown in feet.|$|R
