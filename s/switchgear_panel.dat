5000|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, a busbar (also bus bar, buss bar or bussbar) is a metallic strip or bar, typically housed inside <b>switchgear,</b> <b>panel</b> boards, and busway enclosures for local high current power distribution. They {{are also used}} to connect high voltage equipment at electrical switchyards, and low voltage equipment in battery banks. They are generally uninsulated, and have sufficient stiffness to be supported in air by insulated pillars. These features allow sufficient cooling of the conductors, {{and the ability to}} tap in at various points without creating a new joint.|$|E

Two <b>switchgear</b> <b>panels,</b> the works clock and symbolic cast iron gateposts with Hick's caduceus logo were saved by the Northern Mill Engine Society.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pressure}} rise {{due to an}} internal arc (IA) event {{on the structure of}} a switchgear cubicle is of great importance for a safe design. <b>Switchgear</b> <b>panels</b> are designed for withstanding an internal arc incident as per the testing conditions defined by IEC 62271 - 200 standard. This paper reports on a calculation procedure employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and structural finite element method (S-FEM). The approach is targeting a reduced numerical complexity, straight forward modelling, and stressing as little assumptions as possible. In the proposed method, time varying electric power is used as input along with other parameters for solving mass, momentum and energy equations by CFD. The peak pressure and rise time delivered by transient CFD simulation is needed to perform structural simulation. The structural calculation is performed using dynamic load factor...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis {{deals with}} use of {{electronic}} instrument transformers (sensors) in the protection system in medium-voltage substation. Substation consists of 2 incoming feeders, 2 outgoing feeders for motors, 2 outgoing feeders for power transformers, measuring, bus coupler and bus riser feeder. Incoming feeders are connected to distribution system E. ON by cable lines which were proposed. Protected machines (power transformers and motors with rated power) are connected to <b>switchgear</b> <b>panels</b> of UniGear ZS 1 type by cable lines too. Proposed protection system {{is based on the}} short-circuit conditions, standard CSN 33 3051 recommendations as well as theoretical backgrounds acquired from technical papers and other publicated literature according to the bibliography. For selected protection functions are defined their parameters. Control, monitoring and protection functions provides REF 542 plus relay. Consequently, secondary tests which are part of the commissioning, are given in the practical part of thesis. Secondary tests were performed by relay test system FREJA 300 by Megger. Results of tests are displayed in tripping characteristics...|$|R

50|$|Launched in 1978, {{the letter}} 'E' stood for {{emissions}} compliant. This model featured a new cylinder head, redesigned Amal carburettors to meet emission regulations {{and shortly after}} production started, Lucas electronic ignition. Most 'E' models had many design improvements including new Lucas <b>switchgear,</b> new side <b>panel</b> design and passenger grabrails that incorporated a small parcel rack. There was also a 1980 T140E Special Edition with hard luggage, a bikini fairing and special two-tone paint.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} power system developed for the International Space Station represents the largest space-based power system ever designed and, consequently, has driven some key technology aspects and operational challenges. The full U. S. -built system consists of a 160 -Volt dc primary network, and a more tightly regulated 120 -Volt dc secondary network. Additionally, the U. S. system interfaces with the 28 -Volt system in the Russian segment. The international nature of the Station has resulted in modular converters, <b>switchgear,</b> outlet <b>panels,</b> and other components being built by different countries, with the associated interface challenges. This paper provides details of the architecture and unique hardware developed for the Space Station, and examines the opportunities it provides for further long-term space power technology development, such as concentrating solar arrays and flywheel energy storage systems...|$|R
