5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 {{it was in the}} process of negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.|$|E
25|$|United States Navy cargo/transport version, with JT12A-8 engines, {{originally}} designated VT-39E, seven <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first Solent flew in 1946. New Solents {{were used}} by BOAC and TEAL, {{production}} ending in 1949. <b>Second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> were operated until 1958 {{by a number of}} small airlines such as Aquila Airways.|$|E
50|$|EC-137D: Two {{aircraft}} {{built as}} Early Warning and Control System prototypes. Later re-engined and re-designated E-3A. A further <b>second-hand</b> 707-355C <b>aircraft</b> was acquired and configured as an airborne special operations command post.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that North Korea had acquired several MQM-107D <b>aircraft</b> <b>second-hand</b> from a Middle Eastern country, and the following year revealed an indigenous target drone type believed {{to be based on the}} Streaker.|$|R
25|$|The 89-seat One-Eleven 400s and 119-seat One-Eleven 500s {{operated}} by the second BIA filled a niche in the UK charter market, {{which at the time}} was dominated by 130-seat Boeing 737-200s {{operated by}} BIA's much bigger, vertically integrated competitors. These smaller, <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft's</b> lower acquisition costs (compared with the competition's bigger and newer 737-200s) enabled BIA to offer tour operators lower capacity aircraft at keener rates, giving it a competitive advantage on less dense routes. The One-Eleven 400's ability to match the 737-200's range, as well as both One-Eleven variants' ability to match the 737's fuel consumption and to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules (as a result of having hush kits fitted to their engines), further enhanced BIA's competitiveness vis-à-vis its rivals. This helped attract business from the big tour operators that owned its rivals, especially to secondary European ski destinations served in winter where the lower trip costs of BIA's older planes outweighed the seat-mile cost advantage of the in-house airlines' technologically more advanced equipment. This in turn helped minimise the tour operators' risk, thereby representing a 'win-win' situation for both parties.|$|R
25|$|The conversion, {{designed}} by Boeing engineers from Puget Sound, Moscow and Canoga Park, Cal., and Gamesa Aeronáutica in Spain, {{was carried out}} in Taiwan by a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group. Boeing purchased four <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> and had them all converted; the fourth and final LCF took its first flight in January 2010.|$|E
25|$|In late 1960, the People's Republic of China {{had begun}} {{negotiations}} with Vickers {{for as many}} as 40 Viscounts; however, negotiations were protracted due to political tensions. At this point, China sought arrangements to purchase Viscounts second-hand from existing operators, and later achieved successive deals regarding the Viscount with Britain directly. The last batch of six aircraft built were for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which were delivered during 1964; at the end of production a total of 445 Viscounts had been manufactured. Many Viscounts were refurbished and saw new service with African operators; sales of these <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> continued into the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The half-flight's {{aircraft}} were to {{be provided}} by the Indian Government, and on its arrival in Basra on 26 May, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn were handed over. These three biplanes were of a [...] "pusher" [...] design, so-called because the propeller faced backwards, behind the cockpit. The planes were already obsolete and were not suitable for the desert conditions. To start with, their top speed was only 50mph (80km/h), while the desert wind (known as the shamal) often reached 80mph (129km/h). Secondly, the warmer desert air reduced the aircraft lift capability, rendering them unable to take off on occasions. The Longhorn was a <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> and had persistent mechanical problems, meaning that it {{spent a lot of}} time being repaired.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951, the RCN {{expressed}} interest in replacing their obsolete Hawker Sea Furies with Banshees, drafting a $40 million deal for 60 new aircraft. Unfortunately, due to fiscal wrangling in the Canadian Cabinet, the purchase was not approved until after Banshee production had been shut down in 1953. The RCN was forced to acquire <b>second-hand</b> USN <b>aircraft,</b> 39 {{at a cost of}} $25 million. The aircraft were delivered from 1955 to 1958, and flew from [...] or as NORAD interceptors from shore bases.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} months of operations, AeroRepública added new {{domestic}} destinations such as Cali, Medellín, Barranquilla, Montería, and Leticia. It also launched international services to Aruba and Cuba. Meanwhile, the old 727-100s were replaced by <b>second-hand</b> McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-30 <b>aircraft</b> purchased from Continental Airlines and Alitalia.|$|R
5000|$|Floyd Bennett Field's most storied {{flight was}} {{probably}} that of Douglas [...] "Wrong Way" [...] Corrigan who, in 1938, after repeatedly being denied permission {{by the authorities}} to attempt a non-stop flight to Ireland, [...] "accidentally" [...] crossed the Atlantic in a <b>second-hand</b> surplus <b>aircraft</b> on a flight registered to go to California. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression a hero-starved nation hailed Corrigan for his [...] "accident", even giving him a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan upon his return.

50|$|Four {{original}} {{customers who}} bought and operated the CL-44D4 were: Seaboard World Airlines, The Flying Tiger Line, Slick Airways and the Icelandic Airlines Loftleiðir. All other operators operated <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 1955, Air Charter {{imported}} {{its first}} Douglas DC-4 into the United Kingdom. This aircraft was a C-54B Skymaster, the DC-4's US military version. Laker had acquired the <b>aircraft</b> <b>second-hand</b> from World Airways, a US supplemental carrier. The aircraft {{was intended for}} use on internal German services, general charter work and trooping flights.|$|R
25|$|When the Army wanted 20 more C-23s in 1990 the {{production}} line had closed; <b>second-hand</b> Short 360 <b>aircraft</b> were purchased instead. Designated the C-23B+, these were modified from the original single tail to the twin-tail and cargo ramp of the other C-23Bs. In 1994, another eight aircraft were converted to replace the DHC UV-18 Twin Otters used in Alaska.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, {{the airline}} {{introduced}} <b>second-hand</b> Boeing 737-800 <b>aircraft</b> into its fleet. This provided aircraft larger than its existing 737-300s yet smaller than its 757-200 aircraft. The airline announced an eighth base at Glasgow Airport would be opened in April 2011, {{with an initial}} nine routes. The base was opened on 31 March, slightly earlier than scheduled.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{were used by}} the Swiss company Ad Astra Aero to carry out {{charters}} and joy rides on the Swiss lakes, the two passengers were seated side-by-side behind a large windscreen with the pilot in a raised open cockpit further aft.|$|E
50|$|The famous 'Viscount Jump' effect saw {{passenger}} numbers swell. Powered by four Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops, the Viscount was {{two generations}} {{ahead of the}} DC-3. In 1966 NAC bought a <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft,</b> modifying it to 807 standard, bringing the fleet to five. This opened up Viscount services to Hamilton and Invercargill.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 June 2014, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki {{said that}} they [...] "should have sought to buy other jet fighters like British, French and Russian", {{describing}} the order of American F-16s as [...] "long-winded" [...] and [...] "deluded". The IQAF instead acquired <b>second-hand</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> from Russia and Belarus to combat ISIS militants in Northern Iraq, with the first batch arriving on 28 June. The Iraqi Ministry of Defense confirmed the purchase of 5 Russian Sukhoi Su-25, uploading a [...] on its YouTube channel of their arrival. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force also delivered seven Su-25s on 1 July, the majority of which were ex-Iraqi aircraft that fled to Iran during the Gulf War.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 2006, Blue Wings {{signed a}} {{purchase}} agreement with JetBlue Airways for five <b>second-hand</b> Airbus A320-200 <b>aircraft.</b> For cost-saving reasons, Blue Wings adopted a nearly identical color scheme compared to JetBlue. On 17 October {{of the same}} year, another order - this time for 16 new Airbus A320 and 4 Airbus A321 was signed, and subsequently announced during the Farnborough Air Show of the same year.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the plan}} {{consisted}} in only upgrading the <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> of the Peace Atlantis II program and of transferring the F-16s from the Peace Atlantis I {{to a second}} squadron with the mission of performing tactical air support actions and tactical air support for maritime operations (TASMO), which wouldn't require the MLU kit.|$|E

5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of <b>second-hand</b> F-4J <b>aircraft</b> were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} parts industry was {{born out of}} the sale of <b>second-hand</b> or used <b>aircraft</b> parts from the aerospace manufacture sector. Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow. This includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and [...] "tag" [...] a part. This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications. Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market. When an airline has an aircraft on the ground, the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable. This can drive the market for specific parts. There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of {{aircraft parts}}.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) {{was tested}} to survey large mammals in the Nazinga Game Ranch {{in the south of}} Burkina Faso. The Gatewing × 100 ™ {{equipped}} with a Ricoh GR III camera was used to test animal reaction as the UAS passed, and visibility on the images. No reaction was recorded as the UAS passed at a height of 100 m. Observations, made on a set of more than 7000 images, revealed that only elephants (Loxodonta africana) were easily visible while medium and small sized mammals were not. The easy observation of elephants allows experts to enumerate them on images acquired at a height of 100 m. We, therefore, implemented an aerial strip sample count along transects used for the annual wildlife foot count. A total of 34 elephants were recorded on 4 transects, each overflown twice. The elephant density was estimated at 2. 47 elephants/km 2 with a coefficient of variation (CV%) of 36. 10 %. The main drawback of our UAS was its low autonomy (45 min). Increased endurance of small UAS is required to replace manned aircraft survey of large areas (about 1000 km of transect per day vs 40 km for our UAS). The monitoring strategy should be adapted according to the sampling plan. Also, the UAS is as expensive as a <b>second-hand</b> light <b>aircraft.</b> However the logistic and flight implementation are easier, the running costs are lower and its use is safer. Technological evolution will make civil UAS more efficient, allowing them to compete with light aircraft for aerial wildlife surveys. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|An {{accounting}} of exact types, quantities, and service dates for aircraft {{serving in the}} Abkhazian Air Force is difficult to accurately provide due {{to a number of}} factors including Abkhazia's disputed status, a lack of official available information, multiple conflicts over the course of its existence, and the regular involvement of Russian aircraft and pilots in the conflicts and region. In general, the air force has relied on aircraft inherited from the former Soviet forces based in Abkhazia with possible reinforcement in recent years by Russia with <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft.</b> No traditional contracts for aircraft purchases by Abkhazia have been reported.|$|E
50|$|The concept had {{an unusual}} legacy, in 1976 NASA {{were looking at}} ways to {{transport}} the Space Shuttle from the factory to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida {{as well as from}} Edwards Air Force Base after each mission. In addition they needed a way of getting the unpowered craft airborne for flying tests. A NASA engineer, John Kiker, thought the Mayo Composite idea would provide the answer, using a Boeing 747 as the carrier aircraft. Owing to a downturn in the air passenger market, NASA was able to acquire a <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> from American Airways cheaply and modified it accordingly.|$|E

50|$|His company, the California Airmotive Corp., {{became one}} of the largest dealers in <b>{{second-hand}}</b> <b>aircraft</b> (particularly second-hand airliners) in the world. At one time he had 35 Lockheed Constellations of various models, 22 Douglas DC-6s and DC-7s and 4 other airliners in storage at Fox Field in Lancaster, California in 1970/71, not to mention other aircraft at other airfields such as Burbank.A subsidiary company during the early 1960s was West Coast Airmotive Corporation. Allen Paulson bought out the Pacific Airmotive Corp. at Burbank and started converting various types of passenger transport to freighters. Several Lockheed Constellations were rebuilt by Paulson's company and converted to freighter aircraft. California Airmotive was renamed American Jet Industries in 1973.|$|E
