Our journey is not {{complete}} until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> love we commit to one another must be equal as well.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E

25|$|In July 1800, Malartic sailed for {{a second}} cruise, {{capturing}} the ships Frederic North, Amboyna, Alkias, and Malava. She later captured Governor North (which is almost <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> same vessel as Frederic North, both being named for Governor Frederick North, who served between 1798 and 1805 as the first British civilian governor of Ceylon), Marquis de Wellesley, and a brig, before returning to Mauritius, where she arrived with her prizes on 21 September 1800.|$|E
25|$|During {{his second}} inaugural address on January 21, 2013, Obama called for full {{equality}} for gays: “Our journey is not complete until our gay {{brothers and sisters}} are treated like anyone else under the law — for if we are truly created equal, then <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” This was a historic moment, being {{the first time that}} a president mentioned gay rights or the word gay in an inaugural address.|$|E

25|$|As of 1904, Flagler started what {{everybody}} considered a folly: {{the extension of}} the FEC to Key West which would later be known as the Overseas Railway, at the time considered the eighth wonder of the world and <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> most daring infrastructure ever built exclusively with private funds. The first train—a construction engineers train—arrived in Key West on January 21, 1912, while Mr. Flagler's special train and other passenger trains arrived the next day, January 22, 1912, and that is considered the first day of service on the new route.|$|E

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E
25|$|As regards literature, {{the leading}} figures were Irayimman Thampi and Vidwan Koithampuran, both poets {{of the royal}} court. Their works abound in a {{beautiful}} and happy blending of music and poetry. The former is <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> most musical poet of Kerala and his beautiful lullaby commencing with the line Omana Thinkalkidavo has earned him an everlasting name. But the prime reason why he is held in such high esteem in Malayalam is the contribution he has made to Kathakali literature by his three works, namely the Dakshayagam, the Kichakavadham and the Uttara-svayamvaram. The latter's Kathakali work Ravana Vijayam has made him immortal in literature.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay {{included}} the official {{rights for the}} Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories. This also helped in changing {{the demographics of the}} regions considerably. The Treaty of Adrianople, concluded with Turkey in 1829 granted for more mass settling of Armenians in the newly incorporated territories. Slowly but <b>surely,</b> <b>the</b> number of Christians, that formerly made out since the 17th century a relatively small minority in the region (except for Georgia), were starting to compose an ever-growing number of the total population, especially in the former Iranian-ruled Armenian and Georgian territories.|$|E

25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: <b>surely,</b> <b>the</b> trembling believer thinks, when what is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me that}} the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, <b>surely</b> <b>the</b> State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's Agnes Grey, {{appeared}} in 1847 after many tribulations, again {{for reasons of}} finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a new address and did this {{at least a dozen}} times during the year. The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder & Co in London, of which the 23-year-old owner George Smith had been specialised until then in publishing scientific revues aided by his perspicacious reader, William Smith Williams and remained faithful to the family. Those of Emily and Anne were confided to Thomas Cautley Newby who intended to compile a three-decker, more economical for sale and for loan in the circulating libraries the two first volumes to include Wuthering Heights and the third one Agnes Grey. Both the novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about Wuthering Heights, praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality – <b>surely,</b> <b>the</b> critics wrote, a work of a man with a depraved mind – fairly neutral about Agnes Grey, more flattering in spite of certain commentators denouncing it as an affront to morals and good mores, for Jane Eyre which soon became what would be called today a best-seller.|$|E
