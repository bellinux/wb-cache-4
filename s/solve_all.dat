5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E

25|$|The Congress {{concluded}} that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services {{to the welfare of}} mankind. It was not, however, a panacea which could <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> forest management problems. Often one use must be dominant and other proposed uses must not then be detrimental to the major one. Moreover, there can be disadvantages to multiple use when it is inefficiently applied. But multiple use must be recognized as an important goal of forest policies.|$|E

25|$|During a {{visit to}} a school in Sukhumi on 23 November, Bagapsh stated that {{education}} and health were his priorities, that wages would probably be raised in these areas in the coming year, {{that it was impossible to}} <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> problems simultaneously and that opposition promises of raising wages to 20,000 rubles were blatant lies. His Vice Presidential candidate Ankvab talked about the achievements of the current government, claiming that 10,622 people had received a total of 67million rubles in assistance. He also praised the fact that patients had been sent to Russian medical institutions to receive free treatment.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E
25|$|A Sudoku {{may also}} be {{modelled}} as a constraint satisfaction problem. In his paper Sudoku as a Constraint Problem, Helmut Simonis describes many reasoning algorithms based on constraints which {{can be applied to}} model and solve problems. Some constraint solvers include a method to model and solve Sudokus, and a program may require less than 100 lines of code to solve a simple Sudoku. If the code employs a strong reasoning algorithm, incorporating backtracking is only needed for the most difficult Sudokus. An algorithm combining a constraint-model-based algorithm with backtracking would have the advantage of fast solving time, and the ability to <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> sudokus.|$|E

25|$|In 1949 Mattei made an {{astonishing}} public announcement: {{the soil of}} the Po Valley in Northern Italy was rich in oil and methane, and Italy would <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> its energy needs using its own resources. Through the Italian press, he then encouraged {{the idea that the}} nation (still suffering from the consequences of defeat in World War II), would soon become rich. Agip's financial value immediately grew in the Stock Exchange markets, and the company (owned by the State, but operating as a private company) became at once solid and important. The reality was a little different: in the territory of Cortemaggiore, in the Valley of Po, a certain amount of methane had been found together with a small quantity of oil.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 1997, after 10 years, 407 appearances, 108 {{goals and}} four major trophies, Barnes {{left on a}} free transfer. He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against Southampton just after Christmas) as they had led the table {{for much of the}} first half of the season before being {{overhauled}} by eventual champions Manchester United at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince, a slightly younger central midfielder with a completely contrasting combative style was signed to replace him in the middle of the park and Barnes felt signing a player like Ince may not <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> of Liverpool's problems.|$|E
25|$|Also, for {{the first}} time, the limits of {{mathematics}} were explored. Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian, and Évariste Galois, a Frenchman, proved {{that there is no}} general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abel–Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three dimensions in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of parameter space and hypercomplex numbers.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, Shannon {{began his}} {{graduate}} studies {{in electrical engineering}} at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer, an early analog computer. While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, A paper from this thesis was published in 1938. In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits {{could be used to}} simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used then in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presents diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.|$|E
25|$|Some {{pesticide}} authorities recommend, {{and some}} jurisdictions require, that notice of spraying {{be sent to}} all known beekeepers in the area, so they can seal the entrances to their hives and keep the bees inside until the pesticide has {{had a chance to}} disperse. This, however, does not <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> problems associated with spraying and the label instructions should be followed regardless of doing this. Sealing honey bees from flight on hot days can kill bees. Beekeeper notification does not offer any protection to bees, if the beekeeper cannot access them, or to wild native or feral honey bees. Thus, beekeeper notification as the sole protection procedure does not really protect all the pollinators of the area, and is, in effect, a circumventing of the label requirements. Pesticide losses are a major factor in pollinator decline.|$|E
500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got {{to step up to the}} plate and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E

The prize is [...] "named after President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the doyen of African Heads of State and a tireless advocate of peace, concord, fellowship and dialogue to <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> conflicts both within and between States". It is awarded annually along with a check for €122,000, by an international jury composed of 11 persons from five continents, led by former United States Secretary of State and Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger.

500|$|In {{addition}} to writing a weekly column for The Dallas Morning News for 15years, Marcus {{was the author}} of multiple retailing-oriented books, including Minding the Store: A Memoir (1974), the sequel Quest for the Best (1979), and His & Hers: The Fantasy World of the Neiman Marcus Catalogue (1982) He was a close friend of other writers, including Jane Trahey, an author and longtime advertising copywriter who at one time worked for Neiman Marcus, and historian David McCullough. A television presenter for the public broadcasting program American Experience, McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcus– [...] "one of the wisest men I know"– what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, [...] "I'd try to do something about television."

Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves.
