40|$|If solar arrays on <b>solar-electric</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{protrude}} {{into the}} exhaust hemisphere {{of the electric}} thrusters, they will receive fluxes (usually small) of both propellant and accelerator grid atoms. Unlike propellants, grid materials have low vapor pressures and will not reevaporate. An analysis is presented of degradation in the optical, thermal, and electrical performance of solar cells resulting from thin deposits of grid material (aluminum and molybdenum) on various array surfaces. The classical optical theory of thin films, heat balance equations, and a typical relationship for solar cell efficiency vs temperature are used to compute curves showing optical properties, temperature, and power output as functions of film thickness. The results compare favorably with available experimental data. It is shown that a few monolayers of metal deposition on the illuminated surface will seriously degrade cell performance. A means of estimating the arrival rate of these materials is provided...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed mission analysis and systems {{design of a}} pole-sitter mission. It considers a spacecraft that is continuously above either the North or South Pole and, as such, can provide real-time, continuous and hemispherical coverage of the polar regions. Two different propulsion strategies are proposed, which result in a near-term pole-sitter mission using solar electric propulsion and a far-term pole-sitter mission where the electric thruster is hybridized with a solar sail. For both propulsion strategies, minimum propellant pole-sitter orbits are designed. Optimal transfers from Earth to the pole-sitter are designed assuming Soyuz and Ariane 5 launch options, and a controller is shown {{to be able to}} maintain the trajectory under unexpected conditions such as injection errors. A detailed mass budget analysis allows for a trade-off between mission lifetime and payload mass capacity, and candidate payloads for a range of applications are investigated. It results that a payload of about 100 kg can operate for approximately 4 years with the <b>solar-electric</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> while the hybrid propulsion technology enables extending the missions up to 7 years. Transfers between north and south pole-sitter orbits are also considered to observe either pole when illuminated by the Sun...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{thrusters}} typically {{require a}} power processing unit (PPU) {{to convert the}} spacecraft provided power to the voltage-current that a thruster needs for operation. Testing has been initiated to study whether an arcjet thruster can be operated directly with the power produced by solar arrays without any additional conversion. Elimination of the PPU significantly reduces system-level complexity of the propulsion system, and lowers developmental cost and risk. The work aims to identify and address technical questions related to power conditioning and noise suppression {{in the system and}} heating of the thruster in long-duration operation. The apparatus under investigation has a target power level from 400 - 1, 000 W. However, the proposed direct-drive arcjet is potentially a highly scalable concept, applicable to <b>solar-electric</b> <b>spacecraft</b> with up to 100 's of kW and beyond. A direct-drive electric propulsion system would be comprised of a thruster that operates with the power supplied directly from the power source (typically solar arrays) with no further power conditioning needed between those two components. Arcjet thrusters are electric propulsion devices, with the power supplied as a high current at low voltage; of all the different types of electric thruster, they are best suited for direct drive from solar arrays. One advantage of an arcjet over Hall or gridded ion thrusters is that for comparable power the arcjet is a much smaller device and can provide more thrust and orders of magnitude higher thrust density (approximately 1 - 10 N/sq m), albeit at lower I(sub sp) (approximately 800 - 1000 s). In addition, arcjets are capable of operating {{on a wide range of}} propellant options, having been demonstrated on H 2, ammonia, N 2, Ar, Kr, Xe, while present SOA Hall and ion thrusters are primarily limited to Xe propellant. Direct-drive is often discussed in terms of Hall thrusters, but they require 250 - 300 V for operation, which is difficult even with high-voltage solar arrays. The arcjet requires under 100 V, which is more in-line with what is easily possible with a solar array. Direct-drive of an electric propulsion system confers the advantage of reducing or eliminating the power processing unit (PPU) that is typically needed to convert the spacecraft-provided power to the voltage and current needed for thruster operation. Since the PPU is typically the most expensive piece of an electric thruster system, from both a fabrication and qualification standpoint, its elimination offers the potential for major reductions in system cost and risk. The design of the arcjet built for this effort was based on previous low power (1 kW class) arcjets. It has a precision machined 99. 95 % pure tungsten anode which also serves as the nozzle. The anode constrictor region is 1 mm (0. 040 -in) diameter and 1 mm (0. 040 -in) long. The cathode is a tungsten welding electrode doped with LaO 2; its tip was precision ground to a 30 angle ending in a blunt end. The two electrodes are separated by a boron-nitride insulator which also serves as the propellant injection manifold; it ends in six small holes which introduce the propellant gas in the diverging section of the nozzle, directly adjacent to the cathode. The electrodes and insulator are housed in a stainless-steel outer-body, with a Macor insulator at the mid-plane to provide thermal isolation between the front and back halves of the device. The gas seals were made using Grafoil gaskets. Figure 1 A shows the assembled thruster in the vacuum chamber; figure 1 B shows the thruster in operation on argon at a flow rate of 676 sccm (20 mg/s). Initial testing was conducted in a 3. 5 -ft diameter vacuum chamber; the ultimate pressure reached during quasi-steady operation of the thruster was about 330 millitorr. The thruster was powered with a high-current, 0 - 100 A, 15 kW power supply. The discharge was initiated with a high-voltage (approximately 10 kV) spark initiator that was isolated from the supply by a stack of diodes. The testing indicated that an operating point exists within the I-V characteristics that is compatible with direct-drive solar-electric operation; for a flow rate of 20 mg/s (argon) the arc could be sustained at a voltage of about 20 V and a current of 25 A (500 W) ...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{has emerged}} as a cost-effective solution {{to a wide range of}} satellite applications. Deep Space 1 successfully demonstrated electric propulsion as the primary propulsion source for a satellite. The POWOW concept is a <b>solar-electric</b> propelled <b>spacecraft</b> capable of significant cargo and short trip times for traveling to Mars. There it would enter areosynchronous orbit (Mars GEO equivalent) and beam power to surface installations via lasers. The concept has been developed with industrial partner expertise in high efficiency solar cells, advanced concentrator modules, innovative arrays, and high power electric propulsion systems. The present baseline spacecraft design providing 898 kW using technologies expected to be available in 2003 will be described. Areal power densities approaching 350 W/sq m at 80 C operating temperatures and wing level specific powers of over 350 W/kg are projected. Details of trip times and payloads to Mars are presented. Electric propulsion options include Hall, MPD, and ion thrusters of various power levels and trade studies have been conducted to define the most advantageous options. Because the design is modular, learning curve methodology has been applied to determine expected cost reductions and is included...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTitan, {{with its}} {{organically}} rich and dynamic atmosphere and geology, and Enceladus, with its active plume, both harbouring global subsurface oceans, are prime {{environments in which}} to investigate the habitability of ocean worlds and the conditions {{for the emergence of}} life. We present a space mission concept, the Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E 2 T), which is dedicated to investigating the evolution and habitability of these Saturnian satellites. E 2 T is proposed as a medium-class mission led by ESA in collaboration with NASA in response to ESA's M 5 Cosmic Vision Call. E 2 T proposes a focused payload that would provide in-situ composition investigations and high-resolution imaging during multiple flybys of Enceladus and Titan using a <b>solar-electric</b> powered <b>spacecraft</b> in orbit around Saturn. The E 2 T mission would provide high-resolution mass spectrometry of the plume currently emanating from Enceladus' south polar terrain and of Titan's changing upper atmosphere. In addition, high-resolution infrared (IR) imaging would detail Titan's geomorphology at 50 â€“ 100 m resolution and the temperature of the fractures on Enceladus' south polar terrain at meter resolution. These combined measurements of both Titan and Enceladus would enable the E 2 T mission scenario to achieve two major scientific goals: 1) Study the origin and evolution of volatile-rich ocean worlds; and 2) Explore the habitability and potential for life in ocean worlds. E 2 T's two high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometers would enable resolution of the ambiguities in chemical analysis left by the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini-Huygens mission regarding the identification of low-mass organic species, detect high-mass organic species for the first time, further constrain trace species such as the noble gases, and clarify the evolution of solid and volatile species. The high-resolution IR camera would reveal the geology of Titan's surface and the energy dissipated by Enceladus' fractured south polar terrain and plume in detail unattainable by the Cassini mission...|$|R
