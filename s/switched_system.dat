Some other users of System X - in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston Communications - replaced their circuit <b>switched</b> <b>System</b> X equipment with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which are the NGN replacement for System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a suitable replacement softswitch to match System X reliability, and the shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband - all led to much of the System X estate being maintained.|$|E
50|$|Communication on the IP {{network is}} {{perceived}} as less reliable {{in contrast to the}} circuit-switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network-based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost, and are delivered in sequential order. It is a best-effort network without fundamental Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Voice, and all other data, travels in packets over IP networks with fixed maximum capacity. This system may be more prone to congestion and DoS attacks than traditional circuit switched systems; a circuit <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment, while the quality of real-time data such as telephone conversations on packet-switched networks degrades dramatically. Therefore, VoIP implementations may face problems with latency, packet loss, and jitter.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{landline}} is {{also used}} to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wired <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> (usually the public switched telephone network). So-called leased lines are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a land line in this context are security and survivability. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units [...] "by landline" [...] to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. Another example of this is in airports. All air traffic control towers have dedicated lines connected to the police, fire department, hospitals, army, etc. Deployed as a precaution in case of emergency, these can be used at any time.|$|E

50|$|Prior to OSI, {{networking}} {{was largely}} either government-sponsored (ARPANET in the US, CYCLADES in France) or vendor-developed and proprietary standards (such as the System network architecture (SNA) of IBM and DECnet of Digital Equipment Corporation). An Experimental Packet <b>Switched</b> <b>system</b> in the UK circa 1973, also identified {{the need to}} define higher level protocols. The NCC (UK) publication 'Why Distributed Computing' which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. OSI was hence an industry effort, attempting to get industry participants to agree on common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability. It was common for large networks to support multiple network protocol suites, with many devices unable to interoperate with other devices {{because of a lack}} of common protocols. However, while OSI developed its networking standards, TCP/IP came into widespread use on multivendor networks for internetworking, while on the local network level both Ethernet and token ring gained prominence.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the stability under arbitrary switching of a discrete–time linear <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> A powerful approach for addressing {{this problem is}} based on studying the “most unstable ” switching law (MUSL).

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state switched systems, where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent systems and in switched systems, the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for switched systems, and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|E
