25|$|The BSA {{requires}} {{financial institutions}} {{to engage in}} customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as know your customer. This includes obtaining satisfactory identification to give assurance that the account is in the customer's true name, and having {{an understanding of the}} expected nature and source of the money that flows through the customer's accounts. Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent dirty money from {{entering}} the U.S. financial system in the first place, the United States Congress passed a series of laws, starting in 1970, collectively known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). These laws, contained in sections 5311 through 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require financial institutions, which under the current definition include {{a broad array of}} entities, including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, money service businesses and broker-dealers in securities, to report certain transactions to the United States Department of the Treasury. Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a currency transaction report (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of US$5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000. [...] The U.S. {{is one of the few}} countries in the world to require reporting of all cash transactions over a certain limit, although certain businesses can be exempt from the requirement. Additionally, financial institutions must report transaction on a <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> (SAR) that they deem [...] "suspicious", defined as a knowing or suspecting that the funds come from illegal activity or disguise funds from illegal activity, that it is structured to evade BSA requirements or appears to serve no known business or apparent lawful purpose; or that the institution is being used to facilitate criminal activity. Attempts by customers to circumvent the BSA, generally by structuring cash deposits to amounts lower than US$10,000 by breaking them up and depositing them on different days or at different locations also violates the law......|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of virtual currencies {{in the past}} decade, and particularly the popularity of Bitcoin, has raised concerns that such technologies may be utilised by criminals {{for the purposes of}} money laundering. Recent guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has suggested applying anti-money laundering legislation (AML) to virtual currencies, specifically <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements. This paper seeks to explain what virtual currencies are, and demonstrate the difficulties in applying AML, and specifically <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements, to virtual currency transactions. The argument proposed is that <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> is not compatible with virtual currencies, specifically due to the absence of human interaction with virtual currency transactions. In achieving this aim the stages of money laundering will be outlined, and a hypothetical example of money laundering through ‘traditional’ methods will be compared money laundering through virtual currencies. The guidance of the FATF will be considered, alongside the responses of the United States, the EU and the UK. The <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> regime of the UK will be applied to virtual currencies and as such the pitfalls will be identified and potential solutions will be considered...|$|R

50|$|Many criminals, such {{as those}} {{interested}} in tax evasion and money laundering, have researched the Title 31 requirements and have created a number of strategies to avoid detection of their activities by circumventing the reporting requirements. When these activities are discovered, casino staff are required to file a <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> (SAR, FinCEN Form 114) to report the suspicious activities. Because there are many types of suspicious activities, it is required that casino personnel receive Title 31 training to avoid penalty and remain compliant.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>report</b> is to report known or {{suspected}} violations of law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions subject to the regulations (for example, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)). In many instances, SARs have been instrumental in enabling law enforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing investigations and other criminal cases. Information provided in SAR forms also presents FinCEN with a method of identifying emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes. The information about those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable feedback to financial institutions.|$|E

At two {{points in the}} conversation, the Aurelia Finance representatives made threats ... referring to 'Colombian friends' who could 'cause havoc' and telling JPMorgan employee 'we {{know where to find}} you’.” [...] JPMorgan reported the threats to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency in October 2008 by filing a <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report,</b> concerned that “Colombian drug money” was involved in the Madoff firm.|$|E
50|$|The term foreign {{official}} {{has been}} used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010. Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a <b>suspicious</b> <b>activity</b> <b>report</b> to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals. The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.|$|E

50|$|When {{the first}} version of the CTR was introduced, the only way a {{suspicious}} transaction less than $10,000 was reported to the government was if a bank teller called law enforcement. This was primarily due to the financial industry's concern about the right to financial privacy. On October 26, 1986, {{with the passage of the}} Money Laundering Control Act, the right to financial privacy was no longer an issue. As part of the Act, Congress had stated that a financial institution could not be held liable for releasing suspicious transactional information to law enforcement. As a result, the next version of the CTR had a suspicious transaction check box at the top. This was in effect until April 1996 when the <b>Suspicious</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> (SAR) was introduced.|$|E
