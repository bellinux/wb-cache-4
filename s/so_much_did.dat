5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he had a}} {{reputation}} for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a canal at Suez would make good relations with Egypt vital to Britain. Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being [...] "born a free, independent American, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived". By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.|$|E
2500|$|The Carthaginians {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties and}} their field forces were virtually eliminated for some time. Some ancient authorities refrain from giving specific numbers, but others give figures between 30,000 and 40,000 {{for the men}} who were killed, and up to 5,000 for those taken alive. Almost all sources (except Cassius Dio) agree that the losses of the Romans were minimal. Polybius wrote: [...] "...it is not possible to find any other disaster which even if exaggerated could be compared with this, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> it exceed in horror all previous events. Therefore of all the brilliant exploits performed by Scipio this seems to me the most splendid and most adventurous." [...] With one single strike Scipio was able {{to get rid of the}} Carthaginian blockade and to renew the offensive operations of the previous summer. What followed shortly afterwards was the battle of the Great Plains, which ended with another crushing defeat of Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax. Carthage had to recall its armies from Italy for a last decisive encounter that took place in 202 BC, and resulted in a final defeat and a peace treaty, ending the Second Punic War in 201 BC.|$|E
6000|$|Dan {{was equally}} enthusiastic. In all his experience, which {{extended}} {{over two years}} at the very least, he declared {{that he had never}} seen <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>done</b> for a boy, and concluded by saying: ...|$|R
50|$|I pray {{to heaven}} {{to dry up}} the magueys,Because these agaves are the cause of my misfortune;I am very drunk and nothing gives me satisfaction,Because the woman I loved <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>does</b> not love me.|$|R
6000|$|... "My mother, frequently--I {{have seen}} the tears start into {{her eyes as she}} gazed at me, and she has often told me my family name ought to have been Mordaunt, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> I {{resemble}} her father." ...|$|R
60|$|No wonder, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> {{his hand}} tremble, {{as he held}} out the envelope.|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{a letter}} dated two days later to their sister Wilhelmina, he relayed, [...] "I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, {{something}} like another brother, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> we resemble each other physically and also mentally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a-goin' to {{make her}} some jelly this very forenoon," [...] said Mrs. Kittridge. [...] "Aunt Roxy was a-tellin' me {{yesterday}} that she was a-goin' down {{to stay at the}} house regular, for she needed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>done</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, darling," [...] says Mr. Bucket {{with the}} {{greatest}} composure, [...] "I'm fully prepared to hear that. Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ. You don't mind me half <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>do</b> you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Phoebe {{could almost}} have said 'pray do,' <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> she long {{to join the}} party in Woolstone-lane, where the only alloy was, that poor Maria's {{incapacity}} for secrecy forbade her hearing the good news.|$|E
60|$|The rage {{went out}} of Arthur's eyes, and he almost smiled, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> that {{familiar}} phrase convey, with its subtle inflections. It was cunning and candid and chivalrous all at once. It acknowledged defeat and guilt and embodied a certain pride in the victor.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> Doctor John tell me, his {{old friend}} and confidant. I said nothing and gave no advice, not having lived seventy-five years for nothing. I knew that Doctor John's {{decision}} was manly and right and fair; but I also knew it was all nullified {{by the fact that}} Marcella already loved him.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can {{you promise}} <b>so</b> <b>much?</b> <b>Do</b> {{you mean that}} you and I must fall upon him? You forget {{that he will have}} men about him. A duel is one thing, a rough-and-tumble another, and we shall fare none so well in this, I'm thinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{a gentleman}} like him should {{have his own}} way. And an old hag like me shouldn't stand for anything. No more shouldn't a young woman like you who has had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>done</b> for her. Now, Miss Mary, you see I've told you my mind freely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{know what}} you do think of it, but indeed you need not be wasted. Our women and {{children}} want <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>done</b> for them, and none of our ladies are able or willing. Will you not come and help me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Early on the {{following}} day the whole town was on its feet, and everyone wondered how and where the stranger would build the wonderful palace. The Princess alone was silent and sorrowful, and had cried all night till her pillow was wet, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> she take the fate of the beautiful youth to heart.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> Lady Lufton {{do for her}} protégé, and it {{may well}} be {{imagined}} that the Devonshire physician, sitting meditative over his parlour fire, looking back, as men will look back on the upshot of their life, was well contented with that upshot, as regarded his eldest offshoot, the Rev. Mark Robarts, the vicar of Framley.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he grieve {{over this}} unhappy {{business}} that his health was affected and being run down, {{in the end}} he took some sort of fever and was very ill indeed. When at length he recovered more or less he went before a Medical Board who ordered him promptly to England on six months' leave.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was making}} me cross. [...] "Where do I live?" [...] I retorted. [...] "Why, in this cottage. You don't think I've got {{up early and}} come from a {{distance}} {{to listen to this}} cow? Don't talk <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> <b>Do</b> you know whose cow it is, or don't you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|One day the King, {{with his}} usual imprudence, pointed him out to the Provost of St. Omer. [...] "Seest thou him yonder? Never did one man watch another as he watches me, lest I should get some of his goods; but as much pains as he takes to watch me, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> I take to gain them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Slowly {{the evening}} wore on, {{until the last}} trace of {{sunshine}} had gone and only the stars shone down upon the Hasty.

60|$|Mr. Stubbs's {{brother was}} quite as mischievous as a monkey could be; he capered around the room, picking at {{this thing and}} looking into that, until Aunt Olive laughed herself tired, and Uncle Daniel {{declared}} that if the other monkey was anything like this one, Toby was right when he named him Steve Stubbs, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he resemble that gentleman in inquisitiveness.|$|E
6000|$|But she was lucky, and luck's all. Your Queens [...] Are {{generally}} prosperous in reigning-- [...] Which puzzles us to {{know what}} Fortune means:-- [...] But to continue--though her years were waning, [...] Her climacteric teased her like her teens; [...] And though her dignity brooked no complaining, [...] <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> Juan's setting off distress her, [...] She could not find at first a fit successor.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't talk a {{bit more}} than the old ladies do. I just wish you could have heard them go on, last time. The way they get <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>done,</b> is, they take work home, and make their seamstresses do it, and then they take credit for vast industry," [...] said Belle, who always spoke her mind with charming candor.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt she}} did;--but {{that does not}} alter her nature. I think I could find it in my heart to forgive her, even though she {{attempted}} to poison me, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> I stand in her way. I have sometimes thought that I ought to repudiate myself; give up my prospects, and call myself John Trafford--so as {{to make way for}} her more lordly lordlings." ...|$|R
6000|$|That personage finely meditated. [...] "After all, {{why should}} we both go; having, each of us, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to <b>do</b> during these last hours?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then Thurid {{laid her}} arms round his neck, and besought {{him not to}} burn the {{furnishings}} of the bed, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> she press him in this that his heart gave way to her, and she managed it so that Thorodd burned the mattresses and pillows, while she took for herself the quilt and coverlets and all the hangings. Yet neither of them was well pleased.|$|E

60|$|A pang of pity {{shot through}} her heart. Edward Cossey, feeble, dejected, and limping from {{the jaws of}} Death, was a very {{different}} being to Edward Cossey in the full glow of his youth, health, and strength.

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} so occupied, Adela. There is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to <b>do</b> in taking up a parish. Even though I know all the people so well, there has been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Moses; [...] "at least," [...] he added, {{blushing}} very deeply, [...] "I didn't {{feel like}} reading. I had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to <b>do,</b> {{and there was}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to see." ...|$|R
