By introducing minimum-length limits, maximum-length limits, and combinations of such limits (resulting in harvestable-slot length limits) into the model, we examine the potential of simple management tools for mitigating selection pressures induced by recreational fishing.

Measurement of selection is complicated by the presence of correlations between characters; selection on a particular trait produces not only a direct effect, but indirect effects as well.

The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate patterns and strength of selection acting on a set of correlated characters in a natural population of Bufo bufo from the vicinity of Belgrade, Serbia. Morphological traits (body length, fore- and hind leg length) were measured, while fitness was assayed as fecundity and gonad weight for females and males, respectively. The regression approach was used to estimate <b>selection</b> <b>differentials</b> and gradients. <b>Selection</b> patterns differed between the sexes – linear <b>selection</b> <b>differentials</b> showed significant total directional selection for body size in females, but not in males.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{heritability}} as generally used, involves {{the assumption that}} additive genetic variance is a constant proportion of total variance over {{the entire range of}} phenotypes. If this assumption holds, selection response will be linearly related to <b>selection</b> <b>differential.</b> If not, prediction of selection response will not be possible from a knowledge of the phenotypic <b>selection</b> <b>differential</b> and the average proportion of additive genetic variance. Thus the validity of this assumption has a bearing on the design of efficient selection schemes for many situations. In the field of applied animal breeding, for example, this will affect such important questions as the increase in rate of genetic improvement to be expected from the use of artificial insemination.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the proper conditions for mass selecting useful genotypes in segregating maize genetic materials. F 1 /F 2 comparisons were made to evaluate the genetic materials and F 1 /F 2 and F 2 mixtures of genotypes were formed to ensure allocompetition conditions. Moreover, two severe stresses were applied: plant density and low inputs, in addition to full-inputs conditions. Prisma F 1 and F 2 were better yielding materials than Funo F 1 and F 2, respectively. Until 13. 33 plants m - 2 there was an increase in F 1 field yields, followed by lower yields in increased plant density, since modern hybrids tolerate greater plant populations. Significant interaction between genetic materials and plant density found in full-inputs experiments, was eliminated under the strong low-inputs stress.

Nucleus herd numbers over the 1976 - 85 period were 775 cows and 357 heifers, {{with an average}} of 101 2 -year-old bulls being {{distributed}} annually to LDMC herds. From 1976 / 77, a multiplicative breeding objective was established in the nucleus, accounting for cow and calf weights and net fertility of the cow. Primary selection was applied to yearling bulls and heifers using a selection index combining the calf 2 ̆ 7 s data and dam 2 ̆ 7 s updated data (2 ̆ 7 Yearling Index 2 ̆ 7, YI). For calves born in 1976 to 1984, the average generation interval was 3. 76 years. The corresponding cumulative <b>selection</b> <b>differential</b> for YI had reached 1. 90 σ in the final year, with similar values also for three of four component traits. For young males, the actual <b>selection</b> <b>differential</b> for YI was 1. 47 σ, 86...|$|E
40|$|Divergent {{selection}} for heat production/ loss (kcal•kg-. 75 •d- 1), measured in 9 - to 11 -wk-old male mice, was conducted for 15 generations. Heat loss was measured for 15 h on individual animals placed overnight in direct, gradient-layer calorimeters. Selection for high (MH) and low (ML) heat loss and unselected control (MC) occurred {{in each of}} three replicates {{for a total of}} nine unique lines. Repeatability of the heat loss measurement was. 45 and the CV was 10. 5 %. Cumulative realized <b>selection</b> <b>differentials,</b> averaged for the three replicates, were 145. 1 and - 105. 0 (kcal•kg-. 75 •d- 1) and ranged from 136. 9 to 149. 2 and - 107. 1 to - 101. 3 for MH and ML selection, respectively. Cumulative standardized realized <b>selection</b> <b>differentials,</b> averaged for the three replicates, were 10. 06 and - 9. 51 for MH and ML selection, respectively. Direct responses (kcal•kg-. 75 •d- 1) in heat loss after 15 generations were 44. 2 for MH and - 27. 4 for ML as deviations from MC. Asymmetry of response was evident (P =. 03) by Generation 10. Realized heritability was. 28 ±. 01 based on divergence of MH and ML selection. For {{selection for}} higher and lower heat loss, realized heritabilities were. 31 ±. 01 and. 26 ±. 01, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} basis and computational procedures for estimating the culling variate utilized by breeders in actual selection are presented. The {{essential part of}} this procedure is to derive the unknown culling variate {{in terms of a}} linear combination of traits based on realized indirect <b>selection</b> <b>differentials</b> of those traits and phenotypic variances and covariances among traits in the population. Special emphasis is placed on the distribution of the variables involved. The accuracy of the culling variate is estimated by use of the biserial correlation with some modifications. Numerical illustrations are given for different types of selection...|$|R
