500|$|Otosclerosis is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are <b>stapedectomy,</b> the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E

Case presentation We present the case of a 48 -year-old German Caucasian woman presenting with hearing loss on the left side and vertigo. She had undergone three previous <b>stapedectomies</b> for hearing improvement.

40|$|During a 10 -year period (1984 - 1994) 1229 stapes {{operations}} for otosclerosis were performed at our respective institutions by experienced surgeons well {{trained in the}} various techniques. Procedures included 691 <b>stapedectomies,</b> 234 small-fenestrae stapedotomies, and 304 revision operations. These primary and revision cases resulted in 20 ears with severe sensorineural hearing loss or anacusis noted during the immediate postoperative period. This article will critically evaluate those procedures that resulted in profound hearing loss and attempt to determine possible reasons for this occurrence.

Intraoperative findings, causes of failure, and pre- and postoperative audiometric results were noted retrospectively. ResultsThe leading causes of failure found intraoperatively included dislocated prosthesis and necrosis of the long process of the incus. The average postoperative air–bone gap was 13 dB.

40|$|Morphology {{and calcium}} {{metabolism}} {{have been studied}} on five different cell cultures from human normal adult temporal-bone biopsies obtained during five <b>stapedectomies.</b> Control cell cultures were obtained from normal human skin. Four different cell types were observed in the bone biopsies: 1) osteoblast-like cells; 2) osteoclast-like cells; 3) fibroblast-like cells; 4) intermediate cells. However, morphology by itself is inadequate for clear differentiation of the four cell types. Hormonal stimulation with calcitonin and dibutyryl-cAMP in presence of 45 Ca++ showed a clear-cut difference in 45 Ca++ uptake between cultured cells deriving from bone and skin. Functional responses to hormonal stimulation are therefore more specific than cell shape and morphology in differentiating fibroblasts from bone cells. Since responses to hormonal stimulation confirm that temporal-bone cell cultures actually contain bone cells, such cultures {{seem to be a}} good experimental model for the study of bone morphology and physiology...|$|R

The authors compared the number of otologic surgical procedures {{with the number of}} laryngomicroscopies and procedures performed in Waldeyer's ring. RESULTS From January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2001, 1184 patients underwent the following surgical procedures in total endotracheal anesthesia: 285 paracenteses, 473 ventilation tubes insertions, 175 antrotomies or mastoidectomies, 194 tympanoplasties, 34 radical mastoidectomies, 4 facial nerve decompressions, 5 exostoses or osteoma of the external auditory canal operations and 14 <b>stapedectomies.</b> DISCUsSION Otologic surgical procedures are presented in table 1. In Yugoslav literature Topolac reports approximately 700 tympanoplasties in a 10 -year period (1968 - 1978). Radonjić and associates report 2272 ear operations in the period 1975 - 1985. Distribution of operations is presented in table 2, whereas in table 3 we can see that the number of operated ears is much greater than the number of operated patients. CONCLUSION We think that the number of operations is not bigger, because we operate only in critical cases.

50|$|The world's first <b>stapedectomy</b> is {{credited}} to Dr. John J.Shea Jr. who performed it in May 1956 on a 54-year-old housewife who {{could no longer}} hear even with a hearing aid. Significant contributions to modern <b>stapedectomy</b> techniques were then made by the late Dr. Antonio De La Cruz of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles; by the late Professor Henri André Martin of the Hôpital Edouard Herriot in Lyon, France, including calibrated platinotomy (stapes footplate rather than whole surgery) and trans-footplate piston surgery that also {{paved the way for}} modern stapedotomy; and by the late Dr. Jean-René Causse of the eponymous clinic in Béziers, France, who pioneered the use of Teflon piston prostheses (also critical progress for stapedotomy) and, with his late son Dr. Jean-Bernard Causse, the reattachment of the stapedius muscle alongside the use of veinous grafts.|$|E
50|$|Comparisons {{have shown}} stapedotomy to yield either {{as good or}} better results than <b>stapedectomy</b> (measured by hearing {{improvement}} and reduction in the air-bone hearing gap, and especially at higher sound frequencies), and to be less prone to complications.

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether the three-dimensional (3 -D) images from computed tomography (CT) scans of the ears could adequately define the site and extent of new bone in the cochlea, and how these images compared with those created by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients whose investigations were used in the study were being assessed for a cochlear implant and were selected on the basis of their history and the appearance of their two-dimensional (2 -D) CT scans. Four patients had progressive mixed deafness, a family history of deafness, and <b>stapedectomies.</b> They were considered to be deaf from otosclerosis and needed further assessment because their scans showed either obstructed cochleas from new bone, or demineralized otic capsules to the point that we could not determine whether new bone was present or not. The fifth patient was being assessed within 3 months of suffering deafness from meningitis. In one ear he had extensive ossification, and in the other the degree of opacification shown in axial and coronal cuts of the basal turn was inconsistent. Essentially the problem is that at the magnification used in examination of the inner ear, the resolution of 2 -D CT scans gives indistinct borders between bone and water. Magnetic resonance imaging has commonly been used in these cases. The study showed that it is now possible to confirm whether or not there is new bone and to demonstrate the site and extent of new bone with both 3 -D and MRI images. It is not possible to give a degree of sensitivity and specificity for this observation because of the small group of subjects in the study. It should be worth applying the reconstruction software to scans from helical scanners with a view to assessing whether the resolution of the 3 -D images can be improved further. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Otosclerosis {{describes}} a pathological bone remodelling process within the labyrinth capsule {{of the middle}} ear that causes a conductive hearing loss through secondary contribution of the stapes foot plate. Over the last decades, operative procedures for the treatment of Otosclerosis have been developed that make use of stapes prostheses. The Incusstapedotomy of Fisch is now generally established practice. In special cases of an altered ossicular chain, the Malleostapedotomy is also applied today. The present study is concerned with the analysis of pre- and post-operative hearing results of patients with Otosclerosis, who have undergone a stapes operation between 1998 and 2007 at the university of Marburg and the Park-Klinik Weißensee, Charité Berlin. The analysis is based on 119 stapes operations, which included 99 Incusstapedotomies, 5 <b>Stapedectomies</b> and 15 Malleostapedotomies. The operations were carried out by a single surgeon with substantial experience in ear-surgery. The Incusstapedotomies were performed partly under local anesthesia (24 %), but for the greater part under general anesthesia (76 %). Prosthesis made of gold (Fa K, 33 %) and of titanium (Fa K, 39 % and Fa Storz, formerly Fa S & L, 18 %) were utilised. The stapes footplate was perforated manually (51 %) and using the Erbium:YAG-Laser (49 %). The results were presented separately for patients with first and revised stapes surgery, as well as for Incusstapedotomy and Malleostapedotomy. The follow-up inspection period after surgery encompassed short and long term results. The selection and analysis of hearing parameters complied with the recommen¬dations of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium of the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery. To increase the statistical relevance of the comparison, frequency series as well as single frequencies were selected for air conduction and bone conduction. A post-operative air-bone gap of less than 10 dB was used as the base measure of hearing success. The computed frequency series, which differed significantly, highlighted a dependency of the postoperative hearing results on different factors such as the selection of hearing parameters. Under consideration of higher frequencies, the hearing success rate was lowered. The results did not change significantly in the post-operative time dimension, but an increase in hearing success was observed in the lower frequencies, although also a decline in the higher frequencies. In the context of the Incusstapedotomy, the gold prosthesis Fa K (38 %) and the titanium prosthesis Fa K (49 %) were examined more closely. Post-operatively, both groups of prostheses showed a significant lower air-bone gap. The titanium prosthesis showed a significant better air conduction result in higher frequencies, whereas the gold prosthesis showed it in lower frequencies. The “overclosure” phenomenon appeared more often with the gold prosthesis than with the titanium prosthesis. Overall a greater hearing success was observed using the gold prosthesis than with the titanium prosthesis, whereas in former studies both prostheses were evaluated as equal. The use of general anesthesia in this study tended to yield better hearing results than the use of local anesthesia. The combination with manual perforation yielded better mean results than the Erbium:YAG-Laser; a tendency which took shape with rising frequencies of air conduction. For patients with first surgery, the Malleostapedotomy was a promising and conservative therapy. The hearing results and the hearing success rate of 67 % clearly demonstrate a superiority over the Incusstapedotomy. Complications were not observed. This study suggests to consider the postoperative hearing as a multi-factorial result particularly of the surgery technique, the prosthesis, the mode of perforation, and the anesthesia. Prospective studies with defined and standardized measurement parameters can in future underline these results and contribute to a better basis for comparison. One can expect that a growing experience in surgery and a continuing development of materials will contribute to the continual improvement and optimisation of hearing results...|$|R
50|$|Stapedotomy, like <b>stapedectomy,</b> can be {{successful}} in the presence of sclerotic adhesions (tissue growths abnormally linking the bones to the tympanic cavity), provided the adhesions are removed during surgery. However, the adhesions may recur over time. The stapedotomy method is not applicable in those relatively rare cases that involve scleroris of the entire ossicular chain.|$|E
50|$|Because it is {{a simpler}} and safer procedure, stapedotomy is {{normally}} preferred to <b>stapedectomy</b> {{in the absence}} of predictable complications. However, the success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. Furthermore, a major success factor in both surgeries is correctly determining the length of the prosthesis.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Glasscock et al. {{published}} a 25-year single-centre review of over 900 patients who underwent <b>stapedectomy</b> and stapedotomy and found complications rates as follows: reparative granuloma 1.3%, tympanic membrane perforation 1.0%, total {{sensorineural hearing loss}} 0.6%, partial sensorineural hearing loss 0.3%, and vertigo 0.3%. In this series, there was no incidence of facial nerve paralysis or tinnitus.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} methods to treat otosclerosis. However {{the method of}} choice is a {{procedure}} known as Stapedectomy.Early attempts at hearing restoration via the simple freeing the stapes from its sclerotic attachments to the oval window were met with temporary improvement in hearing, but the conductive hearing loss would almost always recur. A <b>stapedectomy</b> consists of removing {{a portion of the}} sclerotic stapes footplate and replacing it with an implant that is secured to the incus. This procedure restores continuity of ossicular movement and allows transmission of sound waves from the eardrum to the inner ear.A modern variant of this surgery called a stapedotomy, is performed by drilling a small hole in the stapes footplate with a micro-drill or a laser, and the insertion of a piston-like prothesis. The success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. However, comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield results at least as good as <b>stapedectomy,</b> with fewer complications, and thus stapedotomy is preferred under normal circumstances.|$|E
50|$|PLF is a {{cause of}} dizziness, imbalance, and hearing loss—any {{or all of these}} {{symptoms}} can exist. Vertigo (an illusion of motion) is not common in this disorder. The most common cause of this fistula is head or ear trauma. Rapid increases of intracranial pressure can also result in a PLF. Rarely, these fistulas can be congenital, leading to progressive hearing loss and vertigo in childhood. It has also been a complication of a <b>stapedectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jacob Sadé {{worked for}} 40 years in ENT {{departments}} of various university hospitals, in Israel {{and in the}} US, and established two ENT departments which he headed for 30 years, and where many physicians and students studied otolaryngology. His clinical, surgical and scientific main interest centered on hearing, inflammatory ear diseases, cholesteatoma, the facial nerve, equilibrium, and microsurgery of the middle ear. He {{was the first in}} Israel to introduce a novel type of ear surgery (<b>stapedectomy)</b> and contributed substantially to the discipline of ear microsurgery.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>stapedectomy</b> {{is done in}} {{a middle}} ear with a congenitally fixed footplate, the results may be {{excellent}} but the risk of hearing damage is greater than when the stapes bone is removed and replaced (for otosclerosis). This is primarily due {{to the risk of}} additional anomalies being present in the congenitally abnormal ear. If high pressure within the fluid compartment that lies just below the stapes footplate exists, then a perilymphatic gusher may occur when the stapes is removed. Even without immediate complications during surgery, there is always concern of a perilymph fistula forming postoperatively.|$|E
50|$|Gradually the {{operating}} microscope {{began to be}} used for ear operations. In the 1950s many otologists began to use it in the fenestration operation, usually to perfect the opening of the fenestra in the lateral semicircular canal. The revival of the stapes mobilization operation by Rosen, in 1953, made the use of the microscope mandatory, although it was not used by the originators of the technique, Kessel (1878), Boucheron (1888) and Miot (1890). Mastoidectomies began to be performed with the surgical microscope and so were the tympanoplasty techniques that became known in the early 1950s. The stapes mobilization operation had varying results and was soon replaced by <b>stapedectomy,</b> first described by John Shea, Jr.; this was an operation that was always performed with the microscope.|$|E

He {{performed the}} first successful reconstructive <b>stapedectomy</b> in May, 1956. The patient was a 54-year-old housewife with conductive hearing loss so severe that {{she could no longer}} hear at all, even with a hearing aid. Dr. Shea removed the stapes, covered the oval window opening with a vein graft removed {{from the back of the}} patient's hand, and inserted a prosthesis to replace the diseased stapes bone. The patient’s hearing was restored and she heard well for the rest of her life. He has pioneered numerous techniques in the treatment of hearing loss and dizziness, developed many instruments and prostheses to restore hearing, and worked to advance the knowledge and understanding of the treatment of ear disease.|$|E
5000|$|Otosclerosis is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are <b>stapedectomy,</b> the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E
50|$|In both {{of these}} situations, it is {{possible}} to improve hearing by removing the stapes bone and replacing it with a micro prosthesis - a <b>stapedectomy,</b> or creating a small hole in the fixed stapes footplace and inserting a tiny, piston-like prosthesis - a stapedotomy. The results of this surgery are generally most reliable in patients whose stapes has lost mobility because of otosclerosis. Nine out of ten patients who undergo the procedure will come out with significantly improved hearing while less than 1% will experience worsened hearing acuity or deafness. Successful surgery usually provides an increase in hearing acuity of about 20 dB. That is as much difference as having your hands over both ears, or not. However, most of the published results of success fall within the speech frequency of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz; poorer results are typically obtained in the high frequencies, but these are normally less hampered by otosclerosis in the first place.|$|E
5000|$|Neurotologists are {{physicians}} who have specialized in otolaryngology and then further specialized in neurological {{conditions of the}} ear and related structures. Many general otolaryngologists are trained in otology or middle ear surgery, performing surgery such as a tympanoplasty, or a reconstruction of the ear drum, when a hole remains from a prior ear tube or prior infection. Otologic surgery also includes treatment of conductive hearing loss by reconstructing the hearing bones, or ossicles, {{as a result of}} infection, or by replacing the stapes bone with a <b>stapedectomy</b> for otosclerosis. Neurotology encompasses more complex surgery of the inner ear not typically performed by general otolaryngologists, such as removal of complex cholesteatoma, labyrinthectomy, surgery of the endolymphatic sac for meniere's disease and cochlear implant surgery, because of the additional risk of hearing loss, vertigo, and facial nerve paralysis. It is more and more common in the United States as well as around the world for otolaryngologists to obtain additional advanced training in neurotology, which requires an additional one or two years of fellowship training after five years of residency.|$|E
50|$|Otology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which studies normal and pathological anatomy and physiology of the ear (hearing and vestibular sensory systems and related structures and functions) {{as well as their}} diseases, diagnosis and treatment. Otologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the middle ear and mastoid related to chronic otitis media, such as tympanoplasty, or ear drum surgery, ossiculoplasty, or surgery of the hearing bones, and mastoidectomy. Otology also includes surgical treatment of conductive hearing loss, such as <b>stapedectomy</b> surgery for otosclerosis. Neurotology, a related field of medicine and subspecialty of Otolaryngology, is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanlicular acoustic neuromas. Neurotology is expanded to include surgery of the lateral skull base to treat intracranial tumors related to the ear and surrounding nerve and vascular structures, such as large cerebellar pontine angle acoustic neuromas, glomus jugulare tumors and facial nerve tumors.|$|E
