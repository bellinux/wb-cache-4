5|$|In April, Pietraru {{met with}} the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an {{agreement}} was reached regarding the maximum total of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody. The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> as working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment {{to take place in}} Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should be taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Younger's cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan, not {{far from}} T'ho. On 6 January 1542, he founded the second {{permanent}} town council, calling the new colonial town Mérida. On 23 January, Tutul Xiu, the lord of Mani, approached the Spanish encampment at Mérida in peace, bearing <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> food supplies. He expressed interest in the Spanish religion and witnessed a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit. Tutul Xiu was greatly impressed and converted to the new religion; he was baptised as Melchor and stayed with the Spanish at Mérida for two months, receiving instruction in the Catholic faith. Tutul Xiu was the ruler {{of the most powerful}} province of northern Yucatán and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula, and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule. The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures.|$|E
25|$|Bringing <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> reinforcements, Türr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made {{immediately}} upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and got three battalions of German troops {{under his command}} {{in addition to the}} Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming Prussian attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing the officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands.|$|E

25|$|The {{neutralization}} of Rabaul {{was ultimately}} {{a disaster for}} the Japanese. Most of their experienced carrier pilots were lost over Rabaul, large numbers of their <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> aviation maintenance personnel were either lost during their attempted evacuation or trapped there, and the Japanese no longer had a base from which they could threaten the Allied presence in the Solomons. By isolating Rabaul the Allies effectively made its large garrison (which outnumbered the defenders on Okinawa) prisoners of war without having to fight them. The last Allied airstrike on Rabaul took place on 8 August 1945, only weeks before the Japanese surrender.|$|E
25|$|The Tonquin left New York City for the Columbia River in late 1810. From {{there the}} vessel sailed across the Atlantic Ocean until {{reaching}} the Falkland Islands in December. Captain Jonathan Thorn marooned eight PFC employees there, {{though they were}} secured the same day after other men threatened to kill Thorn. After passing Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean, the Tonquin visited the Kingdom of Hawaii in February 1811. <b>Sorely</b> <b>needed</b> fresh produce and animal products were purchased and 24 Native Hawaiian Kanakas hired after holding negotiations with Kamehameha I and Kalanimoku. The Tonquin finally reached the Columbia River on 22 March 1811. In the subsequent days, attempts to find a safe route over the Columbia Bar killed eight men.|$|E
25|$|The Knoxville Campaign ended {{following}} {{the battle of}} Bean's Station, and both sides went into winter quarters. The only real effect of the minor campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> in Chattanooga. Longstreet's foray as an independent commander was a failure, and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted {{to the failure of}} the campaign by blaming others, as he had done at the Battle of Seven Pines in the Peninsula Campaign the previous year. He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court martial of Brig. Gens. Jerome B. Robertson and Evander M. Law. He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied. His corps suffered through a severe winter in East Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions, unable to return to Virginia until the spring.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} bombing proponents {{within the}} USAAF, called the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had {{established in the}} early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers understood {{that they would not}} be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel George William Goddard's observation that the US <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a change order specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was drop tank-capable off the assembly line.|$|E

500|$|The Brazilians modernized Minas Geraes, São Paulo, {{and the two}} cruisers {{acquired}} {{under the}} 1904 plan, [...] and , between 1918 and 1926. This was <b>sorely</b> <b>needed,</b> as all four ships were not ready to fight a modern war. Although the Brazilian government intended to send São Paulo overseas for service in the Grand Fleet, both it and Minas Geraes had not been modernized since entering service, meaning they were without essential equipment like modern fire control. Maintenance on the two ships had also been neglected, which was most clearly illustrated when São Paulo was sent to New York for modernization: fourteen of its eighteen boilers broke down, and the ship required {{the assistance of the}} American battleship [...] and cruiser [...] to continue the voyage. The two cruisers were in [...] "deplorable" [...] condition, as they were able to steam at a top speed of only [...] thanks to a desperate need for new condensers and boiler tubes. With repairs, though, both participated in the war as part of Brazil's main naval contribution to the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Longstreet {{was criticized}} for {{the slow pace of}} his advance toward Knoxville in November and some of his troops began using the {{nickname}} [...] "Peter the Slow" [...] to describe him. At the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, the Federals evaded Longstreet's troops. This was due both to the poor performance of Brigadier General Evander M. Law, who exposed his brigade to the enemy and thus ruined {{what was supposed to be}} a surprise attack, and Burnside's skillful retreat. The Confederates also dealt with muddy roads and a shortage of good supplies. Burnside settled into entrenchments around the city, which Longstreet besieged unsuccessfully. The Battle of Fort Sanders failed to bring a Confederate breakthrough. When Bragg was defeated by Grant at Chattanooga on November 25, Longstreet was ordered to join forces with the Army of Tennessee in northern Georgia. He demurred and began to move back to Virginia, soon pursued by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in early December. The armies went into winter quarters and the First Corps rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia in the spring. The only real effect of the minor campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> in Chattanooga. Longstreet's second independent command (after Suffolk) was a failure and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others, as he had done at Seven Pines. He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court martial of Brig. Gens. Jerome B. Robertson and Law. He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied.|$|E

What is <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> is an independent body to coordinate the health care, research, rehabilitation of gas victims, and care for potential effects in their offspring. Instead of the non-directive symptomatic medical treatment that currently exists, clear guidelines and criteria need to be formulated for specific medical conditions such as damage to bronchial tubes, sleep apnea, neuron destruction, etc. Such an effort could be implemented through India's existing health care pyramid.

[...] Perhaps too late, the Rhodesians decided to take the war to the enemy, and cross-border operations, which had started in 1976 with a raid on a major base in Mozambique in which the Rhodesians had killed over 1,200 guerrillas and captured huge amounts of weapons, were stepped up.

2500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of the Douro wine company was {{to respond to the}} [...] "scandal" [...] and wine frauds that contributed to the overall {{depression}} in sales and pricing of Port wine. Uninhibited and reckless blending of inferior wine and foreign ingredients contributed to many substandard examples of Port flooding the London market. To reestablish the reputation of Port, the Douro Wine Company first delineated the exact boundaries of Douro and dictating what areas could and could not produce Port. Under the guidance of Pombal, they specified the areas the contained predominately schistous soil along the Douro river and its tributaries. This distinguished the areas from the outcrops of granite that flanked the region and produced Port wine grapes of lesser quality. Pombal also specified this delineation to ensure that grapes were not planted where corn itself needed to be produced, which was a <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> food crop. This delineation essentially made the Douro the world's first regional appellation.|$|E

He noted that Muhammad was fond of celebrations, {{as in the case of}} the birth of a child, or a traveller arriving after a long journey. Thus, Yusuf concluded that healthy entertainment was acceptable within limitations, and that he now felt that it was no sin to perform with the guitar. [...] Music, he now felt, is uplifting to the soul; something <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> in troubled times. At that point, he was joined by several young male singers who sang backing vocals and played a drum, with Yusuf as lead singer and guitarist. They performed two songs, both half in Arabic, and half in English; [...] "Tala'a Al-Badru Alayna", an old song in Arabic which Islam recorded with a folk sound to it, and another song, [...] "The Wind East and West", which was newly written by Yusuf and featured a distinct R sound.|$|E
2500|$|A {{nationwide}} economic depression, {{combined with}} impending war, forced Queen's College {{to close down}} a second time, in 1812. In 1825, Queen's College was reopened, and its name was changed to [...] "Rutgers College" [...] in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Colonel Henry Rutgers (17451830). According to the Board of Trustees, Colonel Rutgers was honored because he epitomized Christian values, although {{it should be noted}} the Colonel was a wealthy bachelor known for his philanthropy. A year after the school renamed itself, it received 2 donations from its namesake. Rutgers, a descendant of an old Dutch family that had settled in New Amsterdam (now New York City), gave the fledgling college a $200 bell that hangs from the cupola of the Old Queen's building; then later in 1826 he donated the interest on a $5,000 bond. This second donation finally gave the college the sound financial footing it had <b>sorely</b> <b>needed.</b> [...] The college's early troubles inspired numerous student songs, including an adaptation of the drinking song Down Among the Dead Men, with the lyrics [...] "Here's a toast to old Rutgers, loyal men/May she ne'er go down but to rise again." ...|$|E

The Harvard Crimson, in reporting the suspension of the Monthly, opined that the journal, [...] "... has filled to a certain extent the important post of Devil's Advocate amid the blatant orthodoxy of undergraduate life... Harvard <b>sorely</b> <b>needed</b> the Monthly. In the world outside it was looked on as one of the proofs of Harvard's difference from other colleges. The existence of such a magazine indicated... a desire to think things through, to reject ready-made opinions for the mere reason that they were ready-made, to hold a little aloof from current lanes of thought. Such a spirit, only too rare in our land of gigantic uniformities, and almost non-existent in our colleges, gave one hope that here at least a leaven was working which would ultimately transform American thought from the flabby courageless thing it is into something new and liberating."
