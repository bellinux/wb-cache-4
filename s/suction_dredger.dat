2500|$|The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has {{invested}} nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal, {{with the aim}} of increasing capacity by 20%. The ACP cites a number of major improvements, including the widening and straightening of the Gaillard Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels, the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply, and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal. This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and <b>suction</b> <b>dredger,</b> and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20%. In addition, improvements have been made to the canal's operating machinery, including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than [...] of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls. Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal.|$|E

5000|$|According to Mort J. Richardson in The Dynamics of Dredging Ackermans & van Haaren held {{a leading}} {{position}} in technological innovation, {{from the very}} beginning. In 1895 Ackermans & van Haaren was at the cradle of hydraulic dredging techniques and successfully designed a <b>suction</b> <b>dredger,</b> capable of unloading by its own. In the same year, a first vessel of that type was built and christended as Schelde II. Société Générale de Dragage/Algemene Baggermaatschappij (SGD) realized the very first application of a submersible pump in dredging, when such a device was developed and fixed on the drag head of TSHD Maas. At {{the time of her}} commissioning in September 1994 DEME's 17,000 m3 flagship Pearl River became, according to Richardson (p. 11), [...] "the very first suction hopper dredge of a completely new generation - featuring twice as much capacity as its biggest successor." [...] In 2005 DEME's French subsidiary Société de Dragage International (SDI) launched the world's largest heavy-duty and ocean-going cutter <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> d'Artagnan (28,200 kW installed power).|$|E

[...] She was completed in March, 1914, and towed to Hudson's Bay, arriving in September 1914, where she promptly ran aground.

50|$|Meanwhile, the two {{sand and}} gravel firms {{continued}} to use the sea lock and the pound to carry on their business. However, the end came {{on the night of}} 5 December 1951, when a steam <b>suction</b> <b>dredger,</b> called Catherine Ethel and weighing 154 tons, crashed into the inner lock gates. The gates collapsed, and all of the water in the mile-long section (1.6 km) emptied into the estuary. The gates were never repaired and the difficult job of closing the canal was solved overnight for the Cardiff Corporation.|$|E
50|$|A cutter-suction dredger's (CSD) {{suction tube}} has a cutting {{mechanism}} at the suction inlet. The cutting mechanism loosens the bed material and transports {{it to the}} suction mouth. The dredged material is usually sucked up by a wear-resistant centrifugal pump and discharged either through a pipe line or to a barge. Cutter-suction dredgers are most often used in geological areas consisting of hard surface materials (for example gravel deposits or surface bedrock) where a standard <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> would be ineffective. In recent years, dredgers with more powerful cutters have been built in order to excavate harder rock {{without the need for}} blasting.|$|E

Following the war, the vessel was transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and renamed Herchmer. In 1946, Herchmer was sold for mercantile conversion and reappeared as Gulf Mariner. The ship was abandoned in 1964 on the Fraser River shore after plans for conversion to a <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> failed. The abandoned hulk was broken up.|$|E

50|$|This process {{functions}} like a cutter <b>suction</b> <b>dredger,</b> but {{the cutting tool}} is a rotating Archimedean screw set {{at right angles to}} the suction pipe. The first widely used auger dredges were designed in the 1980s by Mud Cat Dredges, which was run by National Car Rental, but is now a Division of Ellicott Dredges. In 1996, IMS Dredges introduced a self-propelled version of the auger dredge that allows the system to propel itself without the use of anchors or cables. During the 1980s and 1990s auger dredges were primarily used for sludge removal applications from waste water treatment plants. Today, auger dredges are used for a wider variety of applications including river maintenance and sand mining.|$|E
5000|$|Preceding {{the current}} programme, ten major {{dredgers}} {{were added to}} the DEME fleet under the investment programme 2002-2007. This included the world's largest heavy-duty seagoing cutter <b>suction</b> <b>dredger,</b> the 28,000 kW d'Artagnan. With the construction of the Pearl River in 1994, DEME became a trendsetter for what is now [...] "considered as the first 'jumbo' trailer suction dredger"On August 1, 2002, the enlargement of Pearl River was started in Singapore. In the process the hopper capacity of Pearl River was increased from 17,000 m3 to 24,146 m3. Moreover, a large deep dredging installation for the Pearl River was built in, which allows this jumbo trailer to dredge to depths of 120 m.|$|E
50|$|DEME invests some €200 {{million per}} year in {{construction}} of new vessels. Under the current investment programme 2008-2012, some fifteen major vessels will be launched for an estimated value of €1.26 billion.

The latter include the 11,650 m3 {{trailing suction hopper dredger}} Breughel and the 28,000 kW cutter <b>suction</b> <b>dredger</b> Ambiorix, a sister ship of d'Artagnan. Other ships to be commissioned before 2012 are the 5,000 m3 gravel dredger Victor Horta; the 19,000 tons fallpipe vessel Flintstone; the self-propelled seagoing dredgers Al Jarraf and Amazone, each with a total installed power of 12,860 kW; the mega-trailer Congo River which has a hopper capacity of 30,000 tonnes; and the jack-up Neptune.|$|E
