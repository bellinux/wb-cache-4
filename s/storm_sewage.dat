5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a <b>storm</b> <b>sewage</b> separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary <b>storm</b> <b>sewage</b> tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake {{did not have to be}} taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E

These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced.

5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 <b>storm</b> <b>sewage</b> overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E

It should be also noted that lakes within forested land are also under surface runoff influences. Runoff can wash out the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow, natural eutrophication.|$|R

Devices and test methods for measuring settling velocities of solids in <b>storm</b> <b>sewage</b> have been developed by researchers. A literature review has revealed that the settling velocity profiles obtained with some methods are very different. In order to explain why the results are different and to quantify the influence of the experimental procedure on the settling velocity grading curves, we have compared the selected methods when tested with the same sample and we have studied the effects of the conservation of the sample before the test, of the concentration of solids in the device and of the nature of the water on the settling velocity profiles. The results of the comparative tests indicate that the settling velocities are significantly lower with both the Cergrene and Aston methods than with the UFT test procedure. Moreover, the study has shown that the settling characteristics of solids change with time, that the use of sewage liquor rather than demineralised water or drinking water can change the results of the measurement and that the higher the concentration of solids, the greater the velocity of settled particles...|$|E
