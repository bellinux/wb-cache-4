40|$|AbstractThe Wulungu Depression is {{the northernmost}} first-order tectonic {{unit in the}} Junggar Basin. It {{can be divided into}} three sub-units: the Hongyan step-fault zone, the Suosuoquan sag and the Wulungu south slope. The Cenozoic strata in the basin are intact and Mesozoic–Cenozoic {{deformation}} can be observed in the Wulungu step-fault zone, so this is an ideal place to study the Mesozoic–Cenozoic deformation. By integration of fault-related folding theories, regional geology and drilling data, the strata of the Cretaceous–Paleogene systems are divided into small layers which are selected as the subjects of this research. The combination of the developing unconformity with existing growth strata makes it conceivable that faults on the step-fault zone have experienced different degrees of reactivation of movement since the Cretaceous. Evolutionary analyses of the small layers using 2 D-Move software showed certain differences in the reactivation of different segments of the Wulungu Depression such as the timing of reactivation of thrusting, for which the reactivity time of the eastern segment was late compared with those of the western and middle segments. In addition the resurrection strength was similarly slightly different, with the shortening rate being higher in the western segment than in the other segments. Moreover, the thrust fault mechanism is basement-involved combined with triangle <b>shear</b> <b>fold,</b> for which a forward evolution model was proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the crustal {{structure}} of the South Fossa Magna region, where a Tertiary geosyncline is developed, is inferred geologically under some assumptions. The method here adopted consists of two steps; 1) preparation of the stratigraphic profiles in every stage of geological devolopment of the region, and 2) modification of the stratigraphic profiles by the subsequent deformation of the crust. 1) Preparation of the stratigraphic profiles. The early Miocene Misaka and the middle to late Miocene Fujikawa series are the main conponents of the nearsurface crust of the region. They vary in thickness in different geological provinces in the region. Their geologic and tectonic maps are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The pre-Misaka sediments are supposed geologically to have been deposited on the oceanic crust of transitional crust between the main Japanese Islands and the Pacific. These data and assumptions {{as well as those}} listed in A) of Table 2 are used for the stratigraphic profiles of the region (Fig. 3). 2) Modification of the stratigraphic profiles. After the deposition of the Misaka series, the following events took place: i) crustal warping with deposition of the Fujikawa series in the downwarping parts and with erosion of the Misaka series in the upwarping parts, ii) intrusions of quartz diorite stocks of the uplifted parts, and iii) formation of the crystalline schist along the southern limb of the Tanzawa upwarping part. (Boulders of the quartz diorite and of the crystalline schists appear in {{the upper part of the}} Fujikawa series of the subsiding belts). Until the end of the deposition of the Fujikawa series, the crustal surface was de- formed in a wavy contour as shown in curve s-s of Fig. 4. From the observations of the Tanzawa schist belt, we can assume that the wavy deformation of the crust mentioned above is due to <b>shear</b> <b>fold</b> with the shear plane inclined northward with angle about 70 °. Then we get curve b-b in Fig. 4 as the bottom of the crust. Besides, it is assumed that the quartz diorite magma originated due to melting of the crust and the Mohodiscontinuity represents a boundary between two different materials (the basaltic and ultramafic), and that the volume change of the crust through the magmatic process which brought the quartz diorite stocks and through other tectonic process is negligible. Thus, we get Fig. 5 (b) as the crustal {{structure of the}} South Fossa Magna at the end of the Fujikawa time. Fig. 5 (b) is here proposed as the present status of the region. If the method and data used in this paper are adequate, it is suggested that present Moho-discontinuity lies between the - 15 to - 20 km level with increasing depth northward. The Moho-discontinuity shows a fairly strong relief (10 km or more), whose troughs and swells correspond to the subsided belts and uplifted belts originated in Miocene. It is also suggested from Figs. 3 and 5 that the quartz diorite magma was generated from the lower crust in 15 to 20 km depth in the orogenetic epoch. The heat sufficient to melt the crust at such a shallow level might have been supplied from the mantle below...|$|E

40|$|The pre-Cambrian {{rocks of}} the {{northern}} Black Hills {{in the vicinity of}} the Homestake Mine show the effects of extreme isoclinal folding on which has been superimposed <b>shear</b> <b>folding</b> crossing the isoclinal axial planes at small angles. An attempt has been made to distinguish the two types of folding in all scales of folds from those of microscopic size to those large enough to appear on the regional map. Enough Cambrian cover remains in this area to permit contouring the top of the pre-Cambrian rocks. These contours, which essentially measure post-Cretaceous deformation, show a close correlation between doming of the district and the intrusion of a stock of Eocene age. Several other domes in the northern Black Hills, previously called laccoliths, are believed to be due to stock intrusion. The deformation of pre-Cambrian rocks by the Tertiary intrusive bodies is more difficult to interpret. There are, however, many small-scale deformations attributable to igneous intrusion, and probably there are large ones as well. Whether the <b>shear</b> <b>folds</b> crossing the isoclinal axial planes are due to Tertiary igneous intrusion or, like the isoclinal folds, are of pre-Cambrian age cannot be answered at this time...|$|R
40|$|Fold {{mechanisms}} {{operating in}} the Canton Schist have been resolved using the geometric relationship between folds and spiral inclusion trail geometries. Of the four end-member fold mechanisms, tangential–longitudinal strain folding and slip folding are unable to produce the observed inclusion trail and fold geometries, but a combination of flexural flow and pure <b>shear</b> <b>folding</b> {{is consistent with the}} geometric constraints. The maximum flexural flow component during each fold event was determined from the geometric data. During F 3 and F 4, flexural flow produced ≤ 27 % and ≤ 37 % of measured limb rotation, respectively, which corresponds to a maximum of 24 ° limb rotation by flexural flow in each fold event. To satisfy the geometric constraints, the remainder of limb rotation must be a product of pure <b>shear</b> <b>folding.</b> The maximum possible component of flexural flow folding during F 3 and F 4 increases with increased variation in vorticity between layers in the rock mass. In the flexural flow–pure shear model, a maximum of 28 % of inclusion trail curvature is produced by rotation of porphyroblasts relative to (irrotational) fold limbs, with a minimum 72 % curvature due to rotation of fold limbs relative to (irrotational) porphyroblasts. All model solutions produce less than ≈ 8 ° syn-folding porphyroblast rotation relative to geographic coordinates...|$|R

50|$|Lateral {{shearing}} interferometry is a self-referencing {{method of}} wavefront sensing. Instead of comparing a wavefront {{with a separate}} path reference wavefront, lateral shearing interferometry interferes a wavefront with a shifted version of itself. As a result, it is sensitive to the slope of a wavefront, not the wavefront shape per se. The illustrated plane parallel plate interferometer has unequal path lengths for the test and reference beams; because of this, it must be used with highly monochromatic (laser) light. It is normally used without any coating on either surface, so as to minimize ghost reflections. An aberrated wavefront from a lens under test is reflected from {{the front and back}} of the plate to form the interference pattern. Variations on this basic design allow testing of mirrors. Other forms of lateral shearing interferometer, based on the Jamin, Michelson, Mach-Zehnder, and other interferometer designs, have compensated paths and may be used with white light. Besides optical testing, applications of lateral shearing interferometry have included thin film analysis, mass and thermal diffusion in transparent materials, refractive index and gradient of refractive index measurement, collimation testing, and adaptive optics. Shearing interferometers, a general framework which includes the lateral shearing, Hartmann, Shack-Hartmann, rotational <b>shearing,</b> <b>folding</b> <b>shearing,</b> and aperture masking interferometers, are used in most of the wavefront sensors industrially developed.|$|R

40|$|The E-W running Salem-Attur {{shear zone}} {{demarcates}} the tectonic boundary between Archaean Dharwar Craton {{in the north}} and Proterozoic Southern granulite terrane in the south. This study reveals that the shear zone is a low angle thrust. The thrust zone is around 10 m thick and it merges with the main shear zone along the strike. The thrust is developed on charnockite near Odyarpatti, which is retrograded into schists. Further, it is marked by gently dipping mylonitic foliation and subhorizontal lineation. The S-C fabric, mantled porphyroclasts and intragranular faults indicate northeasterly slip along the thrust. Recumbent <b>shear</b> <b>folds</b> SF 1 are developed within the thrust zone. The thrust has been folded by late stage F 2 fold which has brought variation in the orientation of the mylonitic foliation from subhorizontal to vertical attitude; the mylonitic lineations have been rotated to subvertical orientation also. Additionally, the F 2 crenulations and shear cleavages and intersection lineations are superimposed on the mylonitic fabric. Thrusting along the Salem-Attur shear zone is probably the cause for upliftment of the charnockites to the upper crust. Post-upliftment stage has witnessed brittle deformation in the form of development of shear fractures in NNE-SSW and E-W directions. Pseudotachylites are emplaced along these fractures...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{investigations}} in post-obductional Paleocene to Eocene limestones of the Tertiary Ridge reveal a ~ 1 km long WNW-ESE striking strike-slip fault system within the ridge, {{consisting of two}} main sub-parallel, strike-slip faults. Considering the geometry of the Harding Strain Ellipse, the orientation of structures between the two strike-slip faults (e. g., Riedel <b>shears,</b> <b>folds,</b> reverse faults) point to left-lateral motion. The abundance of large-scale folds (up to 100 m in wave length and amplitude) between the two strike-slip faults led us to the interpretation of transpressive conditions in a first approximation. Moreover, the Tertiary Ridge {{of the study area}} consists of three distinct structural domains. The faults of Domain A and C are oriented WNW-ESE, but the trend of the faults in the central Domain B differs by ~ 10 °. The left-lateral strike-slip fault system exists only in Domain B. We propose that the direction of greatest stress during Miocene plate convergence (sigma 1) was oriented 032 °/ 212 °. Considering the trend of the strike-slip zone and the orientation of sigma 1, the left-lateral motion must have been transpressive. Sigma 1 is perpendicularly oriented to the domains A and C.

40|$|Although {{integrated}} clast macro and microfabric {{studies have}} been used to provide evidence of palaeo-ice flow directions, to discriminate between diamictons deposited in differing sedimentary environments, and to model the response of tills to subglacial deformation, such studies have typically only examined the ‘bulk’ fabric developed within the diamicton, largely ignoring the potential for several phases of fabric development within these typically polydeformed deposits. We present a new graphical method for the identification, description and analysis of clast microfabrics in polydeformed tills. This method utilises high resolution digital scans of orientated thin sections imported into a standard computer graphics package to measure the orientation of long axes of detrital (skeleton) grains included within the till. These data are then used to identify the main clast microfabrics present within the till, allowing the delineation of clast microfabric domains in which elongate grains share a similar preferred orientation. This process leads to the identification, characterisation and, most importantly, the interrelationships between the various generations of microfabrics. The relationships between these clast microfabrics and other microstructures (e. g. plasmic fabrics, turbate structures, <b>shears,</b> <b>folds,</b> faults…etc) can also be examined, providing a detailed microfabric-microstructural map of the thin section. Clast long axis orientation data collected for different parts of a thin section are plotted on a series of rose diagrams allowing the variation in clast microfabric orientation to be displayed graphically. A new set of terminology for the description of clast microfabrics in tills, which is based upon the system used by metamorphic petrologists, is also presented. Three case studies of the fabrics present within subglacial sediments of Pleistocene age as well as the present are used as examples of how to apply this methodology. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere {{was much}} debate {{recently}} on {{the mechanisms of}} continental convergence and related pressure­temperature (P­T) conditions, both in modeling and petrologic community. Depending on the mechanisms of convergence (subduction, collision, folding or RT instability) one can argue {{about the possibility of}} large-scale deviations of pressure and temperature in the accretion prism and below it, from "reference" (i. e. lithostatic) conditions commonly used for petrologic reconstructions of evolution of exhumed metamorphic rocks. These deviations can be caused, for example, by tectonic overpressure that, as suggested in some studies, may be responsible for formation of UHP (Ultra High Pressure) rocks. However, overpressure in exhumation zones can be built only in specific collision scenarios associated with plate coupling (pure <b>shear,</b> <b>folding).</b> In this study, we analyze conditions that define various mechanisms of convergence, and consequently, of exhumation. These mechanisms can be represented as a superposition of (1) simple shear (subduction), (2) pure <b>shear</b> (collision), (3) <b>folding</b> and (4) Rayleigh­Taylor instability. We study these scenarios using a thermo-mechanical model that accounts for brittle­elastic­ductile rheology, surface processes, and metamorphic changes. It appears that stable, "oceanic-type" subduction may occur in the case of cold lithospheres (TMohob 550 °C) and relatively high convergence rates (N 3 ­ 5 cm/yr). Depending on the lower-crustal rheology (strong or weak), either the whole (upper and lower) crust or only the lower crust can be involved in subduction. In case of weak metamorphic rheologies, phase changes improve chances for stable subduction. Pure shear becomes a dominant mechanism when TMohoN 550 °C or convergence rates are lower than 3 cm/yr. Large-scale folding is favored in case of TMoho= 500 ­ 650 °C and is more effective in the case of mechanical coupling between crust and mantle (e. g., strong lower crust). Gravitational (Rayleigh­Taylor) instabilities overcome other mechanisms for very high values of TMoho (N 800 °C) and may lead to development of subvertical "cold spots. " However, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that in most cases continental collision is initiated at oceanic subduction rate, which is rarely slower than 5 cm/yr. This rate is sufficient to drive continental subduction during the first several Myr of collision. In this case, the subduction channel is characterized by nearly lithostatic pressure conditions. Large-scale zones of tectonic overpressure may be built outside the channel but do not affect the exhumed rocks. Overpressure may be built inside the channel in the short moment of its closure. We suggest that most continental orogenic belts could have started their formation from continental subduction. This evokes small tectonic overpressures and thus deep origin of the UHP rocks that may be brought to the surface via the suggested multi-level mechanism of exhumation...|$|R

Kinematic vorticity number {{is one of the}} parameters that govern tail geometry across clasts. For example, symmetric and nearly straight tails develop if the clast-matrix system underwent dominantly a pure shear/compression. Prolonged deformation and concomitant recrystallization can significantly change the degree of symmetry of clasts. Angular relation between two shear zones or between a shear zone and anisotropy determines fundamentally the degree of symmetry of lozenges. Symmetry of boudinaged clasts too depends on competency contrast between the matrix and clast in some cases, and on the degrees of slip of inter-boudin surfaces and pure <b>shear.</b> Parasitic <b>folds</b> and post-tectonic veins are usually symmetric...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} of deformation in geological {{materials is}} a widelystudied phenomenon at all scales, from {{the formation of}} deformation bandswithin single grains, up to crustal-scale shear zones (White et al., 1980;Poirier 1980; Hobbs et al., 1986). There is widespread evidence (in theform of faults, <b>shear</b> zones, <b>fold</b> hinges, etc.) that localization plays a ma-jor {{role in determining the}} mechanical response of rocks, and results intectonically and economically important structures. At each scale, andsometimes for each material, there is considerable speculation as to whichprocesses dominate the observed localization behaviour. In the mantle, lo-calization of deformation is necessarily much harder to document. It may,however, {{play a major role in}} controlling continental and mantle dynamicsand the observable seismic anisotropies (Ellis et al., 2001; McNamara etal., 2001). The purpose of this section is to demonstrate a simple simula-tion scheme capable of investigating spatial and temporal patterns of in-stantaneous and cumulative localization of deformation at the grain scale,using a two-dimensional numerical modelling scheme...|$|R
