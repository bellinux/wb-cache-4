The availability of organic carbon appeared to have the most pronounced effect on the bacterial community composition in deeper sediment layers. In general, the bacterial community was dominated by fermenters and syntrophic bacteria. The depth distribution of methanogenic archaea correlated with the sulfate profile and could be explained by electron donor competition with sulfate-reducing bacteria.

40|$|Póster presentado en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly, celebrada en Viena del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013. The main {{cap rock}} for CO 2 {{injection}} at the PDT Hontomin site (Spain) is a marly shale {{made up of}} calcite (56 %), quartz (21 %), illite (17 %) clinochlore (3 %) and others (albite, gypsum, anhydrite, pyrite) (3 %). Contact with CO 2 -rich acid brines may induce the dissolution of these minerals. Since the brine contains sulfate, gypsum (or anhydrite at depth) may precipitate, which may coat {{the surface of the}} dissolving calcite grains and cause their passivation. These mineral reactions will also induce changes in porosity and permeability. Percolation laboratory experiments with Hontomin shale rock cores under controlled pCO 2 (8 MPa) are being performed to quantify these processes. In mechanically fractured cores (7. 5 mm in diameter and 18 mm in length), two synthetic brines (a sulfatefree solution and a version of the Hontomin formation brine (sulfate solution)) were injected into the rock at constant flow rates (0. 2, 1 and 60 mL/h) under CO 2 supercritical conditions (pCO 2 = 8 MPa and T = 60 C). As the pH of the injecting brines in equilibrium with a pCO 2 of 8 MPa is acidic (3), it was observed {{that in the case of}} the <b>sulfate-free</b> brine experiments, the main processes that yield variation in the hydrodynamic behavior of the fractured rock was the dissolution of calcite, Si-bearing minerals, clinochlore and pyrite. In the sulfate-rich brine experiments, the dissolution of calcite and Si-bearing minerals also occurred, together with gypsum precipitation in the experiments run at low flow rates. As a result, initial fracture permeability tends (i) to stabilize or increase when the cap rock interacts with the <b>sulfate-free</b> brine and (ii) to decrease as the rock interacts with the sulfate-rich brine. The interpretation (reactive transport modeling) of the changes in mineralogy and solution composition, together with the analysis of the changes in physical properties (porosity and permeability), will provide valuable information (e. g., kinetic parameters such as mineral surface area) required in the performance assessment of a CO 2 sequestration plant.

The S and V loadings {{are similar to those of}} TiO 2 based commercial catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH 3 : NH 3 -SCR. Two original experimental procedures are used, namely, adsorption equilibrium infrared spectroscopy (AEIR) and temperature-programmed adsorption equilibrium (TPAE). They have been developed in previous works and adapted in Part 1 for the species formed by the adsorption of NH 3 on a sulfate free TiO 2 support (P 25 from Degussa). In agreement with the literature, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies show that the impregnation of the <b>sulfate-free</b> and sulfated TiO 2 supports by the vanadium precursor leads to well-dispersed VxOy species, which are involved in the adsorption of NH 3 in the temperature T-a range of 300 - 673 K and for adsorption P-a < 0. 5 IcPa. Sulfate and VxOy groups favor the amount of NH 4 + species without modifying their heats of adsorption as compared to the TiO 2, support: they are not detected for temperatures of interest for NH 3 -SCR reaction. In these experimental conditions and whatever the solids, two main adsorbed NH 3 species on Lewis sites (denoted NH 3 ads. L 1 and NH 3 ads. L 2) are present, characterized by two delta(s) IR bands below 1300 cm(- 1) and a common delta(as), IR band at approximate to 1600 cm(- 1). By comparison with TiO 2, P 25; it is shown that sulfate groups have strong impacts neither on the proportion, x(1) and x(2),, of the two adsorbed species nor on their heats of adsorption (E-L 1 (theta) and E-L 2 (theta) with theta the coverage of the NH 3 ads.

The deposition of V-containing species on the <b>sulfate-free</b> and sulfated TiO 2 surfaces leads to similar conclusions: in the experimental conditions (Ta and Pa) of the NH 3 -SCR, two adsorbed NH 3 species on Lewis sites are detected with comparable proportions and heats of adsorption to those observed on the TiO 2 supports...|$|E

When LDL preincubated with PG-M-CSF was fractionated by molecular size sieving chromatography, it was eluted earlier than untreated LDL. When LDL was preincubated with chondroitin <b>sulfate-free</b> 85 -kD M-CSF instead of PG-M-CSF, the elution profile of LDL remained unchanged, indicating specific interaction between PG-M-CSF and LDL. The level of PG-M-CSF binding in the wells of a plastic microtitration plate precoated with LDL was significant, this binding being completely abolished by pretreatment of PG-M-CSF with chondroitinase AC, which degrades chondroitin sulfate. The addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate or apolipoprotein B inhibited the binding of PG-M-CSF to LDL in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the interaction between PG-M-CSF and LDL was mediated by the binding of the chondroitin sulfate chain of PG-M-CSF to LDL apolipoprotein B.

The Cm-producing streptomycete modifies the primary (C- 3) hydroxyl of the antibiotic by a novel Cm-inactivating enzyme, chloramphenicol 3 -O-phosphotransferase (CPT). Here we describe the crystal structures of CPT in the absence and presence of bound substrates. The enzyme is dimeric in a <b>sulfate-free</b> solution and tetramerization is induced by ammonium sulfate, the crystallization precipitant. The tetrameric quaternary structure exhibits crystallographic 222 symmetry and has ATP binding pockets located at a crystallographic 2 -fold axis.

In addition to active site binding by Cm, an electron-dense feature resembling the enzyme’s product is found at the other subunit interface. The structures of CPT suggest that an aspartate acts as a general base to accept a proton from the 3 -hydroxyl of Cm, concurrent with nucleophilic attack of the resulting oxyanion on the γ-phosphate of ATP.

However, the production of CH 4 from CO 2 and H 2 provided in the headspace occurred with 0. 1 mM sulfate or sulfide.

It appears that the degradation of cellulose to CH 4 in a <b>sulfate-free</b> medium by inoculum maintained in a low-sulfur medium is inhibited because of the lack of availability of sulfur for growth of bacteria and synthesis of cell materials and sulfur-containing cofactors involved in cellulose degradation and methanogenesis.

We studied the mass transfer phenomena and microbial conversions in the surface layers using in situ microsensor measurements and on retrieved cores. The HMMV consists of three concentric habitats: a central area with gray mud, a surrounding area covered by white mats of big sulfide oxidizing filamentous bacteria (Beggiatoa), and a peripheral area colonized by symbiontic tube worms (Pogonophora). A fourth habitat comprised gray microbial mats near gas seeps. The differences between these four methane-fueled habitats are best explained by different transport rates of sulfate into the sediments and porewater upflow rates. The upflow velocities were estimated by two independent methods at 3 – 6 m yr 21 in the central area and 0. 3 – 1 m yr 21 in Beggiatoa mats. In the central area no sulfide was found, indicating that the rapidly rising <b>sulfate-free</b> fluids caused sulfate limitation that inhibited anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Under Beggiatoa mats a steep sulfide peak was found at 2 to 3 cm below the seafloor (bsf), most likely due to AOM.

These mutants were also deficient in growth with a variety of other organosulfur sources, including aromatic and aliphatic sulfate esters, methionine, and aliphatic sulfonates other than the natural sulfonates taurine and cysteate. This pleiotropic phenotype was complemented by the ssu operon, confirming its key role in organosulfur metabolism in this species. Further complementation analysis revealed that the ssuF gene product was required for growth with all of the tested substrates except methionine and that the oxygenase encoded by ssuD was required for growth with sulfonates or methionine. The flavin reductase SsuE was not required for growth with aliphatic sulfonates or methionine but was needed for growth with arylsulfonates, suggesting that an alternative isozyme exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter substrates.

It is shown that the nitrosyls formed on the <b>sulfate-free</b> catalyst with 5 wt% cobalt loading are unstable on prolonged contact with NO at room temperature due to the oxidation of adsorbed NO to NO 2 - (nitro) and NO 3 - species by cobalt(III) originating from the Co 3 O 4 phase.

In this study, the effect of fertilization regime on rhizosphere bacterial asfA distribution was examined at the Broadbalk long-term wheat experiment, Rothamsted, UK, which was established in 1843, and has included a sulfur-free treatment since 2001. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria from the wheat rhizospheres led to the identification of several Variovorax and Polaromonas strains, all of which contained the asfA gene. Rhizosphere DNA was isolated from wheat rhizospheres in plots fertilized with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfur, with farmyard manure or from unfertilized plots. Genetic profiling of 16 S rRNA gene fragments [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) ] from the wheat rhizospheres revealed that the level of inorganic sulfate in the inorganic fertilizer was correlated with changes in the general bacterial community structure and the betaproteobacterial community structure in particular. Community analysis at the functional gene level (asfA) showed that 40 % of clones in asfAB clone libraries were affiliated to the genus Variovorax.

40|$|Results of a {{continuous}} wastewater experiment conducted in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 37 °C showed that m- and o-cresols (225 mg. l- 1 each) could be partially degraded, and their presence did not adversely affect methanogenesis of benzoate (1000 mg. l- 1) and sulfidogenesis of sulfate (1800 - 5600 mg. l- 1. With 12 hours of hydraulic retention, the reactor on average {{was able to}} remove over 99. 5 % of benzoate, 11. 0 % of m-cresol, 8. 3 % of o-cresol and reduce up to 48 % of sulfate. Sulfate was reduced at a constant rate of 1630 mg. (l. d) - 1, independent of sulfate concentration. Results of batch tests showed that biogranules were able to remove 46. 2 % of m-cresol and 37. 4 % of o-cresol in 100 hours. Furthermore, biogranules treating solutions containing 1250 mg. l- 1 of sulfate degraded benzoate at an average rate 125 % faster than those treating <b>sulfate-free</b> solutions; 74. 4 % of the electron flow was used for methanogenesis and only 25. 6 % for sulfidogenesis. Results suggest that most sulfidogens in the biogranule were acetogenic, producing acetate, most of which was subsequently converted by methanogens into methane. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe 8 th IAWQ International Conference on Anaerobic Digestion, Sendai, Japan, 25 - 29 May 1997.

40|$|Pseudomonas putida S- 313 (= DSM 6884) grew in <b>sulfate-free</b> medium {{when the}} sole sulfur source {{supplied}} {{was one of}} several arylsulfonates involved in the synthesis, application, or biodegradation of linear alkyl-benzenesulfonate (LAS) surfactants. 2 -(4 -Sulfophenyl) butyric acid, 4 -n-butyl- 1 -methyl- 6 -sulfotetralin, and 4 -toluenesulfonic acid were each completely utilized during growth, as were the model LAS 1 -(4 -sulfophenyl) octane and the arylsulfonate dyestuff Orange II. The product in each case was the corresponding phenol, which was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance. Stoichiometric conversion of 4 -toluenesulfonic acid to 4 -cresol was observed. The molar growth yields observed were 2. 4 to 2. 8 kg of protein per mol of S, which were comparable to the yield for sulfate. Commercial LAS disappeared from growth medium inoculated with strain S- 313, but negligible growth occurred; digestion of cells in alkali led to recovery of the LAS mixture, which seemingly sorbed to the cells. However, mixed culture L 6 was readily obtained from batch enrichment cultures containing commercial LAS as a sole sulfur source and an inoculum from domestic sewage. Culture L 6 desulfonated components of the LAS surfactant to the corresponding phenols, which were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compounds with shorter alkyl chains were desulfonated preferentially, as were the centrally substituted isomers. In the presence of 200 μM sulfate, culture L 6 grew well and LAS disappeared, although this was due purely to sorption, as shown by digestion of the cells in alkali. Thus, under sulfate-limited conditions, LAS can be desulfonated directly...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Cobalt {{catalysts}} are prepared by impregnating zirconia and sulfated zirconia using an aqueous solution of cobalt(II) acetate. XRD {{results show that}} the catalysts with 5 wt% cobalt loading contain a small amount of Co 3 O 4. Analysis of the FT-IR results on the adsorption of NO at room temperature reveals the formation of cobalt(II) mono- and dinitrosyls. It is shown that the nitrosyls formed on the <b>sulfate-free</b> catalyst with 5 wt% cobalt loading are unstable on prolonged contact with NO at room temperature due to the oxidation of adsorbed NO to NO 2 - (nitro) and NO 3 species by cobalt(III) originating from the Co 3 O 4 phase. This process does not occur {{in the case of the}} sulfated catalyst containing the same amount of cobalt, for which the existence of a Co 3 O 4 phase is also detected. This experimental fact leads to the conclusion that the sulfate ions lower the reducibility of cobalt(III). Upon coadsorption of NO and O- 2 at room temperature on the samples studied, various kinds of surface nitrates are observed differing in the modes of their coordination. In the case of CoOx/SO 42 [...] ZrO 2 catalysts, part of the bidentate nitrates transform to NO 2 - (nitro) species after evacuation at 373 K. The nitro-nitrato species on the sulfated catalysts are characterized by a lower thermal stability than that of the nitrates on the CoOX/ZrO 2 samples. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Hole 823 A {{covers the}} upper 120 m (Subunits IA and IB) of Site 823 {{at the bottom}} of the Queensland Trough. This hole {{contains}} an abundance of gravity-flow deposits, but is thought to have a monotonic age sequence. Above 32 mbsf, a strong, stable (normal) magnetic remanence having a relatively small viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) is seen. Below 32 mbsf, the sediments are subject to widespread VRM, which appears to obliterate the primary magnetization and precludes identification of the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary. Progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization is limited to low fields (typically 10 cm thick) to thin (< 10 cm thick) turbidite deposition, and is also near the boundary separating the sulfate-reduction zone in the upper part of the sequence from the <b>sulfate-free</b> zone beneath. The abrupt nature of the magnetic boundary is evidence that nannofossil subzone CN 14 b is not condensed, but is missing in a hiatus at 32 mbsf. Nine peaks have been identified in the susceptibility (K) record that are superimposed on ôbackgroundö signals. ARM/K ratios are uniformly low for the background sediments below 32 mbsf, intermediate for strong susceptibility peaks, and high for background sediments above 32 mbsf and weak susceptibility peaks. Comparisons with results from Site 820 suggest that (1) the background sediments above 32 mbsf and the weak susceptibility peaks carry a stable single-domain magnetization, and (2) the high susceptibility peaks are caused by the addition of a superparamagnetic contribution. Expectations are that the distinctive features of the Hole 823 A magnetic record are linked to major environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|Five {{strains of}} sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} were {{isolated from the}} highest positive dilutions of a most probable number (MPN) series supplemented with lactate and inoculated with sediments from the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin. The isolates were endospore-forming and were motile by means of laterally inserted flagella. They stained Gram-negative and contained b-type cytochromes. CO difference spectra indicated the presence of P 582 as a sulfite reductase. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16 S rDNA sequences revealed that the isolates were very closely affiliated with the genus Sporomusa. However, sulfate and amorphous Fe(OH) (3), but not sulfite, elemental sulfur, MnO(2), or nitrate were used as terminal electron acceptors. Homoacetogenic growth was found with H(2) /CO(2) gas mixture, formate, methanol, ethanol, and methoxylated aromatic compounds. The strains grew autotrophically with H(2) plus CO(2) in {{the presence or absence}} of sulfate. Formate, butyrate, several alcohols, organic acids, carbohydrates, some amino acids, choline, and betaine were also utilized as substrates. The growth yield with lactate and sulfate as substrate was 7. 0 g dry mass/mol lactate and thus two times higher than in <b>sulfate-free</b> fermenting cultures. All isolates were able to grow in a temperature range of 4 - 37 degrees C. Physiologically and by the presence of a Gram-negative cell wall, the new isolates resemble known Desulfosporosinus species. However, phylogenetically they are affiliated with the Gram-negative genus Sporomusa belonging to the Selenomonas subgroup of the Firmicutes. Therefore, the new isolates reveal a new phylogenetic lineage of sulfate-reducing bacteria. A new genus and species, Desulfosporomusa polytropa gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of heparan <b>sulfate-free</b> chains {{by human}} keratinocytes is {{upregulated}} during terminal differentiation. The cellular location of this product {{class and the}} significance of the differentiation effect are unknown. Differential plasma membrane shearing with cationized colloidal silica was used to evaluate the compartmentalization of the heparan and chondroitin sulfate free chains and their respective proteoglycans in 3 T 3 fibroblasts and human keratinocytes. The method exploits the topologic segregation of plasma membranes of adherent cells into ventral, dorsal, and intracellular domains and the selective binding of the silica to the dorsal membranes, which by shearing can be separated from ventral membranes adherent to the substratum. Analysis of membrane preparations from sheared cells that had been prelabeled with [35 S]-sulfate revealed the proteoplycans to be predominantly ventral, at which location a matrix binding function could be accommodated. Proteoglycans were also recovered from dorsal and intravellular membranes, suggesting active trafficking between intra- and extra-cellular sites. In contrast, the major fraction of heparan and chondroitin sulfate free chains was either cytosolic or associated with intracellular membranes, with the remaining ∼ 20 % segregated to dorsal and ventral membranes. These results suggest deferent cellular functions for the proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan free chains. The partial localization of the free chains to peripheraI membranes is compatible with our prior hypothesis that they arise by processing of precursor proteoglycans on cell surfaces. following this origin, the free glycosaminoglycan polymers could be available to bind ligands such as cytokines prior to transport to intracellular sites of action...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Suboptimal bowel {{preparation}} {{can result}} in decreased neoplasia detection, shortened surveillance intervals, and increased costs. We assessed bowel preparation recommendations and the relationship to self-reported proportion of suboptimal bowel preparations in practice; and evaluated the impact of suboptimal bowel preparation on colonoscopy surveillance practices. A random sample of a national organization of gastroenterologists in the U. S. was surveyed. Methods: Demographic and practice characteristics, bowel preparation regimens, and proportion of suboptimal bowel preparations in practice were ascertained. Recommended follow-up colonoscopy intervals were evaluated for optimal and suboptimal bowel preparation and select clinical scenarios. Results: We identified 6, 777 physicians, of which 1, 354 were randomly selected; 999 were eligible, and 288 completed the survey. Higher proportion of suboptimal bowel preparations/week (≥ 10 %) was associated with hospital/university practice, teaching hospital affiliation, greater than 25 % Medicaid insured patients, recommendation of PEG alone and <b>sulfate-free.</b> Those reporting greater than 25 % Medicare and privately insured patients, split dose recommendation, and use of MoviPrep® were associated with a less than 10 % suboptimal bowel preparations/week. Shorter surveillance intervals for three clinical scenarios were reported for suboptimal preparations and were shortest among participants in the Northeast who more often recommended early follow-up for normal findings and small adenomas. Those who recommended 4 -l PEG alone more often advised less than 1 year surveillance interval for a large adenoma. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates significantly shortened surveillance interval recommendations for suboptimal bowel preparation and that these interval recommendations vary regionally in the United States. Findings suggest an interrelationship between dietary restriction, purgative type, and practice and patient characteristics that warrant additional research...|$|E
40|$|Triosephosphate {{isomerase}} has {{an important}} loop near the active site which can exist in a "closed" and in an "open" conformation. Here we describe the structural properties of this "flexible" loop observed in two different structures of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase. Trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase, crystallized {{in the presence of}} 2. 4 M ammonium sulfate, packs as an asymmetric dimer of 54, 000 Da in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Due to different crystal contacts, peptide 167 - 180 (the flexible loop of subunit- 1) is an open conformation, whereas in subunit- 2, this peptide (residues 467 - 480) is in a closed conformation. In the closed conformation, a hydrogen bond exists between the tip of the loop and a well-defined sulfate ion which is bound to the active site of subunit- 2. Such an active site sulfate is not present in subunit- 1 due to crystal contacts. When the native (2. 4 M ammonium sulfate) crystals are transferred to a <b>sulfate-free</b> mother liquor, the flexible loop of subunit- 2 adopts the open conformation. From a closed starting model, this open conformation was discovered through molecular dynamics refinement without manual intervention, despite involving C alpha shifts of up to 7 A. The tip of the loop, residues 472, 473, 474, and 475, moves as a rigid body. Our analysis shows that in this crystal form the flexible loop of subunit- 2 faces a solvent channel. Therefore the open and the closed conformations of this flexible loop are virtually unaffected by crystal contacts. The actual observed conformation depends only on the absence or presence of a suitable ligand in the active site...|$|E
40|$|Sinorhizobium sp. strain BR 816 {{possesses}} two nodPQ copies, providing activated sulfate (3 ′-phosphoadenosine- 5 ′-phosphosulfate [PAPS]) {{needed for}} the biosynthesis of sulfated Nod factors. It was previously shown that the Nod factors synthesized by a nodPQ double mutant are not structurally {{different from those of}} the wild-type strain. In this study, we describe the characterization of a third sulfate activation locus. Two open reading frames were fully characterized and displayed the highest similarity with the Sinorhizobium meliloti housekeeping ATP sulfurylase subunits, encoded by the cysDN genes. The growth characteristics as well as the levels of Nod factor sulfation of a cysD mutant (FAJ 1600) and a nodP 1 nodQ 2 cysD triple mutant (FAJ 1604) were determined. FAJ 1600 shows a prolonged lag phase only with inorganic sulfate as the sole sulfur source, compared to the wild-type parent. On the other hand, FAJ 1604 requires cysteine for growth and produces <b>sulfate-free</b> Nod factors. Apigenin-induced nod gene expression for Nod factor synthesis does not influence the growth characteristics of any of the strains studied in the presence of different sulfur sources. In this way, it could be demonstrated that the “household” CysDN sulfate activation complex of Sinorhizobium sp. strain BR 816 can additionally ensure Nod factor sulfation, whereas the symbiotic PAPS pool, generated by the nodPQ sulfate activation loci, can be engaged for sulfation of amino acids. Finally, our results show that rhizobial growth defects are likely the reason for a decreased nitrogen fixation capacity of bean plants inoculated with cysD mutant strains, which can be restored by adding methionine to the plant nutrient solution...|$|E
