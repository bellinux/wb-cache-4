They can also be used to screen the potential effects of criminal justice interventions on crime compared with more basic structural factors such as urbanization, industrialization, migration, and control of substance use. The marginal effects of changes in criminal sanctions appear to be negligible for the development of recorded crime.

The influence of urbanization and industrialization appears to be insignificant, but measures to control alcohol use have had a great effect on violence, as have changes in the opportunity structure on theft.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to estimating the existence and magnitude of taxmotivated income shifting within multinational corporations. Existing studies of income <b>shifting</b> <b>use</b> changes in corporate tax rates as a source of identification. In contrast, this paper exploits exogenous earnings shocks at the parent firm and investigates how these shocks propagate across low-tax and high-tax multinational subsidiaries. This approach is implemented using a large panel of European multinational affiliates over the period 1995 - 2005. The central result is that parents' positive earnings shocks are associated with a significantly positive increase in pretax profits at low-tax affiliates, relative to the effect on the pretax profits of high-tax affiliates. The result is robust to controlling for various other differences between low-tax and high-tax affiliates and for country-pair-year fixed effects. Additional tests suggest that the estimated effect is attributable primarily to the strategic use of debt across affiliates. The magnitude of income shifting estimated using this approach is substantial, but somewhat smaller than that found in the previous literature. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A remarkably {{neglected}} way {{of entering}} the Wirkungsgeschichte of Valerius Maximus myriad of rhetorical anecdotes in his Memorable Deeds and Sayings (Facta et dicta memorabilia) is an in-depth study of his Renaissance commentators from the 14 th {{up to the}} 17 th century. Since scholars from Petrarch onwards treated classical texts both as documents of historical interest, which could make the ancient world live again, and as ideal and timeless objects for literary imitation in the present, commentaries prove to be an indirect yet fascinating route both to Valerius collection of exempla and its narrative force. In this research project it is investigated how Renaissance commentaries on Valerius Maximus, dating from the generation following Petrarch and including the influential commentaries by Oliverius Arzignanensis (Venice, 1487), Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Paris, 1510), Henricus Glareanus (Basle, 1550), and Stephanus Pighius (Antwerp, 1574), functioned in their cultural and literary context. In a second stage the question is raised how this commentary tradition, inspired by Petrarch and his contemporaries in the intellectual and literate milieu of 14 th-century Avignon to various degrees, led to a new, humanist vision on Valerius Maximus and his rhetorical use of exempla. As such it is argued how this humanist reading of Valerius Maximus collection elicited both a new aesthetics of composition and a <b>shifting</b> <b>use</b> of ideologically useful exempla in the 14 th up to the 17 th centuries. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An area {{overlooked}} in recent {{research is the}} meaning of architecture in the ill-defined category of sites known as small towns. Using the social psychology approaches of identity theory, social identity theory, and operant conditioning, this study examines the impact of Roman imperialism and the socio-economic changes that occurred on the island as reflected in the choice of architecture. Focusing on small towns is problematic due to difficulties with definition and site categorization. However, as settlements that were more complex than simple villages but more organic than the larger cities, they provide an opportunity to measure the socio-economic impact of Roman imperialism in the rural countryside. This thesis examines the meaning of architectural variation in small towns by investigating the <b>shifting</b> <b>use</b> of construction techniques and building types in comparison with personal artifacts. Data was collected from published site reports and entered into a simple geo-spatial database where broad trends were analyzed to reveal general patterns over space and time. Detailed case studies were then examined from sites that showed some shared characteristics in this initial analysis. Different patterns became evident that were not solely attributable to site type, size, economics, or local geology and reveal the negotiation of personal identity in the context of Roman imperialism. As a supplementary example, architectural variation on the better documented American frontier provided a comparison for socio-economic change on the Roman frontier. The choice of architecture styles by the inhabitants of Romano-British small towns had different meanings given the unique set of economic and social forces they encountered. The inhabitants of these sites negotiated their personal identities in relation to the civic identities of the settlement in which they lived and were affected by economic, social, and imperial forces...|$|E

40|$|In this master’s thesis, I {{explain the}} concept of profit {{shifting}} within multinational enterprises and investigate whether petroleum companies on the Norwegian and British continental shelves engage in tax motivated profit shifting, by applying ordinary least squares and company fixed effects estimation. To be able to distinguish between traditional tax distortions and profit shifting, I extend the model developed by James R. Hines and Eric M. Rice in their 1994 article “Fiscal Paradise: Foreign Tax Havens and American Business” published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, by including the statutory tax rate that applies to the petroleum companies and the parent companies’ corporate income tax rates as separate explanatory variables in the regressions, while also performing regressions using the tax difference as explanatory variables. The majority of previous studies on profit <b>shifting</b> <b>use</b> the average tax difference between affiliates as the explanatory variable. The tax difference variable used in this thesis is a simplified version including only {{the difference between the}} tax rates that apply to the petroleum affiliate and the parent company. As companies also have the option of shifting profits to other affiliates within the group, the simplified tax difference variable is expected to capture only parts of any profit shifting. I propose that the statutory tax rate that applies to the petroleum companies also represent the tax difference between the petroleum affiliate and the affiliates located in a country with a corporate income tax rate of zero. As this is the most profitable channel for profit shifting, the coefficients that result from a regression of reported profits on the tax rate that applies to the petroleum companies can also be interpreted as the semi-elasticity of reported profits with respect to the maximum tax difference between the petroleum company in question and its affiliates. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} semi-elasticities of reported profit with respect to the tax difference between the affiliate at hand and its group members are in the range [- 3,- 0. 5]. The corresponding semi-elasticities that result in this thesis are in the range [- 3, - 1. 4]. The semi-elasticities of reported profit with respect to the petroleum tax rate are in the range [- 5. 5, - 0. 1], while semi-elasticities of reported profits with respect to the parent company tax rate are in the range [- 12. 4, 3. 3]. I conclude that there is some evidence of profit shifting in the data, and that some of the results are comparable to the ones from previous studies...|$|E
