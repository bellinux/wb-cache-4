5|$|Malcolm Barrett as Dr. Lem Hewitt: Lem {{is one of}} the {{laboratory}} scientists in Veridian's Research Department. He is best friends with his lab partner Phil, who works with him on almost every project. Lem is just as conflict-averse as Phil, and seems just as willing to roll over and take whatever abuse the company has to offer. He grew up in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother (Khandi Alexander) a renowned scientist.|$|E
5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield a home field nor any players, coaches, or equipment. Harry March, {{who was part of}} the group that convinced Mara to buy the team from the league, helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary. March guiding him through the team's early years, handling the personnel decisions. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring college stars such as Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self, and although he signed with the team, his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early portion of the season, until he got into shape, at which point he would play full games. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E
5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield any players, coaches, equipment, or a home field. March helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary and handling the personnel decisions, and Gibson served as the team's president. Mara's friends were wary of investing in the team, but he convinced Matty Frank, a real estate investor, {{and a few other}} people to invest. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring stars such as running back Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self, and his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early parts of the season, until he got into shape.

25|$|Wilson Fittipaldi is {{the older}} brother of CART {{champion}} and double Formula One world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Like Jimmy Stewart and Ian Scheckter he remained in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> younger and more illustrious sibling in top level motorsport. He married Suzy. He {{is the father of}} former CART, Formula One and NASCAR driver Christian Fittipaldi and has a daughter, Roberta.|$|E
50|$|Later, he {{is taken}} into the British Army {{fighting}} on the Western Front of the First World War, where the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> past pursue him and lead to a shattering climax.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} his {{excitement}} broke out. He {{jumped off the}} bench and gesticulated. The great <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms darting over roof and walls made the shed appear too small to contain his agitation.|$|R
50|$|Just {{as a child}} {{plays at}} its own will with its {{reflection}} in a mirror, even so with the help <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Yogamāyā Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa sported with the Gopīs, who were like many <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> own form.|$|R
25|$|After 11 {{games and}} three goals – a <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former strike rate – Charles was sold for £70,000 to A.S. Roma. Initially, {{the move was}} a success and Charles scored within fifteen minutes of his first game for Roma, in a match against Bologna. The early promise was never fulfilled, however, and Charles was on the move again a year later.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{and his own}} {{reservations}} about the idea, Louis's grief and guilt spur him {{to carry out his}} plan. Gage returns from the dead as a monstrous, demonic <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self and kills both Jud and Rachel. After killing Church, Louis confronts his son and sends him back to the grave with a lethal injection of chemicals from his medical supply stock.|$|E
25|$|Upon release Oluwale {{was unable}} to hold down a job and a {{permanent}} residence, and quickly became homeless. Friends reported {{that he was a}} <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self, and had lost all confidence. As a black man in a still overtly-racist Britain, his choices of lodging and employment were also limited in his lifetime (the Race Relations Act outlawing discrimination in both only received Royal Assent in October 1968).|$|E
50|$|Recognition for {{his work}} has grown since then, {{and the opening of}} the most recent major exhibition, Africa,the Sun and the <b>Shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works at Johannesburg's Standard Bank Gallery on 13 October 2009 was {{strongly}} attended.|$|R
50|$|Samuel: The {{youngest}} step {{child of}} Ethel, Samuel has {{the distinction of}} being the judge with the most overturned decisions in the U.S. He walks in the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> siblings, offering a sassy, short comment every once in a while, only to be shot down.|$|R
60|$|Scaramouche stood meditatively smiling with tight lips. At {{the last}} moment he had {{caught a glimpse of}} M. de La Tour d'Azyr's face thrust farther forward than usual from the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> box, and it was a face set in anger, with eyes on fire.|$|R
25|$|Min Saw {{grew up in}} the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> two step-brothers, {{who viewed}} Min Saw as their {{youngest}} brother and allowed him to retain his princely status at the court. Min Saw and his mother attended Kunhsaw, and lived nearby the monastery. In 1038, Kyiso died, and was succeeded by Sokkate. Min Saw was loyal to the new king. He took wives, and had at least two sons (Saw Lu and Kyansittha) by the early 1040s.|$|E
25|$|As the {{hand-picked}} {{choice of}} the popular Governor du Pont, he easily won election as Governor of Delaware, defeating former Delaware Supreme Court Justice William T. Quillen. In the campaign, Castle was criticized for being a <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mentor and only promising an extension of du Pont’s program. Delaware voters however elected him to another term in 1988 when he defeated Democrat Jacob Kreshtool by a wide margin. Castle served two terms, cutting the second one slightly short when he resigned to begin his first term as U.S. Representative.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that after Atlanna's death, Tom Curry {{met and married}} an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman's half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew to hate Aquaman {{not only for the}} powers that he could never possess but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman. Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman's nemesis, Ocean Master.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} I {{got closer to}} the marvellous lines of the actor's face, and was enabled to read and record the subtler, fleeter <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expression. I have never looked upon a face with such transcendent power of externalizing and {{differentiating}} emotions, and I have never heard a voice of equal beauty and majesty.|$|R
50|$|An ex-soldier {{returns to}} Crete, {{to take stock}} after his boat-building {{business}} is bought out, thirty years after he had fought alongside the local resistance (andartes) during the Second World War.

50|$|Many {{painters}} of the 19th century experimented with {{the uses of}} the color violet to capture the subtle effects of light. Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863) made use of violet {{in the sky and}} <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works, such as <b>his</b> painting <b>of</b> a tiger.|$|R
25|$|He was {{ten years}} old when his {{grandfather}} died and his mother ascended to the throne. His childhood and youth were lived quietly, as he was a mere infante in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> elder brother José, Prince of Brazil and 14th Duke of Braganza, the heir-apparent to the throne. Folklore has John as a rather uncultured youth, but according to Jorge Pedreira e Costa, he received as rigorous an education as José did. Still, a French ambassador of the time painted him in unfavorable colors, seeing him as hesitant and dim. The record of this period of his life is too vague for historians to form any definitive picture. Little is known of the substance of his education. He surely received instruction in religion, law, French, and etiquette, and would presumably have learned history through reading the works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and João de Barros.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} what Wills and the Aborigines {{made of the}} broader social and {{political}} dimensions of the enterprise. Some of Wills' contemporaries were shocked that he would associate with Aborigines in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's death. Others, such as this writer in The Empire, called him a hero: ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} Flavian emperors, Domitian would rule the longest, {{despite the fact}} that his youth and early career were largely spent in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> older brother. [...] Titus had gained {{military}} renown during the First Jewish–Roman War. After their father Vespasian became emperor in 69 following the civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood looking}} {{out across the}} roofs and at the distant skyscrapers. She watched him without speaking. She knew very well that his eyes saw nothing of the landscape. He was looking back into some world <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own fancy, back, perhaps, into the <b>shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own life, {{concerning}} which no word that she or any {{one else in the}} city had ever heard had passed his lips.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days had}} passed. Cosway {{sat alone in}} his lodging--pale and worn: the <b>shadow</b> already <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self.|$|R

500|$|Conacher was {{a member}} of the Memorial Cup winning West Toronto Nationals in 1935 as Canadian junior {{champion}}s and {{was a member}} of the Ontario Hockey Association senior champion Toronto Dominions in 1937. Playing in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more famous brothers Charlie and Lionel, Roy was known as the [...] "forgotten Conacher". [...] He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998, following his brothers to become the only trio of siblings so enshrined.|$|E
500|$|Known {{publicly}} as Albert {{until his}} accession, and [...] "Bertie" [...] among {{his family and}} close friends, George VI {{was born in the}} reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria, and was named after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. As the second son of King George V, he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> elder brother, Edward. He attended naval college as a teenager, and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he had speech therapy for a stammer, which he never fully overcame.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals did {{not return}} to office until 1892. Lord Rosebery was {{eventually}} persuaded to enter government, becoming once again Foreign Secretary serving under Gladstone as Prime Minister. In 1894 on Gladstone's retirement he achieved his wife's ambitions and became Prime Minister, but by then Lady Rosebery was dead. Without her, Rosebery was a <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former self, taking huge doses of morphine to combat insomnia and nerves. His Prime Ministership lasted barely a year, marred by problems and difficulties. For the remainder of his life and without his wife, as Queen Victoria phrased it, [...] "to hold him back", he became more and more eccentric and controversial in his decisions. His final years were blighted by ill health and a self-enforced seclusion in Scotland. He died in 1929.|$|E
5000|$|Salvador Dalí, as with Picasso in {{anticipation}} of the tercentennial of Velázquez's death, created in 1958 a work entitled [...] Velázquez Painting the Infanta Margarita With the Lights and <b>Shadows</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Own Glory. The color scheme shows Dalí's serious tribute to Velázquez; the work also functioned, as in Picasso's case, as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought—nuclear mysticism, in Dalí's case.|$|R
