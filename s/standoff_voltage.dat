40|$|We {{fabricated}} high <b>standoff</b> <b>voltage</b> (450 V) Schottky rectifiers on hydride {{vapor phase}} epitaxy grown GaN on sapphire substrate. Several Schottky device geometries were investigated, including lateral geometry with rectangular and circular contacts, mesa devices, and Schottky metal field plate overlapping a SiO 2 layer. The best devices were characterized by an ON-state voltage of 4. 2 V at a current density of 100 A/cm 2 and a saturation current density of 10 ^– 5 A/cm 2 at a reverse bias of 100 V. From the measured breakdown voltage we estimated the critical field for electric breakdown in GaN to be (2. 2 ± 0. 7) × 10 ^ 6 V/cm. This value for the critical field is a lower limit {{since most of the}} devices exhibited abrupt and premature breakdown associated with corner and edge effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of ultra-thin lanthanum-doped lead zirconium titanate (PLZT) multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) using a high-power pulsed ion beam was studied. The deposition experiments {{were conducted on}} the RHEPP- 1 facility at Sandia National Laboratories. The goal of this work was to increase the energy density of ceramic capacitors through {{the formation of a}} multilayer device with excellent materials properties, dielectric constant, and <b>standoff</b> <b>voltage.</b> For successful device construction, {{there are a number of}} challenging requirements including achieving correct stoichiometric and crystallographic composition of the deposited PLZT, as well as the creation of a defect free homogenous film. This report details some success in satisfying these requirements, although 900 C temperatures were necessary for PLZT perovskite phase formation. These temperatures were applied to a previously deposited multi-layer film which was then post-annealed to this temperature. The film exhibited mechanical distress attributable to differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the various layers. This caused significant defects in the deposited films that led to shorts across devices. A follow-on single layer deposition without post-anneal produced smooth layers with good interface behavior, but without the perovskite phase formation. These issues will need to be addressed in order for ion beam deposited MLCCs to become a viable technology. It is possible that future in-situ heating during deposition may address both the CTE issue, and result in lowered processing temperatures, which in turn could raise the probability of successful MLCC formation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the developments of novel semiconductor devices based on epitaxial wide bandgap semiconductors GaN and ZnS. The number of interesting and exciting results in physics, electronics and materials science {{of these systems}} were found in studies motivated by these devices. This thesis consists of three major topics, structural characterization and kinetic growth modeling of the GaNAs/GaAs superlattices, structural and optical characterization and solid phase recrystallization of ZnS thin films grown on GaN and sapphire substrates, and design and fabrication of GaN high power devices as well as measurement of fundamental electronic properties of GaN, such as minority carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes and critical field for electric breakdown. The set of GaNAs/GaAs superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy was analyzed by high resolution X-ray diffraction and cross—sectional transmission electron microscopy. The nitrogen incorporation and GaNAs/GaAs interface sharpness were experimentally found to strongly depend on growth temperature. The activation energies for nitrogen desorption and nitrogen to arsenic segregation were found through simple kinetic model, which is in fine agreement with experimentally obtained results. These fundamental studies provide important insights into growth of GaN on GaAs substrates, which is of significant practical importance for all electronic GaN devices. Zinc sulfide/Gallium nitride heterostructures are potentially interesting system for light emitters in blue and green part of visible spectrum, with DC low power consumption electroluminescent displays being one attractive application of these diodes. Zinc sulfide thin films grown on GaN (0001), GaAs (001) and sapphire (0001) substrates by MBE were characterized by variable temperature photoluminescence and high resolution X-ray diffraction. The structural properties of the films suffered from the large lattice mismatch between ZnS and various substrates which were used. The optical properties of the ZnS films {{were found to be}} in direct correlation with structural properties of the films. The ZnS films doped with Al and Ag grown on n and p-type GaN, and sapphire were characterized by low temperature photoluminescence and displayed bright blue luminescence. Fabricated N-ZnS/p-GaN heterostructures were characterized by current-voltage and electroluminescence. Electroluminescence was found to be centered around 390 nm, corresponding to high energy silver band, and it shifted to higher energies with increase in device voltage. Since as grown films suffered from crystalline imperfections, the ZnS thin films on sapphire were recrystallized, by annealing at temperatures above 900 °C at sulfur overpressure of 10 atm. The structural properties of samples significantly improved, indicating more than 10 -fold reduction in tilting and excellent crystallinity. The role of sulfur was discussed, and it was found that sulfur is important in preventing film evaporation, increasing boundary migration and providing compliancy to sapphire substrate. The minority carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes were measured for electrons and holes in unintentionally doped, n and p-type GaN samples grown by several different growth techniques. The experimentally observed diffusion lengths were in the 0. 2 — 0. 3 µm range for Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown samples, and 1 — 2 µm in the case of Halide Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) grown sample. In the case of MOCVD grown samples, the hole lifetime was estimated to approximately 7 ns, and electron lifetime to approximately 0. 1 ns. The same samples were structurally characterized by AFM, {{and the size of the}} defect-free regions surrounded by linear dislocations is found to be of the order of measured diffusion length, in qualitative agreement with minority carrier recombination at linear dislocations. A simple model is presented which explains an increase in minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length with a decrease in the dislocation density or increase in the size of defect-free grains. A model which explains why linear dislocations might act as recombination sites is also presented. The important advantage of nitrides and other wide band gap materials for high power devices is a smaller standoff layer thickness for the same <b>standoff</b> <b>voltage,</b> giving smaller ON-state voltage and resistance, smaller power dissipation and larger maximum current density, allowing physically smaller devices for the same power rating. The design rules for nitride based Schottky rectifiers and thyristors are presented. The critical field for electric breakdown and minority carrier recombination lifetimes are found to be important design parameters. Using modeling parameters which are well in the range currently available with GaN, and measured from fabricated devices, design results indicate the possibility of 18 µm thick GaN Schottky rectifiers and 12 µm thick A 1 GaN thyristors supporting 5 kV <b>standoff</b> <b>voltage.</b> The critical field for electric breakdown was found to be 5 MV/cm from the theoretical studies. The maximum current density for 5 kV thyristors is in the 200 — 400 A/cm^ 2 range depending on the hole lifetime, and is limited by thermal breakdown. The maximum operating frequency of 5 kV thyristors is in the 1 - 2 MHz range and also depends on the hole lifetime. Two-terminal GaN Schottky rectifiers were fabricated. The Schottky rectifiers were fabricated on thick GaN layers grown by HVPE and had a standoff voltages in the 450 V to 750 V range, depending on the thickness of the GaN film and contact geometry. Best devices were characterized with reverse current density of 10 ^(- 5) A/cm^ 2 at reverse bias of 100 V, and 4. 2 V ON-state voltage at a forward current density of 100 A/cm^ 2. Various contact geometries were investigated. It was found that mesa geometry improves ON-state voltage, but causes increase in reverse current density, while that metal field plate geometry significantly reduces reverse current density. The measured critical field for electric breakdown in GaN was found to be (2. 5 ± 0. 5) MV/cm and it approaches the theoretical estimate of 5 MV/cm. The measured values of critical field are only a lower limit since the reverse breakdown voltage was limited by premature corner and edge breakdown...|$|E

40|$|We {{continue}} {{here the}} development of high-voltage Ultra-Wideband coupled-line directional couplers that we began in a previous note. We investigate smoothing the impedance profile, increasing the isolation, and reducing the transmission loss, while maintaining high <b>voltage</b> <b>standoff.</b> We develop {{a number of new}} prototypes, including medium-voltage designs filled with air, and higher voltage designs filled with oil. First, we experiment with an air-filled design that is similar to an earlier oil-filled symmetrical design. The new design includes tuning screws positioned at the junction of the feed sections and coupled lines, in an attempt to tune out impedance discontinuities. Next, we simplify this design by eliminating the feed sections, placing the connectors in direct contact with the coupled lines. This eliminates a potential source of impedance discontinuities. Next, we build a higher-voltage version of the simplified design filled with oil. This version was successfully tested using a pulser with a 25 kV output. Finally, in the last three versions we experiment with the end treatments of both air-filled and oil-filled couplers, to reduce the cross-coupling into the isolated port, and to increase the reliability of the solder connections with spring-loaded pressure contacts.

40|$|For {{the central}} heating of a fusion reactor ion {{cyclotron}} {{radio frequency heating}} (ICRH) is the first choice method as {{it is able to}} couple RF power to the ions without density limit. The drawback of this heating method is the problem of excitation of the magneto-sonic wave through the plasma boundary layer from the antenna located along the wall, without exceeding its <b>voltage</b> <b>standoff.</b> The amount of coupling depends on the antenna excitation and the surface admittance at the antenna output due to the plasma profile. The paper deals with the optimization of the antenna excitation by the use of sections of traveling-wave antennas (TWAs) distributed all along the reactor wall between the blanket modules. They are mounted and fed in resonant ring system(s). First, the physics of the coupling of a strap array is studied by simple models and the coupling code ANTITER II. Then, after the study of the basic properties of a TWA section, its feeding problem is solved by hybrids driving them in resonant ring circuit(s). The complete modeling is obtained from the matrices of the TWA sections connected to one of the feeding hybrid(s). The solution is iterated with the coupling code to determine the loading for a reference low-coupling ITER plasma profile. The resulting wave pattern up to the plasma bulk is derived. The proposed system is totally load resilient and allows us to obtain a very selective exciting wave spectrum. A discussion of some practical implementation problems is added...|$|R
40|$|We {{present some}} recent results on two {{innovative}} applications of microelectronics technology to dust inventory measurement and dust removal in ITER. A novel device {{to detect the}} settling of dust particles on a remote surface has been developed in the laboratory. A circuit board with a grid of two interlocking conductive traces with 25 μm spacing is biased to 30 – 50 V. Carbon particles landing on the energized grid create a transient short circuit. The current flowing through the short circuit creates a voltage pulse that is recorded by standard nuclear counting electronics and {{the total number of}} counts is related to the mass of dust impinging on the grid. The particles typically vaporize in a few seconds restoring the previous <b>voltage</b> <b>standoff.</b> Experience on NSTX however, showed that in a tokamak environment it was still possible for large particles or fibers to remain on the grid causing a long term short circuit. We report on the development of a gas puff system that uses helium to clear such particles. Experiments with varying nozzle designs, backing pressures, puff durations, and exit flow orientations have given an optimal configuration that effectively removes particles from an area up to 25 cm² with a single nozzle. In a separate experiment we are developing an advanced circuit grid of three interlocking traces that can generate a miniature electrostatic traveling wave for transporting dust to a suitable exit port. We have fabricated such a 3 -pole circuit board with 25 micron insulated traces that operates with voltages up to 200 V. Recent results showed motion of dust particles with the application of only 50 V bias voltage. Such a device could potentially remove dust continuously without dedicated interventions and without loss of machine availability for plasma operations...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of two parts. Part I describes work on the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of GaN, AlN, and Al(x) Ga(1 -x) N alloys, as well as efforts in the initial technical development and demonstration of nitride-based high power electronic devices. The major issues pertaining to MBE growth are discussed, including special requirements of the growth system, substrates, film nucleation, n- and p-type doping, and the dependence of film quality on growth parameters. The GaN films were characterized {{by a variety of}} methods, including high resolution x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, and Hall effect measurement. It is found that the film polarity and extended defect density as well as quality of photoluminescence and electrical transport properties depend crucially on how the nitride layer is nucleated on the substrate and how the subsequent film surface morphology evolves, which can be controlled by the growth conditions. A technique is proposed and demonstrated that utilizes the control of morphology evolution to reduce defect density and improve the structural quality of MBE GaN films. In addition to growth, the design and processing of high voltage GaN Schottky diodes is presented, as well as an experimental study of sputter-deposited ohmic and rectifying metal contacts to GaN. Simple models for high power devices, based on materials properties such as minority carrier diffusion length and critical electric breakdown field, are used to estimate the <b>voltage</b> <b>standoff</b> capability, current carrying capacity, and maximum operating frequency of unipolar and bipolar GaN power devices. The materials and transport properties of GaN pertinent to high power device design were measured experimentally. High voltage Schottky rectifiers were fabricated which verify the impressive electric breakdown field of GaN (2 - 5 MV/cm). Electron beam induced current (EBIC) experiments were also conducted to measure the minority carrier diffusion length for both electrons and holes in GaN. Part II of the thesis describes studies of the MBE growth of ZnS and investigations of ZnS/GaN light emitting heterojunctions which show promise for application as blue and green light emitters. Zinc sulfide layers doped with Ag and Al were grown by MBE on sapphire, GaAs, and GaN substrates and characterized by x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence.
