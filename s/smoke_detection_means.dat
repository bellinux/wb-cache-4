40|$|An image {{processing}} approach for <b>detection</b> of <b>smoke</b> in video using static and dynamic features is proposed in this paper. As the conventional <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> such as particle sampling, smoke, temperature, Humidity Sensors {{needs to be}} close to the source of the <b>smoke</b> for <b>detection,</b> also they have weakness in wide coverage area and low response time. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a method based on {{image processing}} techniques, capable to identify smoke from video taken from video dataset. The proposed detection method consists of the following steps: moving region <b>detection,</b> <b>smoke</b> color <b>detection,</b> detecting <b>smoke</b> disorder, direction and then classification phase. This will provide early warnings such as fire, thus reducing economic losses and casualties. In addition, it will help to improve the rate of <b>smoke</b> <b>detection,</b> as well as reducing the false detection rate of other suspected object. The paper is structured as follows: section 1 describes introduction part and features of smoke used to differentiate it from other suspected object. Then section 2 describes the previous work including conventional and recent research on <b>smoke</b> <b>detection.</b> Next, section 3 describes the proposed <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> system. Finally conclusion is given. Index Terms: <b>smoke</b> <b>detection,</b> moving region <b>detection,</b> <b>smoke</b> features...|$|R

40|$|Video-based <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> in {{laparoscopic surgery}} has {{different}} potential applications, {{such as the}} automatic addressing of surgical events associated with the electrocauterization task {{and the development of}} automatic smoke removal. In the literature, video-based <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> has been studied widely for fire surveillance systems. Nevertheless, the proposed methods are insufficient for <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> in laparoscopic videos because they often depend on assumptions which rarely hold in laparoscopic surgery such as static camera. In this paper, ten visual features based on motion, texture and colour of smoke are proposed and evaluated for <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> in laparoscopic videos. These features are RGB channels, energy-based feature, texture features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), HSV colour space feature, features based on the detection of moving regions using optical flow and the smoke colour in HSV colour space. These features were tested on four laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Experimental observations show that each feature can provide valuable information in performing the <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> task. However, each feature has weaknesses to detect the presence of smoke in some cases. By combining all proposed features smoke with high and even low density can be identified robustly and the classification accuracy increases significantly...|$|R

In addition, robust <b>smoke</b> feature <b>detection</b> algorithms are implemented that take into account both dynamic and static characteristics of smoke. The smoke features include motion, motion orientation (estimated by using the accumulation of motion) for the former and texture for the latter.

40|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>detection</b> {{calls for}} a {{reliable}} and fast distinction between background, moving objects and variable shapes that are recognizable as smoke. In our system we propose a stable background suppression module joined with a <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> module working on segmented objects. It exploits two features: the energy variation in wavelet model and a color model of the smoke. The decrease of energy ratio in wavelet domain between background and current image is a clue to detect smoke representing the variations of texture level. A mixture of Gaussians models this texture ratio for temporal evolution. The color model is used as reference to measure the deviation of the current pixel color from the model. The two features have been combined using a Bayesian classifier to detect smoke in the scene.

40|$|Existing video-based <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> methods often rely on {{the visual}} {{features}} extracted directly from the original frames. In the case of light smoke, the background is still visible and it deteriorates {{the quality of the}} features. This paper presents an approach to separating the smoke component from the background such that visual features can be extracted from the smoke component for reliable <b>smoke</b> <b>detection.</b> Specifically, an image is assumed to be a linear blending of a smoke component and a background image. Given a video frame and its background, the estimation of the blending parameter and the actual smoke component can be formulated as an optimization problem. Three methods based on different models for the smoke component are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on synthesized and real video data have shown that the proposed approach can effectively separate the smoke component and the <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> performance is significantly improved by using the visual features extracted from the smoke component...|$|R
40|$|In the {{state-of-the-art}} video-based <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> methods, {{the representation}} of smoke mainly depends on the visual information in the current image frame. In the case of light smoke, the original background can be still seen and may deteriorate the characterization of smoke. The core idea {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the superiority of using smoke component for <b>smoke</b> <b>detection.</b> In order to obtain smoke component, a blended image model is constructed, which basically is a linear combination of background and smoke components. Smoke opacity which represents a weighting of the smoke component is also defined. Based on this model, an optimization problem is posed. An algorithm is devised to solve for smoke opacity and smoke component, given an input image and the background. The resulting smoke opacity and smoke component are then used to perform the <b>smoke</b> <b>detection</b> task. The experimental results on both synthesized and real image data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
