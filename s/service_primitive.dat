These concepts {{are derived from}} an analysis of limitations of some currently available standard design languages. We conclude that language design should be based upon the careful consideration of architectural concepts. This paper aims at supporting designers by presenting a methodological design framework {{in which they can}} reason about the design and implementation of distributed systems. The paper is also meant for language developers and formalists by presenting a collection of architectural concepts which deserve consideration for formal support. 1 Introduction Architectural concepts are abstractions (models) of frequently occurring aspects of technical objects.

40|$|Multicast/broadcast is an {{important}} <b>service</b> <b>primitive</b> in networks. The IEEE 802. 11 multicast/broadcast protocol {{is based on the}} basic access procedure of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). This protocol does not provide any media access control (MAC) layer recovery on multicast/broadcast frames. As a result, the reliability of the multicast/broadcast service is reduced due to the increased probability of lost frames resulting from interference or collisions. In this paper, we propose a reliable Batch Mode Multicast MAC protocol, BMMM, which substentially reduces the number of contention phases, thus considerably reduces the time required for a multicast/broadcast. We then propose a Location Aware Multicast MAC protocol, LAMM, that uses station location information to further improve upon BMMM. Extensive analysis and simulation results validate the reliability and efficiency of our multicast MAC protocols. ...|$|E

The two-way transaction, formally called the Send Data with Acknowledge (SDA) <b>service</b> <b>primitive,</b> is a fundamental building block for real-time protocols. We analyze its delay performances under packet loss probability caused by a number of co-located interfering piconets. We first present a probabilistic treatment of the performance of a Bluetooth piconet under co-channel interference from other Bluetooth piconets. An upper bound on the packet error rate is analytically derived. Simulation results validating the theoretical results are shown. The obtained packet error rate bounds are then applied to the problem of deadline for twoway transactions. The probability that a deadline will be met is introduced, as well as the value of the deadline in function of the desired probability that the deadline will be met. ...|$|E
40|$|The service {{specification}} {{concept has}} acquired an increasing level of recognition by protocol designers. This architectural concept influences the methodology applied to service and protocol definition. Since the protocol {{is seen as}} the logical implementation of the service, one can ask whether it is possible to formally derive the specification of a protocol providing a given service. This paper addresses this question and presents an algorithm for deriving a protocol specification from a given service specification. It is assumed that services are described by expressions, where names identifying both <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> and previously defined services are composed using operators for sequence, parallelism and alternative. <b>Services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> may have input and output parameters. Composition of services from predefined <b>services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> is also permitted. The expression defining the service is the basis for the protocol derivation process. The algorithm presented fully automates the derivation process. Future work will focus on the optimization of traffic between protocol entities and on applications...|$|R

(3) Even if bottleneck rate is suitably identified, packet losses are still possible due to fading and interference. The protocol will need to recover from such losses so that clients achieve an application-specified reliability. This paper aims to design a link layer multicast service that addresses these challenges in the context of WiFi networks. A practical solution is of interest that can accomplish high multicast throughput, while meeting a required per-node delivery ratio. Increasing transmission rates does not resolve the challenges, since some weak clients will fail to receive transmissions at higher data rates, and thus, be âleft behindâ.

40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an {{important}} transport layer protocol providing a reliable data transfer service to support many applications running over the Internet such as the World Wide Web. It is therefore important to define the intent of TCP. This is achieved by describing the services {{it is intended to}} provide in an abstract way, known as a service definition. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define the services provided by TCP, however, they are all inadequate in various ways. In particular, most of them follow the applications interface defined in the TCP Request for Comments (P&C 793) too closely, making them rather implementation specific. The aim of our work is to provide an appropriately abstract definition of the TCP service, following the guidance of the Open Systems Interconnection service conventions, and to make it as general and as complete as possible. We define the service in terms of a set of 15 <b>service</b> <b>primitives</b> and their sequences, for TCP's main features of connection establishment, data transfer, urgent data transfer, orderly connection release, and aborting connections.
