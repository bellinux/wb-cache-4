During the 1990s, JAL featured several commercials with celebrities, including Janet Jackson who danced and <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> a backdrop of JAL 747s on rotation.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

5|$|Trautmann {{attended}} the evening's post-match banquet (where Alma Cogan <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> the players) despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting his injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae in his neck, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian {{travel to}} the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the {{birthday}} of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with {{a bolt of lightning}} striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.|$|E

The error, if it is one, may be due to a misattribution in the Smithsonian publication of Thomson's book (Fischer).|$|E
25|$|Jacques Urlus (January 6, 1867 in Hergenrath, Rhine Province - June 6, 1935 in Noordwijk, Netherlands), was a Dutch {{dramatic}} tenor.

For {{the first four}} verses, the {{additional}} gifts are all <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> a repeated standard melodic phrase. In the fifth verse, a different melody, with a change of tempo, is introduced for the five gold rings; and {{from this point on}} the first five gifts are always <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> a set of varied melodic phrases (with the partridge retaining its original coda phrase). Thence forward, the wording of each new gift is <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> the original standard melodic phrase before returning to the five gold rings.|$|R
50|$|It {{would appear}} that most Ancient Greek poetry, {{including}} the poems of Homer, was composed <b>to</b> be <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> music, and it is generally assumed {{by those who have}} reconstructed the surviving fragments of Greek music, such as the Seikilos epitaph, that a short syllable was <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> a short note, while the long syllables were <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> longer notes, or to a group of two or three short notes.|$|R

25|$|According to Cassius Dio, Terentius Maximus resembled Nero {{in voice}} and {{appearance}} and, like him, <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> the lyre. Terentius established a following in Asia minor but was soon {{forced to flee}} beyond the Euphrates, taking refuge with the Parthians. In addition, sources state that Titus discovered that his brother Domitian was plotting against him but refused to have him killed or banished.|$|E
25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin. Stalin used to invite Kozlovsky {{to come over}} whenever he wanted {{to listen to the}} sound of his voice, even {{in the middle of the}} night. So pleased was Stalin with Kozlovsky's singing, that he once kissed him and then himself <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> the piano accompaniment of Kozlovsky. Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E

25|$|The next night, Kau ties <b>Sang</b> <b>to</b> a {{chair and}} prepares to capture and {{eliminate}} the spirit. Sure enough, she arrives at their house and Kau chases her throughout. As Sang tries to free himself, Choi turns into a vampire and attacks him. Amidst the chaos, Kau restrains Choi and almost terminates the spirit, but stops when Sang begs him to let her go. Saddened she {{can no longer be}} with Sang, the spirit flies away.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Pierre Raffarin {{was often}} teased for his optimistic aphorisms, known colloquially and {{ironically}} as raffarinades, {{the best known}} being La route est droite, mais la pente est forte ("The road is straight, but the slope is steep"). Some consider that the word raffarinade was created {{in reference to the}} other French word mazarinade. However, mazarinade refers to the songs that the frondeurs (French revolutionaries during the Régence of Queen Anne – Archduchess of Austria – and chief minister Cardinal de Mazarin, before king Louis XIV's personal reign) <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> mock the unpopular chief minister.|$|E
25|$|With few {{survival}} skills having left school around {{the age of}} thirteen, he realized that formal employment {{was out of the}} question. His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with a few other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings he became street wise, with a real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income and he picked up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Melanie was {{the only}} artist to ignore the court {{injunction}} banning the Powder Ridge Rock Festival, playing for the crowd on a homemade stage powered by Mister Softee trucks. Shortly following this performance, she played at the Strawberry Fields Festival held from August 7 to 9, 1970, at Mosport Park, Ontario. She also performed at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 where she was introduced by Keith Moon and received four standing ovations (she also appeared at the 2010 Isle of Wight festival). She was also the artist who <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> herald in the summer solstice at Glastonbury Fayre (later the Glastonbury Festival) in England in June 1971. She performed again at Glastonbury in 2011, the 40th anniversary of the original festival.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens <b>sang</b> <b>to</b> him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E
25|$|The vampire again invades Yam's house, forcing Choi and Ting to hide. Kau and Sang {{arrive in}} time to wound it in battle and forcing it to flee, but not before it attacks and {{critically}} wounds Choi. Kau invites Ting to stay at his house for safety. The next morning, after examining Choi's wounds, Kau claims he too may become a vampire. He orders <b>Sang</b> <b>to</b> feed Choi with glutinous rice, claiming it may decrease the vampire's venom in Choi's body and {{bring him back to}} his normal state. While shopping for the rice, however, Sang fails to notice that the shady merchant deliberately mixed different kinds of rice in the bag. While Sang rides home, he is lured by a mysterious woman into her home. He soon deduces she is a spirit, but she uses her supernatural power to seduce him. They sleep together for the night.|$|E
