50|$|Aptly {{named after}} their disproportionately large, {{iridescent}} (as well as fluorescent) eyes, greeneyes are slender fish with slightly compressed bodies. The largest species, the <b>Shortnose</b> <b>greeneye</b> (Chlorophthalmus agassizi) reaches {{a length of}} 40 cm, but most other species are much smaller. Their heads are small with large jaws. Their coloration ranges from a yellowish to blackish brown, and some species have cryptic blotches.|$|E
40|$|Background. The <b>shortnose</b> <b>greeneye,</b> Chlorophthalmus agassizi Bonaparte, 1840, is {{a species}} with a circumglobal {{distribution}} and {{is among the}} most abundant commercial fishes in some Mediterranean areas. The knowledge of the biology and ecology of this species is poor and geographically limited, then the aim {{of this study is to}} provide a contribution to the knowledge on the reproductive biology of this monoecious deep-sea fish in Sardinian waters. Materials and Methods. In this paper the morphology and the development of the gonads, the mean size at maturity, the monthly evolution in the percent frequency of the maturity stages, and of the indices related to reproduction of the <b>shortnose</b> <b>greeneye</b> were examined. Individuals were caught by trawls, between 270 and 504 m of depth in the Sardinian seas. Results. The ovarian pattern is of an asynchronous type, characterized by releasing of eggs in successive batches. Seven stages of development for the ovary and four for the testis were identified on the basis of macroscopic and histological features. The female portion is the most evident component and shows a later maturation than the male portion. The spawning period is unique and takes place from May to September. Conclusion. The identification of spawning period and the adopted reproductive strategy is essential to obtain a better understanding of its biology and a good management of its fisheries...|$|E
