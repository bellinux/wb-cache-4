These prospective large-scale field studies were truly remarkable due to their size {{and the fact that}} families were randomized to either an experimental arm (i.e., NIT) or control arm (usual tax practice).

Yet such concerns could be addressed through regulation and by a universal service obligations in contracts, or in the licensing, to prevent such a situation from occurring. Of course, this bears the risk that this barrier to entry will dissuade international competitors from entering the market (see Deregulation).

5000|$|One key {{indicator}} {{of the success of}} production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [...] "pull" [...] comes from demand. Re-supply or production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer. In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the <b>supply</b> <b>response</b> is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, stock building may be deemed more appropriate, and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.|$|E

5000|$|Under Wellinghoff's {{leadership}} the Commission issued FERC Order 745 on March 15, 2011, which prescribes how {{providers of}} demand response {{are to be}} compensated in the organized wholesale markets. This order was opposed by energy economists including Professor William W. Hogan of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. Professor Hogan and Robert Borlick asserted that Order 745 overcompensates demand response {{and is likely to}} produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and U.S. economic output at a time of high unemployment. Furthermore, Borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses. Order 745 was approved by the Commission on a 4-1 vote; Commissioner Phillip D. Moeller filed a dissenting opinion. The order's compensation scheme was supported by the late Alfred Kahn, then Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy, Emeritus, at Cornell University, and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates, Inc. Dr. Kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to <b>supply</b> <b>response,</b> it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets. All resources selected by the market should receive the same market-clearing price, he said. However, Order 745 also mandates the application of a complex and controversial cost-benefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response. Professor Kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at NERA believe that he would have opposed such a test.|$|E

40|$|A central {{finding of}} the modern labor market {{literature}} is that labor <b>supply</b> <b>responses</b> tend to be concentrated along the extensive margin (labor force participation) rather than the intensive margin (hours of work). Yet, {{the literature on the}} marginal cost of public funds (MCF) focuses solely on the intensive margin. In this paper we demonstrate {{that it is important to}} incorporate extensive labor <b>supply</b> <b>responses</b> into the analysis. Firstly, MCF becomes a function of average taxes, rather than just marginal taxes. Secondly, participation decisions and thus MCF depend on the magnitude of transfers for those out of work.

5000|$|In general, {{the average}} {{reduction}} in {{work force in}} the US sites was about 13%, {{with most of the}} reduction in labour from secondary (typically the wives) and tertiary (typically older children) earners as opposed to the primary earner (usually the husbands). In Mincome the reduction in work effort was more modest: 1% for men and 3% for wives. It {{is important to remember that}} when the experiments were conducted, it was less socially acceptable for women to work outside the home. According to Rossi and Lyall [...] only 40% of wives who participated in the experiment worked outside the home and their earning power was low due to limited and discontinuous work experience. As such, the authors contend that wives’ labour involvement was marginal and when faced with competing tasks of looking after the household and raising children, the additional income provided by NIT was sufficient to justify an exit from the labor market. However, this phenomenon was predominantly observed in Caucasian wives whereas African American and Hispanic women exhibited a small increase in labor force participation. Interestingly, the decrease in labor involvement of teenage children was correlated to higher rates of high school graduation. A potential explanation is that the additional income from government assistance meant that young adults could stay in school as opposed to join the workforce in order to support their family. This has the potential positive long-term effect of allowing youth to find higher wage employment. In summary, the work <b>supply</b> <b>response</b> to NIT was very complex; however, data from the American studies would argue against a dramatic decline in the labour force.|$|E
