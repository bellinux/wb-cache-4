50|$|The {{best thing}} about using color {{management}} {{is the ability to}} see very accurate soft proofs of output: that is, the monitor-to-print match. Most vendors of monitor and profiling software don't seem to understand how important ambient lighting, critical print lighting and screen surround colors are in <b>soft</b> <b>proofing,</b> so most instructions for setting up <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> fall short and make side-by-side, screen-to-print matches less accurate than one would like. This is perhaps the third biggest problem for most people, after the overall complexity of color management and inadequate gamma mapping in printer profiles.|$|E

Since {{it is possible}} to predict how colour would look like when different illuminants are used, colour appearance models are incorporated in some monitor profiling software. Owing to these software, tone reproduction curve can be defined by taking into consideration viewing condition in which display is observed. In this work assessment of CIE CAM 02 colour appearance model usage at calibrating LCD monitor for <b>soft</b> <b>proof</b> was tested in order to determine which tone reproduction curve enables better reproduction of colour. Luminance level was kept constant, whereas tone reproduction curves determined by gamma values and by parameters of CIE CAM 02 model were varied.

The major problem is the difference of color spaces (RGB in monitor and CMYK in print), and this is solved by using ICC profiles for input and output devices. Moreover, colors on a monitor depend not only on its properties, but also on lighting conditions in a room where the image is viewed.

40|$|Load {{testing of}} bridges (in one of 3 possibilities: <b>soft,</b> {{diagnostic}} and <b>proof</b> load test) may discover higher strength capacities than predicted by standard analytical assessment methods based on numerical models. This {{is due to}} hidden resisting mechanisms than in many cases analytical tools {{are not able to}} deal with. As a consequence, load testing can make a more accurate assessment of the bridge response and therefore predict longer life-time than predicted by simple calculations. At the end, this leads to an extended service life for bridges that may be posted or declared as unsafe after some years in operation due to increasing damage or traffic loading. An accurate life-cycle analysis requires an accurate estimation of the remaining service life of the bridge. In this sense, the paper shows how load testing can be used directly in the correct capacity assessment of existing bridges and how the results of the test can be included in a life-cycle cost analysis of the prospective decisions (repair, strengthening, replacement,…).

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of Cathode Ray Tubes (CTRs) as soft-copy proofing devices in electronic imaging situations has raised serious questions as to their relevance, the appropriate viewing conditions and the necessary design, color and tone characteristics of the color monitors. Proofs are used at many different stages in the print production process. Each stage has different requirements in terms of color acceptance, detail, sharpness, composition and portability. At each level of the approval cycle various measuring devices are used to qualify acceptability. This thesis deals with every-day use and problems of soft-copy proofing. An electronic test pattern was displayed on a color monitor while the same test pattern in hard-copy proof form was displayed under industry standard 5000 degree Kelvin lighting. Fifty printing industry users of these proofing methods, comprising art directors, buyers, quality assurance representatives and electronic pagination users, evaluated the two proofs using the most common method of measurement visual assessment and completed a written questionnaire. This survey covered color and hue variations, detail, sharpness, design, size and portability descrepancies as they related to a soft-copy proof used as a design comprehensive, initial color approval, intermediate proof and/or the final proof. In general, the fifty industry decision makers found the <b>soft</b> copy <b>proof</b> to be acceptable for all the variables listed above when used as design comp, initial color and /or intermediate proof but rejected it in all cases when used as the final proof. The {{results of this study}} will enable monitor manufacturers, electronic pagination suppliers and users to better understand how soft-copy and hard-copy proofing differ, what the weaknesses are of each, and which areas are most objectionable. By having industry experts weigh the key differences and similarities between the new and the old proofing methods and by judging the shortcomings and the constraints of each, the soft-copy manufacturers will be able to better rank priorities in improving this developing science, and thus better {{meet the needs of the}} people they are serving...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Having a {{calibrated}} monitor with {{an accurate}} ICC monitor profile is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for an accurate <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> system. <b>Soft</b> <b>proofing,</b> {{using a computer}} monitor to proof a printed piece on a conventional or digital printing press, is an increasingly important component for remote proofing of mission critical printed materials. <b>Soft</b> <b>proofing</b> systems are current issues for proposed revisions of SWOP. This paper examines the requirements for an accurate, useful and certifiable <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> system. The accuracy of a monitor profile depends on both {{the stability of the}} monitor and the accuracy of the measuring device used to build the profile. In addition to an accurate monitor profile, the accuracy of a <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> system depends on the CMM (Color Management Module) utilized, the specified white point (color temperature) and, of course, how well the profile represents the device it is attempting to characterize. Results of colorimetric measurements using various emissive spectrophotometers are presented for CRT and LCD displays of controlled color patches in RGB, CMYK and Lab modes. The accuracy of these values, predicted from the profile versus measured, is highly dependent on the CMM employed. Surprisingly, the accuracy of the soft proof is highly dependent on the method used to display the soft proof. There are three different, a priori equivalent, and methods to display a soft proof using Photoshop. Only one of these gives colorimetric agreement with printed and Info Palette values. Care must be taken when interpreting displayed Lab or CMYK values. Differences between CRT and LCD monitors are discussed. A summary of unresolved issues and some recommendations for their resolution is presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>proofing</b> is an {{effective}} solution for clients and printers that decreases production cost and cycle time. However, print buyers are increasingly specifying brighter papers, which contain optical brightening agents (OBAs). One potential concern facing adopters of <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> systems is that they fail to consider the influence of OBA when rendering color images. Proofing systems are largely based on existing published specifications and their ICC profiles. These specifications and ICC profiles [...] such as SWOP 3 and GRACoL 2006 [...] do {{not account for the}} influence of OBA-loaded printing papers, and therefore could cause a mismatch between the soft proof and the final print. To improve the <b>soft</b> <b>proofing</b> performance, it is important to account for the influence of OBA in printed color and in <b>soft</b> <b>proofing.</b> This research project investigated the use of the substrate-corrected colorimetric aims (SCCA) as the source ICC profile to improve proofing color accuracy. By conducting psychometric experiments and analyzing with Chi-Square statistic, the research concludes that (a) OBA causes the mismatch between the default soft proof and the OBA-loaded print; (b) source ICC profiles, built from both a fully characterized dataset and an SCCA solution, can improve color match between the soft proof and the OBA-loaded print; and (c) color match between the soft proof and the print is image-dependent...|$|E

Considering how close they had seemed, this was strange. I halted and listened. Silence reigned supreme.

Then I turned my horse to get round the cliff and over the ridge. When I again stopped, all I could hear was the thumping of my heart and the labored panting of Satan. I came to a break in the cliff, a steep place of weathered rock, and I put Satan to it. He went up with a will. From the narrow saddle of the ridge-crest I tried to take my bearings. Below me slanted the green of pinyon, with the bleached treetops standing like spears, and uprising yellow stones. Fancying I heard a gunshot, I leaned a straining ear against the <b>soft</b> breeze. The <b>proof</b> came presently in the unmistakable report of Jones's blunderbuss. It was repeated almost instantly, giving reality to the direction, which was down the slope of what I concluded must be the third ravine.
