[...] After indignation broke out among both liberal and conservative defenders of women, Christopher confronted McCain on-camera at the CPAC conference in March 2011, seeking clarity. McCain conceded the point, explained why he had been skeptical of a widely publicized date-rape accusation (against Julian Assange) and repeated after Christopher: [...] "No means no; <b>stop</b> <b>means</b> stop." [...] Writing about this encounter, Christopher remarked that [...] "McCain still holds many opinions that I find objectionable, but I also think that video places the 'character' that is RS McCain into a context that simply reading him does not." ...|$|E

40|$|Both type 2 B {{and type}} 2 M von Willebrand disease result in {{bleeding}} disorders; however, whereas type 2 B has increased binding affinity between platelet glycoprotein Ibα and von Willebrand factor (vWF), type 2 M has decreased binding affinity {{between these two}} molecules. We used R 687 E type 2 B and G 561 S type 2 M vWF-A 1 mutations to study binding between flowing platelets and insolubilized vWF mutants. We measured rolling velocities, <b>mean</b> <b>stop</b> times, and <b>mean</b> go times at 37 °C using high-speed video microscopy. The rolling velocities for wt-wt interactions first decrease, reach a minimum, and then increase with increasing shear stress, indicating a catch-slip transition. By changing the viscosity, {{we were able to}} quantify the effects of force versus shear rate for rolling velocities and <b>mean</b> <b>stop</b> times. Platelet interactions with loss-of-function vWF-A 1 retain the catch-slip bond transition seen in wt-wt interactions, but at a higher shear stress compared with the wt-wt transition. The <b>mean</b> <b>stop</b> time for all vWF-A 1 molecules reveals catch-slip transitions at different shear stresses (gain-of-function vWF-A 1  < wt vWF-A 1 < loss-of-function vWF-A 1). The shift in the catch-slip transition may indicate changes in how the different mutants become conformationally active, indicating different mechanisms leading to similar bleeding characteristics...|$|R
