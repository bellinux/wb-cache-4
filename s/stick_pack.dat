40|$|Obesity Due to Poor Snack Choices and Lack of Physical Activity A chronic {{issue in}} my {{immediate}} community, Murray State University, is obesity due to unhealthy diets and a generally lethargic lifestyle. The muffin picture represents the average healthiness of snacks available on campus. While students are working towards their education on campus {{it has become}} increasingly difficult to acquire snacks that are both convenient and health conscious. Places such as the T-Room cater towards less healthy foods by making them far more available and also making them much less expensive. For a student to get a quick lunch consisting of a grilled cheese, fries, and soft drink the price is 8. 48 while if that same student wanted a ready-made cobb salad with turkey, a water, a sausage and cheese <b>stick</b> <b>pack,</b> and a fruit dip cup the price would cost 11. 36. Both of these meals are similar in their respective caloric densities but meal one has a far less healthy macro balance, being high in fats and carbs, and is also fried or cooked with a lot of butter. Furthermore, the amount of sugar in the soft drink has its own health implications as well. These factors lead to students putting on unhealthy weight and the unhealthy food also does not fuel the body well for physical activity. Leading on to my community asset I posted a picture of me in D. C. I work as a personal trainer at a local gym Downtown Dynabody and I have worked as a group fitness instructor at the MSU wellness center for a number of years. During my time a a fitness professional I have worked with many people to help change their views of what it takes to become fit, promote working towards a better version of themselves, and I have helped a few people reach fitness goals beyond what they believed possible. My job as personal trainer is to be 2 ̆ 2 team motivation 2 ̆ 2 as well as to listen to my clients, adapt their training to optimize its effectiveness, and to teach them how to so things properly. By doing my part working with the few clients I have, I am able to also influence those who come in contact with my clients. People see others in the community making healthy life changes to better their health, lose weight, and improve their body image and the idea that it is obtainable for them as well spreads like wild fire. Case based examples in the community as well as changing the community views of obesity are crucial in fighting this epidemic. To combat the obesity problem at MSU a two-part challenge is set before us. Both a physical aspect, stressing the importance of being more physically active, and the nutritional aspect, eating correctly and having healthy food available to busy students. Using community ambassadors, community based challenges, and using the assets at our disposal can help change the trend of the 2 ̆ 2 freshman 152 ̆ 2 or worse the 2 ̆ 2 sophomore 302 ̆ 2. With less unhealthy weight gain and a more balanced diet health risks associated with obesity as well as health issues students may currently have as well as those that may present in the future due to obesity, poor nutrition, or lack of exercise. Our country as a whole has a large population of people suffering from or at risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure; all of which can be reduced or completely resolved with a healthier diet, active lifestyle, and lower body fat. As with most things, education and understanding are the most important factors in making lifestyle changes towards a healthier life...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{polyethylene}} packaging (PEP) (in air) and vacuum packaging (VP) on the histamine related quality of milkfish sticks stored at different temperatures (− 20 °C, 4 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C) were studied. The {{results showed that}} the aerobic plate count (APC), pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), and histamine contents increased as storage time increased when the PEP and VP samples were stored at 25 °C. At below 15 °C, the APC, TVBN, pH, and histamine levels in PEP and VP samples were retarded, but the VP samples had considerably lower levels of APC, TVBN, and histamine than PEP samples. Once the frozen fish samples stored at − 20 °C for 2 months were thawed and stored at 25 °C, VP retarded the increase of histamine in milkfish sticks as compared to PEP. In summary, this result suggested the milkfish <b>sticks</b> <b>packed</b> with VP and stored below 4 °C could prevent deterioration of product quality and extend shelf-life...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of using mouthpiece nebulization and nasal swab <b>stick</b> <b>packing</b> for topical anesthesia in awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation. Material and Method: This was a prospective descriptive study of 30 patients with ASA I-II who underwent elective surgery and suspected of difficult intubation between March 2004 and June 2006. After 2 % lidocaine 5 ml was nebulizated in a micronebulizer using oxygen 10 L/min as a driving gas through a standard mouth-piece and 10 % cocaine 1 ml on cotton swab-stick was applied to the selected nostril for 15 min, fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was done while the patient was awake. If the patient had severe gag or cough reflex, 1 % lidocaine 5 ml per each time could be injected through the working channel of the fiberoptic broncho-scope. The descriptive statistics were calculated by using SPSS version 11. 0. Results: The success rate of awake fiberoptic nasotracheal was 100 %. The mean duration of awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was 119. 0 + 76. 8 sec. The responses of the patient to instrumentation during 4 periods, i. e. : passing the endotracheal tube into the nose, passing the bronchoscope into the pharynx-larynx, passing the bronchoscope into the trachea-carina and passing the endotracheal tube into the trachea were, as follows: no response in about 53. 3 %, 63. 3 %, 23. 3 %,and 13. 3 %; mild pain or reflex in about 46. 7 %, 10 %, 70 %, and 86. 7 %; moderate pain or reflex in about 0 %, 3. 3 %, 6. 7 %, and 0 %; and severe pain or refle...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{supercritical}} technology is {{proposed to improve}} the classical emulsification/diffusion technology for lipid nanoparticles (LNs) production. The process {{is based on the}} emulsion diffusion method improved by the addition of a continuous supercritical fluid processing step to eliminate the organic solvent from the nanosuspension obtained. Different emulsion/diffusion formulations for stearic acid nanoparticles production were tested and, then, processed by supercritical continuous extraction at 80 bar and 45 C (liquid/gas ratio of 0. 1) in a packed column, obtaining an efficient benzyl alcohol elimination. Solvent residues less than 100 ppm were measured. Stearic acid nanoparticles were not extracted or damaged by the supercritical processing step, did not <b>stick</b> on the <b>packing</b> elements and showed mean diameters of 30 - 50 nm; a value of one order of magnitude smaller than the ones obtained by the conventional emulsion/diffusion technology with a recovery efficiency of 100 %. Indeed, the fast and complete elimination of the benzyl alcohol around the nanoparticles reduced the aggregation phenomena responsible of larger lipid particle sizes obtainable by traditional process. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Based on {{national}} reports from Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway, describing the school meal systems {{and to which}} extent organic food is integrated there, this report identifies differences between the four countries and experiences made with organic food procurement and the dissemination of organic ingredients in school meals. Such knowledge will help to understand the possibilities and restrictions for increasing organic food in school meal systems, and to reveal the room of manoeuvre for public organic food procurement for youth in each country. In the report, similarities and differences of the national school meal systems in general are first discussed, because this context determines the scope of organic food procurement. The history and current situation of the school meal systems, framework conditions of public food procurement in schools (laws, guidelines, control, financing), {{the structure of the}} school meal provision and public discourses about school meals are described. Next, focus is set on the use and development of organic food in school meal systems. Some school meal system cases are presented by the amount of organic food used, the arguments for organic school food and challenges and barriers for the dissemination of organic food. Finally, school meal system actors in general as well as “organic” actors such as promoters, decision makers, companies and organisations are compared across the four countries. Summarizing chapters are found {{at the end of each}} section of the report. In short, warm meals are served for free to all pupils daily in Finland, and subsidized according to family income to all pupils at least twice a week in Italy. Norway and Denmark <b>stick</b> to a <b>packed</b> lunch brought from home, with additional milk and fruit subscription schemes and a developing additional or complementary meal service especially in Denmark with subsidized prices.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of risks versus benefits from new products should be encouraged, even {{when dealing with}} agents which may cause cancer or malformations in laboratory animals, because {{there is evidence that}} safety thresholds exist even for such exposures. However, {{it is not easy to}} describe risk and benefit in comparable terms when they may involve generations to come and events in the future. Risk versus benefit analysis regarding the exposure of man and his environment to new chemical, physical, or. biological agents resulting from altered or new technological developments, has become a familiar phrase. It has been on the minds of scientists, public health officials or administrators, but has not resulted in technical or conceptual clarification regarding the requirements for satisfactory analysis. Different points of view on benefits to society and on willingness to take calculated risks can be heard. Individuals may be willing to take risks and enjoy the realization of having taken risks-in driving cars, flying planes, participating in certain sports, or by <b>sticking</b> to their <b>pack</b> of cigarettes a day. Taking risks with the health of the unsuspecting public, however, is quite a different matter. The risks we shall deal with here are of the latter type, and it is up to those entrusted with safeguarding the public health to make risk/ benefit evaluations for society and the environment on the basis of information available to them. Usually such information on potential hazards of newly developed products or substances is fragmentary and woefully inadequate. It is not only a matter of research funds or time until "complete safety evaluations " will be forthcoming but a profound question of how far such safety determinations can be attempted even with all the ingenuity of science at its disposal...|$|R
40|$|Meat {{is a major}} {{component}} of the diet of an American. However, humans do not consume one-third to one-half of each animal raised for their needs. The leftover materials are subjected to processing in the meat rendering industry. The rendering industry turns the waste material into value added ingredients. During the rendering process, air pollutants are released. These air pollutants are odor nuisances in residential areas around rendering plants. These pollutants can be controlled by the use of multistage packed towers. The packed columns used by the rendering industry are distinctive because of the addition of animal fat in the air stream. The fat can agglomerate on the packing and clog the towers. To prevent this, operates introduce a surfactant into the liquid stream for the system. The surfactant serves two roles: suspend the fat in the packed tower so that it does not <b>stick</b> to the <b>packing</b> and clog the system and coat the packing to enhance mass transfer by allowing for the creation of an even water film over the packing. HydroSolution is located in Louisville, KY and specializes in serving the rendering industries. The company makes a treatment that is added to the air scrubber, which removes air pollutants from the airstream. The air scrubber system consists of a venturi connected to two packed towers in series. The company is interested in increasing the efficiency of the packed towers and reducing the amount of fat accumulation in the system. In addition, they would like to switch to an ecofriendly surfactant. To achieve their goals, a “green” surfactant was found that has the ability to replace the current one and the concentration needed to coat adequately the packing been determined. A contact angle analyzer was used to determine extent of water coating by the calculation of the contact angle between the water droplet and the packing. A result of this test showed the soak time for the polyethylene (PE) packing was critical for a hydrophilic layer to form whereas multiple alternating layers cab apparently form on polypropylene (PP). Better performance can be obtained using PE since the ultimate contact angle is lower than the PP packing which leads to a greater degree of wetting. A sonic dismembrator was utilized to suspend animal fat of the correct size in a surfactant solution; and a particle size analyzer calculated the diameter of the particles in the solution. A force balance on the particle diameter entering the packed tower at 500 - 600 nm determined the size. Any particles larger than 600 nm would fall out of suspension while smaller ones would remain and be transferred through the system. Once the equipment settings able to produce the proper size particles were found, the surfactant concentration needed to suspend fat was estimated. These results showed that more surfactant is needed to sufficiently coat the packing than to suspend fat. To increase the efficiency of the packed towers and reduce the probability of clogging, it is recommended that HydroSolutions switch to 70 ppm Bio-Soft GSB- 9. This concentration is able to coat packing as well as 60 ppm Triton X- 100 and suspend 3 % animal fat...|$|R
