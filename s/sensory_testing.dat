Our scientific understanding of pain among individuals with developmental delays and disabilities with associated intellectual, motor, and/or communicative impairments is limited {{because of the}} difficulty in reliably and validly assessing a complex experience when verbal self-report is compromised. One approach is to rely on non-verbal pain behaviors. There has been no work comparing non-verbal pain behavior of very young children with global developmental delays with age and gender matched typically developing children. This study used a calibrated tactile <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> to provide a mechanisms-based approach to indirectly compare the functionality of the somatosensory pathways in children with and without global developmental delay (GDD). A case control design was used to test the reactivity of 20 children with GDD (60 % male; M age = 4. 91 years, SD= 1. 13) and 20 typically developing children (60 % male; M age = 3. 49 years, SD= 1. 08). Sensory reactivity was indexed by vocal, facial, and body activity during the <b>sensory</b> <b>test.</b> This sample of children with GDD exhibited significantly greater duration of overall reactivity during the <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> (p<. 01) and specifically exhibited greater vocal (p<. 01) and body (p<. 05) reactivity compared to controls. For children with GDD, severity of self-injurious behavior significantly correlated with vocal (r=. 58, p=. 01) and body (r=. 56, p<. 05) reactivity during the pin prick trial. Children with GDD who were more reactive to the <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> had significantly reduced epidermal nerve fiber densities (p<. 05). This study was the first to measure the behavioral response of children with GDD to a calibrated <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> and in comparison to a typically developing control group. The results of the study provide information about the physiology and nociceptive pathways of children with GDD. Despite limitations in verbal self-report, children with GDD exhibited non-verbal pain behaviors to signal their reactivity to a calibrated <b>sensory</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

MethodsThe study was conducted on 100 hands with symptoms and signs suggestive of CTS and 100 non-CTS hands as the control group. All were subjected to routine median motor nerve conduction study with stimulation at midpalm, wrist and elbow, median-versus-radial sensory comparison study and Second lumbrical-versus-interosseus (2 L-INT) motor comparison study. ResultsThe results showed that the most sensitive tests were the median-radial <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> and the 2 LINT test and that both were correlated suggesting that the motor fibers of the median nerve can be compressed as early as sensory fibers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{physicochemical}} properties of TA ointments and conduct a human <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> to assess the properties of those ointments. Physicochemical assessment was done via near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, measurement of water content, microscopy, and measurement of viscoelasticity. The human <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> examined 5 aspects (texture, cohesiveness, spreadability, smell, and feel). Three TA ointments were used: TA-A, a brand-name preparation, and TA-B and TA-C, two generics. The <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> revealed significant differences between TA-A and TA-B and TA-C in terms of cohesiveness and spreadability. Significant differences between TA-A and TA-C and between TA-B and TA-C in terms of feel were noted. Microscopic examination revealed that TA-C had good dispersibility while TA-A and TA-B produced crystallization. NIR spectroscopy revealed differences in absorption spectra attributed to oil and water content in TAA, TA-B, and TA-C. Measurement of water content indicated water content of 0. 06 ± 0. 02 % for TA-A, 0. 08 ± 0. 08 % for TA-B, and 36. 7 ± 1. 19 % for TA-C. Assessment of viscoelasticity indicated that stress decreased for all 3 ointments at 35 [*]°C compared to that at 25 [*]°C. TA-A and TA-B were found to have a higher percent decrease in stress than was TA-C. These findings indicate that differences in the types and content of additives caused differences in the physicochemical properties of individual ointments. In addition, differences in physicochemical properties presumably resulted in the close correlation between cohesiveness and spreadability in the <b>sensory</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|Childhood obesity may be {{responsible}} for a major alteration of life quality in children and in future adults. The causes of obesity are multiple and obesity results from a chronic imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure. The challenge is to understand the cause of this imbalance. In this context, this study aimed at evaluating the contribution of the attraction toward salty, sweet and fatty foods. Thus, the first aim {{of this study was to}} establish a tool to assess children’s attraction toward sweet, salty and fatty foods that could be used later in large-scale cohorts. The second objective was to compare this questionnaire to <b>sensory</b> <b>tests</b> measuring the overall liking for sweet, salt and fat applied to the same subjects. Both tools have been initially developed in adults and were then adapted to the child population (age 7 - 10 y). The third objective was to compare results between children and adults. The initial questionnaire was revised by replacing some foods not adapted for children by others, and by adding pictures of foods and detailed instructions. The questionnaire included 83 items (sweet, 21; salt, 11; fat-sweet, 20; fat-salt, 31) scattered into: liking towards foods, preferred level of seasoning, preferred drinks in a menu and behavior-related questions. The <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> included 14 sets of food models (sweet, 4; salt, 4; fat, 6), each with each featuring 5 grading levels of sweetness, saltiness or fattiness. Within each set, the samples were tasted in a random order and rated on a hedonic scale. The study included 123 children. The <b>sensory</b> <b>test</b> was divided in 3 sessions. Then, children filled in the questionnaire at home. For the questionnaire, scores of attraction toward sweet, salty or fatty foods were computed. For the <b>sensory</b> <b>tests,</b> an optimum level of sweetness, saltiness or fattiness was calculated for each food model and then average for each sensation. Children’s optima of liking (sensory) for sweet and salt were higher than for adults. Attraction (questionnaire) for fat and to a lesser extent for sweet was also higher for children than for adults. Scores from the questionnaire and from the <b>sensory</b> <b>tests</b> were correlated for salt (r= 0. 33, P= 0. 001) and fat (r= 0. 34, P= 0. 0005).
