5|$|Interferometric <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (InSAR) is a radar {{technique}} used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar {{images of a}} geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is closely}} {{monitored}} by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, {{a combination of a}} GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E
5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar & Inverse <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar: the DRDO's LRDE is {{currently}} working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as UAV applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships are}} also {{equipped}} with a Thales Underwater Systems towed <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar.|$|E
25|$|MQ-1A Predator: Early {{airframes}} {{capable of}} carrying ordnance (AGM-114 Hellfire ATGM or AIM-92 Stinger). Nose-mounted AN/ZPQ-1 <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar removed.|$|E
25|$|Around September 2009 {{the first}} flight of a Falco UAV {{carrying}} a high resolution AESA <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) sensor payload, called PicoSAR, was made.|$|E
25|$|A NASA Gulfstream C-20B (83-0502 cn 389) {{has been}} {{fitted with a}} {{centerline}} pylon {{to allow it to}} carry the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (UAVSAR) pod.|$|E
25|$|For example, a structured-light 3D scanner, a thermographic camera, a hyperspectral imager, radar imaging, a lidar scanner, a {{magnetic}} resonance image, a side-scan sonar, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar, or etc.|$|E
25|$|The Predator air {{vehicle and}} sensors are {{controlled}} {{from the ground}} station via a C-band line-of-sight data link or a Ku-band satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture thermographic camera (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar produced still frame radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar, if equipped.|$|E
25|$|Indian Space Research Organisation said {{interesting}} data on lunar polar areas {{was provided}} by Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI) and High Energy X-ray Spectrometer (HEX) of ISRO as well as Miniature <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (Mini-SAR) of the USA.|$|E
25|$|The APG-77v1 was {{installed}} on F-22 Raptors from Lot 5 and on. This provided full air-to-ground functionality (high-resolution <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar mapping, ground moving target indication and track (GMTI/GMTT), automatic cueing and recognition, combat identification, {{and many other}} advanced features).|$|E
25|$|Side looking {{airborne}} radar (SLAR) {{made it possible}} to acquire images regardless of weather conditions. On November 4, 1995, Canada launched RADARSAT-1. Developed by the Canadian Space Agency, it provides images of Earth for scientific and commercial purposes. This system was the first to use <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR), which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs. The European Space Agency launched ENVISAT (an observation satellite that orbits the Earth's poles) on March 1, 2002. ENVISAT employs advanced <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (ASAR) technology, which can detect changes in surface height accurately. The Canadian Space Agency launched RADARSAT-2 in December 2007, which uses SAR and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as RADARSAT-1.|$|E
25|$|EL/M-2070 TecSAR, {{also known}} as TechSAR, Polaris and Ofek-8, is an Israeli {{reconnaissance}} satellite, equipped with <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar developed by Elta Systems. It was successfully launched at 03:45 GMT (09:15 local time) on 21 January 2008, by PSLV C-10 Launch Vehicle, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in India.|$|E
25|$|Deformation sensing: Satellite-borne spatial radar {{data can}} be used to detect {{long-term}} geometric changes in the volcanic edifice, such as uplift and depression. In this method, interferometric <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (InSAR), digital elevation models generated from radar imagery are subtracted from each other to yield a differential image, displaying rates of topographic change.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Boeing {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} U.S. Air Force's Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS fleet with a modified P-8 at the same cost Northrop Grumman proposed for re-engining and upgrading the E-8s. The proposed P-8 Airborne Ground Surveillance (AGS) would integrate an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar, and have ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) capabilities.|$|E
25|$|At the International Astronautical Congress 2014 at Toronto, ISRO {{chairman}} K. Radhakrishnan and NASA administrator Charles Bolden signed two documents. One was {{regarding the}} 2020 {{launch of a}} NASA-ISRO <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (NISAR) satellite mission to make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes. The other was to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore Mars.|$|E
25|$|It {{is capable}} of imaging with a {{resolution}} of up to 10 centimetres, through an X-band radar system. The satellite's maximum resolution {{is believed to be}} around 1 metre. TecSAR is the first Israeli satellite to feature <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar, or SAR, which will provide images day or night and under all weather conditions. The satellite is being operated by Israel Aerospace Industries.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} digital {{computing}} made simple analog computers obsolete {{as early as}} the 1950s and 1960s, although analog computers remained in use in some specific applications, like the flight computer in aircraft, and for teaching control systems in universities. More complex applications, such as <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar, remained the domain of analog computing well into the 1980s, since digital computers were insufficient for the task.|$|E
25|$|ISRO {{currently}} operates two Radar Imaging Satellites. RISAT-1 {{was launched}} from Sriharikota Spaceport on 26 April 2012 {{on board a}} PSLV. RISAT-1 carries a C-band <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar (SAR) payload, operating in a multi-polarisation and multi-resolution mode and can provide images with coarse, fine and high spatial resolutions. India also operates RISAT-2, which was launched in 2009 and acquired from Israel at a cost $110million.|$|E
25|$|Examination of {{possible}} end-of-flight scenarios indicate the aircraft may be located relatively {{close to the}} seventh BTO arc. On account of this, the underwater search began at the seventh BTO arc and has progressed outwards. Towed underwater vehicles equipped with <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar, side scan sonar, and multi-beam echo sounders are towed close to the seafloor to create a three-dimensional picture of the seafloor topography.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, India {{successfully}} launched RISAT-2, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar imaging satellite. RISAT-2 was {{manufactured by}} Israel Aerospace Industries, or IAI, {{in conjunction with}} ISRO. The launch of the RISAT-2 satellite aimed to provide India with greater earth observation power, which would improve disaster management, and increase surveillance and defense capabilities. The acquisition and subsequent launch of the RISAT-2 satellite was accelerated after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, to boost India's future surveillance capabilities.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Israel {{decided to}} launch TecSAR, its first <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar imaging satellite, on India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV. TecSAR {{was chosen to}} launch through India's PSLV due to Israeli {{concerns}} about the reliability and technical limitations of its own Shavit space launch vehicle, economic considerations, and also due to Israel's desire to increase strategic cooperation with India. In 2008, TecSAR was successfully inserted into orbit by India's PSLV. One of TecSAR's primary functions is to monitor Iran's military activities.|$|E
25|$|Cassinis {{instrumentation}} consisted of: a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar mapper, a {{charge-coupled device}} imaging system, a visible/infrared mapping spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a cosmic dust analyzer, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a magnetospheric imaging instrument, a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications antenna {{and other special}} transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.|$|E
25|$|The F-15S is {{a variant}} of the F-15E {{supplied}} to the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) in the 1990s. Saudi Arabia previously sought to buy up to 24 F-15Fs, a proposed single-seat variant, but was blocked by the U.S. Congress. The F-15S, initially referred to as F-15XP, is almost identical to the USAF F-15E, the only major difference in the AN/APG-70 radar's performance in <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> mode. 72 were built from 1996 to 1998. In October 2007, GE announced a US$300million contract with Saudi Arabia for 65 GE F110-GE-129C engines for the F-15S.|$|E
25|$|It was decided, {{in light}} of the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, to equip the B-2 for conventional precision attacks {{as well as for the}} strategic role of nuclear-strike. The B-2 features a sophisticated GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) that uses the aircraft's APQ-181 <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar to map out targets prior to deployment of GPS-aided bombs (GAMs), later superseded by the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). In the B-2's original configuration, up to 16 GAMs or JDAMs could be deployed; an upgrade program in 2004 raised the maximum carriable capacity to 80 JDAMs.|$|E
25|$|USA 193, {{also known}} as NRO launch 21 (NROL-21 or simply L-21), was an American {{military}} reconnaissance satellite launched on December 14, 2006. The USA-193 was owned by the NRO and its precise function and purpose are classified. However, several websites speculate that the satellite was probably a high resolution radar satellite intended to produce images for the NRO. This argument is additionally supported {{by the fact that}} the satellite used a similar inclination to that of a Lacrosse Radar Satellite. Lacrosse is a terrestrial radar imaging reconnaissance satellite operated by the NRO. It utilizes a <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) to acquire high resolution images regardless of cloud cover.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 2009, Thales {{announced}} that the Defence Science and Technology Agency of Singapore awarded it as the prime contractor for the Bedok-class Life Extension Programme. Thales will provide an integrated mine countermeasure combat system, including the mine information system, a hull-mounted sonar, a towed <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> sonar and expendable mine disposal systems. The towed synthetic sonar array is the DUBM 44, an unmanned underwater vehicle that uses onboard processing of digital signals to provide high-resolution imagery. The DUBM 44 is not autonomous and is connected by cable to the surface ship. Thales will also {{be in charge of}} making any structural alterations to the vessels in relation to the integration of new systems and equipment.|$|E
25|$|Mini-SAR, designed, {{built and}} tested for NASA {{by a large}} team that {{includes}} the Naval Air Warfare Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, with outer support from ISRO. Mini-SAR is the active <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar system to search for lunar polar ice, water-ice. The instrument transmitted right polarised radiation with a frequency of 2.5GHz and monitored scattered left and right polarised radiation. The Fresnel reflectivity and the circular polarisation ratio (CPR) are the key parameters deduced from these measurements. Ice shows the Coherent Backscatter Opposition Effect which results in an enhancement of reflections and CPR, so that water content of the Moon's polar regions can be estimated.|$|E
25|$|The F/A-18C and D {{models are}} the result of a block upgrade in 1987 {{incorporating}} upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile and AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Other upgrades include the Martin-Baker NACES (Navy Aircrew Common Ejection Seat), and a self-protection jammer. A <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> ground mapping radar enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, the Loral AN/AAS-38 NITE Hawk FLIR (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) multi-function display (MFDs) and a color moving map.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia {{announced}} in July {{that they had}} contracted with state-run oil company Petronas to supply a team {{to participate in the}} search. Petronas, in turn, has contracted the vessel GO Phoenix—owned by Australian company GO Marine Group—and the marine exploration firm Phoenix International, who will supply experts and equipment. Phoenix recovered black boxes from several recent undersea aircraft wrecks: Air France Flight 447, Yemenia Flight 626, Adam Air Flight 574, and Tuninter Flight 1153. Phoenix planned to use the SLH ProSAS-60 towed <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> side scan sonar system (rated to 6,000m depth) to produce a high-resolution image of the ocean floor. On 6August, Australia, Malaysia, and China jointly announced that Fugro had been awarded a contract to conduct this latest phase of the search.|$|E
25|$|The Tu-154M and Tu-154M Lux are {{the most}} highly {{upgraded}} versions, which first flew in 1982 and entered mass production in 1984. It uses more fuel-efficient Soloviev D-30KU-154 turbofans. Together with significant aerodynamic refinement, this led to much lower fuel consumption and therefore longer range, as well as lower operating costs. The aircraft has new double-slotted (instead of triple-slotted) flaps, with an extra 36-degree position (in addition to existing 15, 28 and 45-degree positions on older versions), which allows reduction of noise on approach. It also has a relocated auxiliary power unit and numerous other improvements. Maximum takeoff weight increased first to 100,000 kg (220,462 lb), then to 102,000 kg (224,872 lb). Some aircraft are certified to 104,000 kg (229,281 lb). About 320 were manufactured. Mass production ended in 2006, though limited manufacturing continued as of January 2009. No new airframes have been built since the early 1990s, and production since then involved assembling aircraft from components on hand. Chinese Tu-154MD electronic intelligence aircraft carry a large-size <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) under their mainframe.|$|E
500|$|The B-1 {{has been}} {{upgraded}} since production, {{beginning with the}} [...] "Conventional Mission Upgrade Program" [...] (CMUP), which added a new MIL-STD-1760 smart-weapons interface to enable the use of precision-guided conventional weapons. CMUP began with Block A, which was the standard B-1B with the capability to deliver non-precision gravity bombs. Block B brought an improved <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> Radar, and upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995. Block C provided an [...] "enhanced capability" [...] for delivery of up to 30 cluster bomb units (CBUs) per sortie with modifications made to 50 bomb racks.|$|E
500|$|The B-1's main {{computer}} is the IBM AP-101, {{which is also}} used on the Space Shuttle orbiter and the B-52 bomber. [...] The {{computer is}} programmed with the JOVIAL programming language. [...] The Lancer's offensive avionics include the Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) AN/APQ-164 forward-looking offensive passive electronically scanned array radar set with electronic beam steering (and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability), <b>synthetic</b> <b>aperture</b> radar, ground moving target indication (GMTI), and terrain-following radar modes, Doppler navigation, radar altimeter, and an inertial navigation suite. The B-1B Block D upgrade added a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver beginning in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that CryoSat-2 would be built the CRYOVEX programme was extended. Experiments were conducted in Antarctica to determine how [...] snow could affect its readings, and to provide data for calibrating the satellite. In January 2007 the European Space Agency issued a request for proposals for further calibration and validation experiments. Further CryoVEx experiments were conducted on Svalbard in 2007, followed by a final expedition to Greenland and the Devon Ice Cap in 2008. Additional snow measurements were provided by the Arctic Arc Expedition, and the Alfred Wegener Institute's [...] Airborne <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Aperture</b> and Interferometric Radar Altimeter System (ASIRAS) instrument, mounted aboard a Dornier Do 228 aircraft.|$|E
