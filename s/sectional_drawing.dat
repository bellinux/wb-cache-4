5000|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I increased the urgency to devise an effective torpedo defense system (TDS), thus the British Director of Naval Construction introduced the anti-torpedo bulge. Originally retrofitted to older ships, this was soon added to ships already under construction. In 1915, the British s and in 1917 American s introduced anti-torpedo bulges. Most later capital ships would {{have at least}} one torpedo bulkhead inboard of the external hull plating along the area of the ship protected by the armour belt. Most Battleships built after World War I had sophisticated and complex side-protection systems, as illustrated by the cross <b>sectional</b> <b>drawing</b> of [...] and [...]|$|E

60|$|The fruit {{somewhat}} resembles {{in magnitude}} and general appearance {{one of our}} citron melons of ordinary size; but, unlike the citron, it has no <b>sectional</b> lines <b>drawn</b> along the outside. Its surface is dotted all over with little conical prominences, looking not unlike the knobs on an antiquated church door. The rind is perhaps an eighth of an inch in thickness; and denuded of this, {{at the time when}} it is in the greatest perfection, the fruit presents a beautiful globe of white pulp, the whole of which may be eaten, {{with the exception of a}} slender core, which is easily removed.|$|R

40|$|The {{title of}} my thesis is The Skinny House, a phrase which might indicate: 1) The {{body of a}} human or other animal, 2) A coffin or grave, and 3) A {{residence}} in Mamaroneck, New York built of recycled materials (e. g. railroad ties and a chicken coop) by an African-American carpenter named Nathan T. Seely in 1932. Seely and his brother ran a business that thrived for several {{years prior to the}} Great Depression, catering specifically to Southern blacks moving north. While only a few pages of my thesis are directly concerned with the Mamaroneck residence and its social implications, I was intrigued by this ten-foot wide house on a narrow lot which was a gift from one friend (an Italian-American neighbor to whom Seely had originally sold the plot of land on which the home is built) to another down on his luck (Seely). The phenomenon of the “skinny house” is also associated with an architectural phenomenon spiritually antithetical to Seely’s gift—the “spite house,” a home built primarily to obstruct another property, prevent construction in a given neighborhood, or more generally to inconvenience and offend a neighbor. What else do skinny houses and spite houses have to do with my poems? Before pursuing my Master’s degree, I worked as a marketing manager at an architecture firm. I have always been fascinated by how buildings and landscapes are intertwined with people’s inner lives—even more so now that I am raising a child abroad. Audre Lorde said, “We can train ourselves to respect our feelings and to transpose them into a language so they can be shared. And where that language does not yet exist, it is our poetry which helps to fashion it. Poetry is not only dream and vision; it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. ” “Skeleton architecture” suggests the bones of an architectural or animal body—that framework without which the structure will not stand but which is only apparent when revealed by 1) an artist’s rendering—i. e. a <b>sectional</b> <b>drawing</b> or floor plan—or 2) the destruction, or gradual decay of said structure with the passage of time. These two possible forms of revelation tell me that art is a labor of both construction and salvage. Salvage in art is honoring the small, momentary, else neglected objects and perceptions in the world (to include the writings of others). One must honor particularly that which resists interpretation, which remains itself and not (or not any longer) part of a system. As George Oppen slightly misquotes Charles Reznikoff: “The girder, still itself among the rubble. ” As Hannah Arendt has written of Walter Benjamin (the lover of verbal scraps, debris, and the past for its own sake), “For him the size of an object was in inverse ratio to its significance. ” Benjamin himself wrote, “What seems paradoxical about everything that is justly called beautiful {{is the fact that it}} appears. ” The poet is tasked with recording not only beauty, but also the phenomenon of its appearance, the change that it makes in the world and the poet. An architect friend said to me, “When I was young I thought the aim of architecture was beauty, poetry, sculpture. Now I realize the most important thing is that it doesn’t leak. ” While I attempt to seal the leaks in my verse, to make solid musical and intellectual constructions, I do not mask or shelter the core of a poem—whether it is emotionally warm and dry, or cold and wet. A poem is also what Philip Whalen called “a picture or graph of a mind moving. ” If “recollected in tranquility” (Wordsworth), that graph nonetheless records the seismic spikes of rage and fear; at times it mimes the lull of workaday heartbreak and regret. My poems are bound to the weather in the mountains and the desert, the oceans and the rivers, the factories and the graveyards of the places where I was raised and where I have passed the seasons—I hope you will hear them...|$|E
40|$|Due to an {{increase}} in diagnosis and prescription of methylphenidate and other ADD/ADHD medications, concerns have been expressed over the rise in Ritalin diversion from prescription to nonmedical use. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationships between the dimensions of self-perception (i. e., Impulse Control, Body Image, Mastery of the External World, Worry Control) self-enhancement, environmental and demographic factors, and non-prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate) use. This cross <b>sectional</b> study <b>draws</b> on secondary data from the Adolescent Health Risk Behaviors Survey (AHRBS). The secondary data from AHRBS were analyzed using a sample size of n= 1992 and a sub-sample size of n= 79. Subjects completed questions pertaining to the dimensions of self-perception, self-enhancement, and demographic factors. The results of this study reveal that females who have worse Body Image, and compare their exams to their previous exams are on average more likely to use non-prescribed Ritalin. As a result, researchers in this area may want to focus on self-perception and self-enhancement in order to better understand illicit drug use. Future research should explore the difference between experimentation vs. regular users and how to incorporate this into effective and efficient drug prevention programs...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{growth rate}} of Indonesian infants beyond six months of age declines {{compared}} with that of the international reference population. Objective This study aimed to describe the pattern of nutritional status among breastfed children and their intake of energy, pro- tein, and zinc from complementary foods in Purworejo District, Cen- tral Java, Indonesia. Methods The study was a cross <b>sectional</b> survey <b>drawing</b> breastfed children under 24 months old from a well-defined population. Chil- dren with a history of prematurity or low birth weight were excluded. Anthropometrical measurements were collected. Intake of comple- mentary food was assessed using 24 -hour recall. Analysis of nu- tritional intake was only performed in 11 - 23 month-old children. Results Of 577 children enrolled, the prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting were 8. 1 %, 8. 8 %, and 4. 6 %, respectively. The prevalence of undernutrition increased with age. There was no association between frequency of breastfeeding during 24 hours in the second year of life and the nutritional status. The average intake of energy, protein, and zinc from complementary foods was very low i. e., 30 %, 45 %, and 5 % of the Indonesian recommended dietary allowance (RDA), respectively. Conclusion The prevalence of undernutrition in breastfed chil- dren increases with age. The breastfed children beyond 11 months of age in Purworejo District need sufficient density of nutrients from complementary foods...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the comparison for two different economies; rural Malawi and rural Pakistan by using cross <b>sectional</b> data <b>drawn</b> from ‘MDICP’ and ‘PSLM’ {{for the year}} 2007 - 08. The mainobjective {{of the study is}} to analyze the factors that determine the female behavior towards employment during their child-bearing age (15 - 45). We also extend our analysis toward womenparticipation on-farm and off-farm economic activities. The Probit model is used {{to examine the effects of}} various personal demographic along with social demographic determinants on femaleparticipation in economic activities. The focus of the study is to analyze that how these factors determine the women decision to participate on-farm or off-farm economic activities for bothcountries under consideration. The main findings of the study show that these demographic and individual characteristics influence women participation in both countries. The coefficient of age is positive and significant for female decision to participate in economic activity for bothcountries. The Study’s findings indicate that wealth has a negative influence on female decision to work either on-farm or off-farm activity in Pakistan. All the coefficients of education positively influence the Malawian women participation in any economic activity while in case of Pakistan results indicate that a rise in education level beyond secondary level of education increased the probability of females to active in labor market whereas less educated females are discouraged from entering in labor market. Married Malawian women are economically more active though the case is opposite for Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversations in}} this volume {{about the role of}} {{knowledge}} in strategy management may be framed by seven basic questions: 1. What unique perspective does a knowledge-based view of the firm offer? 2. Should the organization focus on creating new knowledge or applying what it already knows? 3. How does an organization create new knowledge? 4. What knowledge should the firm share and transfer, and what knowledge should the firm protect? 5. Is a knowledge-based strategy the product of careful planning, or the outcome of learning and discovery? 6. What is the difference between managing knowledge and managing intellectual capi-tal? 7. What are the main levers for designing a knowledge-based strategy? Most of the chapters in this book directly or in-directly address these questions. We searched for concepts that would increase our understanding, in two iterations. Below we first review the main ideas presented by contributors in each of the seven parts of the book, highlighting {{the ways in which they}} connect with or differ from each other. After these <b>sectional</b> reviews, we <b>draw</b> upon the principal themes presented by the con-tributors in an attempt to answer the questions raised above. We conclude this introductory chapter with a framework that brings together the major elements in our discussions about strategic knowledge management...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 9206687 V - Master of Public Health {{research}} report - School of Public Health - Faculty of Health SciencesWhen the South African government decided {{to implement the}} roll out of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in public health facilities, {{as part of its}} HIV/AIDS care and treatment plan, there was concern about the capacity of the country’s health care system, to deliver the service efficiently and equitably. The study was deemed necessary, due to that the South African government requires information and feedback on the state of its health care system to provide ARVs in public health facilities. The study will add to the growing body of knowledge on the status of the ARV programme and therefore assist in the improvement of the efficiency and efficacy of the services. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct a rapid appraisal of the status of roll out of the ARVs in facilities that had begun offering the service and the readiness of facilities that were planning to roll out, in the Gauteng Province. Focus was on the capacity of these facilities to provide the ARV services, as outlined by the Provincial Department of Health. It is a descriptive cross- <b>sectional</b> study, <b>drawing</b> on qualitative methods such as thematic analysis, document review and a facility checklist. A sample was determined by purposely selecting participants who were involved in the ARV programme. Participants included facility managers, doctors and nurses from the study facilities, regional managers and representatives from non-profit organisations. Perspectives about the roll out were drawn from in-depth interviews from 27 participants, including document reviews and a facility checklist. The study highlighted the fact that the ARV programme is implemented within a health care system that is experiencing weaknesses and bottleneck problems in the following facets: human resources, training, referral systems, management and monitoring and evaluation systems. Findings indicated that the core weaknesses and constraints in the implementation of ARVs are systemic and hence will require intervention at a systemic level. It is recommended that the Department of Health improve the recruitment and retaining of health professionals, improve training and training structures, improve communication channels and support systems, provide skills to local government, managers and improve monitoring and evaluation systems...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, women have become {{important}} {{participants in the}} labor market. With {{the increase in the}} number of middle-aged women going through the menopause transition, the question arises as to the effect of this transition on the labor market. Previous studies have shown that reproductive cycles have a non-trivial negative effect on women’s labor market outcomes. Thus, the cessation of these reproductive cycles (menopause) should bring relief for these women. However, another body of literature asserts that the menopause transition itself has a negative effect on women’s mental and physical health and so may have a negative effect on labor market outcomes. This study seeks to explore the effect of the menopause transition on labor market outcomes. The empirical analyses are done using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, with the key explanatory variables being the menopause transition stages: premenopause, perimenopause, surgical menopause and natural postmenopause. The regressions include a control for whether the woman experienced early menopause and whether she had a hysterectomy. The first part of the study examines the impact of the menopause transition on health using depression and the scores on the activities of daily living as the measures of health status. These analyses use cross <b>sectional</b> data <b>drawn</b> from the 1995 wave of the survey for activity limitations and the 2003 wave for the depression measure. The findings of these analyses indicate that the menopause transition increases the likelihood of depression and functional limitations. The main part of the study explores the effect of the menopause transition on the following labor market outcomes: labor force participation, hours worked, full time employment, wages, and self-employment. Ordinary Least Squares, the fixed effects model, the random effects model, and the family fixed effects (siblings) model are used to examine these questions. The analysis also uses 2 SLS to correct for endogeneity of the menopause variables and the Heckman two-step procedure to correct for sample selection bias. The findings show that women in premenopause are less likely to be in the labor force than women in natural postmenopause, even after controlling for life-cycle variables. The results also indicate that there are certain benefits from using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), as women who had surgical menopause and are using hormones are more likely to be in the labor force than women with surgical menopause who are not using HRT. Women in premenopause and women in perimenopause are less likely to work full-time compared to women who experienced natural postmenopause. The findings also show that there are no significant differences in hours worked by women in the different menopause stages. Women in premenopause typically earn more than women in natural postmenopause. Furthermore, women in perimenopause and women with surgical menopause are more likely to be self employed. The findings indicate that, among a generally healthy population, the menopause transition results in an increase in labor supply. However, a wage penalty is observed among women in postmenopause, when compared to women who are premenopause. The implications of the findings are that menopause should not be medicalized but should be viewed in a social and cultural context as the changes that occur during the transition may open up possibilities for positive individual development. Thus the cessation of menstrual cycles brings relief for women and results in an increase in labor supply, albeit one associated with a wage penalty...|$|R
