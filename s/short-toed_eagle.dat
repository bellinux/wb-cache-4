The Little Carpathians PLA {{is the only}} place in Slovakia where some plants grow, for example, Ruscus hypoglossum and Rhamnus saxatilis. Insects include 700 species of butterflies and 20 species of ants. Notable species of birds are represented by the rock thrush, northern wheatear, black stork, European honey buzzard, <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagle,</b> Eurasian eagle-owl, long-eared owl, and European nightjar. The Landscape Area is home to the largest population of the saker falcon in Slovakia.|$|E
2500|$|Garuda {{is known}} as the eternal sworn enemy of the Nāga serpent race and known for feeding {{exclusively}} on snakes. Such behaviour may have referred to the actual <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagle</b> of India. The image of Garuda is often used as the charm or amulet to protect the bearer from snake attack and its poison, since the king of birds is an implacable enemy and [...] "devourer of serpent". Garudi Vidya is the mantra against snake poison to remove all kinds of evil.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} black-chested snake eagle often {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagle</b> because of reports of mixed pairings and because Beaudouin's snake eagle is intermediate in plumage between <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagle</b> and black-chested snake-eagle. However, plumage differences are significant enough for all three to be currently regarded as three separate species within a single superspecies.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{living in}} this {{national}} park include a few hundred blackbucks (the state animal of Andhra Pradesh), porcupines, water monitors, <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagles,</b> Indian pond herons, egrets, kingfishers, cormorants and several other bird species.|$|R
40|$|Migrating {{juvenile}} birds rely on endogenous {{information in}} choosing {{the direction in which}} to fly, but such input may be overridden by social interactions with experienced individuals. We tagged seven juvenile <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Eagles</b> Circaetus gallicus with GPS transmitters in southern Italy. This trans-Saharan migrant flies mainly by soaring and is therefore not well adapted to performing long water crossings. Five of the seven tagged juveniles used the longer but apparently safer route towards the Strait of Gibraltar, and two migrated along a southerly trajectory and subsequently spent the winter in Sicily, apparently forced to do so by the 150 -km-wide Sicily Channel. One of these individuals took the longer route the following autumn. These results, combined with long-term (15 years) visual field observations involving thousands of individuals, suggest that inexperienced <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Eagles</b> may learn their migratory routes from experienced adults, whereas some of them migrate south in response to an innate orientation instinct. Transport costs, inherited information and geography apparently interact, forcing some <b>Short-toed</b> <b>Eagles</b> to winter 3000 km {{to the north of the}} majority of their conspecifics. The study has been funded by the Osservatorio Faunistico of Regione Basilicata through the Parco Regionale Gallipoli Cognato – Piccole Dolomiti Lucane...|$|R

50|$|In total {{there are}} eight species of birds of prey in the Montgó Natural Park which have been {{documented}} to be breeding. Four of these species are nocturnal (eagle owl, European scops owl, tawny owl and the little owl) and the other four diurnal (goshawk, peregrine falcon, kestrel and sparrow-hawk). They feed on the many rabbits, foxes, toads, snakes, badgers, dormice, country rats, badgers, gineta, weasels and bats which share their mountain home. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet, {{it is probable that}} buzzards, <b>short-toed</b> <b>eagles</b> and the Eleanora's falcon also reproduce in the Montgó park.|$|R
50|$|The {{abundance}} of {{species of birds}} (222), {{the structure of the}} bird communities and the great significance of the Krka for spring and autumn migrations make it among the ornithologically most valuable regions of Europe.
