40|$|The {{thesis of}} this essay is that the most {{important}} legal effects of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in NFIB v. Sebelius are likely to be indirect. Sebelius marks a possible shift in what we can call the “constitutional gestalt” regarding the meaning and implications of the so-called “New <b>Deal</b> <b>Settlement.</b> ” Before Sebelius, the consensus understanding was that New Deal and Warren Court cases had established a constitutional regime of plenary and virtually unlimited national legislative power under the Commerce Clause (which might be subject to narrow and limited carve outs protective of the core of state sovereignty). After Sebelius, the constitutional gestalt is unsettled. In Sebelius, five justices of the Supreme Court endorsed a view of the commerce clause that is inconsistent with the constitutional gestalt associated with the New <b>Deal</b> <b>Settlement.</b> A fissure has opened in constitutional politics, creating space for an alternative constitutional gestalt. The core idea of the alternative view is that the New <b>Deal</b> <b>Settlement</b> did not create plenary and virtually unlimited legislative power; instead, proponents of the New Federalism argue that New Deal and Warren Court cases establish only the constitutionality of particular federal programs and specific zones of federal power. The most important indirect effect of Sebelius is that it enables constitutional contestation over the content of the constitutional gestalt and the meaning of the New <b>Deal</b> <b>Settlement.</b> This is a revised draft and replaces the draft of October 16, 2012, which is now on file with the author...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} issues of territoriality, public space, the microphysics of power and street gang life in the current urban context of Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In this city, a growing amount of street {{children}} invades the public places. They team up in gangs and scour the streets in search for a location to settle (for a while). Along with their appropriation of public space, these gangs encounter several actors such as the city authorities, shop owners, tenants or rival street gangs.

All participants mix in these negotiations, for no one is considered marginal, certainly not the street youth who are inextricably bound up with Congolese society.
