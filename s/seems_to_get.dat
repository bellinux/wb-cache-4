25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied {{with his own}} flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E

500|$|Upon publication, {{reviews of}} Marching Men were {{moderate}} {{with a small}} number of reviewers taking strong negative stances. In one such [...] review, an anonymous critic from the New York Times Book Review noted that the beginning of the novel was [...] "sufficiently well done to lead the reader to expect a novel of possibly a trifle more than average interest and average merit" [...] but ultimately concludes that neither McGregor, [...] "nor the book ever <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anywhere in particular". Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development and anti-climactic ending. Aside from these faults, several critics also commented on Marching Mens [...] "deliberate vagueness", calling the book a [...] "generous if misty vision of the future".|$|E
500|$|Ling Bouvier, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is Selma Bouvier's adopted daughter. She shares Selma' s laugh. In [...] "Goo Goo Gai Pan", Selma discovers {{that she has}} reached {{menopause}} and adopts Ling in China, after lying that she is married to Homer, to fool the Chinese authorities into thinking that Ling {{would be part of}} a traditional family as opposed to being raised by a single mother. The authorities briefly reclaim Ling, but the adoption agent Ms. Woo relates to her experiences of her childhood with her single mother and allows Selma to adopt Ling. Ling has since become a recurring character and has appeared in several episodes. She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along well with her cousin Maggie. Since Patty told Selma to give up smoking once the baby came home, Selma claimed she would switch to chewing tobacco, although it is not clear if she has followed through with this.|$|E

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|Bell was {{recruited}} to the University of Michigan by assistant coach Gary Moeller. [...] He {{was a relatively}} small player, standing [...] tall, and weighing [...] [...] He was {{sometimes referred to as}} Michigan's [...] "mighty mite tailback." [...] In addition to his speed, what set him apart from other backs was his ability to cut and find the smallest of holes. [...] Bo Schembechler called Bell [...] "the greatest cutback runner I've ever coached." [...] In 1975, the Associated Press noted: [...] "Bell is noted for his ability to cut on a dime, spurt through miniscule [...] holes and hurdle tacklers. [...] He's got fine speed and he's durable. [...] Bell <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> -- pardon the expression -- his bell rung on many tackles, only to bounce up as if nothing happened." [...] Noted Michigan radio broadcaster Bob Ufer often referred to Bell as [...] "little Gordie Bell." [...] Ufer once humorously said, referring to Bell's ability to shift directions quickly, that Bell [...] "could run fifteen minutes in a phone booth and never touch the sides." ...|$|E

When Steffy became pregnant in 2013, Garrett said that while he [...] "loved seeing Jacquie play a vixen, it's equally a fascinating and entertaining watching her as a heroine". He noted that Steffy still had [...] "that edge", and Wood is a [...] "creative genius, an actress who just <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better with time". Regan Cellura of Daytime Confidential criticized the motorcycle crash plot in which Steffy miscarries her baby, writing [...] "I'm sorry, but whose idea was it for a pregnant lady to ride a motorcycle?"

500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|Ron Glass as Derrial Book– a Shepherd (equivalent to a pastor). Although {{presented}} as a devout Christian, Book has profound, unexplained knowledge about criminal activities, police corruption, and military strategy, tactics, and weapons. In [...] "Safe", he was shown to have sufficient status in the Alliance to receive emergency medical treatment from an Alliance ship, with no questions asked. He is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat {{and the use of}} firearms. While objecting to violence most of the time, on a rescue mission he joins the fight, stating that while the Bible is quite specific about killing, it is [...] "somewhat fuzzier on the subject of kneecaps". Book is a moral guide for Mal {{and the rest of the}} crew, a voice of reason, conscience and spirituality. At the same time, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along well with the amoral mercenary Jayne, with the two spotting each other while working out using a bench press. His hidden backstory would have been gradually revealed, had the series continued, but was instead explored in the 2010 comic book The Shepherd's Tale.|$|E

Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah is a long way away, but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing, but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real.|$|E

500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s precisely because of the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E
500|$|All That Is Within Me {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{some of which}} considered it to be MercyMe's best record to that point. However, some critics considered the album as being too similar to the band's previous works. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "regardless of whether the credit goes to the change of scenery or the backs-against-the-wall pressure, {{it is impossible to}} deny that this is the group's best effort to date" [...] and praised Millard's vocals as well as the album's [...] "sparkling array of musical styles". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted the album's shift toward music geared towards the church, and said [...] "No matter what tag the industry puts on these guys, {{the bottom line is that}} they continually make great music with broad-based appeal". Mike Parker of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, called it an [...] "exuberant,defiant, stand-up-and-shake-your-fist at-the-devil, rock & roll worship album" [...] and [...] "MercyMe’s best work to date". Cameron Conant of Charisma praised Millard's vocals as having [...] "a wonderful pop-country style that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better as this album goes along" [...] and saying [...] "All 10 songs on this album prove that it's no accident MercyMe has sold millions of records... It's catchy pop music with a clear gospel message that will resonate with all of MercyMe's fans—a considerable group—and should win them a few new ones, too".|$|E

Virgin Media listed Mercedes' wedding to Russ amongst their list of [...] "Soap's biggest wedding day disasters" [...] before adding that [...] "McQueen weddings are full of drama, and Russ and Mercedes' big day was no exception".

And now Malachy's met his maker, we're sure it won't be long till Mercedes earns yet another notch on her bedpost". The Liverpool Echo described Mercedes' desire to marry saying, [...] "Mercedes has finally got what she's wanted for so long - a great big gleaming rock on her finger.
