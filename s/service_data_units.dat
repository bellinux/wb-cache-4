50|$|IEC 60870-5-103 IEC103 is a {{standard}} for power system control and associated communications. It defines a companion standard that enables interoperability between protection equipment and devices of a control system in a substation. The device complying with this standard can send the information using two methods for data transfer - either using the explicitly specified application <b>service</b> <b>data</b> <b>units</b> (ASDU) or using generic services for transmission of all the possible information.

50|$|The {{presentation}} layer establishes context between entities {{on the application}} layer, in which the higher-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation <b>service</b> <b>data</b> <b>units</b> are encapsulated into session protocol data units, and passed down the stack. This layer provides independence from data representation (e.g. encryption) by translating between application and network formats. The {{presentation layer}} transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer. The original presentation structure used the basic encoding rules of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASSN), with capabilities such as converting an BODICE-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML.|$|E
5000|$|Between {{the layers}} (and between the {{application}} and the top-most layer), the layers pass <b>service</b> <b>data</b> <b>units</b> across the interfaces. The application or higher layer understands {{the structure of}} the data in the SDU, but the lower layer at the interface does not; it treats it as payload, undertaking to get it to the same interface at the destination. In order to do this, the protocol layer will add to the SDU certain data it needs to perform its function. For example, it might add a port number to identify the application, a network address to help with routing, a code to identify the type of data in the packet and error-checking information. All this additional information, plus the original service data unit from the higher layer, constitutes the protocol data unit at this layer. The significance of this is that the PDU is the structured information that is passed to a matching protocol layer further along on the data's journey that allows the layer to deliver its intended function or service. The matching layer, or [...] "peer", decodes the data to extract the original service data unit, decide if it is error-free and where to send it next, etc. Unless we have already arrived at the lowest (physical) layer, the PDU is passed to the peer using services of the next lower layer in the protocol [...] "stack". When the PDU passes over the interface from the layer that constructed it to the layer that merely delivers it (and therefore does not understand its internal structure), it becomes a service data unit to that layer. The addition of addressing and control information (which is called encapsulation) to an SDU to form a PDU and the passing of that PDU to the next lower layer as an SDU repeats until the lowest layer is reached and the data passes over some medium as a physical signal.|$|E

In the final part of the paper, we investigate how this heuristic can be effectively used at the mobile terminal to dynamically choose the right amount of link layer retransmissions while respecting the delay constraints imposed on the higher layer flows. We quantitatively evaluate the maximum achievable gain when the optimum number of retransmissions is selected...|$|E

Both types group several data frames into one large frame. Because management information needs to be specified only once per frame, the ratio of payload data to the total volume of data is higher, allowing higher throughput.|$|R

40|$|In {{powerline}} communications (PLC) {{more so than}} in {{many other}} media, there is a strong interaction between the Me-dium Access Control (MAC) layer and the Physical (PHY) layer. This paper investigates one of the manifestations of this interaction, that of MAC framing and error recovery with PHY transmission characteristics. MAC Framing for high-speed PLC systems should be capable of concatenat-ing multiple MAC <b>Service</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Units</b> (MSDUs, e. g., Ethernet or IP packets) in order to amortize the high and fixed overheads associated with each MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU). By itself, this is easy. However, transmis-sion errors may damage portions of an MPDU, which can further rob a system of efficiency. This paper presents a 2 -level MAC framing mechanism that enables efficient re-transmission of corrupted data. Both analytical and simula-tion results are used to compare the performance of the proposed MAC framing scheme with other existing viable approaches. The results show that the proposed scheme is significantly superior to existing approaches.
