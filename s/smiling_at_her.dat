5|$|Mitzeee pleads {{guilty to}} {{stabbing}} Mercedes, as she doesn't {{remember what happened}} since Mercedes had knocked her unconscious. As a result, Riley and Mitzeee's relationship {{comes to an end}} and Riley and Mercedes get back together. Mitzeee is sentenced to seven years in prison for her actions, however when she notices Mercedes <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as she is being sentenced, she realises her own innocence. Myra discovers that Mercedes had framed Mitzeee although doesn't tell anyone. Mitzeee goes insane in prison knowing that she is innocent and is transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mitzeee escapes from the psychiatric hospital where she confronts Mercedes and threatens her with a knife although leaves before Mercedes can call the police. Carl returns and attempts to persuade Riley not to marry Mercedes. Mercedes hears a conversation between Riley and Carl in which Riley admits that he does not love Mercedes and that he recently had sex with Mitzeee. Angered, Mercedes kidnaps Bobby in an attempt to punish Riley and lies to the police that Mitzeee has kidnapped him. Mercedes pays Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{to be part of the}} scam and look after Bobby in a secret flat. Mercedes sends a letter to Riley asking for £500,000 ransom money in exchange for Bobby. When dropping off the ransom money, Riley sees Mercedes and realises that she is behind the kidnap. Phoebe exposes Mercedes and tells Riley the truth. Mercedes takes Bobby to the rooftop of a building, threatening to throw herself and Bobby off. Mercedes eventually gives Bobby to Riley and she agrees to leave with the ransom money. They return to the McQueen household where Mercedes' involvement in the kidnap is revealed by Phoebe. Myra then exposes Mercedes for having stabbed herself and framed Mitzeee, and calls the police. Moments later, Riley is shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon). In prison, Mercedes shows further signs of mental illness, denying to herself that Riley has died. Mercedes is later taken to a psychiatric hospital. Doctor Browning pleads innocent in his trial. When Myra visits Mercedes, Mercedes appears distressed and asks Myra to help her. Myra contacts lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). At the trial, Jim suggests Riley was abusive towards Mercedes and stabbed her and forced her to frame Mitzeee. He also suggests that Lynsey knew of this so Riley killed her. Mercedes backs up the claims and tells the courtroom that Riley had threatened to kill her so she kidnapped Bobby to protect him from Riley. The jury give a not guilty verdict for both charges of perverting the course of justice and Mercedes is released. Myra tells Mercedes she can not come home as she needs to learn her lesson and instead tells her to move into Jacqui's old flat that has recently been flooded.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] {{was directed by}} Walter Stern and filmed on June 26–27, 1998 at London's Claridge's Hotel and Piccadilly Circus. It includes cameo appearances by Anita Pallenberg and Steve Strange. It was released in September 1998, and features Madonna leaving her home and being chased by paparazzi.
