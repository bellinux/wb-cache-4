So far, most researchers have focused on odour source localization using a single mobile robot; however, using a single robot to locate an odour source has limitations. In this study, multiple robots were adopted and cooperated with a <b>supervisory</b> <b>program</b> to locate an odour source in open space, wind-varying, obstructed environments. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>program</b> collected information from individual robots and designated different control commands to individual robots.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional sorting {{algorithms}} {{make use}} of such data structures as array, file and list which define access methods of the items to be sorted. These traditional methods – exchange sort, divide and conquer sort, selection sort and insertion sort – require <b>supervisory</b> control <b>program.</b> The <b>supervisory</b> control <b>program</b> {{has access to the}} items and is responsible for arranging them in the proper order. This paper presents a different sorting algorithm that does not require <b>supervisory</b> control <b>program.</b> The objects sort themselves and they are able to terminate when sorting is completed. The algorithm also employs parallel processing mechanisms to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The paper makes a review of the traditional sorting methods, identifying their pros and cons and proposes a different design based on conceptual combination of these algorithms.

The idea is based on development of multiple local models for the whole operating range of the controlled process. The local models are then smoothly connected using the validity or weighting functions to provide a nonlinear global model of the plant. For saving the computational load, linear model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of local models at each sample instant and then used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to calculate the future behaviour of the process. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>program,</b> based on a nonlinear global model, computes desired values of manipulated variables leading to minimum utility consumption.

40|$|The Federal Reserve is {{responsible}} for the prudential supervision of bank holding companies (BHCs) on a consolidated basis. Prudential supervision involves monitoring and oversight to assess whether these firms are engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, as well as ensuring that firms are taking corrective actions to address such practices. Prudential supervision is interlinked with, but distinct from, regulation, which involves the development and promulgation of the rules under which BHCs and other regulated financial intermediaries operate. This paper describes the Federal Reserve's supervisory approach for large, complex financial companies and how prudential supervisory activities are structured, staffed, and implemented on a day-to-day basis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as part of the broader <b>supervisory</b> <b>program</b> of the Federal Reserve System. The goal of the paper is to generate insight for those not involved in supervision into what supervisors do and how they do it.

However, the Industrial Arts teachers of Texas do not have the advantage of a supervisor in their field of work. Each school is an entity in itself. There is no concerted state-wide program, no link between widely diversified needs and situations, no one to advise the young teacher beginning his work, and no one to aid the more experienced teachers in different situations. The State Department of Education recommends a uniform course of study, but each teacher is free to use his own interpretation of what he should teach and what he should not teach.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} closed-loop blood pressure control during cardiac surgery. Design: A closed-loop system regulated peroperative hypertension by controlling the infusion rate of the vasodilator nitroglycerin (NTG). The controller consisted of a regulator which was monitored by a <b>supervisory</b> computer <b>program.</b> Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated every 5 s from measurements of the radial artery pressure signal. The regulator calculated an NTG infusion rate with each new MAP measurement. The <b>supervisory</b> computer <b>program</b> monitored the regulator's actions and adapted or overruled the regulator when required. Setting. The cardiac surgery operating room. Patients. 2 ̆ 2 46 patients who were scheduled for cardiac surgery and who developed peroperative hypertension. Interventions. Patients were scheduled for either bypass or valve replacement surgery. The closedloop system was used to control hypertension before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The use of the closed-loop system did not require deviation from the protocol normally used during cardiac surgery. All patients received standard continuous anaesthesia with opioids. Measurements and results: Initial automatic control was achieved in 9. 4 (4. 1 SD) rain.
