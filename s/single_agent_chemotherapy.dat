40|$|The {{management}} of advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) has progressed {{over the last}} 3 decades. Advances in chemotherapeutic drugs and the use of multi-drug combinations, targeted agents and new management strategies have provided modest survival benefits. However, improving quality of life is equally important, and involves a therapeutic strategy that considers the optimal balance between treatment activity (survival; symptom control) and treatment burden (side effects; duration of hospital stay). There remains room for improvement of therapies today, given that 1 -year survival is approximately 35 %. The option of adding another cytotoxic agent to a platinum-based doublet does not appear to improve survival but increases toxicity. With the advent of targeted drugs, there is much interest in adding a biological agent such as bevacizumab to the current standard. Another strategy of interest is the use of maintenance treatment with a well-tolerated cytotoxic agent such as gemcitabine after first-line therapy. This has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with best supportive care alone. Ten years ago, few patients with advanced NSCLC were candidates for second-line treatment for progressive or relapsed disease. However, as response rates and toxicity profiles with first-line therapies improved, relapse therapy has become more important. Several <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> <b>chemotherapies</b> have been evaluated in the second-line setting, including the anti-metabolite pemetrexed, which demonstrates comparable survival outcomes to that of the historical standard docetaxel, but a much better toxicity profile.

40|$|Symposium I. Rare Tumor: Paper no. S 1 - 03 The {{management}} of GTN {{is guided by}} the FIGO risk score (RS) which reflects the likelihood of resistance to <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> While low risk diseases (RS < 7) are usually successfully treated by <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> combination chemotherapy {{should be given to}} those with RS 7 or above. In 1977, Bagshawe reported a 83 % sustained remission rate in high-risk GTN {{with the use of a}} seven-drug chemotherapy regimen CHAMOMA (cyclophosphamide, hydroxyurea, actinomycin D, methotrexate, vincristine, melphalan and doxorubin). After etoposide was shown to be highly effective in the treatment of GTN in the early nineties, the EMA-CO regimen (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and vincristine) had been the most popular regime for high risk disease, with an overall survival of around 85 % with an acceptable toxicity profile. However, the use of etoposide was subsequently found to be associated with an increased incidence of secondary malignancies, particularly primary leukaemia. In view of the young age of many of our GTN patients, our centre took into account of this risk and adopted the CHAMOC combination, which was modified from on the original CHAMOMA regime, with the removal of melphalan and doxorubicin to reduce toxicity. Twenty-seven year experience (1985 - 2012) from our unit suggested that CHAMOC could achieve a 85. 3 % remission rate, which was comparable to the remission rates reported in literature for EMA-CO. The toxicity profile was also similar. However, no leukaemia was reported in 79 patients treated with CHAMOC at our unit with a median follow up of about 13 years. Our data suggested that CHAMOC could be an alternative to EMA-CO in the primary treatment of high risk GTN. The use of CHAMOC for recurrent disease is also promising but the salvage rate for CHAMOC in the setting of chemo-resistant GTN after <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> appears to be inferior to EMA-CO. If the disease is refractory to EMA-CO/ CHAMOC, salvage with other platinum based regimes such as EMA-EP (EMA alternating weekly with etoposide and cisplatin) or TE/TP (paclitaxel and etoposide alternating twice weekly with paclitaxel and cisplatin, with salvage rates over 75 % can be considered...|$|E

SUBJECTS [...] 8139 patients (6408 deaths) included in 45 different trials. RESULTS [...] No firm conclusions could be reached. Nevertheless, the results suggest that in terms of survival immediate platinum based treatment was better than non-platinum regimens (overall relative risk 0. 93; 95 % confidence interval 0. 83 to 1. 05); platinum in combination was better than <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> platinum when used in the same dose (overall relative risk 0. 85; 0. 72 to 1. 00); and cisplatin and carboplatin were equally effective (overall relative risk 1. 05; 0. 94 to 1. 18).

Although it leads to increased overall survival (OS) when added to <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> or <b>chemotherapy</b> doublets, toxicity is also generally increased. The purpose of this meta-analysis study was to compare the efficacy of chemotherapy with and without cisplatin in patients with advanced GC. METHODS: Randomised trials that compared first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy with regimens in which cisplatin was replaced by other agents were identified by electronic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed or random effects model. OS, reported as a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95 % confidence interval (CI), was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Fourteen trials (5 phase III and 9 phase II), including 2, 981 patients, were identified. Overall, chemotherapy regimens without cisplatin significantly improved OS (HR, 0. 79; 95 % CI, 0. 68 - 0. 92; p = 0. 003), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 66 - 0. 90; p = 0. 001), and response rate (RR) (OR, 1. 25; p = 0. 004) when compared to cisplatin-containing regimens.

There were 519 patients with HD and 863 with NHL. The thyroid glands of 439 (84 %) HD and 544 (63 %) NHL patients {{were included in the}} field of radia-tion. The mean age of patients with HD was 39 yr while for those with NHL, it was 53 yr. The mean survival in HD was 4. 2 yr and in NHL 3. 8 yr. There were three cases of thyroid cancer among the HD patients occurring 31, 44 and 48 yr, respectively, after radiation therapy. When compared with the num...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related {{mortality}} in both men and women and approximately 219, 440 new cases of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were estimated to occur in the USA in 2009, which caused 159, 390 NSCLC-related deaths. More than 50 % of cases of advanced NSCLC are diagnosed in patients older than age 65, and recent Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEERs) data suggest that the median age at diagnosis is 70 years. Until recently, the disease has been undertreated in this patient population, with a perception among many clinicians that elderly patients do not tolerate chemotherapy or radiotherapy. So, <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> is the recommended approach by the ASCO and International Expert Panels in unselected patients. The introduction of novel targeted therapies, such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which improved survival versus placebo in patients who had previously failed on chemotherapy, gives clinicians new, effective, and better tolerated options to consider when treating NSCLC in elderly patients. This paper describes the advances of EGFR TKIs for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 935 {{patients}} with extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed {{in the period}} between January 1985 and December 2000 in Kuwait Cancer Center, serving the whole population of Kuwait, were {{used to describe the}} clinicopathological and epidemiological features of extranodal lymphomas in Kuwait. Extranodal lymphomas accounted for 45 % of all NHL observed during this time. All NHL cases from Kuwait Cancer registry were analyzed and pathologically reclassified using the latest WHO (2000) classification. The most common lymphoma observed was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (58. 60 %) followed by Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) (3. 80 %). In the pediatric group, BL comprises more than two thirds of all patients (77. 20 %). The most common extranodal sites were stomach (19. 70 %) and skin (17. 80 %) in the adult group, large intestine (29. 80 %) and small intestine (19. 30 %) in the pediatric age group. The majority (73. 40 %) of adult extranodal lymphomas was in stage IE - IIE and had a very good prognosis. On the contrary, the majority of pediatric extranodal lymphomas were found to be in stage III and IV. Variations in treatment policies (<b>single</b> <b>agent</b> or combined <b>chemotherapy,</b> radiotherapy, combined modality treatment) adopted and changed during the time period of 16 years of this retrospective study were documented.
