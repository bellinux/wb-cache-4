40|$|AbstractNowadays Electromagnetic {{interface}} is a {{great concern}} in many fields which electronic devises are used like military, aerospace and communication. This problem can interpret the devise functionality {{and in some cases}} can cause data loosing. Electromagnetic absorbers were used widely in different wavelength regions, especially microwave, to reduce this unwanted and mortal effect. Polymeric nanocomposites {{are one of the most}} important materials that used in this context due to their low weight. Aim of this research is to make a polymeric nanocomposite containing magnetic nanoparticles, with high shielding effectiveness that can be used in electronic devices for reducing electromagnetic interface between different parts. At first, iron/wüstite nanostructures with 28 nm in <b>size,</b> were synthesized <b>by</b> <b>arc</b> discharge method in deionized water. After that nanoparticles powder with 20, 40 and 60 weight percentages were dispersed well in resin epoxy as polymeric matrix. Scattering parameters were measured for samples by VNA analysis and shielding effectiveness was calculated for them that the maximum value was for sample with 60 weight percentage of nanostructures with 55 dB in 12. 3 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{examines the}} structure and reversible hydrogen storage capacity of alloys based on the LaNi{sub 5 } intermetallic. The alloys are prepared by mechanical alloying (MA), a technique particularly useful when alloying LaNi{sub 5 } with low melting point elements such as tin and calcium. In LaNi{sub 5 -y}Sn{sub y}, x-ray diffraction and Rietveld analysis show that tin preferentially occupies the Ni(3 g) sites in the LaNi{sub 5 } structure, and the unit cell volume increases linearly with tin content to a maximum tin solubility of 7. 33 atomic percent (LaNi{sub 4. 56 }Sn{sub 0. 44 }). The addition of tin to LaNi{sub 5 } causes (a) a logarithmic decrease in the plateau pressures for hydrogen absorption and desorption, {{which is consistent with}} the corresponding increase in the volume of the LaNi{sub 5 } unit cell; (b) a decrease in the hysteresis between the pressures for hydride formation and decomposition, which is in agreement with a recent theoretical model for the effect; and (c) a linear decrease in the hydrogen storage capacity. Effect (c) is explained by a rigid-band model whereby electrons donated by the tin atoms occupy holes in the 3 d band of LaNi{sub 5 }, which could otherwise be occupied by electrons donated by the hydrogen atoms. Thermodynamic van`t Hoff analysis for these alloys show an increase in hydride formation enthalpy and no change in entropy with increasing tin concentration. LaNi{sub 5 } with calcium additions shows enhanced kinetics of hydrogen absorption/desorption. The powder particles prepared by MA have a larger surface area than particles of the same overall <b>size</b> prepared <b>by</b> <b>arc</b> casting. All LaNi{sub 5 }-based alloys prepared by MA in an inert environment require no activation for hydrogen absorption and suffer less comminution upon hydriding/dehydriding...|$|R
