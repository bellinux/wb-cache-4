5|$|They stamp {{their feet}} {{in time to the}} hornpipe – that is until I whip up the {{orchestra}} to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
25|$|The webs are permanent. Over time, {{they will}} begin {{gathering}} leaves and other debris. Double-tailed tent spiders will regularly clean their webs, usually at night, though they will retain some {{bits and pieces}} of debris for camouflage. The webs <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be rebuilt when severely damaged.|$|E

25|$|At the {{southern}} end of York station a short length of fourth track was installed in early 2011 at Holgate Junction with accompanying OLE and signalling systems. This work helped to remove one of the bottlenecks on the East Coast Main Line. Previously, trains from Leeds would <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait before entering the station. The improvement allows for better flow of trains {{in and out of the}} station.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of access}} to water supply and {{sanitation}} has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for more than four hours before they can get water.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual {{clue as to}} areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the show}} began, the budget was {{so low that}} [...] "volunteers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be {{recruited}} to wash dishes, and the food <b>sometimes</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be auctioned to the audience afterwards to cover expenses." ...|$|R
25|$|The scrum-half is {{the link}} between the {{forwards}} and the backs. They receive the ball from the line-out and remove the ball {{from the back of the}} scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> act as a fourth loose forward. Along with the fly-half, they make many of the tactical decisions on the field. During general play, the scrum-half is generally the player who receives the ball from the forwards and passes it to the backs. They are good communicators, especially at directing the forwards around, and their aim is to provide the backs with clean ball. Good scrum-halves have an excellent pass, a good tactical kick and are deceptive runners. At defensive scrums they put pressure on the opposition scrum-half or defend the blindside. On defence in open play they generally cover for deep kicks after the ball has been passed wide. Traditionally, scrum-halves have been the smallest players on the team, but many modern scrum-halves are a similar size to the other players in the team.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build webs of their own, dewdrop spiders (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in the webs of other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in the webs that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on the tangle webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Knowles, however, has {{hinted that}} the {{incident}} {{may have been}} faked for attention, saying: [...] "So you <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ignite that tour. It's called a Jedi mind trick. The Jedi mind trick fools you a lot...all I know is the Jedi mind trick. Everyone's talking about it. Ticket sales went up. Solange's album sales went up 200%!" [...] The cause is rumored to be Jay Z's infidelity, which Beyonce speaks about in her album Lemonade and Jay Z speaks about in his album [...]|$|E

500|$|In December 2007, {{the band}} re-released the album as Sacrament: Deluxe Producer Edition. The release {{contained}} {{all of the}} original songs from Sacrament on the first disc, and the second disc was a CD-ROM featuring all of the vocal, bass, guitar, and drum tracks in 192kbit/s MP3 format, enabling the buyer to produce their own interpretation of the songs. Blythe stated, [...] "you <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do something special to get kids to even buy an album these days rather than download it." [...] The band took a break to write new material throughout 2008 and prepare a new record for release, slated for 2009. The band negotiated for a new record label to distribute records outside the United States. Chris Adler stated Epic Records in the United States [...] "couldn't be more perfect", but wants a different label for international releases.|$|E
500|$|Zenna was {{replaced}} in the soap by her daughter Chancer, {{who was in}} turn succeeded by her own daughter, Kyte. Kyte played Wellard for seven years, longer than Zenna and Chancer. The dog, whose pedigree name is Minka [...] Kyte, came to the soap from Raddings' company Stunt Dogs, along with another EastEnders dog, Terence. She had previous experience in the television and film industry, having appeared on A Touch of Frost, The Jonny Vaughan Show, 102 Dalmatians and Gladiator. Raddings revealed that Kyte came to understand the words [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut", meaning the director would <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give an alternate cue such as [...] "go" [...] during scenes featuring Wellard, as the dog would become instantly alert upon hearing the usual commands, which appeared incongruous in scenes which called for Wellard to be relaxed. Kyte worked closely with Mohammed George, who played Wellard's owner Gus. George was afraid of dogs as a child, but after working with Kyte for three years, commented that they were so close he [...] "sometimes [...] like [...] dad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adam-Troy Castro, however, gave a good {{review of}} the novel. [...] Though {{he found that the}} hidden Jewish {{characters}} of the novel weathered their secret life too well and compared others who live secret lives in our society (for examples homosexuals) who <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with incidents of self-loathing, alcoholism, drug abuse and even suicide. [...] In the end Castro was thrilled to see {{at the end of the}} novel the main characters standing tall against an oppressive government.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incident}} sparked {{debate among}} biologists and primatologists on whether gorillas and other primates {{should be held}} in captivity at all. Primatologist Jane Goodall said that according to the video it seemed Harambe was {{trying to protect the}} child. Goodall later issued a longer explanation {{in an interview with the}} president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, concluding that the zoo had no choice but to kill Harambe. She wrote, [...] "It was awful for the child, the parents, Harambe, the zoo, the keepers and the public. But when people come into contact with wild animals, life and death decisions <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be made." [...] Goodall said that as long as humans and wild animals are kept in close proximity in zoos, there is no way to prevent accidents from happening, but she believed that zoos [...] "with the highest standards of care" [...] could play an important role. Zookeeper Jack Hanna strongly defended the zoo's actions as the [...] "correct decision", noting that a tranquilizer dart might have taken five or ten minutes to take effect and could have aggravated Harambe further. Primatologist Frans de Waal said he saw few options for the zoo: [...] "A gorilla is so immensely strong that even with the best of intentions—and we are not sure that Harambe had those—the child's death was a probable outcome.” ...|$|E
