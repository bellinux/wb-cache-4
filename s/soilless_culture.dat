Four Pseudomonas strains were identified as Pseudomonas fulva, 5 as Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, and 12 as Pseudomonas putida. The use of specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction primer sets designed from gyrB gene sequences additionally permitted the identification of 17 Bacillus cereus and 3 Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Ribotyping with EcoRI pointed out an important polymorphism within Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains. Molecular characterization did not reveal a correlation between the location of isolates within the filter (top, middle, or bottom) and bacterial identification or riboclusters.

40|$|<b>Soilless</b> <b>cultures</b> were {{originally}} developed to control soilborne diseases. <b>Soilless</b> <b>cultures</b> provide several advantages for growers such as greater production of crops, reduced energy consumption, better control {{of growth and}} independence of soil quality. However, diseases specific to hydroponics have been reported. For instance, zoospore-producing microorganisms such as Pythium and Phytophthora spp. are particularly well adapted to aquatic environments. Their growth in soilless substrates is favoured by the recirculation of the nutrient solution. These pathogenic microorganisms are usually controlled by disinfection methods but such methods are only effective as a preventive measure. Contrary to biofiltration, active treatments such as UV, heat and ozonisation have the disadvantage of eliminating not only the harmful microorganisms but also the beneficial indigenous microorganisms. Here, we review microbial populations that colonise ecological niches of hydroponic greenhouse systems. Three topics are discussed: (1) the general microflora; (2) the pathogenic microflora that are typical to hydroponic systems; and (3) the non-pathogenic and possibly beneficial microflora, and their use in the control of plant diseases in soilless greenhouse systems. Technical, economic and environmental concerns are forcing the adoption of new sustainable methods {{such as the use}} of microbial antagonists. Thus, increased attention is now focused on the role of natural microflora in suppressing certain diseases. Managing disease suppression in hydroponics represents a promising way of controlling pathogens. Three main strategies can be used: (1) increasing the level of suppressiveness by the addition of antagonistic microorganisms; (2) using a mix of microorganisms with complementary ecological traits and antagonistic abilities, combined with disinfection techniques; and (3) amending substrates to favour the development of a suppressive microflora. Increasing our knowledge on beneficial microflora, their ecology and treatments that influence their composition will help to commercialise new, ready-to-use substrates microbiologically optimised to protect plants in sustainable management systems...|$|R

In general, wastewater contains beneficial features such as macronutrients, micronutrients and beneficial elements required for plants growth and development. However, the application of wastewater in irrigation may result in the presence of harmful trace metals to the plants which contribute to the adverse effects to the people and environmental. This paper discusses the effects of secondary treated wastewater irrigated on green mustards (Brassica Campestris Sp.

40|$|The year 2007 {{marked a}} {{critical}} {{event in the}} world history. For the first time, {{more than half of}} the world population now lives in cities. In many developing countries, the urbanization process goes along with increasing urban poverty and polluted environment, growing food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for children, pregnant and lactating women; and increasing unemployment. Urban agriculture represents an opportunity for improving food supply, health conditions, local economy, social integration, and environmental sustainability altogether. Urban agriculture is present throughout the world in a diversity of farming systems. Urban dwellers ranging 25 - 30 % are involved worldwide in the agro-food sector. Urban agriculture will gain in recognition for its benefits and services because urban population and rural-urban migration are increasing. The actual scarcity of knowledge on urban agriculture has somehow hindered the relevance of this activity. Here, we review the social, cultural, technical, economic, environmental, and political factors affecting urban agriculture with examples taken in East Asia, South America, or East Africa. We discuss the definition, benefits, and limitations of urban agriculture. Food security benefit of urban agriculture is evidenced by 100 - 200 million urban farmers worldwide providing the city markets with fresh horticultural goods. Urban agriculture favors social improvement since the poors spend up to 85 % of their income in food purchase and most urban farmers belong to poorest populations. Sociologically urban farming favors both social inclusion and reduction of gender inequalities, as 65 % of urban farmers are women. Urban agriculture has ecological benefits by reducing the city waste, improving urban biodiversity and air quality, and overall reducing the environmental impact related to both food transport and storage. The production of horticultural goods shows the main benefits of urban agriculture. Fruit and vegetable crops give high yields, up to 50 kg m? 2 year? 1, a more efficient use of agricultural inputs, high added value, and rapidly perishable products that can easily substitute the rural production in the local market. Urban horticulture is the most competitive branch of urban farming due to the high cost of urban land and with the need of high water- and fertilizer-use efficiency. Traditional urban horticulture systems are classified in four types: allotment and family gardens, simplified extensive systems, shifting cultivation, and intensive systems. We describe also innovative systems including organoponics and simplified <b>soilless</b> <b>cultures.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{spreadsheet}} (SIMULHYDRO) {{was designed}} to predict the consumption of both water and fertilisers, and the environmental impact associated to nutrient leaching, in greenhouse <b>soilless</b> <b>cultures</b> {{on the basis of}} a limited number of variables (such as global radiation, air temperature, and the ion composition of irrigation water) and parameters, the most important of which is the ion uptake concentration (i. e. the expected ratio between ion and water uptake by the crop). SIMULHYDRO aggregates three major models that run on a daily basis to estimated: i) crop water uptake (VU); ii) the ion composition and the electrical conductivity of recycling nutrient solution (ECNS); iii) the ion composition of drainage water in open (free-drain) and semi-closed (with periodical discharge of the recirculating water) growing systems. SIMULHYDRO was used to simulate the water and mineral relations of greenhouse tomato plants grown in semi-closed substrate (rockwool) culture using saline water (approx. 9. 5 mmol L- 1 NaCl) and three different fertigation strategies: A) VU was systematically compensated with nutrient solution at full strength (ECNS = 2. 5 dS m- 1) in order to maintain a (relatively) constant nutrient content; mostly due to the accumulation of ballast ions (Na+ and Cl-), this strategy resulted in a progressive increase of ECNS till it reached a ceiling value (ECNSMAX = 4. 5 dS m- 1) tolerated by the crop, afterwards the recirculating water was flushed out; B) an EC set-point of approx. 3. 0 dS m- 1 was maintained and the nutrient solution was flushed out whenever the N-NO 3 - concentration decreased below 1. 0 mmol L- 1; C) VU was initially compensated with nutrient solution at full strength, as in Strategy A; when ECNS reached 4. 5 dS m- 1, the mixing tank was refilled with fresh water only, in order to withdraw N from the nutrient solution before discharge. The experiment included also an open system to verify the possible influence of salinity build-up and/or nutrient depletion on crop yield. A good agreement was found between simulated and measured data. No important effects of the adopted strategies were observed on VU and fruit yield, although the former was significantly higher in open system than in the Strategies A and B. Strategies A and C reduced total water use compared to the others. The results confirmed that a semi-closed system conducted following the strategy of full nutrient solution replenishment (Strategy A) may produce a massive environmental pollution due to nutrient (nitrogen) leaching, although to a much lesser extent than open growing system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Soilless</b> <b>culture</b> is a plant growing {{techniques}} without traditional agricultural soil. In the early 1960 s {{it was used}} in Europe for the first time. Soil salinity, poor soil, soil-borne diseases and pests, water shortage, etc. are reasons for making the <b>soilless</b> <b>culture.</b> This technique can be divided in two main groups: Substrate culture and Hydroponics (liquid) culture. Substrate cultures consist of two groups including the organic and inorganic. Organic substrates (non inert medium) are peat, coco peat, bark, burn rice husks, etc. Rockwool, glasswool, perlite, pumice and volcanic tuff, etc. are also inorganic substrates (inert medium). In hydroponics culture, plants are directly grown in nutrient solution. The most common inert growing medium is rockwool, very popular in Northern Europe, especially in Holland, Poland, Ukraine, Scandinavia and Russia, but also South Korea and Japan. In Holland the cultivation of roses on rockwool represents 80 % of the total soilless cultivation. Among the organic growing medium, coco peat is currently the most common in rose cultivation. It can be used alone, or mixed wit...|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} {{model was}} developed for water and mineral relations of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivated in semi-closed or open <b>soilless</b> (rockwool) <b>culture.</b> The model simulated on a daily basis: (i) the evolution of crop leaf area index and water uptake using empirical equations; and (ii) the variations of ion concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC) in the recirculating or drainage nutrient solution using a mass balance equation based {{on the concept of}} ion uptake concentration. The model was calibrated using measured data collected in previous works and validated in two independent experiments carried out in 2005 and 2007. In these experiments, different fertigation strategies were tested using nutrient solutions prepared with saline (9. 5 mol/m 3 NaCl) water. In semi-closed systems, the recirculating nutrient solution was discharged whenever EC exceeded a re-defined threshold (4. 5, 6. 5 or 7. 5 dS/m,depending on the experiment) and/or nitrate (NO 3) concentration was lower than 1. 0 mol/m 3. This value was selected because 20 mg/L (1. 43 mol/m 3) is the limit imposed to NO 3 concentration of wastewater discharged into surface water by the current Italian legislation. In open system, the crop was irrigated with full-strength nutrient solution without recirculation of drainage water. In both years, fertigation strategy did not affect significantly crop growth, fruit yield and water uptake. In most cases, simulations of seasonal crop water uptake were within the confidence interval of the measurements with a maximum deviation of 6...|$|R
40|$|To further {{development}} of a simplified fertigation system using controlled-release fertilizers (CRF), we investigated the effects of differing levels of fertilizers and plant density on leaf area index (LAI), fruit yields, and nutrient use in <b>soilless</b> tomato <b>cultures</b> with low node-order pinching and high plant density during spring-summer (SS), summer-fall (SF), and fall-winter (FW) seasons. Plants were treated with 1 of 3 levels of CRF in a closed system, or with liquid fertilizer (LF) with constant electrical conductivity (EC) in a drip-draining system. Two plant densities were examined for each fertilizer treatment. In CRF treatments, LAI at pinching increased linearly with increasing nutrient supply for all cropping seasons. In SS, both light interception by plant canopy at pinching and total marketable fruit yield increased linearly with increasing LAI up to 6 m(2) · m(- 2); the maximization point was not reached {{for any of the}} treatments. In FW, both light interception and yield were maximized at an LAI of approximately 4. These results suggest that maximizing the LAI in SS and FW to the saturation point for light interception is important for increasing yield. In SF, however, the yield maximized at an LAI of approximately 3, although the light interception linearly increased with increasing LAI, up to 4. 5. According to our results, the optimal LAI at pinching may be 6 in SS, 3 in SF, and 4 in FW. In comparing LAI values with similar fruit yield, we found that nutrient supply was 32 - 46 % lower with the CRF method than with LF. In conclusion, CRF application in a closed system enables growers to achieve a desirable LAI to maximize fruit yield with a regulated amount of nutrient supply per unit area. Further, the CRF method greatly reduced nutrient use without decreasing fruit yield at similar LAIs, as compared to the LF method...|$|R

In soilless material thicknes, using 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 cm of commercial medium. Florafleur- 001 H to produce pak-choi. As the medium thickness decreased, medium electrical conductivity (EC) incresed. Plant height, leaf number, leaf size, and dry weight were inhibited significantly. The best cultivation performance of was on 3 cm medium thick. However, the air filled porosity (AFP) of one to three cm medius thick was only 10. 0 ％, 12. 4 ％ and 14. 9 ％, respectively. This caused great inconvenience in cultivation management. If rice hull (RH) and perlite (PR) were added to increase AFP TO 7. 7 - 21. 9 ％ as the commercial medium, leaf growth, fresh weight, dry weight, and final yield increased. 本試驗為探討薄層介質無土栽培應用於短期葉菜類自動化生產模式之開發，應用，乃以'三風'小白菜為植物材料，利用商用介質Florafleur-OOlH為栽培介質，並將介質厚度控制為l公分、 2 公分、 3 公分栽植小白菜。介質愈薄者，介質EC值愈高。小白菜之林高、莖徑、葉片數、紊面積以及單株鮮乾重皆明顯受抑制，以 3 公分介質厚度者之植株生長之情形與產量最佳。利用蒲居方式栽植小白菜，介質由薄至厚其充氣孔隙度分別為 10. 0...|$|R
