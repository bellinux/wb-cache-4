40|$|Swirling motions {{induced by}} a {{counter-rotating}} vortex pair (CVP) provides {{a mechanism to}} entrain fluid from the periphery of this structure and mix surrounding fluids with those within the vortex structure. Eventually, the vortices act upon each other transporting molecularly mixed fluid into the core flow. This mechanism has potential to increase efficiency with more complete mixing. Therefore, a mixer is proposed which directly induces counter rotating vortices by a three dimensional geometry. The proposed <b>swirl</b> <b>mixer</b> is designed to induce counter rotating vortices based on the potential flow theory, Milne-Thomson 2 Ì† 7 s Circle Theorem and Rankine vortex. Twelve test models are developed during the optimization process. Design factors were examined using a seven-hole pressure probe to investigate velocity vector fields produced by the test models, thereby obtaining an optimum CVP mixer that maximized tangential velocity with uniform axial flow. The optimized design was fabricated from Inconnel 718 using the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) technology. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{order to}} design a compact urea {{selective}} catalytic reduction system, numerical simulation was conducted by computational fluid dynamics tool. A <b>swirl</b> type static <b>mixer</b> and a mixing chamber were considered as mixing units in the system. It had great influence on flow characteristics and urea decomposition into ammonia. The mixer caused flow recirculation and high level of turbulence intensity, and the chamber increased residence time of urea- water-solution injected. Because of those effects, reaction rates of urea decomposition were enhanced in the region. When those mixing units were combined, it showed the maximum because the recirculation zone was significantly developed. NH 3 conversion was maximized in the zone due to widely distributed turbulence intensity and high value of uniformity index. It caused improvement of NOx reduction efficiency of the system. It was possible to reduce 55 % length of the chamber and connecting pipe without decrease of NOx reduction efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Coriolis meter, {{despite being}} very {{accurate}} in single phase conditions, fails to accurately measure two-phase flows. It poses a complex fluid-structure interaction problem {{in case of}} two-phase operation; there is a scarcity of theoretical models available to predict the errors reported by Coriolis meter in aforementioned conditions, hence the need for experimental research. Experiments are conducted in both single and two-phase flow conditions. Meter accuracy is excellent in single phase conditions and no significant effect is observed on use of flow conditioners, namely inlet <b>swirl</b> and inline <b>mixer.</b> Operational two-phase envelope is determined through experiments at different flowrates. Flow conditioners are used to study the effect of phase segregation and homogenization on accuracy of the meter. Testing is done to cover two-phase flows from both extreme ends, namely aerated liquids and wet gas. Use of flow conditioners show slight improvement in meter accuracy on use of inline mixer, and reduction in accuracy in case of inlet swirl, when both former and latter are compared to results obtained from experiments with no flow conditioners. The difference in accuracies between results with flow conditioner and without flow conditioners is attributed to relative motion between the phases, which is more in case of inlet swirl, due to larger bubble sizes. Flow conditioners show an insignificant effect on meter accuracy during wet gas tests. The reason proposed is annular flow regime, which is not highly affected by flow conditioners. Single phase tests demonstrate that Coriolis meter gives accurate measurement even in presence of severe flow disturbances. There {{is no need for}} flow conditioning before the meter to obtain accurate readings from it, which would be the case in other metering technologies like orifice and turbine. In two phase flows, the meter reports negative errors, which is consistent with previous experimental works available in literature. Use of flow conditioners clearly affects the reading of the meter in aerated liquids. This phenomenon can be used to get fairly accurate estimate of flow rate in low gas volume fraction liquid flows...|$|R
