25|$|The RDF {{data model}} {{is similar to}} {{classical}} conceptual modeling approaches (such as entity–relationship or class diagrams).

25|$|In the {{expression}} 6/x vision, the numerator (6) is the distance in meters between the <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chart and the denominator (x) the distance {{at which a}} person with 6/6 acuity would discern the same optotype. Thus, 6/12 means that a person with 6/6 vision would discern the same optotype from 12 meters away (i.e. at twice the distance). This is equivalent to saying that with 6/12 vision, the person possesses half the spatial resolution and needs twice the size to discern the optotype.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 90's, {{linguists}} Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of {{the implications}} posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template. Predicates are verbs and state or affirm something about {{the subject of the}} sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates went and is here below affirm the argument of the <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state of the subject respectively.|$|E
25|$|Georgian is an agglutinative language. There {{are certain}} prefixes and suffixes that are joined {{together}} {{in order to}} build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be ageshenebinat ("you (pl) had built"). The verb can be broken down to parts: a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t. Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the <b>subject</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the relationships between motor variables, variables of success from general <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> physical education. The sample was consisted of 25 students, handball players (in total, 75) from VIth, VIIth and VIIIth grade of the elementary school, "Selami Halači" in Gjilani, i. e. students- handball players, of age 11, 12 and 13 (± 5 months), which in addition to the regular classes of physical education had at least one year of handball practice at a school section. We used 10 tests to asses <b>the</b> motor skills <b>and</b> two tests for assessing the success of general <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> physical education (1 - 5). Pearson correlation matrix was used to determine the connection in the manifest space between motor variables <b>and</b> <b>the</b> variables of achievement in general <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> - physical education, at all investigated groups. The correlation results show that students, handball players aged 11 years (± 5 months) had a distinct correlation between the variables of coordination <b>and</b> success from <b>the</b> general <b>subjects</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> correlation between success in the subject of physical education and almost all motor skill’s variables...|$|R
