5|$|The Heart of a Woman (1981) is an {{autobiography}} by American writer Maya Angelou. The {{book is the}} fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The Heart of a Woman recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California, New York City, Cairo, and Ghana as <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active {{in the civil rights}} movement, and becomes romantically involved with a South African anti-apartheid fighter. One of the most important themes of The Heart of a Woman is motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
25|$|She {{tells him}} that he kidnapped the true king in his infancy, placed him in the forest {{at the mercy of}} wild beasts and seized the crown himself. Candaules, alarmed, protests that she is mistaken. Pythia offers to retract her words if he will submit to the {{judgement}} of Heaven. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> arms in readiness, but Candaules, afraid, implies his guilt. Then Pythia informs him that the true king lives and will seize his throne and power. Candaules swears to kill the king if he be alive.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> face, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> hands, in blank amazement: {{she looked}} as if she distrusted her own ears.|$|R

500|$|The male common {{blackbird}} {{attracts the}} female with a courtship display {{which consists of}} oblique runs combined with head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a [...] "strangled" [...] low song. The female remains motionless until <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> head and tail to permit copulation. This species is monogamous, and the established pair will usually stay together {{as long as they}} both survive. Pair separation rates of up to 20% have been noted following poor breeding. Although the species is socially monogamous, there have been studies showing as much as 17% extra-pair paternity.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair {{away from her face}} was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in which}} <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (sits down). I {{wanted to}} talk to you. (<b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> face with a pitiful smile. Nicholls hurriedly moves back to his own chair.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> face, {{and it was}} tear-stained, eloquent, beautiful.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> glass. I {{assumed a}} profoundly sentimental air.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> head, frightened, {{and looked}} at him searchingly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Do {{you send}} me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes.' <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> eyes to Don, and hesitates. 'Shall I ask him----?' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulders}} in a laugh. 'It is funny, John. I {{ran back to}} you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than of Billy boy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The saints {{fight for}} her!" [...] I said, [...] "for {{we have done}} our part thus far, and I would that I may be well ere <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> standard." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes again}} defiantly, but the face had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{quietly and}} looked at him without emotion.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes, and Lieut. D'Hubert {{stared into}} them incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} to {{her eyes}} and hurries out to the [...] corridor without turning her head. Murray stands looking after [...] her for a moment; then strides out to the porch.) ...|$|E
6000|$|THE MOTHER: (Her face drawing {{near and}} nearer, sending out an ashen breath) Beware! (<b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> {{blackened}} withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched finger) Beware God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... (She {{rolls up}} her left sleeve; clasps her arm with [...] the thumb and fingers {{of her right}} hand; and looks [...] down at the bruise. Then <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> head and [...] looks {{straight}} at him. Finally, with a superb [...] gesture she presents her arm to be kissed. Amazed, [...] he looks at her; at the arm; at her again; [...] hesitates; and then, with shuddering intensity, [...] exclaims) ...|$|E
60|$|She shivered. A {{moment later}} <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes and continued.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} <b>her</b> hand. <b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes--and looked at me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> {{blue eyes}} to his and dropped them, smiling softly.|$|R
6000|$|And so--guiltless very likely--she was writhing {{and pushing}} onward towards {{what they call}} [...] "a {{position}} in society," [...] and the servants were pointing at her as lost and ruined. So you see Molly, the housemaid, of a morning, watching a spider in the doorpost lay his thread and laboriously crawl up it, until, tired of the sport, <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> broom and sweeps away the thread and the artificer.|$|E
6000|$|... (She replaces it reverently, and {{selects a}} novel [...] {{from the little}} pile of books. She turns over the [...] leaves dreamily; finds her page; turns the book [...] inside out at it; and then, with a happy sigh, [...] gets into bed and prepares to read herself to [...] sleep. But before abandoning herself to fiction, [...] <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> eyes once more, {{thinking}} of the [...] blessed reality and murmurs) ...|$|E
6000|$|DAISY. Then {{she gets}} up. The {{pieces of wood}} are flat {{on one side and}} round on the other. She'll lift them above her head and she'll drop them in front of the Buddha. If they fall with the round side {{uppermost}} it means yes. [DAISY has been growing more and more excited as the ceremony proceeds. Now the AMAH steps back a little and <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> arms. DAISY gives a shriek and starts to run forward.] No! no! Stop! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> head. Her {{self-confidence}} seemed {{suddenly to}} have become re-established.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> willow-patterned tea-cup; Soames did the same. Their eyes met.|$|R

6000|$|By and by one {{of these}} rises painfully, and [...] "stretches"--stretches fists and body heavenward till <b>she</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> heels from the floor, {{at the same time}} {{refreshing}} herself with a yawn of such comprehensiveness that the bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to see how she is constructed inside--then she slowly closes her cavern, brings down her fists and her heels, comes languidly forward, contemplates you contemptuously, draws you a glass of hot water and sets it down where you can get it by reaching for it. You take it and say: ...|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (in {{a muffled}} voice of hysterical self-accusation, pushing his head away). No, no, you mustn't! I was wrong. The doctor {{told you not}} to, didn't he? Please don't, Fred! It would be awful if {{anything}} happened to you--through me. (Nicholls gives up his attempts, recalled to caution by her words. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> face and tries to force a smile through her tears.) But you can kiss me on the forehead, Fred. That can't do any harm. (His face crimson, he does so. She laughs hysterically.) It seems so silly--being kissed that way--by you. (She gulps back a sob and continued to attempt to joke.) I'll {{have to get used}} to it, won't I? ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. I am {{sure that}} if I had the courage I should {{spend the rest of}} my life in telling everybody--stamping and {{branding}} it into them until they all felt their part in its abomination as I feel mine. There is nothing I despise more than the wicked convention that protects these things by forbidding a woman to mention them. And yet I can't tell you. The two infamous words that describe what my mother is are ringing in my ears and struggling on my tongue; but I can't utter them: the shame of them is too horrible for me. [She buries her face in her hands. The two men, astonished, stare at one another and then at her. <b>She</b> <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> head again desperately and snatches a sheet of paper and a pen]. Here: let me draft you a prospectus.|$|E
60|$|A shadow {{fell on the}} grass, <b>she</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes, and saw Dawney.|$|R
60|$|Her woman's courage {{began to}} assert itself. <b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes to his.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> {{head for}} a moment. Her dark eyes were wonderfully soft.|$|R
