25|$|The lower {{loops of}} hottest superheaters {{can be made}} of {{austenitic}} material, with better corrosion resistance. The steam velocity in the hottest superheater tubes is high, decreasing the tube surface temperature. Low tube surface temperatures are essential to prevent superheater corrosion. A high steam side pressure loss over the hot superheaters ensures uniform <b>steam</b> <b>flow</b> in tube elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The <b>steam</b> <b>flow</b> increases with increasing black liquor dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. The flue gas heat loss will decrease as the flue gas flow diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue gas flow.|$|E

25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased <b>steam</b> <b>flow.</b> (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E

Superheat {{at full power}} was limited deliberately to [...] {{so as to avoid}} reliability problems, which then meant that it was ineffective at low powers. Development work by Babcock & Wilcox resolved this by increasing the <b>steam</b> <b>flow</b> speed through the superheater to 150ft/sec, avoiding the problems of tube distortion and metallurgical failure.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{the compound}} locomotive has two cylinders, a high-pressure cylinder on one side, and a low-pressure on the other side; the name reflects the <b>steam</b> <b>flow</b> from the HP to the LP across the locomotive. [...] Most early attempts at compound locomotives were variations on the cross compound design, some notable ones being that of Baxter (1870) and Hudson (1873). [...] Another was by Anatole Mallet who introduced in 1876 {{a series of small}} 2-cylinder compound 0-4-2 tank locomotives for the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz Railway. These were entirely successful and worked for many years.|$|E
25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating <b>steam.</b> This <b>steam</b> <b>flows</b> through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of <b>steam</b> <b>flowing</b> from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.|$|R

It had a larger grate, enabling grate sections to be compatible with those of the N class and permitting an increase in firebox volume sufficient to allow two arch tubes to be installed. Another innovation was the use of a regulator valve incorporating a centrifugal steam separator (to draw away any water and thus provide the driest steam), rather than the simpler (though extremely reliable) D regulator valve used in the K class. The J class {{also featured}} [...] substantially redesigned cylinder porting to improve <b>steam</b> <b>flow</b> and efficiency.

[...] Initially flowing at 200,000 cubic metres per day, the flow rate increased to some 620,000 cubic metres per day when the well was shut in. [...] The shut in pressure continued to rise and, when the gauge read , the drillers ran for their lives. [...] In 20 minutes, [...] of [...] and [...] of [...] pipe - together weighing 85 tonnes - rose to the top of the derrick. [...] The well blew wild, caught fire, and destroyed the entire rig.

2500|$|In Europe {{this problem}} was often {{overcome}} {{by dividing the}} drive between inside and outside cylinders, or else by using Articulated locomotives, although {{at the time it}} was not believed possible to run one stably at greater than [...] American railroads proved to be unwilling to use locomotives with inside cylinders, so the problem of balance could not be solved by adding more cylinders per coupled wheel set. As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Speed also played a factor, since the forces became greater and more destructive at higher wheel speeds. Ralph P. Johnson thought that the growing size and piston thrusts of existing express passenger locomotives could not be sustained with the by-then conventional 4-8-4 2-cylinder layout. In addition, he became convinced that a single pair of cylinders with conventional valve gear and piston valves was approaching the limits in terms of <b>steam</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
