40|$|Thumb {{rotation}} is {{an essential}} component of circumduction in order to achieve pulp to pulp contact. In order to evaluate opponensplasty, a device was developed to quantify thumb rotation utilizing a <b>special</b> <b>jig</b> to hold the hand and video analysis. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (12 female and 15 male) were tested to obtain normative data. Thumb rotation was measured as the difference in angle between the thumb in abduction and extension and maximal circumduction. Rotation angles varied front 70 degrees to 110 degrees. No gender or right/left differences could be detected. We concluded that comparing rotation of the non-injured hand to the injured hand in evaluating opponensplasties can be used as an accurate measurement of thumb circumduction and opposition.

40|$|Abstract. In general, dynamic {{friction}} coefficient {{in a dry}} surface condition {{is dependent on the}} relative velocity between two sliding bodies. A conventional method of estimating the velocity dependent {{dynamic friction}} coefficient is time consuming and requires a <b>special</b> <b>jig</b> to measure the friction forces. In this paper, a new technique called the state space mapping method is proposed based on the nonlinear dynamics of a 1 -DOF friction oscillator. One body is constructed as a single degree of freedom system and another body is formed as a moving base that may be built as a rotating disk or a horizontally oscillating plate. The resulting friction induced vibration system is used to estimate the dynamic friction coefficient. The measured vibration signals are utilized to construct a three dimensional plot of acceleration versus state variables. Then, the velocity dependent dynamic friction coefficient can be estimated from the plot. The natural frequency can also be estimated from the plot, which can be used to verify the quality of the results...|$|E

METHODS: Two elastomers with the minimum and two with the maximum color changing, and gray elastomers of two brands (American Orthodontics and Ortho Technology) were selected according to an opinion poll with clinicians and color changes after 4 weeks of intraoral use were evaluated. These elastomers were mounted on <b>special</b> <b>jigs</b> fabricated using a CAD-CAM technique, underwent different stretching patterns and the force was measured in 0, 24 hours, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. During in vivo part of the study, force levels of elastomers were measured after 4 weeks on a material testing machine. Data were analyzed with four-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. RESULTS: All the elastomers showed color changing but the degree of color stability was significantly different. The mean force degradation was higher in 1 -mm stretch groups. After 8 weeks, the average residual force of elastomers was 1. 45 ± 0. 18 N and the maximum force decay was seen in the elastomers that exhibited the maximum initial force. CONCLUSION: There is significant relationship between the stretching pattern and the amount of residual force of elastomers. Elastomers with higher initial forces exhibited higher percentages of force loss after 8 weeks. It seems that there is a relationship between initial color and color changing of elastomers...|$|R

As many endodontically treated posterior teeth loose more coronal tooth structure they need post and core for retention of their restorations. The researches have shown different results when using various post and core materials. A total of 20 recently extracted mandibular premolars were used in this study. After endodontic treatment all canals and coronal portions of teeth were prepared for amalgam cores. The teeth were randomly divided in two groups. The teeth in group one were restored with amalgam core and post and group two with amalgam core without post. Each specimen was placed in a <b>special</b> <b>jig</b> and loaded with Zwick/Material testing machine with a crosshead of 0. 5 mm min - 1 until fractured. To compare the results t-test was used.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{on the effects}} of bolt-hole clearance on the load distribution in multi-bolt composite joints. Single-shear, three-bolt joints were studied. The specimens were manufactured from graphite/epoxy HTA/ 6376, with quasi-isotropic lay-ups. Protruding head bolts of 8 mm diameter and torqued to finger-tight conditions were used. Different combinations of clearance were obtained by using four different reamers and a purpose-designed high-precision drilling jig. Instrumented bolts with strain gauges attached for measurement of shear strain at the shear plane, were used to measure bolt load distribution. Prior to use in the multi-bolt joints, the bolts were calibrated in single-bolt joints. For assembly of the multi-bolt joints, a <b>special</b> <b>jig</b> had to be designed to allow simultaneous aligning of the bolt along the axis of the joint, centring of each bolt in its hole, and torquing of the bolts to a prescribed level. The results of the study show that relatively small amounts of clearance can have substantial effects on load distribution. As an example, the middle bolt in a joint of this type is normally assumed to carry less load than the outer bolts, and is therefore considered not to be under threat of failure. But in the presence of clearance the load can shift to the middle bolt, potentially causing an unexpected failure mode...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Common total knee {{endoprosthesis}} (TKE) {{consist of}} a metal femoral component and a tibial component (an UHMWPE plateau and its metal tray). Though metal in case of the femoral component can be replaced with the more progressive material like Zirconia [1] (the endoprosthesis developed with a contribution of our Laboratory of Biomechanics) a loading remains unchanged. For future development of actual endoprosthesis, a quality FE model {{seems to be a}} key-goal. While developing a dynamic model [2] of a lower limb focusing on the knee joint with the implanted endoprosthesis, every partial result is being verified. One of the most important characteristics of the endoprosthetic system using the UHMWPE plateau is contact pressure between the plateau and the femoral component. For the mechanical test serving for verification of contact pressures (formerly calculated by FEA) by means of pressure sensitive films, <b>special</b> <b>jigs</b> were designed for the femoral and the tibial component and the measurement up to 3000 N were made. Then using the single-purpose software, magnitudes and a distribution of a contact pressure were calculated and compared with FEM results. Since a geometric model of the endoprosthesis and a factory-made endoprosthesis seem not to be identical in shape of contact surfaces, a result comparison was very hard. Based on a position of a contact and its area we beg to conclude that the results are very promising. Index Terms — contact pressure, finite element analysis, knee joint, pressure sensitive film.

Recently, methods of using titanium for restorations, crowns, and bridges have been introduced using both cast and spark erosion systems for fabrication. A potential also exists for using titanium for bonded (Maryland) bridges. Materials and Methods : In this study, the potential for bonding titanium was investigated by cementing with various adhesives: (A) metal to metal, (B) metal to enamel, and (C) comparing with a known procedure of bonding nickel-chromium. Truncated cones of pure titanium were fabricated with a 5 -mm circular face for bonding to a larger titanium disc embedded in a plastic ring. A <b>special</b> <b>jig</b> was used to pull the bonded cone from the disc on an Instron tensile testing machine (Instron Corporation, Canton, MA). The resin-metal adhesives used were: (1) Infinity, (2) Metabond, (3) All-Bond 2, and (4) Panavia. These were compared with (5) nickel-chromium cones sandblasted and bonded to nickel-chromium with Panavia. Titanium cones were also bonded to human enamel with (6) Panavia and (7) Metabond. The 10 samples in each group were subjected to tensile force, and point of fracture was recorded. The data were subjected {{to an analysis of}} variance with a Scheffe F test at the 95 % level of significance. Results : The results of tensile forces in MPa were (1) Infinity, 28. 1 ± 3. 6; (2) Metabond, 28. 1 ± 1; (3) All-Bond 2, 49. 5 ± 4. 3; (4) Panavia, 57. 9 ± 3. 1; (5) Panavia to nickel-chromium, 42. 9 ± 6. 6; (6) Panavia to enamel, 18. 5 ± 4. 7; and (7) Metabond to enamel, 19. 3 ± 3. 5.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in prosthetic socket design have created {{renewed interest in}} monitoring the stress distribution at the socket-residual limb interface. Although a few devices for measuring pressure {{can be found in}} the literature, none are capable of measuring reliably in areas of high curvature, such as the important area at the patellar tendon bar. Furthermore, few devices can record shear stress, thought to be critical in causing tissue damage. In order to address these issues two new transducers have been designed and evaluated. One design allows the simultaneous recording of the normal and shear stresses at various points of the socket walls, while the other is capable of measuring the three components of the force applied on the patellar tendon. The latter design incorporates a feature that permits displacement of the patellar tendon bar, in order to study the effect of various amounts of indentation of the tendon on the stress distribution around the residual limb. Both transducers were calibrated using dead weights and <b>special</b> <b>jigs</b> to ensure accurate loading conditions. Under laboratory bench conditions the normal-shear force transducer showed: 2. 03 per cent full scale output (FSO) hysteresis error for shear stress direction, 1. 65 per cent FSO for normal direction; 99. 56 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and within 99. 64 per cent FSO for normal direction; and for the patellar tendon transducer 1. 53 per cent FSO hysteresis error for shear direction, 1. 85 per cent FSO for shear stress direction; 99. 65 per cent FSO overall accuracy for shear direction, and 99. 58 per cent FSO for normal direction.

The standard way of {{calculation of the}} material parameters consists in carrying out a set of 3 or 4 point bending tests of specimens cut out from parts of the ceramic material to be analysed. In case of ceramic heads, {{it is not possible}} to cut out specimens of required dimensions because the heads are too small (if the cut out specimens were smaller than the normalised ones, the material parameters derived from them would exhibit higher strength values than those which the given ceramic material really has).

40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 42 Severely damaged rotors {{often can}} be rebuilt even when damage has {{occurred}} to the shaft/rotor forging. Such shop repair returns {{what would have}} been a scrapped or degraded rotor to original equipment standards. The repair procedure is to: ? Remove damaged areas of the rotor by machining. ? Build up metal with metallurgically compatible weld wire and fluxes, using submerged arc welding in sequences as dictated by repair design. ? Thoroughly inspect the welded/machined area by magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and dye check procedures after each sequence. ? Stress relieve the welded area after each sequence, using computer controlled heating of the desired area so as to control hardness in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and assure adequate metallurgical properties in the weld metal. ? Repeat these sequences until the repaired area conforms to the design required by welding engineering, mechanical engineering, insurance specialists, and/or consulting metallurgical laboratories. These procedures can often provide metallurgical properties superior to those of the original material, move the heat affected zone (HAZ) out of the steam path, strengthen the repaired area, compensate for anticipated problems, and/or improve the original design of the rotor. Such repairs involve use of <b>special</b> <b>jigs,</b> equipment, techniques, and procedures. A detailed description of the turbine rim weld repair is given, including use of supplementary pictures, drawings and techniques. Cracks were discovered in the body of a nominal 22 in diameter, first stage Curtis wheel of a forged turbine rotor. Laboratory analysis indicated the cracks were due to stress corrosion, believed to have been caused by caustic introduced accidentally with inlet steam. The damaged portion of the wheel was removed by machining at a point well into the unaffected portion of the wheel. The remaining rim was welded to build up, heat treated, finish machined to accept blades, and rebladed. The finished rotor was dynamically balanced at operating speed, installed in its casing, and returned to service. The reinstalled rotor has operated without trouble at up to design conditions for a number of months. These welding procedures were evolved and improved through experience gained over the past eight years in the repair of about 80 damaged turbine rims. Similar repairs have also been performed on centrifugal compressor rotor wheels and shafting. Monitoring and periodic shop inspection of these welded rotors has shown no degradation in the repaired areas. Repair costs have been well below those that would have been incurred by replacement with original vendor equipment and, most often, in significantly less time than it would have taken if a new rotor was provided from the original equipment manufacturer...|$|R

40|$|To {{establish}} {{mechanical properties}} and failure criteria of silicon carbide (SiC-N) ceramics, {{a series of}} quasi-static compression tests has been completed using a high-pressure vessel and a unique sample alignment jig. This report summarizes the test methods, set-up, relevant observations, and results from the constitutive experimental efforts. Results from the uniaxial and triaxial compression tests established the failure threshold for the SiC-N ceramics in terms of stress invariants (I{sub 1 } and J{sub 2 }) over the range 1246 < I{sub 1 } < 2405. In this range, results are fitted to the following limit function (Fossum and Brannon, 2004) {radical}J{sub 2 }(MPa) = a{sub 1 } - a{sub 3 }e -a{sub 2 }(I{sub 1 }/ 3) + a{sub 4 } I{sub 1 }/ 3, where a{sub 1 } = 10181 MPa, a{sub 2 } = 4. 2 x 10 {sup - 4 }, a{sub 3 } = 11372 MPa, and a{sub 4 } = 1. 046. Combining these quasistatic triaxial compression strength measurements with existing data at higher pressures naturally results in different values for the least-squares fit to this function, appropriate over a broader pressure range. These triaxial compression tests are significant because they constitute the first successful measurements of SiC-N compressive strength under quasistatic conditions.

Current calibration methods hinder stress sensors to become largely available to experiments in electronic packaging. Stress sensors have to be calibrated in die / strip form and a <b>special</b> design <b>jigs</b> & fixtures are required, which is very tedious and time-consuming. In this study, (111) silicon piezoresistive stress sensors with embedded micro-features were fabricated and a micro-actuation mass calibration method was demonstrated in this study. The calibration mechanism is based on the large difference in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between silicon and aluminum. Stresses in the silicon micro-islands with embedded resistor are produced by aluminum micro-beams. As this calibration is conducted at wafer-level, many resistors can be calibrated concurrently by conventional IC probing and testing equipment. Thermal loading is imposed on the whole wafer during calibration. To calculate the stresses inside the micro-islands, finite element simulation was conducted. Experimental results show that stresses produced by the aluminum micro-beams are in a suitable range for calibration. The piezoresistive coefficient (B 2 -B 3) was obtained. Apart from this, the effect of micro-islands on stress sensitivity was also preliminary investigated. Finite element simulation suggests that sensor with micro-islands is more sensitive to out-of-plane stresses. By using this phenomenon and the fabrication techniques in this study, a new high sensitivity shear stress sensor can be potentially developed...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, we {{paid attention to}} acoustic emission (AE) as a non-destructive method, and bending test for finger-jointed laminae with starved joints was performed. In addition, for installing the AE monitoring method into the production line of the finger-jointed laminae, a <b>special</b> attachment (<b>jig)</b> for the AE sensor installed into the production line was developed. However, this method with the jig was not efficient for the following two reasons; first, {{it is difficult to}} set the position of the jig. Secondly, it is necessary to stop the production line for the bending process. In this study, the new type jig which installed the AE sensor for the detection of the laminae with starved joints regardless of both the position and the number of finger-joint parts is designed, and the evaluation tests of finger-jointed laminae were conducted by using this jig. That is, the evaluation system which installed the jig was constructed, and hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) finger-jointed laminae with starved joints were prepared, and the evaluation tests of finger-joint properties were conducted by using this system. The main results are summarized as follows: The evaluation system for the finger-jointed laminae was constructed. This system was composed of the motive power part, the AE measurement part, and the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. For the laminae with starved joints, the peak of AE signals which were measured by this system corresponded to the position of starved joints in the finger-jointed laminae. In addition, for the laminae with defects such as knots and loosed grain, the peak of AE signals which were measured besides the finger-joint part corresponded to the position of defects. From these results, this evaluation system which installed the jig with AE sensor was promising for detecting of the starved joints and the presence of defects in the finger-jointed laminae. It was found that modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the lamine during the evaluation test with this system could be measured in the grasp of the section size of the laminae beforehand. Therefore, it was suggested that the grading for the laminae after finger-jointing based on MOE could be possible by this system...|$|R
40|$|In end-jointing of laminae for the glulam timber, finger-joint is {{generally}} used. However, the strength {{properties of the}} glulam timber greatly decrease by slippage-off and destruction in starved joints of finger-jointed part when the laminae with starved joints in the finger-joint are located on the external layer of the glulam timber. Therefore, for the glulam timber with good strength properties, the evaluation of finger-joint properties after finger-jointing is important, and the method is hoped to be simple and non-destructive. In this study, hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) finger-jointed laminae with starved joints (NH-laminae) and without starved joints (C-laminae) were prepared, respectively. The evaluation of finger-joint properties with a <b>special</b> attachment (<b>jig)</b> for installing the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring method into the production line of the laminae was conducted. That is, bending tests for these laminae with the jig were performed, and AE generated during the bending test was measured along with the load. Then, AE characteristics and bending strength properties of these laminae were examined. In addition, the verification test with the jig was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: AE signals of NH-laminae in the threshold of 20 mV were measured at the early stage in bending test as compared with C-laminae. The AE generation load of NH-laminae showed a small value and showed the smallest value in 20 mV. From these results, {{it became clear that}} AE technique with the jig in the threshold of 20 mV will be promising for the detection of the difference between C- and NH-laminae at the early stage during bending test. From the obtained result of the verification test with the jig under the conditions of the load: 4 kN and the threshold: 20 mV for the detection of the starved joints, it became clear that NH-laminae could be detected at the probability of about 70 % under these conditions. Therefore, in the case of loading to the finger-jointed part of laminae in 4 kN as the detection load with the jig, the possibility of the detection of the starved joints by AE as a non-destructive method was suggested...|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} {{surgical}} techniques {{for the treatment}} of spinal fractures in the thoracolumbar region. Several implants have been developed for anterior or posterior instrumentation. Optimal treatment of unstable thoracolumbar osseous and ligamentous injuries remains controversial. To compare the stabilizing effects of an antero-lateral, thoracoscopically implantable plate system (macsTL, Aesculap, Germany) with the stability provided by a fixateur interne (SOCON, Aesculap, Germany), this in vitro investigation examined six human bisegmental (T 12 –L 2) spinal units. Specimens were tested intact, and with simulation of osseous lesions in the anterior and ligamentous lesions in the posterior column (combined A/B-fracture). While loaded in the main anatomical planes such as flexion/extension, left and right lateral bending and left and right axial rotation with a bending moment of 7. 5  Nm in a <b>special</b> testing <b>jigs,</b> motion analysis was performed. Quantitative interpretation of the stabilizing effect was achieved using a contactless three-dimensional motion analysis system. Each specimen was tested in four different scenarios: the first step measured movements of intact spinal segments. For the second step, specimens underwent simulation of combined A/B-fracture provided with bisegmental (T 12 /L 2) antero-lateral fixation and bone strut graft from the iliac crest. For the third step, segments were additionally stabilized by the fixateur interne. The last measurement (fourth step) was performed after removing the anterior instrumentation. Range of motion (ROM) values were compared and statistically evaluated. Compared to the intact specimens the anterior instrumentation of the combined lesion, simulated A/B-fracture, leads to a stabilizing effect in flexion/extension and lateral bending. In contrast to these findings the torsional instability increased for the upper segment and bisegmentally. A maximum rigidity, beyond intact values, was registered for each anatomical plane with the combined instrumentation: antero-lateral and fixateur interne. After removing the anterior screw plate system maximum movements, in all segments for flexion/extension and lateral bending, bisegmentally and for the upper segment in axial rotation, were less than ROM values measured with the anterior system only. With respect to these findings a combined ventro-dorsal stabilization procedure should be considered for ligamentous disruptions of the posterior column in combination with A-fractures in the thoracolumbar junction...|$|R
