5|$|The Komnenoi {{also made}} a <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> history of Asia Minor.

Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the Australian military fought on the Western Front in France during World WarI, relatively few Australians fought in Europe during World WarII.

The other services made smaller contributions, with two Army brigades being briefly based in Britain in late 1940 and several of the RAN's warships serving in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On {{the anniversary}} of her birth, in 1814, the widowed King Frederick William instituted the Order of Louise (Luisenorden) as a {{complementary}} decoration for the Iron Cross.

In 1880 a statue of Queen Louise was erected in the Tiergarten in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's main {{contribution}} to the Burma Campaign in terms of manpower {{was made by the}} Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR), a regiment of black troops led by white officers that joined the front at the end of 1944.

Almost every African battalion in Burma had white Rhodesian officers and NCOs attached; some were over 70% Rhodesian-led.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party of Yugoslavia {{played no}} part in the coup, {{although}} it made a <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mass street protests in many cities that signalled popular support for the coup after it occurred. The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Dr. Radenko Stanković and Dr. Ivo Perović, {{as well as the}} government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days before the coup, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Small prey {{is usually}} torn into chunks and eaten {{completely}} including bones and fur, while prey {{larger than about}} 100g (4oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the barn owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) or true crickets (Gryllidae). Bats and even frogs, lizards and snakes may make a minor but <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diet; small Soricomorpha like Suncus shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.|$|E

5|$|In April 1955 the Australian {{government}} had committed army, navy {{and air force}} elements to the Far East Strategic Reserve {{to assist in the}} defence of Malaya from internal and external security threats. While British Commonwealth forces had been operating against the communist terrorists since 1948, the battalions of the regiment came relatively late to the Malayan Emergency, and when 2 RAR arrived in theatre in October 1955 to join the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, the war had been running for over seven years. 2 RAR was replaced by 3 RAR in 1957, which was in turn replaced by 1 RAR in 1959. During the Emergency the three battalions were involved in 45 contacts, killing 17 guerrillas for the loss of seven men killed in action. According to Jim Molan the attention to detail required of five years of infantry soldiering in Malaya exposed the regiment to jungle warfare skills developed by the British Army during its most successful counterinsurgency war. This experience later informed the development of its own doctrine, with the Malayan Emergency making a <b>significant</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> professionalism of the regiment. Meanwhile, the regimental depot—which had been renamed 4 RAR soon after formation—was subsequently incorporated into the School of Infantry and renamed Depot Company, Royal Australian Regiment in 1960. Despite the end of the State of Emergency in Malaya, 1 RAR was employed on anti-terrorist operations along the Thai border in late 1960. 1 RAR was replaced in Malaya by 2 RAR in 1961, with the battalion involved in training and counter-terrorist operations. It was subsequently employed on operations along the Thai border for three months in mid-1962, and again in May and June 1963, being involved in a number of minor contacts. 2 RAR handed over to 3 RAR in August, and returned to Australia. 3 RAR was also committed to operations along the Thai border in early 1964.|$|E
