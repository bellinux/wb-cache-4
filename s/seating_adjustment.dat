40|$|The {{following}} {{hypothesis is}} {{tested by the}} research: A single crash test contains {{information that can be}} used to predict vehicle response accounting for different crash conditions such as vehicle mass and initial velocity and thus can be used to predict the effect on occupant injury risk for varying occupant positions within a vehicle It is established that the response of the crumple zone is influential in the level of injury risk. The metric for such response in common use is the NHTSA linear stiffness parameter. This parameter is used to show that stiffness increases with vehicle mass in a demographic setting. However, by comparing vehicle mass trends over 28 years of crash testing with similar trends in stiffness, a mass influence in the stiffness increase is implicated. This influence is supported by the introduction of a mass-independent stiffness metric, called reluctance, which shows a lesser increase in mass-independent stiffness over the 28 years. The idea that stiffness should increase with vehicle mass runs counter to intuition and is tested by comparing two identical vehicles in crash tests where one of the vehicles carries an extra 555 kg. The idea is further tested by simulation using a multiple mass-spring model on vehicles, varying mass and impact velocity. Using the reluctance stiffness metric it was concluded that increased vehicle mass decreases stiffness, confirming intuition. Using the injury risk metric of contact velocity differential between occupant and interior of the vehicle it is shown that increased vehicle mass reduces injury. This has important implications for the industry where a marginal performer in a compliance crash test needs only to increase production vehicle mass to reduce injury levels to the statutory injury reference values. A fleet study presents evidence of increasing average vehicle mass. The study observes that blunt injury generally commences prior to vehicle rebound and continues well into rebound. Recognizing vehicle rebound to be influential in almost all blunt injury led to analysis of the fleet for improvement to this injury parameter. Using specific energy absorption as criterion, 18 modern cars were compared with 19 cars 15 - 17 years older at compliance test velocities. No improvement was discerned. Similarly, two baskets of cars (n= 41 modern & n= 32 older) tested at NCAP speeds separated by nominally 20 years failed to show improvement in rebound velocity. The implications for this study of the rebound findings was to ensure that the model presented was capable of representing injury into the rebound phase of the crash. To assist in this, a rebound formulation to reflect varying initial velocity was determined to be a linear function, studying 7 models of vehicles involved in 20 crashes at nominally 40, 48 & 56 km/h crash speeds. Occupant position within a vehicle is identified as an important variable in injury determination. Vehicle crash tests require seating positions to be set to mid-track adjustment. This discriminates against vehicles having more "legroom" while appearing to be fair, using <b>seating</b> <b>adjustment</b> as the determinant. An empirical mathematical model is proposed permitting crash test results to be extended to investigate the effects of varying occupant positions thus eliminating the legroom anomaly. In addition to the varying occupant position facility, the mathematical model can easily accommodate changes in vehicle mass and varying impact velocity showing fidelity with test data. The model is used to show that injury risk in the National Fleet has not improved over an 18 -year period of crash testing...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{purposes}} of this study are twofold: First, to recommend a range of angles for driving posture comfort from measurement of participants and second, to investigate the relationships between drivers' anthropometric characteristics, comfortable postural angles and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Approach: Forty five participants were involved in the study. Both anthropometric data and postural angles were measured and recorded by using the photographic technique and analyzed further using software. During the study, each participant was required to sit on the driver's seat in his or her preferred comfortable driving postures. Images of the participant's driving posture were taken after 5 min he or she has been in the driving position to allow him/her to adapt with the seat environment and fabrics. The <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> data were measured manually after the seat is adjusted for comfort by the participant. Prior to that, 10 anthropometric data of each participant was measured and recorded. Data on comfortable driving postural angles, anthropometry and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed statistically with Pearson correlation using the SPSS software. Results: From the study, a range of angles are proposed based on the participant's perception on comfort. The ranges of comfortable angles for Malaysian citizen proposed shows significant different between Caucasian and Korean populations. The relationships between the comfortable postural angles, anthropometric data and <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> were analyzed and discussed with several outcome shows that taller participants preferred a driving posture with their arms outstretched in order to achieve comfort, participants with bigger body dimension have a tendency to sit farther back from the steering wheels and smaller participants prefer to sit closer to the steering wheels with a slightly greater trunk thigh angle.

The geometry and types of joints of this mechanism are carefully arranged so that only one actuator needs to be controlled, enabling the wheelchair user to adjust the seat by simply pressing a button. The seat is also equipped with soft pressure-sensing pads to provide pressure management by adjusting the seat mechanism once continuous and concentrated pressure is detected. Finally, by comparing with the manual wheelchair, the proposed mechanism demonstrated the easier and more convenient operation with less effort for transfer assistance...|$|R
40|$|This work's general {{topic is}} {{advanced}} driver assistance systems. In particular, it's about the assisted driver <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> in dependence on anthropometric data, {{the detection of}} Out-of-Position postures and the driver drowsiness detection. Already existing systems use sensors like in- and off-cabin cameras to detect drowsiness or require the manual input of anthropometric data to adjust the driver's seat. Contrary to these system's approaches, {{the aim of this}} work is to build a system which captures drowsiness symptoms, tracks the head position and captures anthropometric data only by the use of invisible seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors. Still, the aim includes the evaluation of the system's concepts to give direction for further examinations. The idea is the integration of several capacitive proximity sensors at meaningful positions into a driver's seat. Owing {{to the fact that the}}se sensors can sense through non-conductive materials, the sensors can be installed invisible under the seat cover. Furthermore, the sensors measure changes in the electric field. Occupants, which are in range of the sensors, change the electric field. Therefore, the sensor values shall give information about the occupant's anthropometry and position. With these anthropometric data, an assisted <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> shall be possible. Especially the movement of the driver's head could give information about the driver's drowsiness. A first question of this report addresses the driver's anthropometry. What's a proper <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment?</b> Furthermore, what are the symptoms for drowsiness and which could be measured with capacitive proximity sensors? Moreover, what is an Out-of-Position posture? With information about the anthropometrical requirements, the work shows which concepts can meet the demands on the system. Owing to the fact that the system needs evaluation, how shall a prototype be developed with reference to the concepts? Due to the results of the evaluation, the concepts can satisfy the demands on the system. The ideas which rely on machine learning classifiers result in reliable data. Nevertheless, the different approaches show different demands on the collected data's diversity, which is used to train the algorithms. Besides the machine learning classifiers, many functions of the assisted <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> depend on generic relations between the prototype's sensor system and the occupant's anthropometry. These functions show positive results. Nevertheless, a multiclass SVM approach with discrete adjustment classification could lead to better results, because this approach can include more sensors. Therefore, further obedience between the sensors' data and the anthropometry could be included. Several functions of advanced driver assistance systems are integrated into the capacitive proximity sensing supported advanced driver assistance system. The evaluation shows that invisibly seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors can sense several symptoms of driver drowsiness. Furthermore, the system can assist the driver's <b>seat</b> <b>adjustment</b> and detect "Out-of-Position" postures. The detection concepts are constrained by several requirements for a proper working system. Consequently, the next step is a further integration of the system into a real car. Supplementary, the evaluation shows that the machine learning concepts require a plenty of miscellaneous data. Hence, a further data collection will improve the systems creditableness. Besides the further data collection and real system integration, the developed prototype can be the basis for a further function development, like the gesture recognition for the control of a multimedia system...|$|R

40|$|Technique {{and energy}} saving are two {{variables}} often considered {{as important for}} performance in cycling and related to each other.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the relationship between pedalling technique and GE. 10 well-trained cyclists were measured for GE, force effectiveness (FE) and dead centre size (DC) at a work rate corresponding to ~ 75 % of VO 2 max during level and inclined cycling, seat adjusted forward and backward, at three different cadences around their own freely chosen cadence (FCC) on an ergometer. Within subjects, FE, DC and GE decreased as cadence increased (pÂ <Â  0. 001). A strong relationship between FE and GE was found, which was to great extent explained by FCC. The relationship between cadence and both FE and GE, within and between subjects, was very similar, irrespective of FCC. There was no difference between level and inclined cycling position. The <b>seat</b> <b>adjustments</b> did not affect FE, DC and GE or the relationship between them.
