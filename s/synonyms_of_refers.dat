50|$|In 1979 {{the type}} species Torvosaurus tanneri was named: {{it was a}} large, heavily built, bipedal carnivore, that could grow to a length of about 10 m. T. tanneri was among the largest {{carnivores}} of its time, together with Epanterias and Saurophaganax (which could be both <b>synonyms</b> <b>of</b> Allosaurus). Specimens <b>referred</b> to Torvosaurus gurneyi were initially claimed {{to be up to}} eleven metres long, but later shown to be smaller. Based on bone morphology Torvosaurus is thought to have had short but very powerful arms.|$|R

50|$|Supradapedon is an extinct genus of hyperodapedontine rhynchosaur from mid-late Triassic {{deposits}} of Tanganyika Territory, Tanzania. It is {{known from the}} holotype SAM-11704. The holotype and only specimen of Supradapedon was first assigned to a species of Scaphonyx (now {{considered to be a}} nomen dubium), Scaphonyx stockleyi. This species was reassigned to its own genus by Sankar Chatterjee in 1980 and the type species is Supradapedon stockleyi. One study, Langer et al. (2000), concluded that Supradapedon is a <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> Hyperodepedon and <b>referred</b> it to Hyperodepedon sp. However, the provisional validity of this genus has been commonly accepted since.|$|R
50|$|The term GM ("genetically modified") {{is often}} used as a <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> {{transgenic}} to <b>refer</b> to plants modified using recombinant DNA technologies. Plants with transgenic/GM disease resistance against insect pests have been extremely successful as commercial products, especially in maize and cotton, and are planted annually on over 20 million hectares in over 20 countries worldwide (see also genetically modified crops). Transgenic plant disease resistance against microbial pathogens was first demonstrated in 1986. Expression of viral coat protein gene sequences conferred virus resistance via small RNAs. This {{proved to be a}} widely applicable mechanism for inhibiting viral replication. Combining coat protein genes from three different viruses, scientists developed squash hybrids with field-validated, multiviral resistance. Similar levels of resistance to this variety of viruses had not been achieved by conventional breeding.|$|R
50|$|Isalorhynchus is an extinct genus of hyperodapedontine rhynchosaur {{from the}} late Triassic period (Carnian stage) of Toliara Province, southwestern Madagascar. It is known from the holotype MDE-R18, a nearly {{complete}} maxilla and from other specimens from the same locality, Malio River area. It {{was found in the}} Makay Formation (or Isalo II) of the Morondava Basin (or Isalo beds). It was first named by Eric Buffetaut in 1983 and the type species is Isalorhynchus genovefae. The majority of Isalorhynchus specimens are isolated jaw bones, but two nearly complete skeletons were found in 1998. Langer et al., 2000 concluded that Isalorhynchus is a <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> Hyperodepedon and <b>referred</b> it to a new species of Hyperodepedon. Whatley, 2005 retained this genus as valid with a description of new materials in her PhD thesis. Montefeltro et al., 2010 and Langer et al., 2010 accepted Isalorhynchus as valid genus.|$|R

40|$|In news {{articles}} {{the focus}} on named entities is quite common and usually a news case is tied around a person, a company, or similar. One challenge from an information retrieval {{point of view is}} that one entity often have more than one way <b>of</b> <b>referring</b> to it. This means that when users use news search engines they have to use the exact same name for the entity as the articles they are interested in use. Therefore the usage <b>of</b> <b>synonyms</b> to <b>refer</b> to the same entity forms the basis of this thesis. We explore the idea of using Wikipedia as a data source for building a large dictionary of named entities and their synonyms. An entity dictionary like that would be very interesting because it make it possible to link synonyms to the same entity. The evaluation shows that Wikipedia is well suited as a source of named entities and synonyms as the semi-structure aids in recognizing the entities and related <b>synonyms.</b> The use <b>of</b> the dictionary in a modified search solution shows on the other hand mixed results. On problem with evaluating a solution like this is that the precision <b>of</b> the different <b>synonyms</b> is usually very high for popular entities, and when we combine different synonyms in the same query we end up giving more weight to the results that use multiple synonyms. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{synonymy}} of Pammene {{has been}} subject to some confusion with its close relatives Cydia and Epinotia: Eucelis, Orchemia and Trycheris are sometimes listed as junior <b>synonyms</b> <b>of</b> the former, and Halonota has been listed as <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> the latter. But the type species of Eucelis and Trycheris is Tortrix mediana (a junior <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> P. aurana), that of Orchemia is O. gallicana (a junior <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> P. gallicana), and that of Halonota is Pyralis populana (a junior <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> P. populana). Thus, Eucelis, Halonota, Orchemia and Trycheris are all junior subjective <b>synonym</b> <b>of</b> the present genus.|$|R
