40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how cooperation between different actors should be amended and improved through the new strategy of innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> in Värmland. I am able to answer how the new strategy of the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> are going to improve cooperation between actors through an analyse of policy network theory.   The study asks an overall question “How shall cooperation between several different actors be improved through the new strategy in the innovation support system?”. Following by three more concentrated questions: What are the motives to participation in the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> in 2012 and 2017 ? How does the organisation of cooperation appear in the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> in 2012 and 2017 ? What is the strategy for managing collaborations in the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> in 2012 and 2017 ? The study has been fulfilled through document studies and interviews with representatives from the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Analyses of the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> in Värmland through policy network theory dividing the innovation <b>support</b> <b>system</b> into three categories: an actor level, an interaction level and a policy level.   The five priorities, called “smart specialisation”, are the characteristic areas in the VRIS 3 strategy.

5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008).

These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012.
