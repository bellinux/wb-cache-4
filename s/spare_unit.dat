5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The <b>spare</b> <b>unit</b> was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E

25|$|The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, {{located in}} the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings {{to the rest of}} the ISS. In late 2011 MBSU-1, while still routing power correctly, ceased {{responding}} to commands or sending data confirming its health, and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. In each MBSU, two power channels feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. A spare MBSU was already on board, but 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the <b>spare</b> <b>unit</b> jammed before electrical connection was secured. The loss of MBSU-1 limits the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{method of}} {{creating}} p-cycles is computationally intensive {{when the number}} of nodes is large. The Heuristic method presented called the ER-based unity-p-cycle, shows an attractive solution to solve the problem with creating p-cycles without the use of ILP. This method also has a solution that is close to that of an optimal solution, but without the extra computational time required. The general idea of the algorithm is to identify unity p-cycles that are able to protect as many working links as possible, this essentially reduces the number of <b>spare</b> <b>units</b> required for protection. A [...] "unit p-cycle is able to protect one working link in opposite direction for every on cycle span and two working units for every straddling span. The number of <b>spare</b> <b>units</b> of a unity-p-cyle is equal to the number of the spans on the cycle." [...] A ratio called ER is defined as the number of working links that are protected by the unity p-cycle to the number of <b>spare</b> <b>units.</b> The higher the ratio the better the efficiency of the protecting p-cycles and hence this is what the algorithm aims for.|$|R

2500|$|Moreover, {{maintenance}} and operational costs of steam locomotives were {{much higher than}} diesel counterparts even though it took diesel locomotives almost 50 years to reach the same power output that steam locomotives could achieve at their technological height. [...] Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant {{that there was no}} feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained. With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Parts could be interchanged between diesel locomotives of the same or similar design, reducing down-time; for example, a locomotive's faulty prime mover may be removed and quickly replaced with another <b>spare</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing the locomotive to return to service whilst the original prime mover is repaired (and which can in turn be held in reserve to be fitted to another locomotive). Repair or overhaul of the main workings of a steam locomotive required the locomotive to be out of service {{for as long as it}} took for the work to be carried out in full.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} their {{operation}} in the 1950s and 1960s {{was that there were}} about 30 more diagrams for these units than sets actually existed, while for the subsequent 2-HAL units (class 402) there were more than 30 <b>spare</b> <b>units,</b> so a significant number of the daily 2-BIL diagrams were operated by the latter units, typically marshalled together as one of the sets in a full 8-car formation.|$|R
50|$|Although the auto-delivery {{problem has}} been solved, there are many modern examples. For example, {{generators}} or pumps may fail or need service, so {{it is common to}} have a nearby <b>spare</b> <b>unit</b> which is left off most of the time but brought into service when needed. Surprisingly, however, vibration from the operating unit can cause bearing failure in the unit which is switched off. When that unit is turned on, the bearings may be noisy due to damage, and may fail completely within a few days or weeks even though the unit and its bearings are otherwise new. Common solutions include: keeping the <b>spare</b> <b>unit</b> at a distance from the one which is on and vibrating; manually rotating shafts of the spare units on a regular (for example, weekly) basis; or regularly switching between the units so that both are in regular (for example, weekly) operation.|$|E

50|$|At {{least two}} {{units of the}} same type will be powered up, {{receiving}} {{the same set of}} inputs, performing identical computations and producing identical outputs in a nearly-synchronous manner. The outputs are typically physical outputs (individual ON/OFF type digital signals, or analog signals), or serial data messages wrapped in suitable protocols depending upon the nature of their intended use. Outputs from only one unit (designated as the master or on-line unit, via application logic) are used to control external devices (such as switches, signals, on-board propulsion/braking control devices, etc.) or simply to provide displays. The other unit is a hot-standby or a hot <b>spare</b> <b>unit,</b> ready to take over if the master unit fails. When the master unit fails, an automatic failover to the hot spare occurs within a very short time and the outputs from the hot spare, now the master unit, are delivered to the controlled devices and displays. The controlled devices and displays may experience a short blip or disturbance during the failover time. However, they can be designed to tolerate/ignore the disturbances so that the overall system operation is not affected.|$|E
