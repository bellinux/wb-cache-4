50|$|HMS Devastation shipped {{with four}} 12-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) 35-ton Mark I naval guns on <b>sliding</b> <b>carriages,</b> and HMS Thunderer shipped with two 12.5-inch RML 38-ton Mark I or II naval guns (fore turret) and two 12-inch RML 35-ton Mark I naval guns on <b>sliding</b> <b>carriages</b> (aft turret). The guns were housed in two round turrets shipped {{fore and aft}} on the centreline. The guns would be reloaded {{under the cover of}} the turret thereby not exposing the gun crew to enemy fire. To load the guns the guns would be trained to {{approximately}} 140 degrees {{on either side of the}} centreline then moved to the end of their recoil. The muzzles would be lowered towards the deck; the shell and powder track would be raised from the deck below. On HMS Devastation they would be manually raised whereas on HMS Thunderer they would be raised hydraulically. A rammer would ram first the powder and then the shell into the muzzle of the gun. The gun then would be raise and moved to the firing position. The angle of the guns during reloading would be at an angle that in the event of a premature firing, the shell would exit the hull above the waterline rather than below it. No secondary armament or anti-torpedo boat armament was fitted. In 1879 she was fitted with two Whitehead 14-inch (36 cm) torpedo tubes in fixed mounts, one per broadside below the waterline.|$|R

50|$|In 1885, Joseph Edmondson of Halifax, UK, {{patented}} his 'Circular Calculator' - {{essentially a}} 20-digit arithmometer with a circular carriage (the slides being arranged radially around it) {{instead of the}} straight <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage.</b> One benefit of this was that the carriage always remained within the footprint (to use a modern term) of the machine instead of overhanging the case at one side when the higher decimal places were in use. Another was that one could make a calculation of up to ten places, using half the circumference of the carriage, and then turn the carriage through 180°; {{the result of the}} calculation was locked in place by means of brass prongs mounted on the framework, and one could leave it there while making an entirely new calculation using the fresh set of display windows now brought into alignment with the sliders. Thus the machine could be said to have a rudimentary memory. See the Rechenmaschinen-Illustrated website (External links below) for pictures and a description.|$|E
50|$|Kœhler {{is still}} remembered for his {{invention}} of a gun-carriage allowing {{the axis of}} the gun to be depressed to an angle of seventy degrees. This was demonstrated during the Great Siege of Gibraltar on 15 February 1782 at Princess Royal's Battery. This new carriage enabled the defending guns {{to take advantage of}} the height of the Rock of Gibraltar. Although not a new idea it was ingenious and the invention of the <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage</b> allowed the gun to recoil without pulling the gun carriage into the air. This idea was later built into more conventional gun carriages. Colonel John Drinkwater in his accounts claimed that the gun hit its target 28 times out of 30 when aimed at the Spaniards' San Carlos Battery. He was a first lieutenant when he made the invention but he became a brevet-major the following year. He joined the Governor of Gibraltar's staff and despite the poor first impressions he first made he was to become a confidential aide de campe with Charles Holloway. By 1800 he was a brevet Colonel.Koehler was later awarded the Governor's sword for his action during a famous sortie against the Spanish.|$|E

50|$|In 1872 the {{outdated}} armament was {{a mixture}} of smooth bore guns: two 8-inch, nine 32pr, two 24pr, six 18pr, two 12pr all Smooth Bore with two 7-inch Rifled Breech Loading guns. It was proposed to change this to five 7-inch R.M.L. guns and six 64pr R.M.L. guns. In 1886 the armament mounted was: eleven 8-inch S.B. five 7-inch R.B.L. guns and six 64pr R.M.L. guns. By 1891 the armament had been reduced to six 64pr R.M.L. guns, two on ordinary <b>sliding</b> <b>carriages</b> and the other four on standing carriages. These were mounted two to each of 1, 2 and 5 Bastions. By this time accommodation within the fort was for eight officers with 70 NCOs and men. There were also quarters for 15 married soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The fort {{was first}} armed with four 10-inch, six 8-inch, 10 68prs and 8 32prs, all smooth bore guns. By 1886 {{this had been}} revised to {{eighteen}} 7-inch R.B.L. guns with three 13-inch mortars mounted on the parade on purpose built platforms. At {{this time it was}} proposed to remove four of the 7-inch R.B.L. guns and to add four 4-inch B.L. guns with six 40pr R.B.L. guns as moveable armament.In 1891 the armament mounted was eleven 7-inch R.B.L. guns on ordinary <b>sliding</b> <b>carriages</b> with three 7-inch R.B.L. guns on Moncrieff Disappearing mountings. This was supplemented by two machine guns. In 1900 it was proposed to remove all remaining armament and by 1901 and the fort served no further purpose in the defence line.|$|R
50|$|The SBBL 32 pounder was a smooth-bore breech loading gun made by {{converting}} older 32 pounder 42 cwt smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns. The guns {{chosen for}} conversion were Monk Pattern guns of 42 cwt, a lighter and shorter variant of muzzle loader. The cascabel {{of the gun}} was cut off and a double action breech block was fitted. A new vent was drilled {{in front of the}} breech mechanism, as the guns were designed to be fired with short friction tubes, the standard means of ignition for artillery pieces at the time.The conversion was first suggested in 1879 to enable guns fitted in the flank defence of fortifications to be fired much more rapidly. They were used in caponiers to provide flanking fire to fortifications. In this role their targets would have been personnel entering ditches, and the guns were designed to fire case shot only, with ranges of up to about 500 yards. Because {{of the nature of the}} conversion, and the type of ammunition, a service charge of 3lb of black powder was used, as opposed to around three times that amount for a conventional 32-pounder muzzle loading gun.The guns were only ever mounted on one type of carriage. It was an iron <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage</b> and platform, which enabled the gun to be traversed left and right, as well as run back for storage. The slide also acted to absorb recoil from the gun when it was fired. An elevating screw and wooden elevating wedge (or Quoin) was also provided, to enable the gun to be elevated or depressed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{advanced}} blanket {{maintenance concept}} for DEMO was developed which implies vertical multi-module blanket segments (MMS) {{and a small}} number of vertical remote handling ports. As a common feature the MMS blanket consist of in regard to electromagnetic loads and thermal stresses reasonable small blanket modules which are mounted onto a vertical back-plate that contains the coolant channels and in case of liquid metal blankets also the breeder manifolds. For all considered blanket concepts (HCPB, HCLL and DCLL) a common remote handling strategy was developed which – similar to the ITER divertor cassette maintenance – is based on the consecutive exchange of a limited number of assembled functional units. In addition to vertical insertion tools located inside the transfer casks, remote transport machines are involved that are inserted into the divertor region after the removal of the divertor cassettes to transport the MMS in toroidal direction. The transport machines are equipped with <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage</b> systems for the movement of the inboard and outboard MMS in transverse radial/poloidal direction. In the final position the MMS are either bolted onto a permanent self-supporting closed ring shield structure or are mounted onto a frame which allows for relative thermal expansion of the MMS and the vacuum vessel. While the first option seems to be possible for the HCPB and HCLL concept the later could allow for integration of a new DCLL MMS blanket option...|$|E

As one of the more expensive types of linear slides, roller slides are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable <b>slides</b> and double <b>carriages.</b> Roller <b>slides</b> offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} applicability of a prototype computed tomographic echocardiographic imaging probe in paediatric patients with congenital heart disease. DESIGN [...] A phased array echocardiographic transducer (64 elements, 5 MHz) {{mounted on a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage</b> was used transthoracically in various positions on the chest. The transducer moves from the outflow tract to {{the apex of the}} heart in 0. 5 to 1. 3 mm increments and records a tomographic slice of the heart at each increment level. Parallel images are recorded at a frame rate of 25 - 30 images/s. At each level a complete cardiac cycle is recorded. The images are digitised and stored in the image processing computer, which reconstructs the anatomical structures of the heart in a three-dimensional format by means of different grey scales. PATIENTS [...] 45 paediatric patients (age range 3 days to 17 years) with various congenital heart defects who had been admitted to hospital for diagnostic or therapeutic cardiac catheterisation or surgery. RESULTS [...] Good quality echocardiographic pictures were obtained in all but two of the 45 patients. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the heart were possible from transthoracic echocardiograms. The recorded cardiac chambers and valves were displayed in three-dimensions in real time (four-dimensionally). The heart was also displayed in real time in any desired plane and in up to five planes simultaneously without having to change the position of the transducer on the chest. Different parts of the heart were displayed in a view similar to that seen by a surgeon during an operation. Image acquisition took 3 - 5 minutes and three-dimensional reconstruction of various cardiac structures 20 - 90 minutes. CONCLUSIONS [...] The computed tomographic imaging probe facilitates acquisition of echocardiographic data as multiple planes can be obtained from one transducer position. Display of three-dimensional structures of the heart may enhance the understanding of cardiac anatomy...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} work {{details the}} design and fabrication of a tabletop thermoform machine {{with the goal of}} making this machine cheaper than the ones on the market, yet able to fulfill specific requirements. These functional requirements include creating parts that have dimensions within. 05 " of the original part; thermoforming plastics that range between a 3 " x 3 " and 12 " x 12 " size; and having the ability to heat the plastic to at least 150 °C in order to thermoform plastics such as polycarbonate. In addition, this machine had to be simple to manufacture and use. In order to achieve these requirements, a top to bottom drape forming architecture with a four bar linear slider and carriage, was constructed. In order to constrain the plastics of different sizes, two similar, modular wooden plates were used such that the plastic was held in between them via t-nuts and screws. When the user clamps the plastic onto the carriage, he or she <b>slides</b> the <b>carriage</b> upwards to an oven that radiates heat via nichrome wire on a mica sheet. Once the desired temperature is reached, the user then <b>slides</b> the <b>carriage</b> down onto a vacuum box platform, where a mold is present, and forms the plastic over the mold. While that happens, a negative pressure is applied inside the box via a standard commercial vacuum, so that the plastic adheres more closely to the mold. For the testing process, this work focuses on two manufacturing strategies for thermoforming parts: heating the air to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming, and heating the plastic to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming. Once this test was performed, the dimension of each plastic part was examined in order to see if the tolerance levels were reached. In addition, this test determined {{whether or not there was}} a statistical significance between the qualities of parts made by either of these processes. In the end, the thermoform machine was only able to reach an average tolerance of. 07 " for the created parts. In addition, there was no statistical significance between the part qualities of either one of the tested manufacturing processes. Some of the main reasons behind this include having an ineffective vacuum box and clamp design issues, which will be focused on in the future iteration of this project. by Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw.

60|$|As {{the train}} moved slowly {{out of the}} station, the Writer of Stories looked up wearily from the {{illustrated}} pages of the magazines and weeklies on his lap to the illustrated advertisements {{on the walls of}} the station <b>sliding</b> past his <b>carriage</b> windows. It was getting to be monotonous. For a while he had been hopefully interested in the bustle of the departing trains, and looked up from his comfortable and early invested position to the later comers with that sense of superiority common to travelers; had watched the conventional leave-takings--always feebly prolonged to the uneasiness of both parties--and contrasted it with the impassive business promptitude of the railway officials; but it was the old experience repeated. Falling back on the illustrated advertisements again, he wondered if their perpetual recurrence at every station would not at last bring to the tired traveler the loathing of satiety; whether the passenger in railway carriages, continually offered Somebody's oats, inks, washing blue, candles, and soap, apparently as a necessary equipment for a few hours' journey, would not there and thereafter forever ignore the use of these articles, or recoil from that particular quality. Or, as an unbiased observer, he wondered if, on the other hand, impressible passengers, after passing three or four stations, had ever leaped from the train and refused to proceed further until they were supplied with one or more of those articles. Had he ever known any one who confided to him in a moment of expansiveness that he had dated his use of Somebody's soap to an advertisement persistently borne upon him through the medium of a railway carriage window? No! Would he not have connected that man with that other certifying individual who always appends a name and address singularly obscure and unconvincing, yet who, at some supreme moment, recommends Somebody's pills to a dying friend,--afflicted with a similar address,--which restore him to life and undying obscurity. Yet these pictorial and literary appeals must have a potency independent of the wares they advertise, or they wouldn't be there.|$|R
40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The <b>carriage</b> <b>slides</b> along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary percussive drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using rotary percussive drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|R
