40|$|BACKGROUND: The parasacral {{approach}} to sciatic blockade {{is reported to}} be easy to learn and perform, with a high success rate and few complications. METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated the accuracy of a simulated needle (perpendicular to skin) in contacting the sacral plexus with this approach in 10 volunteers. Intrapelvic structures encountered during the simulated parasacral blocks were also recorded. RESULTS: The sacral plexus was contacted by the simulated needle in 4 of the 10 volunteers, and the sciatic nerve itself in one volunteer. The plexus was accurately located adjacent to a variety of visceral structures, including small bowel, blood vessels, and ovary. In the remaining five volunteers (in whom the plexus was not contacted on first needle pass), small bowel, rectum, blood vessels, seminal vesicles, and bony structures were encountered. Historically, when plexus is not encountered, readjustment of the needle insertion point more caudally has been recommended. We found that such an adjustment resulted in <b>simulated</b> <b>perforation</b> of intrapelvic organs or the perianal fossa. CONCLUSIONS: These findings question the reliability of the anatomical landmarks of the parasacral block and raise the possibility of frequent visceral puncture using this technique...|$|E
30|$|Spiral {{perforation}} {{instead of}} open hole completion is always adopted in oilfields. Limited by {{the scale of}} indoor experiments, {{it is difficult to}} perform such operations as casing cementing and helical perforation. Therefore, complex near-wellbore fractures induced by helical distribution of perforations were neglected. Instead, the fracture propagation from only one perforation hole along the direction of the maximum horizontal stress was investigated. In the experiments, the maximum horizontal stress was applied along the <b>simulated</b> <b>perforation</b> hole axis, the vertical stress perpendicular to the interface and the minimum horizontal stress perpendicular to the direction of maximum horizontal stress and vertical stress (Fig.  4 a). To avoid the unbalanced loading of triaxial stresses, the 3 D stresses were first loaded to the value of the minimum horizontal stress at the same time (16  MPa), and then the maximum horizontal stress and vertical stress were slowly increased to the set maximum horizontal value (22  MPa). Eventually, the vertical stress was again slowly increased to the designed value (27  MPa) to finish the 3 D stress loading. Once the stresses reached their desired values, a delay of approximately 15 to 30  min was allowed to establish a stress equilibrium around the hole prior to the fracturing test. After experiments, we observed fracture geometries based on the tracer distribution of the luminous yellow fluorescent dye added to the fracturing fluids.|$|E
40|$|Aluminium foams and {{aluminium}} {{sandwich structures}} with metal foam cores are novel materials and structures {{that have a}} great application potential in the automobile, marine, aircraft and building industries. They have the capability of absorbing considerable impact energy by large plastic deformation under quasi-static or dynamic loading, making them ideal structure protectors and energy absorbers. The microstructures of metal foams give them the ability to undergo large plastic deformation at nearly constant stress, thus absorbing {{a large amount of}} kinetic energy before collapsing to a more stable configuration or fracture. Studies on the mechanical properties of aluminium foam were presented by previous studies on the tensile, compressive loadings. The shear behaviour of aluminium foam is critical when it works as the core of sandwich structures. However, there has been very limited literature reporting on or addressing this aspect. Recent research on the performance of sandwich structures, especially on those made of various fibre-reinforced plastic laminates with polymer foam cores, has been focused on their behaviours under quasi-static loading and impact at a wide range of velocities. Work on the structural deformation and energy absorption of circular aluminium sandwich structures with metal foam cores is still limited. In this research, experimental investigations were conducted on the shearing strength and energy absorption of aluminium foams. Variation of the ultimate shear stress against geometrical dimension and relative density as well as impact velocity is discussed and empirical formulae are obtained for the ultimate shear stress and shear energy in terms of the relative density. Finite element method (FEM) simulation corresponding to the shearing experiment has been undertaken using commercial software LS-DYNA 970 to analyse the energy dissipation during the shearing process. Further experiments were carried out to study the structural performance of circular aluminium sandwich structures with metal foam cores under quasi-static and low-velocity indentation loading. Deformations of specimens in the tests were observed and analysed; quantitative results from different loading conditions were recorded and discussed; different failure modes were proposed and failure maps were constructed according to the geometrical configurations of the panels. A finite element simulation has been performed to validate an analytical model of sandwich panels under indentation loading with large deflection. Comparative studies have been conducted for the analytical solutions of monolithic plates and circular sandwich panels with the identical mass per unit area, but with different face-core thickness ratios. The analytical model has been proposed for the elastic and post-yield behaviours of the circular sandwich panels. Experiments were also conducted on circular metallic sandwich panels with aluminium foam cores to investigate the energy absorption and plastic deformation of the structures under ballistic impact loading. A parametric study was carried out to examine the effect of the face sheets, the foam core, the shapes of projectiles and the impact velocities on the performance and behaviour of the sandwich structures. An empirical equation was suggested to approximately estimate the energy enhancement during dynamic perforation. Finally, LS-DYNA 970 was used to construct numerical models of sandwich structures to simulate the deformation and energy absorption of sandwich structure under ballistic impact loading. The progress of damage and deformation was illustrated. The energy dissipation of the sandwich structure was analysed. The <b>simulated</b> <b>perforation</b> energy absorption by the sandwich structure will increase when the impact velocity increases, which agrees with the findings from previous impact experiments...|$|E

However, the tradition of perforation is so strong that more recent self-adhesives have a wavy diecut <b>simulating</b> the <b>perforation.</b> It can be recognized by studying the edge of the stamp closely; true perforations will have torn paper fibers on each tooth, while <b>simulated</b> <b>perforations</b> are smooth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{finite element}} model is {{developed}} in this paper to <b>simulate</b> the <b>perforation</b> of aluminium foam sandwich panels subjected to high velocity impact using the commercial finite element analysis software LS-DYNA. The aluminum foam core is governed by the material model of crushable foam materials, while both aluminium alloy face sheets are modeled with the simplified Johnson-Cook material model. A non-linear cohesive contact model is employed to simulate failure between adjacent layers, and an erosion contact model is used to define contact between bullets and panels. All components in the model are meshed with 3 D solid element SOLID 164. The developed {{finite element model}} is used to simulate the dynamic response of an aluminium foam sandwich panel subjected to projectile impact at velocity ranging from 76 m/s to 187 m/s.

The aim of the present study to evaluate the effects of different powder to liquid ratios of Calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) on the push-out {{bond strength}}s in <b>simulated</b> <b>perforations</b> in the furcal area and compare it with Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Furcal perforations, measuring 1. 3 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height, were prepared in 120 mandibular first molars. Then the samples were randomly assigned to two groups (n= 60). MTA and CEM cement were used for the repair of perforations in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Each group was divided into 3 subgroups based on the powder to liquid rations as follows: subgroup 1 (W/P), 1 : 2; subgroup 2, 1 : 3; and subgroup 3, 1 : 4. After mixing and placing the materials in the perforation area, the samples were placed in closed containers at 37 °C and 100 % relative humidity for one week. A universal testing machine was used to determine the bond strength values. After recording the standard deviations, data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was set at P< 0. 05. In the MTA and CEM groups the highest push-out bond strength values were recorded in the third (W/P: 1 : 4) and first (W/P: 1 : 2) subgroups, respectively. There were significant differences in both groups between the ratios mentioned above and the other ratios (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Currently, every {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} operator’s motivation is aimed toward attaining optimized, low-cost horizontal well completions. The goal is typically to generate uniform, simultaneously-growing hydraulic fractures from 3 - 6 initiation/entry sites that are spacingd within a certain interval of the wellbore comprising a so-called “stage”. Due to the stress interaction among growing hydraulic fractures, however, it is hard to stimulate all hydraulic fractures to grow simultaneously in the array. This phenomenon, referred to as a stress shadow, inhibits the growth of inner fractures and favors the growth of outer fractures in the array. Recently, we created a new hydraulic fracture simulator, C 2 Frac,which very rapidly simulates the growth of an array of hydraulic fractures. The simulation helps reduce the negative effects of stress shadow by determining an optimal perforation spacing. In this model, the fractures created from all perforation clusters were restricted to radial, planar growth. This coupled mathematical model uses the power estimate, asymptotic solutions, and local integration to develop a relationship between the fluid flow entering the well bore and friction pressure drop that approximately accounts for the stress interaction between fractures. Utilizing this relationship, C 2 Frac can determine how the radius, width, pressure, and total fracture area evolve with time and compare them with a fully coupled benchmark model. The solution is found to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes and C 2 Frac completes the calculation in less than 2 seconds compared with the benchmark model that took approximately 1 week to solve the same problem. Perforation loss, that is, the pressure drop of fluid through the perforation tunnel on the casing, is another important but sometimes neglected effect on fracture growth. So we add the perforation loss into C 2 Frac to <b>simulate</b> how <b>perforation</b> loss influence the total fracture surface area obtained from a growing array of hydraulic fractures that are impacted by the stress shadow effect. Our results show the potential of proper perforation diameter and number to double the fracture surface area generated by a given injected fluid volume though minimizing the negative effect of interaction. This approach is known as “limited entry design”. The investigation concludes with devising limited entry design and optimal spacing for different numbers of entry points. In summary, C 2 Frac is shown to provide useful approximation to the growth of arrays of hydraulic fractures under the influence of stress shadow and limited entry. By using a novel energetic approach to account for the coupling among the hydraulic fractures and through judicious use of asymptotic, approximate solutions, C 2 Frac computes in 10 - 6 - 10 - 5 of the computation time required by the most efficient existing model that fully solves the coupled problem. This enables completion optimization because over a thousand trial cases can be run in a single hour of computation in order to search for the best completion configuration, whereas existing models would require tens of years of processor time to perform the same task...|$|R
