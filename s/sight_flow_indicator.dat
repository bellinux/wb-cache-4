40|$|The {{most serious}} of the {{postulated}} accidents {{considered in the}} design of the Liquid Metal Cooled Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) is the Loss of Pipe Integrity (LOPI) accident. Analysis models used to calculate the consequences of this accident assume that once boiling is initiated film dryout occurs in the hot assembly as a result of rapid vapor bubble growth and consequent flow stoppage or reversal. However, this assumption has not been put to any real test. Once boiling is initiated in the hot assembly during an LMFBR LOPI accident, a substantial gravity pressure difference would exist between this assembly and other colder assemblies in the core. This condition would give rise to natural circulation flow boiling accompanied by pressure and flow oscillations. It is possible that such oscillations could prevent or delay dryout and provide substantial post-voiding heat removal. The tests described in this report were conceived with the objective of obtaining basic information and data relating to this possibility. To accomplish this objective a natural circulation test loop was designed to simulate LMFBR geometry and flow conditions predicted to exist at the time boiling is initiated in a LOPI accident. The test loop included: (l) a vertical tube test section, (2) upper and lower plenum tanks, (3) an external down-commer, (4) sight flow indicators and (5) instrumentation. The test section was an electrically heated tube designed with a hydraulic diameter and length similar to current LMFBR (FTR) design. The upper and lower plenum tanks were provided with means for controlling liquid subcooling above and below the test section. The down-commer was large enough to eliminate down-commer hydraulics. Water at a pressure of 1 atmosphere was used to simulate sodium. Sight flow indicators were provided to observe flow conditions at the test section inlet and exit. Instrumentation was provided to measure test section pressures, inlet and exit temperatures, tube wall temperatures, heat flux and oscillation frequencies. Steady state tests were conducted for subcooled flow boiling, saturated flow boiling, CHF and post CHF conditions. Subcooled flow boiling was observed for heat fluxes below 1 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2. For this condition, both pressure oscillations and temperature oscillations at the heated surface were observed; but the pressure oscillations were not observed continuously. Saturated flow boiling was observed for heat fluxes between 3 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2 and CHF. For this condition, pressure oscillations were observed continuously. As the CHF condition was approached, a periodic downward expansion of vapor from the heated section was observed at the bottom <b>sight</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indicator</b> and the flow regime appeared to be annular at the top <b>sight</b> <b>flow</b> <b>indicator.</b> CHF was observed at the top of the heated section when the heat flux reached 6. 4 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2, but rewetting occurred after a few seconds. As the heat flux was increased further, the maximum surface temperature reached before rewetting increased; until, at a heat flux of 7. 15 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2, the maximum temperature exceeded 9000 F and rewetting no longer occurred. A transient test was conducted for a post CHF condition. The heat flux was 7. 3 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2. The oscillations observed under steady state conditions developed within a few seconds after the power was turned on. The equilibrium tube wall temperature upstream of the CHF location was reached in 10 seconds. The equilibrium tube wall temperature at the CHF location was reached in about 135 seconds. A similarity analysis was done in order to scale the test results to LMFBR LOPI conditions. The results of this analysis indicate that the CHF for the LMFBR (FTR) would be at least 6 x 104 BTU/hr ft 2. This corresponds to a critical average linear power for the hot assembly of 1. 06 kw/ft compared to an estimated 2. 55 to 5. 1 kw/ft being transferred to the coolant at the time boiling begins during a LOPI accident. On the basis of this analysis, the results of the water tests indicate that CHF would occur. But, this conclusion is conservative for a number of reasons and further experimental work on a more prototypical system is suggested.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{relative}} importance of low <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> for the River Rhine and to identify their appropriate temporal lag and resolution. This is done in the context of low flow forecasting with lead times of 14 and 90 days. First, the Rhine basin is subdivided into seven sub-basins. By considering the dominant processes in the sub-basins, five low <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> were selected: precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, snow storage and lake storage. Correlation analysis was then carried out to determine the relationship between observed low <b>flows</b> and preselected <b>indicators</b> with varying lags (days) and temporal resolutions (from 1 day to 7 months). The results show that the most important low <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 14 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, and lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution. In the other sub-basins groundwater levels with a small lag and temporal resolution are important in addition to potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution. The picture is slightly different for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days. The snow storage in the Alpine sub-basins and the precipitation in the other sub-basins also become relevant for low flows. Consequently, the most important low <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution and snow storage with a small lag and large temporal resolution.

40|$|This paper uses past {{hydrological}} {{records in}} Northeastern Illinois to disentangle the combined effects of urban development and climatic variability at different spatial scales in the Greater Chicago Area. A step increase in annual precipitation occurred in Northeastern Illinois during 1965 – 1972 according to climate records. Urbanization has occurred as a gradual process {{over the entire}} Greater Chicago Area, {{both before and after}} the abrupt annual precipitation increase. The analysis of streamflow trends at each gaging station is supplemented by the comparison of the evolution of streamflow indicators in a group of urban and agricultural watersheds, thanks to an original use of the Mann–Whitney test. Results suggest that urban expansion in the Greater Chicago Area has led to widespread increases in a wide variety of streamflow metrics, with the exceptions being spring flows and some of the peak <b>flow</b> <b>indicators.</b> The increases detected in small (200 km 2) ones, over which the changes in streamflow are relatively homogeneous. While the impacts of land-use change are identified across a wide range of <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> and spatial scales, there are indications that some of these effects are mitigated or made negligible by other factors. For example, while impervious surfaces are found to increase flooding, stormwater management facilities, an adaptation to increased flooding, mitigate their impacts at a wide range of scales. While impervious surfaces are known to reduce infiltration and baseflow, a low flow increase was triggered by water withdrawals from Lake Michigan, as a response to a rising water demand which made on-site groundwater extraction unsustainable. Our analysis thus highlights the impacts of adaptive planning and management of water resources on urban hydrology...|$|R

40|$|Low flow forecasting, days or {{even months}} in advance, is {{particularly}} important to the efficient operation of power plants and freight shipment. This study presents a low flow forecasting model with a lead time of 14 days for the Rhine River. The forecasts inherit uncertainty sources mainly because of model parameterization. Therefore, a systematic uncertainty analysis is applied to indicate the major uncertainty sources in the results. Firstly, the Rhine basin is divided into 7 major sub-basins. Each sub-basin is modeled separately with a data-driven model and the output discharges are routed to Lobith after German-Dutch border with another data-driven model. Five pre-selected low <b>flow</b> <b>indicators</b> (basin averaged precipitation, basin averaged potential evapotranspiration; basin averaged fresh snow depths, basin averaged groundwater levels and major lake levels in the sub-basins) are used as inputs to the models. The basin discretization and the selection of indicators {{are based on a}} literature study and seasonality analysis of the discharge time series from 108 sub-basins. The correlations between <b>indicator</b> and low <b>flows</b> with varying temporal resolution and varying lags between <b>indicator</b> and low <b>flows</b> were used to identify appropriate temporal scales of the model inputs. We assume that a suitable model structure for the Rhine basin has been determined; that is, the sub-system boundaries have been specified, the important state variables and input and output fluxes to be included have been identified and selected for each sub-basin.

We can trace the plate-boundary interface from the trench across our entire survey to where the plate-boundary thrust lies > 10 km beneath the margin shelf. Approximately 20 km landward of the trench beneath the mid slope and at the updip edge of the seismogenic zone, a 12 km wide zone of the plate-boundary interface has a distinctly higher-amplitude seismic reflection than deeper or shallower segments of the fault. Directly above and potentially directly connected with this zone are high-amplitude, reversed-polarity fault-plane reflections that extend through the margin wedge and into overlying slope sediment cover. Within the slope cover, high-amplitude reversed-polarity reflections are common within the network of closely-spaced nearly vertical normal faults and several broadly spaced, more gently dipping thrust faults. These faults appear to be directing fluids vertically toward the seafloor, where numerous seafloor fluid <b>flow</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as pockmarks, mounds and ridges, and slope failure features, are distinct in multibeam and backscatter images.

The analysis of a time series carried out by the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) shows that, over a long period of time, family farm income is considerably lower than private consumption. The gap even increases if calculated costs for unpaid labour and for net worth invested in the farm are taken as a reference point (average salaries of employees; average interest on long-term governmental bonds; see Figure 1). For other European countries, the results would probably be similar. As income objectives for the farming sector are an important element of the agricultural policy in most (if not all) OECD countries, the relatively low income is a common argument for maintaining or increasing public support...|$|R
