40|$|Aim. To {{describe}} {{and evaluate the}} structures and processes involved in a hospital in the Nursing Home programme. Background. Older Australians are the largest consumers of healthcare, {{and as a result}} of the ageing process are at risk of developing hospital acquired iatrogenic complications. Hospital admission avoidance programmes that aim to provide care for patients in their own environment include Hospital in the Home and, more recently, Hospital in the Nursing Home. Methods. In 2006, a qualitative evaluation of a nurse-led Hospital in the Nursing Home programme using semi-structured interviews with 19 stakeholders was undertaken. Data analysis involved using start codes and content analysis. Findings. Effective referral and communication strategies were important for Hospital in the Nursing Home implementation. Furthermore, the Hospital in the Nursing Home programme manager had acute care and community experience and worked in an advanced practice role. These elements were integral to the programme’s operation. Conclusion. As the population ages, reducing hospital admissions for aged-care facility residents has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

40|$|Purpose - The New Zealand Ministry of Education has {{constructed}} a wide-ranging "Professional Development Plan" providing a four-stage national pathway for progression to principalship; {{the first stage}} has been the conduction of the National Aspiring Principals Pilot (NAPP) programme in five regional locations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to outline the evaluation of the programme. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method approach for evaluation was employed where qualitative and quantitative data were collected almost simultaneously, and compared and contrasted. Findings - Key findings indicated overall <b>sound</b> <b>programme</b> delivery, curriculum coherence, high relevancy to stakeholders and good rates of principal appointments. Greater emphasis is placed on distinctive findings that have not been reported elsewhere. These included: primary-sector participants rating course facilitation, online learning, and "relevancy of the course for principal development" more positively than their secondary counterparts; aspirants who had partial or full completion of a relevant post-graduate leadership qualification rating eight aspects of NAPP lower than those without such qualifications; and aspirants who were approached and encouraged to apply for NAPP by their principal and subsequently supported by them, finding the programme more relevant and applicable. Research limitations/implications - The multiple positive outcomes reported reveal short-term programme adequacy and effectiveness against a range of indicators. Long-term impact (including capacity to change leadership practice, student learning and school improvement) evaluation is required to determine sustained effectiveness. Originality/value - The paper provides distinctive findings that have not been reported previously for principal development and more general findings that should inform such development programmes.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. This study {{investigates the}} {{perceptions}} of learners and staff of the Dental Technology Extended First Programme (EFYP) currently offered in the Department of Dental Services at the Durban University of Technology. The EFYP has been offered since 1995 {{in order to meet}} the needs of under prepared learners in the Dental Technology programme as well as to address transformation of the programme. The Dental Technology EFYP has evolved over a number of years and was one of the first extended programmes offered in South African higher education. No evaluation of this programme has occurred since its inception. Moreover, the present study is particularly relevant as it has been conducted at a time that the Department of Education is concerned with low throughput rates in South African tertiary education. It is hoped that insights into this programme gained from this study will be of benefit to educators either currently providing foundation provision or those contemplating foundation provision in the future. It is noted that little research into foundation provision has, to date, been conducted in South Africa. For this study, learners currently registered in the Dental Technology programme and staff from the programme were interviewed in semi-structured interviews, and the main themes concerning foundation provision emerging from the study were identified. I conclude that the current EFYP is an academically <b>sound</b> <b>programme</b> contributing to the academic development of individual learners as well as to the overall success of the Dental Technology programme. Learners were unanimous in their belief that the EFYP contributed positively towards their academic advancement.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop a psychoeducational programme for team coaches to facilitate the mental health of managers. Preventing managerial degeneration has become a corporate priority. Without support and intervention, executives and managers can degenerate personally or derail careerwise at enormous cost to themselves, their companies and the economy. Personal degeneration may include selfneglect, ignoring families, marriages, friends, personal interests and their own physical and mental health as they chase their corporate and career objectives. Business managers are subjected to more pressure than ever to produce results, yet they are often promoted through job specific expertise without the emotional intelligence and worklife balance skills necessary to sustain them. Research has revealed an across the board consensus that coaching {{is one of the most}} powerful strategic and tactical weapons open to business today because of its ability to enhance areas of proficiency that are already high and to establish skills that were previously absent or weak. Business coaching provides the gateway to intellectual and emotional support and develops managers, thus avoiding managerial derailment and preparing individuals to meet the increasingly complex requirements of today’s business environment. Business and team coaching is distinct from other types of coaching and calls for additional competencies and expertise as specialisation areas. The coaching industry in Southern Africa is in its infancy and as such there are currently no barriers to entry. There is a lack of descriptive and accepted standards, agreed upon core competencies and accredited team coaching programmes that offer depth in terms of knowledge, skills, values and business acumen. In light of the above challenges the following research question arose: · What should a programme for team coaches consist of in order to facilitate the mental health of managers? A qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was followed including autoethnography as a strategy. The research took place in four phases. Phase 1 : A situation analysis was done in order to explore and describe what a programme for team coaches should consist of in order to facilitate the mental health of managers. This involved the identification of key stakeholders. Focus groups and interviews were conducted and individual naïve sketches collected from individuals who were are not available for interviews. A literature control was conducted in order to verify findings. Phase 2 : Based on the abovementioned results, {{the research}} progressed to phase two, which involved the development of a programme. During this phase a conceptual framework was described that included an approach to the programme. Phase 3 : This phase presented a description of the programme as well as guidelines for the implementation of the programme. Phase 4 : The programme was evaluated and possible limitations were highlighted. Recommendations regarding possible further research were made. The researcher believes that business and team coaching will continue to thrive and gain increased status as a profession. With an empirically <b>sound</b> <b>programme</b> in place, business and team coaching is set to flourish and managers have a means to manage and maintain optimum mental health.

40|$|After 12 {{years as}} Director of CTA Daniel Assoumou Mba has now {{completed}} his assignment. From the outset {{he has led}} his institute with discretion and courtesy. During these years the tasks, personnel and budget of the Centre have expanded to create an institute capable of effectively fulfilling its mandate. Mr Assoumou undertook his duties with a rigorous commitment to development and clear-sighted policies. He always insisted that Spore, which {{he was responsible for}} naming, should be a publication oriented towards development information and not a publicity bulletin for CTA. Spore asked Daniel Assoumou Mba about his experiences and his vision for CTA. Spore: You have led CTA since its creation in 1983. With hindsight, {{what do you see as}} the main phases in the Centre's development? D Assoumou Mba: When CTA was established the mandate given to us by Lomé II was very broad: to improve access by ACP countries to information, research and training and also to agricultural development innovations. This was an enormous task! CTA's initial activities in 1983 began from a hotel room in Wageningen. There were only two staff members at the time: a driver-messenger and myself. Within one year eight people were recruited and a programme-budget for the subsequent year was drawn up. Initially the Centre's activities were mainly focused on demonstrating the importance of scientific and technical information (STI) in relation to food security, income generation and natural resource conservation. In other words, that STI should be regarded as an input in agricultural production. We gradually became aware of the constraints that ACP countries have to face in terms of information dissemination: lack of national or regional STI policies, difficulty in accessing information sources and a shortage of human and financial resources. At the same time, it was necessary to identify which groups of agricultural development workers should become our target groups: e. g. planners, researchers, trainers, extension workers and information managers. Based on the requirements expressed by the ACP countries CTA launched its first information dissemination activities through studies, scientific and technical meetings, and publications on research and extension. Spore: What strategies has CTA adopted to accomplish its objectives? D Assoumou Mba: We have been able to establish and maintain close links with organizations involved in agricultural development in ACP countries at all levels: national, regional and international. CTA commissions experts from European Union and ACP countries to carry out specific tasks. The Centre has established regional offices in the Caribbean and the Pacific to improve its effectiveness in those regions. In Africa, we maintain close links with regional economic bodies and research-coordinating institutes. CTA also works closely with ACP national research, training, extension, and information and documentation services. The value of CTA's early work was recognized five years after its establishment. An evaluation of CTA's work during this period was very positive. Spore: What are the Centre's current activities? D Assoumou Mba: The Centre's activities focus on agriculture, including livestock, fishing and forestry; and the socio-economic aspects of any activity are always taken into account. CTA currently serves 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which are divided into six regions. Spore: How do you see the future beyond Lomé IV? D Assoumou Mba: Lomé IV covers the period 1991 - 2000 and has broadened the Centre's mandate by emphasizing the need to develop capacity in ACP countries. The Convention aims to integrate information within agricultural development strategies and our role is to provide scientific and technical support in the preparation of information programmes. According to the 1994 evaluation of CTA 'the Centre has moved from a position of considerable uncertainy in 1984 to one of growing importance and tangible achievements. The Centre now has an identity and infrastructure, a <b>sound</b> <b>programme</b> and funding base, and a widely recognized contribution to the information needs of ACP countries [...] . '. However, the Centre's role as a catalyst in formulating STI programmes can only bring about major changes if the Centre works to enable ACP countries to ultimately take over CTA's responsibilities and to meet their own agricultural information needs more adequately. CTA's role remains relevant today. However, it will have to put special effort into defining and setting up regional programmes. This is the key to its future success. After 12 years as Director of CTA Daniel Assoumou Mba has now completed his assignment. From the outset he has led his institute with discretion and courtesy. During these years the tasks, personnel and budget of the Centre have expanded to create [...] ...|$|E

Although_, as our review elsewhere in this issue points out, most of the changes seen this year are developments of tr·ends already discernible a year or more ago, there has been ample food for thought in the rate at which some of these changes are taking place, and the reaction of the buying public to the new types of set which are offered to them. Take, for example, the combined television and v. h. f. /f. m. sound receiver. From the technical point of view this is a particularly neat and logical com-bination, since not only the audio-frequency ampli-fier but also the early intermediate-frequency stages can be made to fulfil dual functions. There is no more economical way, either in first cost or in the space taken up in the living room, of making pro-vision for the reception of all the domestic broadcast services. in this country. In spite of this, according to reports published in the trade Press, there has been no spectacular swing in popular favour towards this type of receiver, though there were more sets to choose from this year than last.
