500|$|Gallagher was {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in Oasis, and on the group's first three albums he was the sole songwriting contributor. He is often criticised for the praise he gives to his own songs. He points out [...] "If you'd written 'Live Forever', you'd be walking to a different tune the next day too." [...] Gallagher has often been accused by critics of plagiarising the music of his heroes, but he has maintained outright homages in his music are his intention. In a 1996 Guitar World interview, he described himself as [...] "a fan who writes songs" [...] and stated, [...] "I'm not saying, 'I'm the greatest songwriter in the world. Listen to me.' Usually, I'm <b>saying,</b> <b>These</b> are the greatest songwriters in the world. And I'm gonna put them all in this song"'. His response to critics about the topic of [...] "blatantly pinching riffs" [...] was, [...] "No, I don't feel guilty. But you feel pissed off because you didn't do it first." ...|$|E
500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason said Chris was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing to change your ideas.|$|E

[...] ("That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people as well."

We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business.

2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? Why do you keep <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E

He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hart Senate Office Building was {{completed}} in September 1982 {{at a cost of}} $137.7 million ($ in [...] dollars). The Architect of the Capitol argued that the significantly higher costs of the Hart Senate Office building were due to the unexpected excavation issues, the foundation construction errors, Senate-ordered changes, high inflation, and some mismanagement of the construction project. Architect of the Capitol George M. White argued the construction cost was a reasonable $110 per square foot. Architect John Carl Warnecke defended the building's cost, noting that it almost doubled in size (from [...] to [...] ), and that building costs in the District of Columbia leapt 76 percent during its erection. Warnecke dismissed allegations about Senate-ordered changes, <b>saying</b> <b>these</b> increased costs just 2 percent, and said that construction alone was just $107 million ($ in [...] dollars) (with another $28 million ($ in [...] dollars) coming from administrative costs, fees, and furnishings). He argued that excellent construction management held inflation in construction costs to just 67 percent, and that the building was erected at a cost of $97 per square foot, [...] "well below the costs of any other major public building built in the District during that period." [...] However, the American Institute of Architects said commercial construction costs in Washington, D.C., ranged from $54 to $65 per square foot, and The Christian Science Monitor reported the cost of the building at $137.70 per square foot.|$|E
