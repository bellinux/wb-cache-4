25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the {{phylloxera}} epidemic that devastated vineyards across Europe reached Portugal with similar devastation. Only the Ramisco vines {{planted in the}} sandy terrain of Colares escaped the destructive louse. Many wine regions, {{especially those in the}} south, never recovered and shifted their attention to other agricultural endeavors. Among the industries that took root was the raising and harvesting of cork material, with Portugal today being the world's biggest producer. Those who did replant, turned their attention to high-yielding varieties and French hybrids. The quality of wine produced from these grapes were relatively low and, outside the <b>steady</b> <b>market</b> for Port, the Portuguese wine industry faded out of the public attention.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, the Malden Lunatic Asylum {{was closed}} and its {{patients}} relocated to the London Lunatic Asylum as the Malden branch had always been considered a temporary location within the Provincial Lunatic Asylum system. The Fort remained relatively abandoned until 1875, except for a caretaker on staff to oversee the landscape and building maintenance. However, it should be mentioned that {{the closing of the}} asylum was a great detriment to the economy of the town of Amherstburg. For almost sixteen years the asylum acted as a <b>steady</b> <b>market</b> for locally produced goods. Additionally, the asylum was the single largest employer in 1861 for the town. As a result, while Fort Malden would serve several different functions throughout its history, it would always remain of utmost importance to Amherstburg’s economy and development engendered by and originating from its military days.|$|E

They can't compete with the great wheat farms of the West, which sometimes cover a whole county, and, of course, having so much, they can afford to sell it a great deal cheaper than you can here. And yet you go on, year after year, paying every cent you can rake and scrape for fertilizing drugs, and getting about a teacupful of wheat,--that is, proportionately speaking. I don't think this sort of thing should continue, Uncle Isham. It would be a great deal better to plough that field for pickles. Now there is a <b>steady</b> <b>market</b> for pickles, and, so far as I know, there are no pickle farms in the West." ...|$|E

5000|$|Official {{currency}} substitution helps to promote fiscal and monetary discipline and thus greater macroeconomic stability and lower inflation rates, to lower real exchange rate volatility, and possibly to deepen the financial system. Firstly, {{currency substitution}} helps developing countries, providing a firm commitment to stable monetary and exchange rate policies by forcing a passive monetary policy. Adopting a strong foreign currency as legal tender {{will help to}} [...] "eliminate the inflation-bias problem of discretionary monetary policy". Secondly, official currency substitution imposes stronger financial constraint on the government by eliminating deficit financing by issuing money. An empirical finding suggests that inflation has been significantly lower in economies with full currency substitution than nations with domestic currencies. The expected benefit of currency substitution is {{the elimination of the}} risk of exchange rate fluctuations and a possible reduction in the country's international exposure. Currency substitution cannot eliminate the risk of an external crisis but provides <b>steadier</b> <b>markets</b> as a result of eliminating fluctuations in exchange rates.|$|R

However, today, Kerala is almost self-sufficient in milk production. The credit for this largely goes to Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation and its three Regional Co-operative Milk Producers Unions, {{for the creation of a}} procurement and marketing network, introduction of quality products, customer friendly policies, modern management and most important of all the integrated co-operative participation by the farmers. The Statewide network of Dairy co-operatives now operating is doing yeoman service by assuring a <b>steady</b> <b>market</b> and stable price to dairy farmers for the milk produced by them.|$|E

50|$|Day-Elder Motors Corporation (1918-1937, {{also known}} as D.E.) was a {{manufacturer}} of trucks in Irvington, New Jersey. Production began in 1918. The company originated from the earlier National Motors Manufacturing Company, also of Irvington. The vehicles used proprietary engines, transmissions, and rear axles. The brand used a worm-gear final drive, leading to a smooth drive - this was considered enough of a selling argument that a worm gear was adopted as the brand's logo and heavily used in the brand's advertising. Day-Elder also had a <b>steady</b> <b>market</b> in fire trucks, and chassis were sold {{to be used as}} taxicabs in New York City.

40|$|To better {{understand}} price-setting behaviour in the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada's regional offices surveyed {{a representative sample}} of 170 firms between July 2002 and March 2003. The authors discuss the reasons behind the survey, the methodology used to develop the questionnaire and conduct the interviews, and summarize the results. The study also assessed several explanations for holding prices <b>steady</b> despite <b>market</b> pressures for a change. The survey findings indicate that prices in Canada are relatively flexible and have become more flexible over the past decade. Price stickiness was generally found to originate in firms' fears of antagonizing customers or disturbing the goodwill or reputation developed with them. A detailed discussion of the results includes a consideration of their implications for monetary policy. ...|$|R

50|$|Although Lewin {{was made}} an Associate of the Linnean Society, {{he was not}} part of the {{scientific}} milieu which surround significant naturalists such as Robert Brown, Sir Joseph Banks, or Alan Cunningham. Rather his training was that of a practical collector and artisan. He found it difficult to write about science - indeed his own text for Birds of New South Wales is naive and simple. Rather he excelled as an observer, and although never a great natural history artist, brought to his own work a keen sense of observation and design. Indeed, his interaction with Australian flora and fauna sharpened his eye and art: he moved from producing very conventional natural history illustrations in England to strongly composed images set in local context in Australia. While he did not succeed as a publisher or printmaker, his large scale natural history watercolours of exotic Australian plants and animals appears to have found a <b>steady</b> <b>market.</b> He also seems to have had ambitions to be considered a professional artist, as opposed to simply an illustrator: he noted in 1812 that he had painted a 15 x 18 foot image of a corroboree. Lewin appears to have permanently settled in Australia, where he was one of the few professional artists, a fact from which he gained socially and professionally.|$|E
