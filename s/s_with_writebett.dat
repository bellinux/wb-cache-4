40|$|Investigated the {{contribution}} of age, sex, panic disorder comorbidity, and levels of cortisol and prolactin in mediating the immune alterations found in major depressive episodes (MDEs) among 30 women and 25 men (mean age 43 yrs). Almost half of the Ss also had panic disorder. 55 age- and sex-matched Ss served as controls. Levels of cortisol and prolactin were elevated in female and younger <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> MDE and in <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> MDE and panic disorder. Prolactin levels, but not cortisol levels, were elevated in <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> MDE alone. A significant positive correlation was found in <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> MDE between cortisol plasma levels and total lymphocyte mitogen response, absolute T suppressors, and cells activated by dihydrotestosterone receptors.

The findings suggest that <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> OCD do not generally experience more frequent intrusions about possible harm than do controls, but that <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> OCD more frequently experience intrusions in specific situations: obsession-relevant situations and situations they find most problematic. There was found to be a generalized difference between <b>Ss</b> <b>with</b> OCD and controls in terms of frequency of actions taken to prevent potential harm following intrusions in situations that are obsession-relevant and obsession-irrelevant.
