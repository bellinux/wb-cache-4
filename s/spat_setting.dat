The flagellates Isochrysis galbana and Pavlova lutheri were used independently as larval food at a concentration of 5 cells/μl up to day 5 and the ration was doubled thereafter until <b>spat</b> <b>setting.</b> The initial larval density was 1 /ml. Straighthinge veliger stage (75 × 60 μm) was reached in 20 h, umbo stage (140 × 130 μm) on day 12, pediveliger (220 × 210 μm) on day 20 and plantigrade (260 × 240 μm) on day 23, and spat of 350 × 300 μm appeared on day 28. I. galbana promoted faster growth and early <b>spat</b> <b>setting</b> as compared to P. lutheri. The modal component of the larval population showed an average growth of 10. 98 μm/day. A total of 6. 3 % of the initial larval population metamorphosed as spat. Juveniles cultured in the laboratory showed a growth rate of 0. 09 mm/day. On transplantation to the culture raft in the farm, growth rate increased to 0. 4 mm/day. The juveniles suffered heavy mortality after 4 months. It remains to be tested whether P. margaritifera juveniles would have a greater chance of survival in oceanic island conditions, as the natural distribution of the species in India is confined to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands...|$|E

40|$|Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) {{populations in}} New Hampshire have {{experienced}} severe declines since the 1990 s, and restoration of oyster populations {{has been a}} major goal for New Hampshire management agencies. The most widely used technique in recent years in New Hampshire has been 2 ̆ 2 spat seeding 2 ̆ 2 which involves setting larvae from disease-resistant and/or fast-growth broodstock onto cultch material in large shore-based tanks, then distributing the spat attached to cultch onto the bottom to initiate reef restoration. This approach has the dual potential of providing direct population enhancement as well as introduction to the local gene pool of disease-resistance and/or fast-growth potential. Although spat seeding {{has been shown to be}} an effective technique much remains to be learned about the overall restoration process, particularly specific design criteria, the most effective combinations of methods, and long-term viability of 2 ̆ 2 restored 2 ̆ 2 bottom areas.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} the {{spatial and temporal}} demographic trends in oyster population dynamics and their relationships to freshwater inflows and the pathogen Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) on three reefs (Shell, Mad Island, and Sammy?s) in West Matagorda Bay, Texas. The objectives were to design and link three population models that simulate oyster population dynamics and integrate the environmental factors that influence growth, reproduction and settlement of larvae among these three reefs. The following variables were evaluated: relative abundance of oyster spat, submarket- and market-size oysters, average weighted incidence of Dermo and percent Dermo infection (prevalence) in submarket- and market-size oysters and their relationships to environmental variables of salinity, temperature, flow and distance from freshwater sources. Using a 30 -month continuous dataset, environmental variables accounted for 36 % {{of the variation in}} Dermo-related variables among the three reefs, and were also positively correlated with distance from freshwater sources. The relative abundance of spat and dead oysters was related to peaks in freshwater inflows occurring 30 days prior to larval settlement. Using these spatial and temporal relationships among biological and environmental variables, and data from five years of monitoring three reefs in Matagorda Bay, an integrated Stella model was developed that simulated oyster population responses to stochastic environmental changes over a 50 -year period. Although the geological and structural complexity of each reef appeared to be similar, the model showed the relationship of growth, spawning and <b>spat</b> <b>set</b> were related to hydrologic variation between different reefs and time periods. The model revealed that up-estuary reefs relied on the distribution of larvae from down-estuary reefs following mortality related to freshwater inflow. The model also indicated that loss of freshwater inflows to down-estuary reefs resulted in higher sustained Dermo infections, thus loss of spawning potential and subsequent distribution of larvae to up-estuary reefs. The three oyster populations in West Matagorda Bay provide spawning connectivity and function as an integrated resource for sustaining all oyster reef populations in this bay system. The model presented in this research provides a basis for understanding the population dynamics of WMB as well as {{a better understanding of the}} interaction among the reefs that sustain these populations. The model developed in this investigation provides a basis for developing oyster population models for other bay systems and for future research regarding hydrologic influences on oyster population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Collection of {{pearl oyster}} seed using {{artificial}} collectors {{is a critical}} step {{in the production of}} cultured pearls. This paper reports the seasonal abundance of macrofauna, which settled on <b>spat</b> collectors <b>set</b> to collect Pinctada margaritifera and Pteria penguin seed in shallow inshore areas at Kisite and Mombasa, Kenya. In both, settlement of macrofauna and bivalves was higher during the northeast monsoon season than the southeast monsoon season. Ascidiians and Sabellidae were significantly more abundant on collectors during the southeast monsoon season. A few bivalve species of commercial value including: P. penguin, Perna viridis and Anadara antiquata also settled on collectors during the southeast monsoon. Multivariate analysis showed the periods April-June and June-October presented significantly different macrofaunal assemblages in the open lagoon environment at Mombasa, whereas a significant difference occurred between assemblages settled during June-October and October-January in the channel environment in Tudor. Seven P. penguin specimens were obtained from 41 spat collectors in Kisite, whereas one P. margaritifera and three P. penguin specimens were obtained from 40 spat collectors deployed in Tudor Channel during the southeast monsoon period. From the results, settlement of P. margaritifera appears to be episodic and needs long term monitoring to determine the environmental and oceanographic conditions that are associated with its recruitment, whereas P. Penguin settlement occurred mainly during the southeast monsoon season...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in Sapian Bay, Capiz from November 1975 to December 1976 with samplings conducted fortnightly. Histological studies on the gonad reveal {{a high percentage of}} ripe and spent females during the month of April and May, and ripe to near ripe during November to December. However, larval counts were highest on February 25, 1976 with 253 mytilid larvae per haul compared to 0 - 79 per haul during all other months. The high larval count was followed by the highest spat settlement during the next sampling period two weeks later, with the <b>spat</b> collector <b>set</b> in the water during the February 25 sampling. The four materials tested, blue polypropylene fiber rope, black polypropylene fiber, and coir rope, all had their highest spat counts during this period with an average of 471 spats per standard 10 cm rope piece. The range during the other time periods is 2 - 283 spats. Of the 4 materials tested, the black fibrillated polypropylene film had the highest larval counts in 15 {{out of a total of}} 25 sampling periods. The blue rope was the poorest spat collector. Coconut husk was tested later on and it proved to have a very high catchability, with spats completely enveloping the husk surface. Growth monitored from one cohort in Sapian Bay averaged 10 mm per month. 50 - 60 mm is considered marketable size. Trial growth experiments with transplanted mussels were also conducted at Igang Bay in Guimaras Island, Makato River in Aklan, and a milkfish pond in Leganes, Iloilo. Survival in Igang was less than 50 % after the second week, and the condition of the surviving mussels can be described only as 'watery' with the mantle completely transparent. Mortality was minimal in Makato but the growth rate was only 30 % that of Sapian Bay. The pond experiments were terminated due to severe crab predation...|$|R
40|$|Previous surveys (1996 to 2002) {{provided}} {{distribution and}} abundance data for soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) populations in ten {{areas of the}} Great Bay and Piscataqua River estuaries identified as potentially good clam habitat. The present {{study was designed to}} complete the overall survey by sampling six remaining areas: Weeks Point, Brackett 2 ̆ 7 s Point, Squamscott River mouth, Moody Point, Herods Cove, and Upper Little Bay (western shore). The objectives of the present project were to: (1) visually inspect the six study areas for the general distribution of sediment types and soft-shell clams, (2) quantitatively sample the six areas to determine densities of soft-shell clams, (3) produce GIS maps based on the survey data, and (4) assess clam distributions considering data from the present study and previous research. At each of the six sampling areas, the approximate boundary of 2 ̆ 2 potential clam habitat 2 ̆ 2 (=intertidal soft sediments) was determined by visual inspection at low tide. Notes were made on changes in major sediment types, the presence of clam siphon holes, and empty clam shells. At each site, nine to fourteen 0. 125 m 2 quadrats were haphazardly tossed onto the sediment surface, excavated to at least 20 cm depth using clam rakes, and all excavated sediments washed through a 5 mm mesh sieve. All clams retained on the sieve were measured (shell length to nearest mm with calipers), counted, and returned to the general area. A sample of the upper 5 cm of sediment was collected from each quadrat and stored at Jackson Estuarine Laboratory. Quadrat locations were geo-referenced using DGPS. The general environmental conditions in all six areas appeared suitable as soft-shell clam habitat. However, very few live clams were collected and very few empty shells were observed. From a total of 65 excavated quadrats, only 8 live clams were collected with mean densities ranging from 0. 0 to 3. 1 /m 2 at the six sites. It was concluded that none of the six areas were productive clam flats at the time of sampling, and they probably had not been in the recent past. Previous research and the present study indicate that many of the expansive intertidal flats in the Great Bay/Piscataqua River system have not been productive clam habitat for decades, probably since at least the 1940 s in some areas. However, moderate to high densities of clams have been reported in some areas, particularly in sandy sediments. Previous research also showed high densities of early post-set clams in some areas, suggesting that spat mortality (probably predation effects) may be an important cause of low densities of larger clams in these areas. Future research should focus on sandy sediments and mixed soft sediments with cobble to better characterize the distribution and abundance of clams in the Great Bay/Piscataqua River system. Future research also should assess the role of predation on newly <b>set</b> <b>spat</b> in controlling clam populations...|$|R
