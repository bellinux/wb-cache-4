500|$|The {{context-sensitive}} attacks received {{praise and}} criticism. Antista said, [...] " [...] fans will {{be thankful for}} is the triumphant return of the contextual attacks", but added that the control limitations were the [...] "only real problem", as {{the sensitivity of the}} cursor button can result in a failed combo, [...] "And the jump button <b>sends</b> <b>you</b> forward in the direction you're facing automatically." [...] Buchanan noted that the contextual attacks [...] "can prove frustratingly tricky as you have a brief amount of time to input the commands, but the controls on most handsets are quite small".|$|E

Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{complained that the}} attack [...] "frequently <b>sends</b> <b>you</b> careening off into nothingness, resulting in cheap death after cheap death." [...] Nintendo Power, X-Play, Eurogamer, Official Xbox Magazine, and GameSpy agreed. Other complaints focused on the mechanics of weapons and vehicles. Greg Mueller of GameSpot felt that the guns were nearly useless {{because of a lack}} of a target lock or manual aim, combined with an ineffective auto-aim. IGN staff writer Matt Casamassina, 1UP.com staff writer Greg Sewart, Game Informer, X-Play, GameSpy, and London's The Times also criticized the mechanics of Shadow's weapons, vehicles, and other aspects of the game's controls. However, Thomason claimed that [...] "blasting Shadow's foes with the wide variety of weapons at his disposal is just plain fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|A decisive clash did {{not take}} place however but {{negotiations}} instead- with final outcomes that saw major concessions being granted to an enemy of Rome. The Meroitic diplomats were invited to confer with the Roman emperor Augustus himself on the Greek island of Samos where he was headquartered temporarily. That the Kushites did not appear as beaten supplicants is suggested by the aggressive message brought to the Romans by the envoys of Meroe. A bundle of golden arrows was presented with the envoys reputedly saying: [...] "The Candace <b>sends</b> <b>you</b> these arrows. If you want peace, they are a token of her friendship and warmth. If you want war, you are going to need them." [...] Roman interests appeared focused on maintaining a quiet southern border in Egypt, and during negotiations, Augustus granted the Kushite envoys all they asked for, and also cancelled the tribute earlier demanded by Rome. Premmis (Qasr Ibrim), and areas north of Qasr Ibrim in the southern portion of the [...] "Thirty-Mile Strip"] were ceded to the Kushites, the Dodekaschoinos was established as a buffer zone, and Roman forces were pulled back to the old Greek Ptolemaic border at Maharraqa. [...] Roman emperor Augustus signed the treaty with the Kushites on Samos. The settlement bought Rome peace and quiet on its Egyptian frontier, and increased the prestige of Roman Emperor Augustus, demonstrating his skill and ability to do business with the distant Kushites, who a short time earlier had been fighting his troops. The respect accorded the emperor by the Kushite envoys as the deal was signed also created a favorable impression with other foreign ambassadors present on Samos, including envoys from India, and strengthened Augustus' hand in upcoming negotiations with the powerful Parthians.The settlement ushered in a period of peace between the two empires for around three centuries. Inscriptions erected by Queen Amanirenas on an ancient temple at Hamadab, south of Meroe, record the war and the favorable outcome for the Kushites. Along with his signature on the official treaty, Roman emperor Augustus marked the agreement by directing his administrators to collaborate with regional priests in the erection of a temple at Dendur, and inscriptions depict the emperor himself celebrating local deities.|$|E
2500|$|The Abbé's {{positions}} {{towards the}} Church and the Vatican also brought controversy. His positions {{on social issues}} and engagements were at times explicitly socialist and opposed to the Church. [...] He maintained {{a relationship with the}} progressive French Catholic Bishop Jacques Gaillot, to which he recalled his duty of [...] "instinct of a measured insolence", He didn't like Mother Teresa. Despite her work for the poor her strict adherence to Catholic teaching on morality did not sit well with Abbé Pierre's left wing ideology. He had difficult relations with the Vatican. L'Osservatore Romano not known for reporting the deaths of priests did not report on his death right away in 2007. Even though it is not customary for the Pope to offer condolences on the death of individual priests Abbé Pierre's supporters were heavily critical of Pope Benedict XVI for not making an exception. Father Lombardi, spokesman of the Vatican, pointed journalists to the statement made by the French Church, while Benedict XVI did mention his death in private audiences. An official reactions from the Church came in two interviews of French cardinals, Roger Etchegaray and Paul Poupard. His criticism of what he considered the lavish lifestyle of the Vatican got him a lot of publicity, especially when he reproached John Paul II his expensive travels, this was despite the fact that John Paul lived a very simple life and was well received especially by the poor during his travels, were not well received by the public. Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone lauded his [...] "action in favor of poor": [...] "Informed of the death of Abbe Pierre, the Holy Father gives thanks for his activity in favor of the poorest, by which he bore witness to the charity that comes from Christ. Entrusting to divine mercy this priest whose whole life was dedicated to fighting poverty, he asks the Lord to welcome him into the peace of His kingdom. By way of comfort and hope, His Holiness <b>sends</b> <b>you</b> a heartfelt apostolic blessing, which he extends to the family of the departed, to members of the communities of Emmaus, and to everyone gathering for the funeral." ...|$|E
