50|$|In {{professional}} sports, the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>athletes</b> are secured via {{an exclusive}} contract with an organization. By comparison, {{the services of}} many college athletes are secured through recruiting services established by the athletic departments which include staff members and influential friends of the institutions. The college athlete normally signs an exclusive contract, such as the NLI, {{at the expense of}} losing a year's eligibility if he chooses to transfer to another institution of his choosing. The NLI program is subscribed to by all major athletic conferences and nearly all-independent universities. NCAA Division I is likely to create its own NLI for each sport and, in addition, designate a different signing date for each sport {{in order to reduce the}} time and expense incurred when the recruiting season is overly long. Since success or failure in recruiting is seen as a precursor of a team's future prospects, many college sports fans follow it as closely as the team's actual games and it also provides a way to be connected to the team during the off season. Fans' desire for information has spawned a $1,000,000 industry, which first developed extensively during the 1980s. Prior to the Internet, popular recruiting services used newsletters and pay telephone numbers to disseminate information. Since the mid-1990s, many online recruiting websites have offered fans player profiles, scouting videos, player photos, statistics, interviews; and other information, including rankings of both a player and a team's recruiting class. Most of these websites charge for their information.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 3. 8 million sport and recreation-related head injuries occurring {{each year in}} the United States, which excludes head traumas not involving a loss of consciousness. Many of these head injuries occur at the high school and collegiate competition levels, where coaches have been found to take on greater responsibilities for athlete health and safety by making return-to-play decisions after athletes sustain head injuries without the help of an athletic trainer or medical provider. In <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>athlete</b> safety, it is necessary to ensure that coaches are adequately informed and trained in concussion symptom recognition and return-to-play recommendations. In an attempt to examine such knowledge, an online survey was distributed to 321 coaches nationwide. Results indicated a significant difference between coaches who received concussion management education {{and those who did not}} on a symptom identification difference score. No other significant differences were found. However, descriptive analyses of qualitative and quantitative data suggest that concussion knowledge translation – as indicated on a symptom identification difference score – is low.

40|$|The {{consequences}} {{of coping with}} death as an athlete have been documented in the literature {{by a variety of}} studies. However, these studies have remained largely focused on coping with the death of a teammate. This study examined the inter- and intrapersonal impact of experiencing the death of a head coach. Experiencing the death of a head coach during the season may have profound and varied psychosocial consequences for all members of a team. A collegiate team was identified as having experienced the death of its head coach during his tenure and from that team five participants (four players and one assistant coach) shared their stories during semi-structured interviews which were thematically analyzed. Major emergent themes from the interviews suggested that: members of the team experience bereavement differently which may have interpersonal consequences during a shared tragedy; memorials and tributes {{play a significant role in}} the process of individual and collective bereavement; and members of the team will make an effort to continue the presence of the deceased individual as well as perpetuate their memory in various ways. These results add breadth to the slowly growing literature that documents the effect that a death has on athletes.
