40|$|Quantum chaotic {{states over}} a noncommutative monoid, a unitalization of a noncommutative Ito algebra parametrizing a quantum {{stochastic}} Levy process, {{are described in}} terms of their infinitely divisible generating functionals over the monoid-valued processes on an atomless `space-time' set. A canonical decomposition of the logarithmic conditionally posive-definite generating functional is constructed in a pseudo-Euclidean space, given by a quadruple defining the monoid triangular operator representation and a cyclic zero pseudo-norm state in this space. It is shown that the exponential representation in the corresponding pseudo-Fock space yields the infinitely-divisible generating functional with respect to the exponential state vector, and its compression to the Fock space defines the cyclic infinitly-divisible representation associated with the Fock vacuum state. The structure of states on an arbitrary Ito algebra is studied with two canonical examples of quantum Wiener and Poisson states. A generalized quantum stochastic nonadapted multiple integral is explicitly defined in Fock scale, its continuity and quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>differentiability</b> is proved. A unified non-adapted and functional quantum Ito formula is discovered and established both in weak and strong sense, and the multiplication formula on the exponential Ito algebra is found for the relatively bounded kernel-operators in Fock scale. The unitarity and projectivity properties of nonadapted quantum stochastic linear differential equations are studied, and their solution is constructed for the locally bounded nonadapted generators in terms of the chronological products in the underlying kernel algebra canonically represented by triangular operators in the pseudo-Fock space.
