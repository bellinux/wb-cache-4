40|$|This paper proposes the use {{of genetic}} {{programming}} for the mathematical formulation of knitted fabric <b>spirality.</b> Both dry relaxed and wash-and-dry relaxed states of fabric <b>spirality</b> are studied. In total, six parameters are investigated, in which three parameters are derived from yarn and fabric, {{and the other three}} parameters are from the knitted condition. The three yarn and fabric parameters used are yarn twist liveliness, tightness factor and dyeing method, and the three knitting parameters are the number of feeders, rotational direction and gauge. Genetic programming is adopted to formulize the mathematical relationships between above the six parameters and two states of fabric <b>spirality,</b> respectively. For a comparison, a multiple linear regression approach is studied as well. The formulas generated by genetic programming and multiple regression for two states of <b>spirality</b> are comprehensively investigated and compared.

One of the major problems encountered in knitted fabric is <b>spirality.</b> It affects particularly single jersey fabric and presents a serious problem during garment confection and use. So controlling <b>spirality</b> is a basic requirement for producing quality knitted fabric.

40|$|The Galaxy Zoo has {{provided}} morphological data on many galaxies. Several biases {{have been identified}} in the Galaxy Zoo data. Here we report on a newly discovered selection effect: astronomers interested in studying spiral galaxies may select a set of spiral galaxies based upon a threshold in <b>spirality</b> (the fraction of Galaxy Zoo humans who report seeing spiral structure). SpArcFiRe is an automated tool that decomposes a spiral galaxy into its constituent spiral arms, providing objective, quantitative data on their structure. SpArcFiRe measures the pitch angle of spiral arms. We have observed that when selecting a set of spiral galaxies based on a threshold on <b>spirality,</b> the pitch angle of spiral arms appear increase with redshift. We hypothesize that this is a selection effect: tightly-wound spiral arms become less visible as images degrade with increasing redshift, leading to fewer such galaxies being included in the sample at higher redshifts. We corroborate this hypothesis by artificially degrading images of nearby galaxies, then using a machine learning algorithm trained on Galaxy Zoo data to provide a <b>spirality</b> for each artificially degraded image. It correctly predicts that <b>spirality</b> decreases as image quality degrades. Thus, the mean pitch angle of those galaxies remaining above the <b>spirality</b> threshold is higher than those eliminated by the selection effect. This demonstrates that users who select samples of galaxies using a threshold of Galaxy Zoo votes must carefully consider the possibility of selection effects on morphological measures, even if the measure itself is believed to be objective and unbiased. Finally, we also perform an empirical sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that SpArcFiRe's output changes in a smooth and predictable fashion to changes in its internal algorithmic parameters.

Computation time is typically {{on the order}} of 2 minutes per galaxy, assuming at least 8 GB of working memory. We tested the code using 117 synthetic spiral images with known pitches, varying both the spiral properties and the input parameters. The code yielded correct results for all synthetic spirals with galaxy-like properties. We also compared the code's results to two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2 DFFT) measurements for the sample of nearby galaxies defined by DMS PPak.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a spiral arterial blood flow pattern in humans has been widely accepted. It is believed that this spiral component of the blood flow alters arterial haemodynamics in {{both positive and negative}} ways. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of spiral flow on haemodynamic changes in aorta–renal bifurcations. In this regard, a computational fluid dynamics analysis of pulsatile blood flow was performed in two idealised models of aorta–renal bifurcations with and without flow diverter. The results show that the <b>spirality</b> effect causes a substantial variation in blood velocity distribution, while causing only slight changes in fluid shear stress patterns. The dominant observed effect of spiral flow is on turbulent kinetic energy and flow recirculation zones. As spiral flow intensity increases, the rate of turbulent kinetic energy production decreases, reducing the region of potential damage to red blood cells and endothelial cells. Furthermore, the recirculation zones which form on the cranial sides of the aorta and renal artery shrink in size in the {{presence of}} <b>spirality</b> effect; this may lower the rate of atherosclerosis development and progression in the aorta–renal bifurcation.
