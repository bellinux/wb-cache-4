In July 2010, it was announced that HCI would be developing a school in the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City in Guangzhou, China, akin to that of its first satellite campus, following the inking of a memorandum of understanding (MOU). This would see HCI partnering a top local school for exchange and mutual learning programmes.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E

The open long ray is like the real line (or {{equivalently}} an open half-line) except <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much longer in one direction: we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long at one end and short (open) at the other.

5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells {{him that he was}} the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal is sealed, and Illusia is restored.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to {{a fork in the}} road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, Ahalya is {{depicted}} as a romantic adulteress. When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she {{falls in love with}} Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya's marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not the right day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E

5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not clear what is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E

50|$|The Laurentian was {{a society}} of Trinity College, Dublin, created during the {{academic}} year 1952-3.

25|$|Among the {{reactions}} of the British Columbia and Canadian government was taking away Freedomite children and placing them in an internment center in New Denver.

25|$|In the United States, Adult Swim has {{frequently}} aired adult animation features, anime, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, live-action, and pilots. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence; in other words, programs {{that would be}} deemed inappropriate if aired during the day on Cartoon Network, when children would be watching. While the network features comedic and dramatic programs of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Thus, Adult Swim has {{become a source of}} conflict, with some <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 has two conserved domains and a coiled-coil region. The {{first is}} the COG5134 domain which {{is found to be}} conserved in {{cucumbers}} and likely plays a role in the function of the protein because it is always the most highly conserved region in any multiple sequence alignment. It spans approximately the first 170 amino acids of the protein. The other domain is the DUF572 domain, which is a eukaryotic domain of unknown function that is shared by all of the orthologs and a majority of the more distant homologs. This domain doesn't have a defined range, as different sources have reported different lengths, some <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the entire protein. The coiled-coil region is from 182-214 in the human protein and is rich in charged amino acids. The modified residues are also very well conserved.|$|E
25|$|In his Policy Statement, {{introduced}} to the Riksdag on 3 October 2014, Löfven said that his Government would recognize the State of Palestine. On 30 October 2014 the Government, through Minister for Foreign Affairs Margot Wallström, announced that the Government had decided to officially recognize the State of Palestine and explained the recognition by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the only solution {{to get to a}} two-state solution between Israel and the State of Palestine. Sweden is the first country within the European Union to do so after gaining membership (with other members, such as Poland, withholding recognition previously issued under Communist rule). Israel called the move unconsidered and Israel recalled its ambassador, Isaac Bachman, following the recognition. Bachman returned to Sweden on 29 November 2014. In December 2015 Löfven caused an outrage in Israel by claiming that stabbing attacks are not considered terrorism by international standards. Later he reiterated himself, explaining that it is now known that the stabbing attacks are sanctioned by some terror organisations.|$|E
