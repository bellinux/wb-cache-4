5000|$|In 1885 the Post Office {{established}} a <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> service, issuing a ten-cent stamp depicting a running messenger, {{along with the}} wording [...] "secures immediate <b>delivery</b> at a <b>special</b> <b>delivery</b> office." [...] Initially, only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U. S. Post Offices were obliged to provide the service—an extension not, however, reflected on the <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> stamp until 1888, when the words [...] "at any post office" [...] appeared on its reprint. (On stamps of future years, the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a bicycle 1902 a motorcycle 1922 and a truck 1925. Although the last new U.S. <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> stamp appeared issued in 1971, the service was continued until 1997, by which time it had largely been supplanted by Priority Mail delivery, introduced in 1989.) The 1885 <b>Special</b> <b>Delivery</b> issue was the first U.S. postage stamp designed in the double-width format. Eight years later, this shape would be chosen for the Columbian Exposition commemoratives, as it offered appropriate space for historical tableaux. The double-width layout would subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives.|$|R
