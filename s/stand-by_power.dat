40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to analyze and {{optimize}} the <b>stand-by</b> component of <b>power</b> in digital circuits designed for portable and battery-powered applications. Since these circuits remain in stand-by (or sleep) mode significantly longer than in active mode, their stand-by current, and not their active switching current, determines their battery life. Hence, stringent specifications are being placed on the stand-by (or leakage) current drawn by such devices. As the power supply voltage is reduced, the threshold voltage of transistors is scaled down to maintain a constant switching speed. Since reducing the threshold voltage increases the leakage of a device exponentially, leakage current has become a dominant factor {{in the design of}} VLSI circuits. In this paper, we describe a method that uses simultaneous dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) to reduce the total power consumption of a processor under dynamic computational workloads. Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as a function of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. Given these models, we show how to derive an analytical expression for the optimal trade-off between supply voltage and body bias, given a required clock frequency and duration of operation. The proposed method is then applied to a processor and is compared with DVS alone for workloads obtained using real-time monitoring of processor utilization for four typical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} link {{power converters}} for DC – 3 Φ AC applications are investigated. Low cost, reduced size, galvanic isolation and efficient large boosting of voltage level {{are the key}} motivations behind the selection of such topologies. This thesis proposes high frequency link 3 Φ inverters for three wire and four wire systems. The proposed topologies have the simplest power circuit configuration and commutation requirements among all high frequency link topologies reported in the literature. A full load efficiency greater than 90 % is achieved with a passive snubber. The effect of various circuit non-idealities are common and important for desirable performances of these topologies. A few such issues are highlighted. Firstly, the special commutation requirement of the power circuit causes a non-linear distortion in the output voltages and thus makes the gain of the power converter time varying. A simple compensation technique is adopted to mitigate the problem. Secondly, the high frequency transformer should operate with only switching frequency component. However, in the practical situations {{a significant amount of}} low frequency component gets injected into the transformer and results in peaky transformer magnetizing current unless it is over designed. A suitable measure is incorporated in the proposed topologies to achieve a magnetic protection. The power circuit topology is used as <b>stand-by</b> AC <b>power</b> supply. These are of interest for Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and Micro-grid applications. One of the main objectives of such supplies is to provide a high quality and highly reliable power to the connected loads. A voltage regulation loop based on proportional + multiresonant controller is proposed to achieve excellent quality of the output voltage with unbalanced and nonlinear loadings. The factors influencing regulation and stability of the voltage waveform are identified and necessary modifications are carried out to improve the performance. The potential of this voltage regulation loop along with P/Q droop technique and a simple resistive virtual output impedance loop is exploited to achieve decentralized paralleling of inverters. A trade off between the output voltage power quality and the sharing accuracy is examined. The total harmonic distortion and degree of unbalance in the output voltage waveform are experimentally measured well below the speciﬁed limit for stand alone AC supplies with an excellent sharing accuracy. Some of the grid interactive modes are addressed for the completeness of the work. A shunt compensator system and a double conversion system based on the same high frequency link converter are experimentally evaluated. These systems can find their application in UPS systems.
