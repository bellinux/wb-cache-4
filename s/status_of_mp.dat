The oath {{as one of the}} elements of the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> of Ukraine has been studied. The author has realized general analysis of the oath institution in the light of one of the foundations of the relationship of a person, who is appointed to a position within state agencies (in the broad sense), and the state itself? the principle of loyalty (faith) to the society and the state. It is stated that today taking the oath is an inherent part of any cooperation of an official and the state. Comparative analysis of the oath of MP of Ukraine and a judge has been made. It is indicated that the provisions of the current constitutional legislation of Ukraine governing the matters of the oath of MP in the part of the need to its compliance, in fact have no features of normativity. Therefore, parliamentary oath has become into only declarative, symbolic and ceremonial institution of constitutional law. It actually does not involve (in the case of its break or non-compliance) for MP of Ukraine any legal consequences in the form of disciplinary or early termination of parliamentary powers. It is emphasized on the significant impact of such oath element as the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>MP,</b> as the powers and guarantee of the activities. Based on the systematic analysis the author has grounded the final conclusion about the necessity of a clear constitutional and legal regulation of the oath of MP of Ukraine in order to transform it from a formal institution to legal category, which defines the content of the activities, ethical and legal foundations of the conduct both in the Parliament and on its beyond. ??????????? ??????? ??? ???? ?? ????????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????. ???????? ????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? ????? ??????????????? ????, ??????? ???????????? ?? ??????????????? ??????

Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Perception of Scottish national consciousness and class consciousness. Questions are aimed at assessing the stronger concept (i. e. class or 'Scottishness'). Closeness of identity with England is also assessed together with perceived differences between the Scottish and the English: points of comparison between the two national characters, jobs that the English are seen to do better than the Scots (and vice versa) and whether preferences should be given to Scots over English in filling job or position vacancies. One question asks to which country, England or Canada, the respondent would prefer to move. Scottish politics: attitudes towards the amount of say that Scots have in British government matters affecting Scotland, whether any changes should be made in the present arrangements (i. e. attitudes towards devolution of political power, or the establishment of an independent parliament), attitudes towards the 'national' <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>MPs</b> for Scottish constituencies - whether such representatives should always be Scottish themselves. Information given includes voting behaviour (in the last general and council elections), daily newspaper readership, a self-assessment of political interest (check questions ask for the correct identification of national and local political personalities). In addition there is a record of perceptions of police fairness and the motives of local councillors in serving on council.

40|$|PURPOSE. A Th 1 -type immune {{response}} was detected in allotransplanted, rejected corneas. Because the intracellular thiol redox <b>status</b> <b>of</b> antigen-presenting cells (APCs) reportedly regulates the Th 1 /Th 2 balance through distinctive cytokine production by APCs, {{this study was}} conducted to investigate the effect of the intracellular thiol redox <b>status</b> <b>of</b> macrophages (<b>Mps)</b> on corneal allograft survival. METHODS. N,N�-diacetyl-L-cystine dimethylester (NACOMe) 2 was injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice to induce Mps with a low intracellular glutathione content (icGSH). Corneal grafts from C 57 BL/ 10 (H- 2 b), B 10. D 2 (H- 2 d), and DBA/ 2 (H- 2 d) donor mice were placed on neovascularized BALB/c graft beds for assessment. B 10. D 2 -grafted recipients were evaluated for donor-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and the cytokines produced by their lymphocytes were examined (IFN-�, IL- 4, and IL- 10). In other experiments, naïve BALB/c mice, injected intravenously with <b>Mps</b> <b>of</b> low icGSH content, received B 10. D 2 corneal grafts. RESULTS. In (NACOMe) 2 -treated mice, 13 of 20 B 10. D 2 grafts and 6 of 10 DBA/ 2 grafts survived indefinitely. No grafts survived in the control mice (P � 0. 0001). (NACOMe) 2 treatment did not enhance C 57 BL/ 10 graft survival. At 2 weeks after B 10. D 2 grafting, control mice exhibited DTH, but (NACOMe) 2 -treated mice did not (P � 0. 01). Lymphocytes from (NACOMe) 2 -treated mice did not respond to donor splenocytes. Those of control mice showed Th 1 -type cytokine secretion. The intravenous transfer <b>of</b> peritoneal <b>Mps</b> from (NA-COMe) 2 -treated mice prolonged corneal allograft survival (P � 0. 003).

40|$|Macrophages (Mp) are {{implicated in}} both {{early and late}} phases in type 1 {{diabetes}} development. Recent study has suggested that a balance between reductive Mp (RMp) and oxidative Mp (OMp) is possible to regulate T H 1 /TH 2 balance. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the redox <b>status</b> <b>of</b> peritoneal <b>Mp</b> and its cytokine profile during the development of autoimmune diabetes induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin in BALB/c mice. Meanwhile, the polarization of TH 1 /TH 2 of splenocytes or thymocytes was also examined. We found that peritoneal Mp appeared as an "incomplete" OMp phenotype with decreased icGSH along with disease progression. The OMp showed reduced TNF-¿, IL- 12, and NO production as well as defective phagocytosis activity compared to nondiabetic controls; however, there was no significant difference with IL- 6 production. On the other hand, the levels of IFN-¿ or IL- 4 of splenocytes in diabetic mice were significantly higher compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN-¿ to IL- 4 was also higher at the early stage of diabetes and then declined several weeks later after the occurrence of diabetes, suggesting a pathogenetic TH 1 phenotype from the beginning gradually to a tendency of TH 2 during the development of diabetes. Our results implied that likely OMp may be relevant in the development of type 1 diabetes; however, it is not likely the only factor regulating the TH 1 H/T H 2 balance in MLD-STZ-induced diabetic mice...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diagnosis <b>of</b> Mycoplasma pneumoniae (<b>MP)</b> {{infection}} is traditionally based on serology, which may {{require more than}} two weeks for diagnostic antibodies to develop. PCR-based methods offer earlier diagnosis. During a community outbreak <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> infection, we compared seminested and real-time PCR of oropharyngeal swabs with serology for diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> infection at different time points after disease onset. PCR-positive individuals were followed longitudinally to assess the persistence <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> DNA in throat secretions. We also studied carriage <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> among household contacts and school children. Results: MP infection was diagnosed in 48 of 164 patients with respiratory tract infection. Fortyfive (29 %) had detectable MP DNA in oropharynx. A significant increase in MP IgG IgG titre or MP IgM antibodies was detected in 44 / 154 (27 %) subjects. Two MP PCR-positive patients lacked antibody responses. Sera were missing from another two patients. The agreement between serology and PCR was good,. = 0. 90. During the first three weeks after disease onset the performance of PCR was excellent and all patients but one were detected. In contrast, only 21 % of the patients with confirmed MP infection were positive by serum 1 during the first symptomatic week (56 % during the second and 100 % during the third week). Only 1 / 237 (0. 4 %) school children was positive by PCR. This child had respiratory symptoms. Eighteen of 22 (75 %) symptomatic household contacts were MP PCR positive. Persistence <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> DNA in the throat was common. Median time for carriage <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> DNA was 7 weeks after disease onset (range 2 days- 7 months). Adequate antibiotic treatment did not shorten the period of persistence. Bacterial load, measured by quantitative real-time PCR declined gradually, and all followed patients eventually became PCR-negative. Conclusion: PCR is superior to serology for diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> infection during the early phases of infection. Persistent, sometimes long-term, carriage <b>of</b> <b>MP</b> DNA in the throat is common following acute infection, and is not affected by antibiotic therapy.
