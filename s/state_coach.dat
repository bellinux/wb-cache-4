5|$|Adjacent to {{the palace}} is the Royal Mews, also {{designed}} by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the Gold <b>State</b> <b>Coach,</b> are housed. This rococo gilt coach, designed by SirWilliam Chambers in 1760, has painted panels by G. B. Cipriani. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by GeorgeIII in 1762 and {{has been used by}} the monarch for every coronation since GeorgeIV. It was last used for the Golden Jubilee of ElizabethII. Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis {{attended}} Ohio State University, {{where he}} joined the track and football teams. He {{was part of a}} Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio <b>State</b> <b>coach,</b> Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.|$|E
5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved {{the ball to the}} NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard field goal with four seconds remaining. Though NC <b>State</b> <b>coach</b> Dick Sheridan called a timeout in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E

5|$|Al Ward {{replaced}} Ewbank {{as general}} manager in 1975. The Jets won four of their five preseason games, though sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi, in his history of the Jets, notes that the wins were secured by playing first-string players while the other teams were trying out rookies and backups. When the regular season started, the Jets lost seven of their first nine games, and Winner was fired. Offensive coordinator Ken Shipp became interim head coach, and the Jets finished {{with a record of}} 3–11. Running back John Riggins, who became the first 1,000-yard rusher in franchise history during the season and made the Pro Bowl, departed for the Washington Redskins as he felt the Jets' Namath-led offense passed the ball too often. New York hired North Carolina <b>State</b> <b>coach</b> Lou Holtz. With New York enduring the second of three consecutive 3–11 seasons (two wins came over the 2–12 Bills and a third over the 0–14 expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Holtz—who went on to great success at Notre Dame—resigned with one game left in the season to become head coach at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida <b>State</b> <b>coach</b> Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|When the Anteaters {{defeated}} the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on November 14, 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first {{experience in the}} 2K Sports Classic. His blocked shots total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on December 28, 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach <b>State,</b> <b>coach</b> Dan Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye {{was sitting on the}} bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time in}} the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite its}} Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly {{a metaphor for}} Belgium, with Syldavian King Muskar XII {{physically}} resembling King Leopold III of Belgium. Hergé's decision to create a fictional East European kingdom might {{have been influenced by}} Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) and which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites: the Diplodocus in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia - a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII's carriage is based on the British Royal Family's Gold <b>State</b> <b>Coach.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{procession}} included foreign royalty {{and heads}} of state riding to Westminster Abbey in various carriages, so many that volunteers ranging from wealthy businessmen to rural landowners were required to supplement the insufficient ranks of regular footmen. The first royal coach left Buckingham Palace and moved down the Mall, which was filled with flag-waving and cheering crowds. It {{was followed by the}} Irish <b>State</b> <b>Coach</b> carrying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who wore the circlet of her crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Queen Elizabeth II proceeded through London from Buckingham Palace, through Trafalgar Square, and towards the abbey in the Gold <b>State</b> <b>Coach.</b> Attached to the shoulders of her dress, the Queen wore the Robe of State, a 6-yard (5.5metre) long, hand woven silk velvet cloak lined with Canadian ermine that required the assistance of the Queen's maids of honour—Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Moyra Hamilton, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill and the Duchess of Devonshire—to carry.|$|E
25|$|With under 3 {{minutes to}} go in the first quarter, Oregon <b>State</b> <b>coach</b> Mike Riley took a chance by going for it on fourth-and-1 at his own 43, and {{converted}} with Jacquizz Rodgers going for five yards. On the next play, the Beavers faked a dive to Jacquizz and handed instead to James Rodgers on a reverse, then watched him dash in front of the Beavers' bench for a 52-yard touchdown.|$|E
