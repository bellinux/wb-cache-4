She objected both to his {{description}} of the union between mind and body, and that virtue and moral truths <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> to be grasped by something other than the intellect (despite Descartes's assertion that all truths must be grasped intellectually).|$|E
25|$|Not all {{affected}} patients <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> a regular preventive plasma infusion therapy, especially as some reach longterm remission without it. Regular plasma infusions are necessary {{in patients with}} frequent relapses and in general situations with increased risk to develop an acute episode (as seen above) such as pregnancy. Plasma infusions are given usually {{every two to three}} weeks to prevent acute episodes of USS but are often individually adapted.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{decline in}} Antarctic krill biomass {{may have been}} caused by the reduction of the pack ice zone due to global warming. Antarctic krill, especially {{in the early stages of}} development, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.|$|E

I'm not one for playing all over a track if I can't see a genuine need for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{characters}} {{could be}} from an Almodovar movie as they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> {{to behave in}} extraordinary ways in order to draw some sexual, psychological advantage... The use of subjective camera movement, composition and mirrored reflections are effective in conveying {{a real sense of}} false perceptions... The collaborations of Roberto Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi make them the future wave as these two engaging directors bring together fresh insight with redesigned camera work." [...] From Dickie Kings review at MTG, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{two dozen}} of the 92 {{naturally}} occurring chemical elements are essential to various kinds of biological life. Most rare elements on Earth are not needed by life (exceptions being [...] selenium and iodine), while a few common ones (aluminum and titanium) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, {{but there are a}} few differences between plants and animals. For example, ocean algae use bromine, but land plants and animals <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> none. All animals require sodium, but some plants do not. Plants need boron and silicon, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} July, her coach had {{suggested}} that she was ready for an Ironman, despite the relatively low volume of her training. She said of Sutton, [...] "my training was more geared to standard distance, with not much high volume. I don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> high-volume work like three-hour runs. I've done none of these since I've been with Brett. Some {{of the other girls}} will. This is why he is so special: he has an ability to spot potential even if the athlete can't. He said I was ready even on the training I was doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{is accused of}} having ignored warnings about fire safety in tower blocks. A former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, Ronnie King, said ministers stonewalled requests for meetings and efforts to tighten rules. He said that the then–housing minister Gavin Barwell, refused requests for meetings. King said: “We have had replies, but the replies were {{to the effect that}} you have met my predecessor [...] and {{there were a number of}} matters that we are looking at and we are still looking at it. (...) They always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> a significant loss of life before things are changed.” After six people were killed in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider, and the Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then–Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, which said in part: [...] After further correspondence, Williams replied: [...] Jeremy Corbyn has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all high-rise social housing.|$|E
