25|$|A typical {{formulation}} for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a <b>stable</b> <b>emulsion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a <b>stable</b> <b>emulsion</b> on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{change in}} centrifugal pumps operating under flow of stable and unstable oil-in-water emulsions is determined experimentally. The head-flow rate is measured at different temperatures and holdup values and represented by empirical relations. A comparison between head-flow curves for centrifugal pumps under water and emulsions flow results in coefficients relating the flow rate {{and head for}} water and emulsions. The hydraulic efficiency is calculated for <b>stable</b> and unstable <b>emulsions</b> and compared with water flow. The oil-in-water emulsion flow reduces the head and flow rate of the centrifugal pumps. As the holdup increase and temperature decrease, the reduction in head and flow rate increase. The unstable oil-in-water emulsions show less decrease in headflow rate, while <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> show bigger decrease in head-flow rate compared with water. The surfactant type affects the head-flow rate, where the <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) show less reduction in head-flow rate than <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> with Fatty Acid and Amine (FAA). The change in the rheology of the emulsions with holdup, temperatures, and addition of surfactant is responsible for increasing the losses inside the pump and change in performance. Thus, the hydraulic efficiency decreases as the holdup increase and temperature decrease...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the proposition that creosote, emplaced in an initially water saturated porous system, can be removed from the system through Pickering emulsion formation. Pickering emulsions are dispersions of two immiscible fluids in which coalescence of the dispersed phase droplets is hindered by the presence of colloidal particles adsorbed at the interface between the two immiscible fluid phases. Particle trapping is strongly favoured when the wetting properties of the particles are intermediate between strong water wetting and strong oil wetting. In this investigation the necessary chemical conditions for the formation of physically <b>stable</b> creosote-in-water <b>emulsions</b> protected against coalescence by bentonite particles were examined. It was established that physically <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> could be formed through the judicious addition of small amounts of sodium chloride and the surfactant cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide. The stability of the emulsions was initially established by visual inspection. However, experimental determinations of emulsion stability were also undertaken by use of oscillatory rheology. Measurements of the elastic and viscous responses to shear indicated that physically <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> were obtained when the viscoelastic systems showed a predominantly elastic response to shearing. Once the conditions were established for the formation of physically <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> a "proof-of-concept" chromatographic experiment was carried out which showed that creosote could be successfully removed from a saturated model porous system.

40|$|A {{novel and}} highly {{efficient}} oil-water separator {{equipped with a}} series of inclined multiple arc coalescence plates is developed and optimized for the removal of <b>stable</b> oil <b>emulsions</b> from produced water. The synthetic high salinity produced water with <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> was prepared by mixing Catenex oil and the emulsifying surfactant (Armac T) with brine water. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of the arc coalescence plate geometry, produced water volumetric flow rate, influent oil concentration, and treatment temperature on the oil removal efficiency using the developed separator. Optimal coalescence plate arc geometry for maximum oil removal at different operating conditions was determined. Using the optimal coalescence plate arc geometry., strong correlations between oil removal efficiency from produced water, volumetric flow rate, and treatment temperature were established. The results demonstrated that the developed oil-water separator is highly effective in the treatment of <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> in produced waters due to the combined effects of chemical demulsification and oil droplet coalescence.

40|$|Modern {{high speed}} {{machining}} {{would not be}} possible without the use of metalworking fluids (MWFs). MWFs perform a number of useful functions like cooling and lubrication. They also assist with metal chip evacuation and short-term corrosion protection. It is estimated that 90 million U. S. gallons of water-soluble MWF concentrate are manufactured annually in the U. S. alone to meet the above needs. MWFs become process effluents when the accumulation of contaminants such as extraneous oil, particulate debris from machining operations, and bacteria negatively impact functionality. One to two billion U. S. gallons of oily wastewater result annually from the use of MWFs. Reducing this environmental footprint has become an important objective for both manufacturers and end-users of MWFs. Oil-containing MWFs are conventionally formulated to be highly <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions.</b> These emulsions are difficult to maintain, recycle, and treat (Byers, 1994).

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> during {{the production of}} crude oil is an expensive problem faced by the oil industry. <b>Stable</b> <b>emulsions</b> can be encountered during recovery, treatment or transportation of crude oil.

Though demulsifiers are extensively used in industry to destabilize the emulsions formed, {{there is a lack}} of understanding of the mechanism of demulsification. Moreover, potentially informative techniques such as interfacial rheology are of very little use and the value that they can bring to understand the mechanism of demulsification is not known. In this project, asphaltene stabilized emulsions were formulated and the efficiency of the two commercial demulsifiers Tretolite DMO 83262 and Emulsotron OFLP 09 / 2171 was tested by focusing on their effects on the interfacial rheology properties of the water/oil interface. The experiments showed that both the demulsifiers showed almost the same efficiency. From the bottle tests, it was found that even 1 ppm of demulsifier was effective to achieve complete separation of oil and water. Experimental studies conducted using dilatational rheology and shear rheology indicated that atleast 25 - 50 ppm of demulsifier is necessary to achieve complete separation. The critical demulsifier concentration (25 - 50 ppm) determined by the interfacial rheology tests was much higher than the demulsifier concentration (1 ppm) needed for complete separation by the bottle tests. Hence demulsifier efficiency cannot be determined by the critical demulsifier concentration obtained from the interfacial rheology tests. The preliminary studies on the role of various asphaltene sub-fractions separated as a function of polarity was also performed. The results showed a significant difference in the interfacial tension (IFT) and the elastic modulus of the emulsion stabilized by the asphaltene sub-fractions. </p...|$|R
