40|$|With great {{potential}} in precision medical application, cell biomechanics is rising as {{a hot topic}} in biology. Cell nucleus, as the largest component within cell, not only contributes greatly to the cell&# 39;s mechanical behavior, but also serves as the most vital component within cell. However, cell nucleus&# 39; mechanics is still far from unambiguous up to now. In this paper, we attempted to characterize and evaluate the mechanical property of isolated cell nuclei using Atomic Force Microscopy with a tipless probe. As indicated from typical indentation, changing loading rate and <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment</b> results, cell nuclei showed significant dynamically mechanical property, i. e., time-dependent mechanics. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, finite element simulation and <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment,</b> the nature of nucleus&# 39; mechanics was better described by poroelasticity, rather than viscoelasticity. Therefore, the essence of nucleus&# 39; mechanics was clarified to be poroelastic through a sophisticated analysis. Finally, we estimated the poroelastic parameters for nuclei of two types of cells {{through a combination of}} experimental data and finite element simulation...|$|E

Because the two types {{are known to be}} different, we need to distinguish two material functions to describe lateral contraction, namely a creep contraction ratio and a stress relaxation contraction ratio. Expressions are derived that describe how for linear and isotropic visco-elastic materials these functions depend on other material functions. It is demonstrated that these two possible contraction ratios are different functions. The contraction ratio based on the <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment</b> is found to be the visco-elastic analogue of the clastic constant called Poisson''s ratio...|$|E

At all time, η_eff is found to be independent of G_ 0, of elastic perturbations, and of {{the rate at which the}} sample is quenched in the glassy phase.

To investigate if compaction creep could be restricted both uniaxial compaction and triaxial <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments</b> are performed on sand aggregates (Beaujean) and sandstone cylinders (Bentheim and Fontainebleau) respectively. Different pore fluids were tested for their effect on compaction creep, namely distilled water, aluminium chloride solution (0. 1 M and 0. 01 M), sodium chloride solution (0. 3 M), sodium sulfate solution (0. 15 M), sodium silicate solution (silica saturated solution) and lab air (i. e. dry). The uniaxial compaction experiments were performed in constant stress mode both at room temperature and 80 ˚C. The <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments</b> were performed at 80 ˚C.

The main compaction deformation mechanism for wet Beaujean sand and Bentheim sandstone was inferred to be fluid enhanced microcracking, which was inhibited by aluminium chloride and by sodium silicate.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of molten}} polymeric materials {{is known to}} be less sensitive to shear than to extensional deformations. However, {{it is not easy to}} characterise molten polymeric materials in simple extensional flows due to the large number of experimental difficulties involved. This has led to the effective absence of a structure-preserving, morphology probing technique similar to the ones commonly found in shear, i. e., the equivalent of <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> and oscillatory <b>experiments.</b> It is the aim of the present work to demonstrate the usefulness of a recently developed experimental technique that enables <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments</b> after a step strain in uniaxial extension to be performed.

Good agreement is found with results in the literature derived from measurements of temperature fluctuations (the so-called Donth method). The temperature dependence of the CRR size is explored for poly(butadiene); in this case the segmental relaxation function is derived through a novel method for the analysis of the efficiency with which free induction decay echoes are refocused in 1 H NMR experiments.

40|$|In this manuscript, we {{investigated}} the fundamental mechanism of stress relaxation phenomenon by employing finite element simulation. Through finite element simulations, {{the evolution of}} stress distribution, deformation field and the interaction force was wholly recorded during both the loading and stress relaxation stages. With the developed simulation model, the sensitivity of force-time curves on cell height and substrate stiffness was thoroughly studied by changing the thickness of cell and Young&# 39;s modulus of the substrate. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} variation of cell height leads to the significant change of F-t curve&# 39;s magnitude but tiny deviation of the curve&# 39;s shape.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{testing of}} thin layers of soft materials {{is an important}} but difficult task. Spherical indentation provides a convenient method to ascertain material properties whilst minimising damage to the material by allowing testing {{to take place in}} situ. However, measurement of the viscoelastic properties of these soft materials is hindered by the absence of a convenient yet accurate model which takes into account the thickness of the material and the effects of the underlying substrate. To this end, the spherical indentation of a thin layer of viscoelastic solid material is analysed. It is assumed that the transient mechanical properties of the material can be described by the generalised standard linear solid model. This model is incorporated into the theory and then solved for the special case of a <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment</b> taking into account the finite ramp time experienced in real experiments. An expression for the force {{as a function of the}} viscoelastic properties, layer thickness and indentation depth is given. The theory is then fitted to experimental data for the spherical indentation of poly(dimethyl) siloxane mixed with its curing agent to the ratios of 5 : 1, 10 : 1 and 20 : 1 in order to ascertain its transient shear moduli and relaxation time constants. It is shown that the theory correctly accounts for the effect of the underlying substrate and allows for the accurate measurement of the viscoelastic properties of thin layers of soft materials...|$|E

The in vivo creep and in vivo stress relaxation methods are compared {{with respect to their}} utility for determining the irreversible wall extensibility and the yield threshold. The results of the in vivo stress relaxation experiments demonstrate that the growth usually does not cease when the external water supply is removed, and the turgor pressure does not decay for hours afterwards. A successful <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment</b> requires that the cell enlargement rate (growth rate) be zero during the turgor pressure decay. In a few experiments, the growth rate was zero during the turgor pressure decay. However, in general only the yield threshold could be determined. In vivo creep experiments proved to be easier to conduct and more useful in determining values for both the irreversible wall extensibility and the yield threshold. The results of the in vivo creep experiments demonstrate that small steps-up in turgor pressure, generally < 0. 02 MPa, elicit increases in growth rate as predicted by the growth equations and the augmented growth equations. The irreversible wall extensibility and the yield threshold were determined from these results. The results also demonstrate that steps-up in turgor pressure larger than 0. 02 MPa, produce a different response; a decrease in growth rate. The decreased growth rate behavior is related to the magnitude of the step-up, and in general, larger steps-up in turgor pressure produce larger decreases in growth rate and longer periods of decreased growth rate. Qualitatively, this growth behavior is very similar to the “stretch response” previously reported by Dennison and Roth (1967) ...|$|E
40|$|GeS₂-Sb₂S₃-CsCl {{glass-ceramics}} with nanoporous surfaces were synthesized {{and tested}} as optical elements. The nanoporosity is obtained through a two-step process, including controlled nucleation of CsCl nuclei {{in the glass}} matrix followed by selective etching of the nuclei with an acid solution. The porous surface is several hundred nanometers thick and results in a surface area increase of almost four orders of magnitudes. The pores size is approximately 150 nm and can be tailored by controlling the nucleation process and the etching time. It is shown {{that the creation of}} the nanoporous surface does not critically affect the optical transmission of these infrared transparent glass-ceramics. These materials can therefore be used for the design of optical elements and an ATR (Attenuated Total Reflections) plate with nanoporous surface was fabricated and tested as an optical infrared sensor. The porous element shows higher detection sensitivity in initial experiments with a coating of silane molecules. The TAS (Te₂As₃Se₅) infrared glass, used as optical sensor in many fields of applications (medicine, environment, etc), exhibits poor mechanical properties rapidly that enable it to be used. Its mechanical properties have been investigated as a function of time and environment. From a general observation, air and vacuum have dramatic effects on TAS fibers tensile strength. When ageing under static stress, they exhibit an increase of tensile strength. The structural relaxation phenomenon is hypothesized to explain these results. The coordination number,, which is a rough measure of the network rigidity, has an influence on the TAS mechanical properties. It is shown that the TAS glass exhibits photosensitive effects. This effect seems to be only a surface effect, not a volume effect in the sense that light has no influence on the kinetic of a <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment.</b> Due to their low glass transition temperature, TAS fibers exhibit viscoelastic behavior at room temperature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to control and systematically vary the network topology of bismaleimides through cure temperature and chemistry (addition of various coreactants) and subsequently attempt to determine structure-mechanical property relationships. Characterization of the bismaleimide structures by dielectric, rheological, and thermal analyses, and density measurements was subsequently correlated with mechanical properties such as modulus, yield strength, fracture energy, and stress relaxation. The model material used in this investigation was 4, 4 '-BismaleiMidodIphenyl methane (BMI). BMI was coreacted with either 4, 4 '-Methylene Dianiline (MDA), o,o'-diallyl bisphenol A (DABA) from Ciba Geigy, or Diamino Diphenyl Sulfone (DDS). Three cure paths were employed: a low- temperature cure of 140 C where chain extension should predominate, a high-temperature cure of 220 C where both chain extension and crosslinking should occur simultaneously, and a low-temperature (140 C) cure followed immediately by a high-temperature (220 C) cure where the chain extension reaction or amine addition precedes BMI homopolymerization or crosslinking. Samples of cured and postcured PMR- 15 were also tested {{to determine the effects of}} postcuring on the mechanical properties. The low-temperature cure condition of BMI/MDA exhibited the highest modulus values for a given mole fraction of BMI with the modulus decreasing with decreasing concentration of BMI. The higher elastic modulus is the result of steric hindrance by unreacted BMI molecules in the glassy state. The moduli values for the high- and low/high-temperature cure conditions of BMI/MDA decreased as the amount of diamine increased. All the moduli values mimic the yield strength and density trends. For the high-temperature cure condition, the room- temperature modulus remained constant with decreasing mole fraction of BMT for the BMI/DABA and BMI/DDS systems. Postcuring PMR- 15 increases the modulus over that of the cured material even though density values of cured and postcured PMR were essentially the same. Preliminary results of a continuous and intermittent <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment</b> for BMI:MDA in a 2 : 1 molar ratio indicate that crosslinking is occurring when the sample is in the undeformed state. Computer simulation of properties such as density, glass transition temperature, and modulus for the low- temperature cure conditions of BMI/MDA and BMI/DABA were completed. The computer modeling was used to help further understand and confirm the structure characterization results. The simulations correctly predicted the trends of these properties versus mole fraction BMI and were extended to other BMI/diamine systems...|$|E

This study seeks to explain the self-healing behavior of the triblock copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate) -poly(n-butyl acrylate) -poly(methyl methacrylate), or PMMA-PnBA-PMMA, by probing the material’s post-fracture behavior with rheometry and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The self-healing behavior was studied by deforming each gel in shear until failure multiple times with “recovery” periods in-between. PIV was used to verify the occurrence of each fracture in both time and space. <b>Stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments</b> were also performed on the gels to give greater context {{to the results of}} the investigation into fracture recovery.

40|$|The {{demand and}} use of polymer-based dental {{restorative}} materials continues to rise as advances in materials research continue to improve their performance. In spite of the many advances, there remain some shortcomings in their behavior. Polymerization shrinkage and the associated shrinkage stress continue to be detrimental to the long term performance of these materials. A majority of the current research is focused on developing low shrinkage resin systems to alleviate the problem of high volumetric shrinkage. There is relatively less focus on developing novel fillers and surface modification techniques to improve material properties. This thesis focuses on studying the effect of fillers on composite properties, mainly shrinkage stress development, {{and the development of}} a novel technique to modify the surface of the fillers to control shrinkage stress and optical properties of the composites. The effect of monomer conversion and filler content was studied on the development of shrinkage, modulus and shrinkage stress. Fillers and monomer conversion were found to affect all the properties. Shrinkage stress was found to have a complex relationship with both shrinkage and modulus, with shrinkage apparently dominating the modulus at high values of monomer conversion. A novel surface modification technique was developed, utilizing the concept of polymer brushes, to alleviate shrinkage stress in composites. Oligomers, both commercial and synthesized in the lab, were covalently attached to the surface of fillers and mixed with a model dental resin to form composite pastes. These pastes, when photopolymerized in a shrinkage stress measuring apparatus, showed that the composites with the experimental surface modified fillers outperformed conventional filler-based composites by achieving a reduced final stress. The final stress was found to depend on various characteristics of the oligomers. In general, the higher the molecular weight of the brush, the lower was the shrinkage stress. Increased in reactive group concentration on the oligomer backbone had the effect of increasing the stress. Flexibility of the oligomers appeared to play a less significant role, with low flexibility oligomers showing a slightly lower stress than flexible oligomers. Modern dental composites utilize different filler sizes to optimize material properties. To explore this practical scenario, composites were made with two different sizes of filler, with varying ratios of nano-fillers and submicron-sized fillers. Each filler type was treated with either a conventional silane treatment or with the experimental oligomer. It was found that composites with the experimental oligomer had reduced shrinkage stress and also better light transmission properties. The nano-fillers affected both the properties to a more significant effect than the larger fillers. Stress development in polymerizing composites is a combination of stress increase and stress reduction. Stress reduction occurs by relaxation processes in the composite, even as the composite is polymerizing. There is a potential to increase the magnitude of the stress relaxation leading to a lower final stress. Stress relaxation was measured as a function of monomer conversion and also filler surface treatment, using a standard <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiment.</b> The experimental composites exhibited faster stress relaxation as compared to conventional composites, showing potential for utilizing the novel surface treatment in commercial composites...|$|E

From 500 to 1070 K, the continuity of the activation volume/temperature curves reveals a single mechanism of activation enthalpy 3. 8 eV/atom and volume 90 b 3 at 810 K with an athermal stress of 330 MPa. Over the very same temperature interval, impurity or solute diffusion towards dislocation cores is evidenced through serrated yielding, peculiar shapes of stress strain curves while changing the rate of straining and <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments.</b> This complicates the identification of the deformation mechanism which is likely connected with cube glide. From 1070 K to 1270 K, a high temperature mechanism has an activation enthalpy and volume of 4. 8 eV/atom and 20 b 3 respectively, at 1250 K...|$|R
40|$|As {{is widely}} acknowledged, {{morphology}} in most materials {{is far more}} sensitive to extensional than to shear deformations but, unfortunately, due to the experimental difficulties involved, there are no non-destructive, morphology probing techniques in such flows, i. e., the equivalent of <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> and oscillatory <b>experiments</b> in shear flows. This paper tries to overcome some of those drawbacks by proposing an experimental technique that allows <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> <b>experiments</b> after a step strain in uniaxial extension to be performed. The benefits of this technique are twofold: (a) while the deformation is small enough for the response {{to be in the}} linear viscoelastic regime it constitutes a probe of the microstructure of the material and (b) it allows the departure to the non linear regime to be studied, useful, for example, for the definition of the damping function in uniaxial extensional flow or {{for the study of the}} response of materials to fast transient flows with a strong extensional component, such as contraction flows. In this work the proposed technique, which requires a correction to the apparent (theoretical) strain rate in order to allow the calculation of the true Hencky strains attained during the strain step, is tested and validated for two polyisobutylene melts...|$|R
