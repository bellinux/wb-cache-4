The main part presents {{the analysis of the}} level of fear of crime, the factors that influence it and characteristics of the prevalence in recorded crime of five selected housing estates: D browa (block housing estate mainly dates from 1970 − 75 years), Jagiełły-Czarnieckiego (building dates from the years 1975 − 80), Karolew (blocks from {{the second half of the}} sixties), Kurak (older buildings were designed for habitation before the 1965 year) and Widzew-Wschód (housing estate was built in the eighties). The author analyzes research results regarding three main aspects of the sense of security: cognitive (What is the likelihood that you will become a victim of offence?, What is the likelihood that you will become a victim of one of the forms of offence mentioned below (such: beaten, robbed, assaulted, molested etc) ?), emotional (How often do you usually walk alone in this area after dark?) and behavioural (active/passive forms of protection). As well socio-demographic factors of residents that influence the level of fear were studied. In five research areas, respondents assessed the dangers and threats in their neighbourhood in a different way but there are not identified any significant spatial variations in sense of security. On the other hand, there are many interesting correlations between three main components of the fear of crime and between components and certain <b>socio-demographic</b> <b>respondent’s</b> characteristics as well. The survey also confirmed a lack of correlation between the sense of security and the real level of recorded crime...|$|R

We illustrate the merits of the model as we have information on a sample of about 5000 individuals from the Netherlands for who we know how they voted last time (if at all), which parties they would consider for the upcoming election,and what their voting intention is. A unique feature of the data set is that information is available on actual individual voting behavior, measured at the day of election. We find that the inclusion of the consideration set stage in the model enables the user to make more precise inferences on the competitive structure in the political domain and to get better out-of-sample forecasts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Proposals for {{value-based}} assessment, {{made by the}} National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, {{recommended that}} burden of illness (BOI) {{should be used to}} weight QALY gain. This paper explores some of the methodological issues in eliciting societal preferences for BOI. AIMS: This study explores the impact of mode of administration and framing in a survey for eliciting societal preferences for BOI. METHODS: A pairwise comparison survey with six arms was conducted online and via face-to-face interviews, involving two different wordings of questions and the inclusion/exclusion of pictures. Respondents were asked which of two patient groups they thought a publically funded health service should treat, where the groups varied by life expectancy without treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) without treatment, survival gain from treatment, and HRQOL gain from treatment. Responses across different modes of administration, wording and use of pictures were compared using chi-squared tests and probit regression analysis controlling for <b>respondent</b> <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics. RESULTS: The sample contained 371 respondents: 69 were interviewed and 302 completed the questionnaire online. There were some differences in socio-demographic characteristics across the online and interview samples. Online respondents were less likely to choose the group with higher BOI and more likely to treat those with a higher QALY gain, but there were no statistically significant differences by wording or the inclusion of pictures for the majority of questions. Regression analysis confirmed these results. Respondents chose to treat the group with larger treatment gain, but there was little support for treating the group with higher BOI. Respondents also preferred to treat the group with treatment gains in life expectancy rather than HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Mode of administration did impact on responses, whereas question wording and pictures did not impact on responses, even after controlling for the <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents</b> in the regression analysis...|$|R

These stressors impact the environmental quality of the Baltic Sea. Each Baltic Sea country contributes to the stressors and, at the same time, is affected by their negative impacts on water quality. Knowledge about benefits from improvements in coastal and marine waters is key to assessing public support for policies aimed at achieving such changes. We propose {{a new approach to}} account for variability in benefits related to differences in <b>socio-demographics</b> of <b>respondents,</b> by using a structural model of discrete choice. Our method allows to incorporate a wide range of socio-demographics as explanatory variables in conditional multinomial logit models without the risk of collinearity; the model is estimated jointly and hence more statistically efficient than the alternative, typically used approaches. We apply this new technique to a study of the preferences of Latvian citizens towards improvements of the coastal and marine environment quality. We find that overall, Latvians {{are willing to pay for}} reducing losses of biodiversity, for improving water quality for recreation by reduced eutrophication, and for reducing new occurrences of invasive alien species. However a significant group within the sample seems not to value environmental improvements in the Baltic Sea, and, thus, is unwilling to support costly measures for achieving such improvements.

40|$|The {{landscape}} {{is the product}} of human activities and nature as developed during the centuries. However, the landscape has a symbolic value because it can be considered the identity and culture of a territory that includes the values and beliefs of local population. The Alpine {{landscape is}} a unicum in the world due to its geomorphologic, climatic and vegetation characteristics and socio-economic conditions of local population. Over the centuries the social perception of Alps has changed: in a first phase the Alps were considered “horrible and scary mountains”, later Alps were perceived as “beautiful and fascinating places”, and currently the Alpine mountains are considered a place of relaxation and recreation. The analysis of landscape perception aimed to investigate the visitors’ opinions about landscape is an important instrument to support the decision concerning the land planning and management. This study focuses on the analysis of the aesthetic perception of visitors on Alpine landscapes following two perspectives: a first overall perspective considering the landscape as a mosaic of different land uses and a second perspective of detail observing the individual components that characterize the forest landscape. The aim of the study is to identify the most appreciated elements of landscape from the aesthetic point of view and the influence of <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents</b> on individual perception. In order to investigate the perception about the Alpine landscapes 358 visitors of two sites of Trentino-Alto Adige (Val di Genova and Santa Maria lake) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The results show that the most appreciated elements of the landscape by the visitors are water (lakes and rivers) and forests. These preferences are also conditioned by the site where the interviews were made. In addition, the results show that for the respondents of this survey the forest with the highest attractiveness is an uneven aged and mixed forest with randomly distributed trees, a canopy cover between 50 % and 60 % and without lying deadwood. Finally, this study shows the influence of <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents</b> (age, gender and origin) on individual preferences considering three types of perceptions: instinctive perception, affective perception and intellectual perception...|$|R

To this extend, previous studies have suggested the effect of <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents</b> such as education and occupation on children’s food habits and consumption patterns. Specifically, according to previous studies, higher is parental education and healthier should be children diet (Patrick and Nicklas 2005; McCurdy et al. 2014), while parents’ occupation is supposed to affect plan meal at home (Morin et al. 2013). Parental engagement in physical activity is assumed to affect positively children’s practice of physical activity as well. Indeed, children may be encouraged to play sports by the desire to conform to their parents (Guidetti and Cavazza 2008). Lastly, the awareness about the negative effects of a high-calorie diet is expected to affect children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables, their engagement in physical activity, and less consumption of candies and soft drinks as a consequence of the greater attention towards healthy food habits that children perceive at home.|$|R

Out of the 750 patients who were selected randomly, 569 (75. 9 %) successfully completed the questionnaire. The data collected were {{on a set of}} variables including socio-demographic characteristics, health-related variables, source of health knowledge and patients′ attitudes towards a number of health-related aspects. Data were presented and analyzed in a descriptive fashion. Results: Only 20 % of PHC patients had received health education in the past twelve months. The majority of respondents identified TV and friends/relatives as the main sources of their health education. A considerable percentage of the patients with chronic conditions lacked knowledge about their illnesses. The results indicate that the deficiency in knowledge was the result of some of the <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents.</b> Conclusion: There is an urgent need to review and evaluate health education programs conducted in PHC centers. Special emphasis should be placed on health education activities for those living with chronic health conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we analyze {{the reasons for}} {{changing}} pre-planned activities and travels episodes considering the type of modification observed during the scheduling process. Specifically we selected a small sample from those pre-planned episodes that are no executed at all as a pilot study. The data analyzed was collected in {{the first wave of}} a weekly activity-travel panel survey carried out in Valencia (Spain) in 2010. Each survey wave consisted on a face-to-face interview to generate a pre-planned activity agenda for the following week, an activity-travel diary implemented on mobile phones to collect activities and travels as they are executed, and in-depth telephone interviews to inquire about differences between pre-planned agenda and observed activities and travels. This methodology allowed to collect data related to how respondents pre-planned activity-travel episodes and how they re-scheduled them before execution. Observed modification types provide us with information about their spatio-temporal and social flexibility. Open-ended records collected in the in-depth telephone interviews, were coded and provided a semi-formal segmentation and categorization of the changing process as the basis of our study. Spatio-temporal and social constraints, biological needs and resource constraints are differentiated along with facets of the activity-travel episodes and <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics of <b>respondents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{detection}} of satisficing caused by not reading the instruction below {{a question in}} the online survey in the Czech Republic. First, the issues of online survey is introduced from the theoretical {{point of view and}} cognitive aspects of the proces of creating a response to survey questions is described. Further, the term satisficing is explained, including its sources, forms and ways of measurement, and surveys and studies focused on satisficing detection are presented, including Instructional manipulation checks method which is crucial for the practical part of this thesis. Based on previously executed studies, the author designs hypotheses about the presence of satisficing in the online survey in the Czech Republic, and about the effect of <b>respondent's</b> <b>socio-demographic</b> and other factual characteristics; these hypotheses are subsequently verified using data from the conducted quantitative survey. The research results reveal considerable presence of satisficing caused by not reading the instruction below a question in the online survey. Furthermore, the impact of some socio-demographic and factul characteristics on the total amount of incorrectly answered control IMCs was proved. Building a model used to predict the probability with which the respondent will engage in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Correct {{knowledge}} about Tuberculosis (TB) {{is essential for}} appropriate healthcare seeking behaviour and to accessing diagnosis and treatment services timely. There are several factors influencing {{knowledge about}} TB. The present {{study was conducted to}} assess the change in community knowledge of Tuberculosis (TB) and its association with <b>respondent’s</b> <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics in two serial knowledge-attitude-practice surveys. Methods Community level interventions including community meetings with youth groups, village health committees and self-help groups and through mass media activities were undertaken to create awareness and knowledge about TB and service availability. Increase in knowledge on TB and its association with <b>respondent’s</b> <b>socio-demographic</b> characteristics was assessed by two serial KAP surveys in 2010 – 2011 (baseline) and 2012 – 2013 (midline) in 30 districts of India. Correct knowledge of TB was assessed by using lead questions and scores were assigned. The composite score was dichotomized into two groups (score 0 – 6, poor TB knowledge and score 7 – 13, good TB knowledge). Results In baseline and midline survey, 4562 and 4808 individuals were interviewed. The correct knowledge about TB; cough ≥ 2  weeks, transmission through air, 6 – 8 months treatment duration, and free treatment increased by 7  % (p-value < 0. 05), 11  % (p-value < 0. 05), 2  % (p-value < 0. 05), and 8  % (p-value < 0. 05) in midline compared to baseline, respectively. The knowledge on sputum smear test for diagnosis of TB was 66  % in both surveys while knowledge on availability of free treatment and that TB is curable disease decreased by 5  % and 2  % in midline (p- 0. 001), compared to baseline, respectively. The mean score for correct knowledge about TB increased from 60  % in baseline to 71  % in midline which is a 11  % increase (p-value < 0. 001). The misconception regarding on transmission of TB by- sharing of food and clothes and handshake persisted in midline. Respondents residing in northern (OR, 2. 2, 95  % CI, 1. 7 – 2. 6) and western districts (OR, 3. 4, 95  % CI, 2. 7 – 4. 1) of India and age groups- 25 – 34 years (OR, 1. 3; 95  % CI, 1. 1 – 1. 6) and 45 – 44 years (OR, 1. 4; 95  % CI, 1. 1 – 1. 7) - were independently associated with good TB knowledge. Conclusions The knowledge about TB has increased over a period of 2  years and this may be attributable to the community intervention in 30 districts of India. The study offers valuable lesson for designing TB related awareness programmes in India and in other high burden countries...|$|R
