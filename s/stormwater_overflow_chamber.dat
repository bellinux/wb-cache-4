40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{presented}} {{the calculation of}} mass balance of the materials in suspension, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, COD and BOD 5 within sewage collector A 6 {{in the area of}} Hajdrihova street No. 28 and behind the outfall from the <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflow</b> under the bridge at Riharjeva street in Ljubljana. The pollutant concentration was acquired on the basis of measurements which were carried out during the time period between the years 2004 and 2009, and it presents the basic data for conversion of mass balance at the above mentioned sample sites. The catchment area of sewage collector A 6 is expressly urbanised. During precipitation events, on the urbanised areas, due to impervious areas the precipitation waters are drained through the secondary sewage systems which are connected to the main collector. Rainwater run-off from the road surfaces, which is heavily polluted with hard particles and other pollutants due to tire wear, vehicle breaking, road surface wear and other sorts of dirt caused by the drivers, represents a considerable burden to the sewage system. This is valid mostly for the rainwater run-off after a longer period of drought. Due to high rates of discharge during the precipitations, and owing to economic reasons, the <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> have been installed. These <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> disburden the surplus of waste waters and rainfall waters into the water drainage system, which can destroy natural ecosystem and increase its eutrophication. This thesis presents a more detailed description of the first flush of precipitation event, sewage collector A 6, riverbasin of the river Gradaščica and the German standard ATV-A 128 E. In the calculation part of this thesis there follows the calculation of hydraulic burdening of sewage collector A 6 with the SWMM 5 model, and the calculation of mass balance for particular pollutants, both in sewage collector and river. The fact is that <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> protect the river insuficiently. Therefore, the Municipality of Ljubljana made the strategic spatial plan, where one of the targets is to make the river of Ljubljanica a river suitable for bathing again. So, we have envisaged the installation of five stormwater tanks and made the calculation of the necessary basin volumes based on the German standard ATV-A 128 E...|$|R

The task is roughly consists of three parts. The introduction describes the area in question. It presents the problem of rapidly growing settlement Ivančna Gorica and the existing sewer system. More detailed are described the local streams and their pollution. In the central part are presented the German ATV guidelines. These standards describe the design of <b>stormwater</b> tanks with <b>overflow</b> in the combined wastewater. Described are <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> and <b>stormwater</b> tanks, their work and connection to the system.

In the final part, as a practical example, is given calculation of retention volumes for the three tanks {{with the help of}} the German guidelines ATV and program SWMM. These retention volumes would serve for storing of the first wave of pollution, which occurs at the beginning of the rainfall event after a long dry period. First flush must be fully covered and brought to a treatment center. The existing sewerage system does not have holding facilities and relieves waste water in the watercourse Višnjica.

40|$|In {{the past}} the quality of {{receiving}} waters has been continuously improved by upgrading measures on both industrial and urban waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and sewer systems. However, latest inventories of sources and pathways of pollutants originating from industrial and domestic use and activities, for example carried out for the river Rhine catchment, {{emphasize the importance of}} diffuse nonpoint pollution on water quality in urbanized river catchments in comparison to the loads of point sources form industrial or urban WWTPs, for which a reduction on about 70 % of the status of 1985 was considered in 1995. In order to obtain detailed information on the fate of heavy metals in river catchments, this study was carried out mainly to collect representative literature about possible diffuse nonpoint pollution sources, to monitor concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn) in <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> and to assess these loads discharged into receiving waters. An extensive literature survey was carried out resulting in a database containing 121 references with more than 2100 values especially about the pollution sources FARMING and URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE. The database was adapted to the register on diffuse nonpoint pollution of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR). While only a few references on diffuse nonpoint pollution sources were evaluated for Hg, Cr and Ni and the pathways within the urban drainage systems (e. g. effluents of stormwater retention basins, combined sewer overflows) a remarkable number of references could be collected for the other heavy metals and diffuse sources and pathways respectively. Due to the lack of precise data on {{the current state of the}} art of stormwater treatment in Germany a field study was carried out in Herrenberg. Objects of the investigation were two different stormwater retention basins (SRB) at two well defined catchments. In the field study about nine events of <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> at SRB 1 and eleven events at SRB 2 were sampled. The results (event mean concentration) indicate a high level but match the values of the evaluated references. However, specific heavy metal pollution loads referring to the impervious catchment area show high values in particular SRB 1 with its urbanized hinterland. Based on the evaluated literature database and observed EMCs in <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflows</b> a semi-empirical model has been developed to assess heavy metal loads in receiving waters from considered pollution sources.

With the help of these relationships optimal dimensions of an improved high-side weir <b>overflow</b> <b>chamber</b> could be found. The steady state efficiency for this improved <b>overflow</b> <b>chamber</b> seems to be comparable to mat of a hydrodynamic separator, when both devices are subjected to the same surface load. On the other hand, during real storm events, the storage inside the overflow structure can play an important role. This role is investigated by calculating the removal efficiencies for both structures when 4 monitored storm events are used as input. When higher removal efficiencies are wanted, the storage effect gets more and more important and as a consequence the hydrodynamic separator can technically as well as economically compete with simpler structures like e. g, a high-side weir overflow. These findings are confirmed by a simple construction cost estimation. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

The present article describes a method for validating dry-weather data a posteriori. This method relies upon flow rate forecasts, a combination of standard daily wastewater flow profiles and an estimation of infiltration flows. Measurement results are then compared with this forecast and an appropriate series of statistical tests are run to detect all major data anomalies.

Five case studies are presented that use water level loggers to evaluate the overflow of basins, compare a traditional stormpipe trench with an infiltration trench, monitor timing of blue roof storage, show the effects of retrofitting a basin, and provide long term performance data.

Unfortunately, over the past several decades, the City’s century-old combined sewer system has failed to protect communities from flooding (Hayhoe, et al, 2010).

Adapted technical solutions were set forth {{for the improvement of}} stormwater management (drainage, discharge and/or storage) from public roads and public surfaces (ex. parkings) taking into account {{the current state of the}} sewage networks and available facilities. In a first phase, the design and operating conditions of the current sewage networks were assessed based on recorded cadastral data, our own scouring of the terrains and sewer smoke testing. We found that the current management of the stormwater from public roads and public surfaces is generally inadequate because often too polluted water is directly evacuated into the environment. In a second phase, updated various data sources on the size of communities, water consumption from all origins, drainage conditions of stormwater, the slope of the terrains, and road load by vehicles traffic, were collected and were the basis for this study. For the Zlato Polje area of Kranj, we have shown that by inserting new sewage section heading to the local Sava river for the evacuation and purification of critical stormwater through a gravity oil separator, we can reduce both overall burdening of the sewage system and the impact on the environment by the stormwater.

Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system.

They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems.

30|$|Sylvia Frey (Ocean Care, Wädenswil, Switzerland) gave an {{overview}} of the current knowledge on the occurrence and biological impacts of microplastics in freshwater and saltwater bodies. Microplastics can function as vectors of chemicals by accumulating persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs) and transferring them to living organisms. There is an urgent need to better understand such interactions and to curb plastic inputs into the aquatic environment from: (1) single-use plastics, (2) microbeads in cosmetics, and (3) plastic fibers which are not completely removed in WWTPs. A major barrier to advancing research and implementing policy action on the issue of microplastics is the lack of standard analytical methods to quantify microplastics. With currently used non-standard methods, the risk of false positives can be considerable. Florian Storck (Water Technology Center, Karlsruhe, Germany) presented his research on analytics and occurrence of microplastics in inland waterways. He recommends not to rely on visual sample inspection only, but to include chemical analysis like Raman microscopy. Nicole Bandow (Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und Prüfung, Berlin, Germany) measured chemicals released from three different types of microplastics: polystyrene, high density polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride. The plastic materials were either directly eluted, or first exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or thermic stress and then eluted. Many different peaks were detected in eluates, even more after plastics were exposed to UV or heat. Their identification is challenging, and an ecotoxicological evaluation based on analytical results is difficult {{due to the lack of}} toxicological data. She concluded that effect-based assays are needed to assess the toxicity of the eluates. Concentrations of microplastics in Swiss lakes and rivers were measured by Florian Faure (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland). All water bodies investigated contained microplastics. Concentrations increased by 5 – 150 times after <b>stormwater</b> <b>overflow</b> events. Faure and colleagues also analyzed selected additives and monomers in the plastic particles, as well as hydrophobic micropollutants.

In the European context, these actions are driven by the Water Directive 2000 / 60 /CE. In this regard, assessment studies of the potential load from sewer networks recognize the need for adaptation and upgrade of existing networks with waterworks and management measures. In many cases this is done by building first-flush detention tanks that, however, present consistent practical and economical burdens. In this work, simple rules to manage existing pumping stations in combined sewer systems are proposed as a way to apply management rules that mitigate pollution load. Such rules can be easily implemented in real cases with minimal cost of activation and no need of additional infrastructures. The procedure is based on the previous knowledge of the precipitation forcing and of a quantity/quality model of the sewer network. The steps adopted are (1) use of a (long-term, high-resolution) sequence of rainfall events to compute a wide spectrum of flow conditions (hydrographs and pollutographs) to the pumping stations; (2) definitions of a pumping rule to apply to the whole sequence of events to filter the incoming flow toward the wastewater treatment plant, so to compute outflows; and (3) efficiency assessment of the pumping rule by cumulative frequency analysis of water volume, pollutant mass, and pollutant mean concentration. Rule optimization can be performed by iterating points (2) and (3). An example is proposed to show how two simple parameters (a discharge threshold on the inflow and a maximum pumping time) can control the management of water and pollutant fluxes. Numerical results show that a proper optimization allows one to reduce the pumped volumes (thus reducing energy requirements and increasing the treatment plant efficiency) without significant changes to the overall pollutant mass outflow. The new pumping rules can be implemented on real stations with minimal and economically sustainable intervention...|$|R
50|$|The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) {{has three}} main responsibilities. The {{first is to}} treat the raw water drawn from the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers {{so that it is}} safe for drinking, and deliver it to customers. The second is to collect and treat {{wastewater}} (i.e., sewage) that flows into the sewer system. Philadelphia Water must treat this used water coming from homes, businesses and factories, as well as rainwater, so that it is clean enough to return to the Delaware River. The department is also responsible for collecting, storing and managing stormwater in order to keep excess <b>stormwater</b> from <b>overflowing</b> into the wastewater treatment system.The third is to collect and recycle biosolids into clean, beneficial soil-like compost. Biosolids are the solid materials left over from the wastewater treatment process, including plant material, human waste, food put down the garbage disposal and detergents. The Biosolids Recycling Center cleans, treats and transforms these materials into a nutrient-rich compost.|$|R
5000|$|Sewerage is the {{infrastructure}} that conveys sewage or surface runoff (stormwater, meltwater, rainwater) using sewers. It encompasses components such as receiving drains, manholes, pumping stations, storm <b>overflows,</b> and screening <b>chambers</b> {{of the combined}} sewer or sanitary sewer. Sewerage ends at the entry to a sewage treatment plant or {{at the point of}} discharge into the environment. It is the system of pipes, chambers, manholes, etc. that conveys the sewage or storm water.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of solid behavior in combined sewer <b>overflow</b> (CSO) <b>chambers</b> {{is a great}} challenge {{for the protection of}} receiving watercourses. Moreover, great attention must be given to the occurrence of deposits on the bed of the chamber because they may lead to operation problems. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a particle tracking approach to determine the solid separation in CSO chambers. This is done by comparing simulations and experimental data collected in three small-scale models, as reported by Kehrwiller 1995. The trap, reflect, and bed shear stress (BSS) boundary conditions are compared. We propose to use the Shields relationship for evaluating the critical BSS. Finally, we propose a methodology for predicting the solid separation in CSO chambers using computational fluid dynamics. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R
