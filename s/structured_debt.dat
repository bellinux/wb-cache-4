40|$|This is a {{first attempt}} at gauging the effects of {{corporate}} public debt issuance on the <b>debt</b> <b>structure,</b> risk profile and valuation of firms in an emerging market. We find that financial services firms, along with government institutions, are important early supporters of an organized public debt market. Firms in this market use equity, public debt and private debt funds simultaneously as need be. Consistent with predictions of the corporate <b>debt</b> <b>structure</b> literature, public debt-issuing firms are larger, older, more profitable, and less informational opaque than non-public debt-issuing firms. Moreover, public debt-issuing firms experience significant reductions in both overall and systematic risks, and incur lower cost of capital following issuance than non-public debt issuers. These and other findings of the study suggest deepening national debt markets can be a fruitful financial market development exercise for emerging markets.

40|$|We {{consider}} the debt {{capacity of a}} risky asset when debt is being rolled over {{and there is a}} liquidation cost in case of default. We show that debt capacity depends on how information {{about the quality of the}} asset is revealed. When the information structure is based on “optimistic” expectations, the arrival of no news about the asset is good news; under this <b>structure,</b> <b>debt</b> capacity does not depend upon rollovers and liquidation cost, and is simply equal to expected cash flows from the asset. In contrast, when the information structure is based on “pessimistic” expectations, no news about the asset is bad news; under this <b>structure,</b> <b>debt</b> capacity of the asset is decreasing in the liquidation cost and frequency of rollovers. In the limit, as the number of rollovers becomes unbounded, the debt capacity goes to zero even for an arbitrarily small default risk. Our model explains why markets for rollover debt, such as asset-backed commercial paper, may experience sudden freezes. The model also provides an explicit formula for the haircut in secured borrowing or repo transactions. asset-backed commercial paper; credit risk; haircut; liquidation cost; repo; secured borrowing...|$|R
