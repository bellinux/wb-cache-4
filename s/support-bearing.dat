40|$|Statistical {{methods used}} to predict system lifetimes from {{component}} lifetimes. Report shows how to use information to determine system life of drive train, using methods of probability and statistics. Presents life and reliability model for bevel-gear drive trains. Bevel-gear and <b>support-bearing</b> lives analyzed for each gear and bearing in drive train, with results statistically combined to produce system life for entire drive train. Numerical example included...|$|E
