5000|$|Both {{methods have}} their weaknesses; the most {{dangerous}} (and easily overcome) is their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> in the outline. Likewise, neither compares homologous points, and global change is always given more weight than local variation (which may have large biological consequences).Eigenshape analysis requires an equivalent starting point to be set for each specimen, {{which can be a}} source of errorEFA also suffers from redundancy in that not all variables are independent. [...] On the other hand, it is possible to apply them to complex curves without having to define a centroid; this makes removing the effect of location, size and rotation much simpler.The perceived failings of outline morphometrics are that it doesn't compare points of a homologous origin, and that it oversimplifies complex shapes by restricting itself to considering the outline and not internal changes. Also, since it works by approximating the outline by a series of ellipses, it deals poorly with pointed shapes.|$|E
5000|$|Louder sounds {{cause damage}} in a shorter period of time. Estimation of a [...] "safe" [...] {{duration}} of exposure is possible using an exchange rate of 3 dB. As 3 dB represents a doubling of intensity of sound, {{duration of exposure}} must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the [...] "safe" [...] daily exposure amount at 85 dB A, known as an exposure action value, is 8 hours, while the [...] "safe" [...] exposure at 91 dB(A) is only 2 hours. Different standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85 dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a synergistic interaction. Since noise damage is cumulative {{over long periods of}} time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.|$|E

It produces a spread spectrum signal using Frequency-shift keying (FSK) and Phase-shift keying (PSK) to spread the radiated power over a wider spectrum (range of frequencies) than normal radio transmissions. This reduces <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise,</b> jamming, and interception. In Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (supposedly like cell phone systems), each time interval (e.g. 1 second) is divided into time slots (e.g. 1024 per second). Together, all the time slots in the interval are called a [...] "frame". Each slot is [...] "bursted" [...] (transmitted) at a different frequency (FSK). Within each slot, the phase angle of the transmission burst can be varied to provide PSK. Each type of data to be transmitted is assigned a slot or block of slots (channel). In TDMA, the slot frequencies remain fixed from second to second (frame to frame). In DTDMA, the slot frequencies and/or slot assignments for each channel do not remain fixed from frame to frame but are varied in a pseudo-random manner. The slot assignments, frequencies, and information may all be encrypted to provide computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.|$|E

Of these survivors, many have experienced treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin that have aided in and enabled their recovery. Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug used to combat head, neck, and urological cancers, is highly ototoxic and causes significant high-frequency cochlear hearing loss, {{as well as}} increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> damage, leading to even more severe hearing losses. The current study assessed whether rats that {{have been exposed to}} cisplatin see potentiated noise-induced hearing loss, and determined if the increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> damage lasts {{for a period of time}} after the cisplatin treatment interval. The study found that subjects ’ <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> damage was still increased even four months after the end of cisplatin treatment, suggesting that the effects of this drug can last longer than only the duration of the drug administration itself. Further, the rats involved in this study experienced potentiated losses in frequencies indirectly affected by cisplatin (10, 15, and 20 kHz), indicating that the entirety of the cochlea was affected by the drug, and not merely the high frequencies. Further study is required to evaluate the clinical ramifications of these findings in humans and to develop appropriate counseling strategies to combat these effects, but the results provide an initial indication that clinical patients who have been administered cisplatin need to be educated on the long-term need for hearing protection from noise to avoid further hearing damage...|$|E

50|$|As long {{as there}} is tight electric- and magnetic-field {{coupling}} between the two wires, LVDS reduces the generation of electromagnetic noise. This noise reduction is due to the equal and opposite current flow in the two wires creating equal and opposite electromagnetic fields that tend to cancel each other. In addition, the tightly coupled transmission wires will reduce <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> electromagnetic <b>noise</b> interference because the noise will equally affect each wire and appear as a common-mode noise. The LVDS receiver is unaffected by common mode noise because it senses the differential voltage, which is not affected by common mode voltage changes.|$|R

In this paper, novel modulation techniques called Concentration Shift Keying (CSK) and Molecule Shift Keying (MoSK) are proposed for coding and decoding information of the so-called messenger molecule concentration waves in nanonetworks. The first technique, CSK, modulates the information via the variation in the concentration of the messenger molecules whereas MoSK utilizes different types of messenger molecules to represent the information. Using simulation, the performance of these modulation techniques is evaluated in terms of <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> and transmission power requirements.

RFID like all other wireless technologies has its short coming when it comes to range and <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise.</b> These short coming have made the RFID usage somewhat limited when it comes to its use for Localization. Most extant Localization scheme use Angle of Arrival methodology that results in accurate Localization at an extra cost to the Reader. The use of RSSI has proven to be a cheap solution to the Localization problem since no additional hardware is required, other than the receiver itself. RSS Localization schemes are based on the use of multiple Stationary Antennas and a Single tag placed on the asset. These attempts have been plagued by <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> and failed approaching the accuracy of Angle of Arrival method. In this work we propose a novel RFID based Localization methodology. Our scheme is based on Power Map Matching algorithm. The proposed method employs the use of a Single Stationary Reader Antenna and multitags placed on the asset. Unlike conventional Power Map Matching schemes which create the map from actual measurements; the proposed Power Map is automatically generated based on a model.

Several useful properties of tessellation density estimators (TDEs), such as low bias, scale invariance {{and sensitivity to}} local data morphology, make them an attractive alternative to standard kernel techniques.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{a method}} is {{proposed}} to optimally com-bine the received signal samples {{in space and}} time based on the principle of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After the combining, energy detection (ED) is used. However, optimal com-bining needs information of the source signal and channel, which is usually unknown. To overcome this difficulty, a method is proposed to blindly combine the signal samples. Similar to energy detection, blindly combined energy detection (BCED) does not need any in-formation of the source signal and the channel a priori. BCED can be much better than ED for highly correlated signals, and most im-portantly, it does not need noise power estimation and overcomes ED’s <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> uncertainty.
