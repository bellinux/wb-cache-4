5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A <b>splenectomy</b> was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a <b>splenectomy.</b> When Susan learns that her health insurance will not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical benefits. They agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. In this time of need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose. On his way to dinner, Mike is a victim of a hit-and-run at the hands of Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a dentist whom Susan had recently befriended.|$|E

30|$|Bone marrow smears were {{performed}} in the ICU in 77 cases and were mostly useful to contribute to HLH diagnosis (83 % hemophagocytosis). However, only 23 (30 %) identified HLH-etiology. Among tissues that were sampled, the highest and the lowest diagnostic yields were provided by spleen resection and liver biopsy, respectively (7 / 8 [87.5 %] <b>splenectomies</b> and 11 / 30 [37 %] liver biopsies allowed to establish a definite diagnosis).|$|R
50|$|Wandering spleen is most {{commonly}} diagnosed {{in young children}} as well as {{women between the ages of}} 20 and 40. Even so, the disease is very rare and fewer than 500 occurrences of the disease have been reported as of 2005, of which around 148 (including both children and adult cases) were documented to have been from between 1960 and 1992.

25|$|<b>Splenectomy</b> (removal of the spleen) may be {{considered}} in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following <b>splenectomy</b> is achieved in 60 to 65 percent of ITP cases, less so in older subjects. The use of <b>splenectomy</b> to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.|$|E

40|$|Background Current {{treatment}} for Gaucher’s disease involves administration of intravenous glucocerebrosidase to degrade glucocerebroside stored in lysosomes.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of OGT 918 (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin), an inhibitor of glucosyltransferase, as a novel oral {{treatment for}} non-neuronopathic Gaucher’s disease. Methods We recruited, into a 1 -year open-label study, 28 adults (seven with previous <b>splenectomies)</b> from four national Gaucher’s referral clinics, who were {{unable or unwilling to}} receive enzyme treatment.

40|$|Evidence of {{recurring}} {{activity of}} splenic tissue {{was investigated in}} patients who had undergone <b>splenectomies.</b> Methods included technetium 99 m sulfur colloid scan, serum tuftsin assay, serum immunoglobulin concentration, blood cell counts, and search for Howell-Jolly bodies. Positive scans were observed together with normal levels of tuftsin in 54 % of the patients. In 46 % of the patients, no splenic activity was detected by scanning {{and low levels of}} tuftsin were noticed. The difference in tuftsin levels between the two groups was statistically significant. Howell-Jolly bodies and decreased serum levels of IgM featured all patients. The possible application of combined splenic scan and tuftsin assessment for screening recurring splenic activity in the postsplenectomy population at great risk is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Each year, up to a 1000 <b>splenectomies</b> are {{performed}} in the Netherlands. Aside from patients without a spleen, {{there is also a}} large group of patients with hyposplenism or functional asplenia due to other primary diseases. All these patients are at risk of developing severe infections, such as post-splenectomy sepsis (PSS), which is associated with very high mortality. However PSS can partly be prevented by taking simple measures such as immunizations and prophylactic or early use of antibiotics. Healthcare professionals in first and secondary care in the Netherlands are generally not well informed about which preventive measures should be taken to prevent these infections, resulting in often suboptimal management of patients. In this article, recommendations are given on vaccination and administration of antibiotics to prevent severe infections such as PSS in this group of patient...|$|R
25|$|Removal of the spleen (<b>splenectomy)</b> is {{effective}} in reducing the severity of these complications, but is {{associated with an increased}} risk of overwhelming bacterial septicaemia, and is only performed on those with significant complications. Because many neonates with severe elliptocytosis progress to have only a mild disease, and because this age group is particularly susceptible to pneumococcal infections, a <b>splenectomy</b> is only performed on those under 5 years old when it is absolutely necessary.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of infection, physicians administer oral antibiotics as a prophylaxis after a surgical <b>splenectomy</b> (or starting at birth, for congenital asplenia or functional asplenia).|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} major {{are more}} inclined to have a <b>splenectomy.</b> The medical cases of splenectomies have been declining in recent years due to decreased prevalence of hypersplenism in adequately transfused patients. Patients with hypersplenism are inclined to have a lower amount of healthy blood cells in their body than normal and reveal symptoms of anemia. Iron rich patients need a <b>splenectomy</b> to reduce the probability of an iron overload. The different surgical techniques are the open and laparoscopic method. The laparoscopic method requires longer operating time but a shorter recovery period with no surgical scar. If it is unnecessary to remove the entire spleen a partial <b>splenectomy</b> may occur; this method preserves some of the immune function while reducing the probability of hypersplenism. Surgeons who chose Laparoscopic <b>splenectomy</b> must administer an appropriate immunization at least two weeks before the surgery. On the operating table the patient must be placed at a 30˚ to 40˚ position with his or her left arm elevated above the head to properly make the incision. The camera is inserted along with four other trocars: one placed in the left subcostal area, one inserted at the midpoint between the first and third, one 4cm right of the midline, and the fourth positioned on the midline to retract the spleen. Removing the spleen, an organ in under a person’s rib cage on the upper left side of its abdominal, allows the body to regulate the correct amount of healthy cells in the body.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Post-splenectomy {{infection}} has a {{mortality rate}} {{of up to}} 70 %. Previously we have published data confirming the poor adherence to best practice guidelines with relation to management of the asplenic patient. A defined protocol of care was established, staff education commenced and a 'patient information leaflet' made available. AIM: To ascertain whether management of the asplenic patient has improved since {{the implementation of a}} structured programme of care. METHOD: Retrospective chart review of all <b>splenectomies</b> performed in Beaumont Hospital between 2002 and 2008. RESULTS: Overall, 75. 9 % of patients were documented as having received the recommended vaccinations. Of these, 48. 7 % were not timed according to recommended guidelines. Prophylactic antibiotics were documented as prescribed in all but five patients discharged. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an improvement in post-splenectomy care between 2002 and 2008. However, further improvements are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{numbers of}} {{circulating}} lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) {{were observed in}} 115 individuals splenectomized for haematological disease (74 cases) or for trauma (41 cases). LGL lymphocytosis was present in 78. 4 % of haematologically indicated and in 85. 4 % of traumatic <b>splenectomies.</b> A 70. 5 % of these values was above the 97. 5 percentile upper tolerance limit of healthy controls (200 cases). In addition, 175 haematological controls were investigated. Forty per cent or more of circulating lymphocytes exhibited LGL morphology in nearly half of repeatedly investigated splenectomized persons. The increase in LGL is not attributable to lymphocytosis. It becomes apparent, and persists after the first postoperative week, irrespective of the cause of surgery. In spite of the two-fold increase in LGL concentration in the blood, in vitro natural killer (NK) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) activities did not increase in the investigated 48 (NK) and 31 (ADCC) splenectomized persons, {{as compared with the}} appropriate healthy or haematological controls...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{operative}} {{potential of}} hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) could {{be enhanced by}} the introduction {{of a new generation of}} assisting instruments. These tools will have to meet specific requirements of shape, function, and safety of use. Methods: Problems related to the working environment of HALS and deriving projectual restrictions of HALS instruments were analyzed in order to develop and manufacture a working prototype with grasping and dissecting properties to assist during HALS procedures. The resulting instrument was mechanically and clinically tested in 22 HALS procedures. Results: The additional benefit of the new device was particularly appreciated during dissection and isolation of vascular pedicles (nephrectomies and <b>splenectomies).</b> It was shown to be safe and effective in providing the additional assistance it was designed for. Conclusion: The described grasping and dissecting instrument for HALS is of great value in assisting the surgeon during fine dissection, as required in selected procedures. New generation of HALS instruments should comply with the functional and safety issues analyzed in this report...|$|R

25|$|To {{minimise}} {{the risks}} associated with <b>splenectomy,</b> antibiotic and vaccination protocols have been established, but are often poorly adhered to by physicians and patients due to the complications resulting from antibiotic prophylaxis such as development of an overpopulation of Clostridium difficile in the intestinal tract.|$|E
40|$|Hibernation is an energy-conserving {{behavior}} in winter characterized by two phases: torpor and arousal. During torpor, markedly reduced metabolic activity results in inactivity and decreased body temperature. Arousal periods intersperse the torpor bouts and feature increased metabolism and euthermic body temperature. Alterations in physiological parameters, such as suppression of hemostasis, {{are thought to}} allow hibernators to survive periods of torpor and arousal without organ injury. While the state of torpor is potentially procoagulant, due to low blood flow, increased viscosity, immobility, hypoxia, and low body temperature, organ injury due to thromboembolism is absent. To investigate platelet dynamics during hibernation, we measured platelet count and function during and after natural torpor, pharmacologically induced torpor and forced hypothermia. <b>Splenectomies</b> were performed to unravel potential storage sites of platelets during torpor. Here we show that decreasing body temperature drives thrombocytopenia during torpor in hamster with maintained functionality of circulating platelets. Interestingly, hamster platelets during torpor do not express P-selectin, but expressio...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse large B cell {{lymphoma}} of the spleen {{is a form}} of splenic lymphoma, a rare primary neoplasm of the spleen. The {{clinical presentation}} is nausea, fatigue, weight loss, and other nonspecific symptoms. The most often seen laboratory finding is anemia. The first sonographic findings are typically splenomegaly and a well-defined hypoechoic mass. Most cases are treated with <b>splenectomies.</b> If the malignancy is confined to the spleen, the prognosis is favorable, but metastasis beyond the spleen is associated with a poor outcome. This case presents a classic case of diffuse large B cell splenic lymphoma with extension into the hilar lymph nodes. Keywords splenic lymphoma, splenic tumor, hilar nodes, spleen Primary malignancies of the spleen are very rare, with diffuse large B cell lymphoma being an atypical sub-type.

40|$|From 1987, {{when the}} first laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} was performed, different surgical techniques were done by laparoscopic approach. We analised the type of the surgical procedures performed in the University Hospital Brugmann between 1995 – 2004 : in the first 5 years (1995 – 2000) laparoscopic approach was used for cholecystectomies, surgery of the gastro-esophageal disease, perforated ulcer, appendectomies, <b>splenectomies,</b> treatment of the groin hernias, small bowell obstruction, colectomies and gastrectomies. From 2000 we used the laparoscopic approach {{in the treatment of}} the post-incisional hernias and in the last years for surgical treatment of obesity and retroperitoneal tumors. Postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic techniques was lower than for the similar open procedures, especially for postoperative pain, surgical site infections and incisional hernias. Conclusions: 70 – 75 % of the surgical techniques were performed by laparoscopic approach. 25 % from the operations were done by open approach, especially the operations performed in emergency, re-interventions and other complex situations.

25|$|Other {{treatments}} include rituximab infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha. In limited cases, {{the patient}} {{may benefit from}} <b>splenectomy</b> (removal of the spleen).

40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} characteristics, clinical course, {{and outcome}} of 96 episodes of pseudo-monas bacteremia occurring during 1980 - 1984 {{in a community}} teaching hospital are reviewed. The male-to-female ratio for the patients involved was 1. 9 : 1. The mean age was 64 years, and 41 patients were ~ 70 years of age. Sixty-two episodes were nosocomially acquired; nine were acquired in nursing homes. 1 Wenty episodes were polymicrobial. The respiratory and genitourinary tracts were the most common sources of bacteremia. Seven patients had <b>splenectomies</b> prior to the onset of bacteremia. The overall mortality was 61010; mortality attributable to pseudomonas bacteremia was 48 %. Statistically signifi-cant differences in mortality were related to underlying conditions and portal of entry.

30|$|Advanced ovarian {{carcinoma}} is {{a lethal}} tumour, and its standard treatment is consists of aggressive primary cytoreductive surgery {{followed by a}} chemoadjuvance based on platinum agents. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register of 2010, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE of 2010. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies. One {{of the goals of}} its management is to achieve the longest overall survival possible, and the most important survival factor is the residual tumour after cytoreductive surgery, obtaining the best surveillance in the cases where no tumour is left in the abdomen. To improve the cytoreductive rates in the actual management strategy, a change is necessary, selecting the cases not suitable for primary debulking surgery and adding, if necessary, procedures different than the ovarian tumour resection, like bowel resections, peritonectomies (particularly diaphragmatic ones) and <b>splenectomies.</b> This review pretends to understand why advanced ovarian carcinoma should be treated with primary surgery whenever possible and to rationate the use of extrapelvic surgical procedures. The improvement of surgical rates with these manoeuvres can determine the best management of our patients, without clinical complications.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Accessory spleens {{are found}} in 10 – 15 % of the population, and are even more {{prevalent}} in patients with hematological disorders (Rudowski, 1985). It infrequently may become symptomatic due to torsion, spontaneous rupture or hemorrhage which may lead to death. Torsion of an accessory spleen is extremely rare, and requires prompt medical attention [2] (Coote et al., 1999). Presentation of case: We report {{the case of a}} 27 -year-old Mediterranean lady with thalassemia trait, who presented to the emergency department with an acute surgical abdomen due to torsion of a giant accessory spleen, measuring 13  cm. She was diagnosed with the aid of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan and was treated surgically through resection of the spleen. Discussion and conclusion: Torsion of an accessory spleen is not common, and is the surgical indication in about 0. 2 – 0. 3 % of <b>splenectomies</b> (Mortele et al., 2004). It has variable clinical presentations, and is a difficult preoperative diagnosis due to lack of specificity of symptoms. Accessory spleens are usually smaller than 3  cm, with few cases being reported as larger than 10  cm larger accessory spleens have a higher rate of torsion. Knowledge of this pathology, and familiarity with its radiological findings are fundamental to accurately diagnosing and manageming this challenging condition...|$|R
25|$|The risk to asplenic {{patients}} {{has been}} expressed as equivalent {{to an adult}} dying in a road traffic accident (in every 100 people without spleens, 1 to 5 would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK <b>Splenectomy</b> Trust Advice)hence sensible precautions are advisable.

25|$|The {{original}} technique {{described by}} Sugiura and Futagawa was a two-step operation consisting of an initial thoracic operation {{followed by the}} abdominal operation 3–4 weeks later. The thoracic operation consists of an extensive paraesophageal devascularization up to the inferior pulmonary vein and esophageal transection. The abdominal operation consists of a <b>splenectomy,</b> devascularization of the abdominal esophagus and cardia, and a selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty.|$|E
25|$|In mild cases, only careful {{observation}} may {{be required}} but very low counts or significant bleeding may prompt treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, or immunosuppressive drugs. Refractory ITP (not responsive to conventional treatment) may require <b>splenectomy,</b> the surgical removal of the spleen. Platelet transfusions {{may be used in}} severe bleeding together with a very low count. Sometimes the body may compensate by making abnormally large platelets.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{reports of}} gastrocutaneous fistulas {{emphasize}} their benign {{nature and the}} probability of spontaneous healing {{without the need for}} surgical closure. In distinct contrast we report our experiences with six patients whose gastrocutaneous fistulas were caused by fulminant pancreatitis and pancreatic abscesses. High-output acid fistulas appeared days to weeks after drainage of left upper quadrant-infected collections. None occurred at the time of initial abscess drainage. Most originated high on the greater curvature of the stomach and traversed the abscess cavity. Three of six patients had previous <b>splenectomies,</b> but these operations were remote in time from the appearance of the fistula. Nonoperative management was successful in only two of six patients. Massive hemorrhage from the fistula tract contributed to the deaths of three patients. The pathogenesis of these fistulas appears to be consequent to gastric injury resulting from adjacent pancreatic inflammation. We conclude that (1) gastrocutaneous fistulas associated with pancreatitis are unlikely to heal even with drainage of the abscesses and are often complicated by hemorrhage, (2) surgical closure of the fistula will often be necessary and should not be unreasonably delayed, and (3) when performed in a semi-elective setting, resection of the damaged gastric segment, perhaps with an omental or serosal patch to buttress the gastric suture line, has a good chance of success...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: While optimal cytoreduction is the {{standard}} of care for advanced ovarian cancer, the related post-operative morbidity has not been clearly documented outside pioneering centers. Indeed {{most of the studies}} are monocentric with inclusions over several years inducing heterogeneity in techniques and goals of surgery. We assessed the morbidity of optimal cytoreduction surgery for advanced ovarian cancer within a short inclusion period in 6 referral centers dedicated to achieve complete cytoreduction. Patients and Methods: The 30 last optimal debulking surgeries of 6 cancer centers were included. Inclusion criteria included: stage IIIc- IV ovarian cancer and optimal surgery performed at the site of inclusion. All post-operative complications within 30 days of surgery were recorded and graded using the Memorial secondary events grading system. Student-t, Chi 2 and non-parametric statistical tests were performed. Results: 180 patients were included. There was no demographic differences between the centers. 63 patients underwent surgery including intestinal resections (58 recto-sigmoid resection), 24 diaphragmatic resections, 17 <b>splenectomies.</b> 61 patients presented complications; One patient died post-operatively.

40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} common. Fundoplication is very {{effective}} for {{those patients who}} fail medical therapy, particularly those with an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter. Open surgery is reported to achieve cure rates in excess of 90 percent. Laparoscopic fundoplication has been performed since 1991. The early experience with this procedure is reviewed. Results: 1992 cases were reported in the literature. The mortality rate was 0. 1 percent. Operative complications occurred as follows: 0. 9 percent esophagogastric perforation rate; 0. 6 percent bleeding rate (requiring transfusion); and 0. 6 percent pneumothorax rate. No <b>splenectomies</b> were reported. 4. 8 percent of patients required conversion to the open procedure. As experience with the procedure is gained this conversion rate decreases. Recurrent reflux postoperatively is 3. 4 percent, but follow-up is short (range: 0 to 36 months; mean: two years). Dysphagia requiring dilatation occurs in 3. 5 percent of patients. Gas bloat occurs in 0 to 24 percent of patients. These results compare favorably with the published results of medical therapy and the open fundoplication. Conclusions: The early experience with laparoscopic fundoplication appears promising and provides an attractive alternative to long-term medical therapy and to open surgery in appropriate patients.
