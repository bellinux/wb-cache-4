2500|$|As {{head of the}} Natural History Collections at the British Museum, Owen {{received}} numerous inquiries {{and complaints}} about the Origin. His own views remained unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee {{the need for a}} new Natural History museum, he pointed out that [...] "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence?

6000|$|... "What is enough, Pierre? To <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{poor women}} and children, {{who are likely}} to behold their homesteads in flames, before many hours?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Having <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{troubles}} {{created by}} Kalineesan for the Santror, Thirumal visited Neesan and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} journeyed much, and been {{stirring}} late and early, good-man, to have <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, {{and to have}} got no harm." ...|$|R
60|$|She had <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> evidences of {{a civilization}} and brain-power transcending in {{scientific}} achievement anything that her race had produced; nor once had she seen {{a creature of}} her own kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "To the Abbaye. After that, {{there is}} the Rat Mort--Albert must not be disappointed--and a new place, they tell me. One must <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> new places." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense. All that reddlemen do is sell reddle. You <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> bags at {{the back}} of my cart? They are not full of little boys--only full of red stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear, dear me! quite a {{geographical}} study, I declare," [...] exclaimed Secretary Jack, examining the painting with some care. [...] "Can you really <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> places at once from Wheal Dooem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the day at}} Edinburgh Castle when we saw {{the jewels}} and the armoury. But you must have <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things many times before? You could not have enjoyed it as much as we did for the first time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Evan is happier alone," [...] said Sandra. [...] "We {{have been}} {{separated}} from the newspapers. Well, it is better that people should have what they want.... You have <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> wonderful things since we met.... What impression ... I think that you are changed." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the March 5th SouthTown Star article, {{reporter}} Amy Lee interviewed {{water quality}} expert David De John who said [...] "It's flat-out disturbing because, as they {{note in the}} report, they have not <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> cases come to reality, {{we have not seen}} the end of these illnesses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things very much," [...] said Rollo, [...] "some other day; but now we will go on, Jennie, to the church, where {{the rest of the}} people are going." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise couldn't <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{details from}} her seat in the {{pavilion}} across the river, but she was near enough to observe the general effect of the old man's antiquated costume and it amazed her.|$|E
60|$|Rollo wished {{very much}} to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things--but there was one {{question}} which it puzzled him {{very much to}} decide, and that was whether he would rather go to Holland in the summer or in the winter.|$|E
6000|$|... "You tell me," [...] she said, after a pause, [...] "that {{there is}} a God,--a God that looks down and <b>sees</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things. May be it's so. The sisters in the convent {{used to tell me}} of a day of judgment, when {{everything}} is coming to light;--won't there be vengeance, then! ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the first}} {{recognition}} for many a day! and, at the smoothing motion of her hand over him, while she still entreated, [...] "Lie still, my dear," [...] the mutterings died away; the childish instinct of obedience stilled the struggles; {{and there was something}} more like repose than had been <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weary months.|$|R
50|$|After Pope Andronicus had {{accomplished}} {{six years in}} his patriarchal office, and had suffered from the Persians, and <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> disasters, which he encountered and patiently endured, {{he went to his}} rest, and departed to the Lord in perfect peace, holding fast to the right faith, the faith of his fathers, on the 8th of Toba (January 16, 623).|$|R
60|$|Of {{course we}} were as yet {{too far off}} to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> details, but the general outline I saw at once, and it {{astonished}} me considerably. Even old Indaba-zimbi, whom the Baboon-woman {{had been unable to}} move, deigned to show wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle thinks one has {{no right}} to waste money on such things, but he is very generous and loves to give useful, beautiful, or curious gifts. <b>See,</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> pretty {{ornaments}} are for presents, and you shall choose first whatever you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he is an}} oddity--and {{a genius}} too, I declare!" [...] he continued. [...] "I have been {{wondering}} all the morning how I could have read the Bible to so little purpose as not to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> particulars he has presented." ...|$|E
5000|$|Soule {{has said}} that [...] "He's {{trying to do what}} he can to both collect strong Inhumans to help his own society, but also cleanse the planet of Inhumans who should never have {{received}} Terrigenesis in the first place,", because [...] "the idea is that not everyone on Earth <b>sees</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> new Inhumans popping up as a good thing." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{over all}} lay a sickly, pallid ocher light {{through which the}} scourged clouds raced. Tarzan had <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{conditions}} many times before, yet he never could escape a strange feeling at each recurrence of them. He knew no fear, but {{in the face of}} Nature's manifestations of her cruel, immeasurable powers, he felt very small--very small and very lonely.|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{indications}} of hard roystering; like a cautious young bridegroom {{at his own}} marriage merry-making, Taji stood on his guard. And when Borabolla urged him to empty a gourd or two, by way of making room in him for the incidental repast about to be served, Taji civilly declined; not wishing to cumber the floor, before the cloth was laid.|$|R
60|$|Now Hokosa {{had lived}} to <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{convictions}} shattered: {{he had seen}} the lightning, which he pretended to be able to control, roll back upon him from the foot of the Christian cross, reducing his god to nothingness and his companions to corpses.|$|E
60|$|Rollo, {{looking down}} {{from the window of}} his uncle George's room, could <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things very plainly; for the roof which {{protected}} the piazza from the rain was {{up at the top of}} the hotel, and therefore did not interfere with his view.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] he declared, [...] "I think that the {{evidence}} went to prove {{that there were no}} visitors in the restaurant that night. You <b>see,</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> offices round here close at six or seven o'clock, and the whole neighborhood becomes deserted." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now {{let us go}} back to {{the history}} of [...] "that most learned, famous, and rare Baron Vesalius," [...] who had stood by and <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things done; and try if we cannot, after we have learned the history of his early life, guess at some of his {{probable}} meditations on this celebrated clinical case; and guess also how those meditations may have affected seriously the events of his after life.|$|R
30|$|Based on Theorem 2, one can <b>see</b> that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> poles {{lie in the}} {{stability}} region. This indicates that the proposed controller can asymptotically synchronize foregoing systems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Melvin Sarangay of Inquirer Bandera writes that although its prospective audiences are teenagers, the film [...] "surpasses {{as a family}} movie because of its discussion of some real life issues in a family." [...] Abby Mendoza of FHM Philippines writes, [...] "While you’ve plausibly <b>seen</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> before: an incredibly convoluted plot imbued with all-too familiar characters, Vince and Kath and James pulls off rom-com tropes with flair. ... It’s cute without being annoying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, you see, Lillie," [...] John persevered, in a {{pleading}} tone,--"you <b>see,</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> alterations {{that have}} been made in the house have involved very serious expenses; and then, too, we are living at a very different rate of expense from what we ever lived before"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--and if I {{could help}} you get a job, though of course---- Being a {{stranger}} out here---- Seems strange to me, though," [...] Mr. Boltwood struggled on, [...] "that a strong fellow like you should be utterly destitute, when I <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> farmers able to have cars----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{can show}} you exactly how that fellow put us off the scent here," [...] their guide proceeded. [...] "He seems to have picked up something, Edgar, in those South American trips of yours, for a cleverer thing I never saw. You <b>see</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> bullrushes everywhere--clouds of them, all along the river?" ...|$|E
6000|$|WANDA. Promise me--wherever you go, I go too. Promise! Larry, {{you think}} I haven't <b>seen,</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> weeks. But I have <b>seen</b> everything; <b>all</b> in your heart, always. You cannot hide from me. I knew--I knew! Oh, if we might go {{away into the}} sun! Oh! Larry--couldn't we? [She {{searches}} his eyes with hers--then shuddering] Well! If it must be dark--I don't care, if I may go in your arms. In prison we could not be together. I am ready. Only love me first. Don't let me cry before I go. Oh! Larry, will there be much pain? ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. I <b>see</b> {{that after}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> years {{you have not}} changed a bit, Gertrude.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these,</b> the Devas asked Kali {{to thank}} Shiva, and the Devas also {{asked him to}} claim the boons (blessings and permissions). Kali {{accepted}} this, saying, [...] "Your highness, thank you for creating a lady for me. Would you mind giving me other items I need?" [...] Shiva told, [...] "What do you want?" [...] Since Shiva had agreed to offer Kali boons, he started asking for boons which control the whole Universe. This panicked all of the logas, who shivered on hearing the boons of Kali.|$|R
