5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Ragtop: Originally an open {{car like}} a roadster, {{but with a}} <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> (cloth top) that can be raised or lowered. Unlike a convertible, it had no roll-up side windows. Now often used as slang for a convertible.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, Ferrari {{recalled}} about 2,000 2005–2007 F430 Spiders in the U.S., due to {{the risk}} that heat from the engine could cause the <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto the V8 motor, resulting in a fire.|$|E
50|$|A {{range of}} {{materials}} {{is available for}} <b>soft</b> <b>tops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Off-road: Another type of {{convertibles}} is the {{off-road vehicles}} with removable <b>soft</b> <b>tops</b> such as Jeep Wrangler, Suzuki Escudo, Suzuki Samurai, Ford Bronco, Land Rover Defender, Mercedes-Benz G-Class, early models of Toyota Land Cruiser, Land Rover Defender, etc. All these models {{are available with}} various types of <b>soft</b> <b>tops</b> that attach to the roll cage or to the installation points on the vehicle's body.|$|R

25|$|Roadster: Originally a two-seat open {{car with}} minimal weather {{protection}} — without top or side glass — though possibly with optional hard or <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> and side curtains (i.e., without roll-up glass windows). In modern usage, the term means simply a two-seat sports car convertible, {{a variation of}} spyder.|$|E
25|$|The Second to Fourth Generation Thunderbird {{convertibles}} {{were similar}} in design to the Lincoln convertible {{of the time and}} borrowed from earlier Ford hardtop/convertible designs. While these Thunderbird models had a true convertible <b>soft</b> <b>top,</b> the top was lowered to stow in the forward trunk area. This design reduced available trunk space when the top was down.|$|E
25|$|The {{trunk lid}} was rear-hinged; raised and lowered via {{hydraulic}} cylinders during the top raising or lowering cycle. The forward {{end of the}} trunk lid contained a metal plate that extended upward to cover the area that the top is stowed in. With the top down and the trunk lid lowered, there is no sight of the <b>soft</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
50|$|The car was now offered {{either as}} a two-door “cabrio-limousine” (a <b>soft</b> <b>topped</b> four seater with fixed side windows) or as a “full” two seater cabriolet.|$|R
50|$|Beside <b>soft</b> <b>tops</b> for {{convertibles}} and roofmodules, Toyo Seat produces automobile seats, mechanical products, automotive exhaust pipes, door trims, train seats, steel office furniture, health equipment, {{and other}} products.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of World War I some {{automakers}} offered a removable roof, typically with a wood frame with a canvas or leather covering, that bolted onto touring car or roadster bodies. They typically used side curtains like the conventional folding <b>soft</b> <b>tops.</b>|$|R
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV {{used the}} fixed-profile convertible, where {{the doors and}} upper side {{elements}} of its bodywork remain fixed, while its fabric <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> can be opened. This reduces weight and lowers the centre of gravity, and allows the carrying of long or irregularly shaped items, but the key reason was that fabric was cheaper than steel which was in short supply and expensive after the war. The fixed-profile concept was quite popular in this period.|$|E
25|$|In May 1958, {{a second}} {{version of the}} Mark E became available, the Mark E Saloon Coupe. Externally, because the roof was longer than that on the tourer, this gave the {{impression}} that the car was a 2+2, but internally it was the same size, and simply replaced the convertibles <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> with a full-length fibreglass roof. Though not described as a detachable hardtop, the roof could (with a little patience!) be removed in one piece, if desired.|$|E
5000|$|Season 5 - 1971 Plymouth Cuda convertible, actually, three 1971s (all {{dark green}} with green {{interiors}} and black <b>soft</b> <b>tops),</b> were supplied by Chrysler Corporation, and all had differently sized (318, 340, 383) engines. One was wrecked, but later repaired. One episode the hood is raised, dynamite discovered, {{and the air}} cleaner reads 383.|$|R

25|$|The bridge has 7 piers with a {{total of}} 14 columns, and {{consists}} of approximately 10,000 cubic metres of reinforced concrete (with the rebar weighing approximately 1,000 tons). Some of the piles were driven 50m deep, to avoid issues with the <b>softer</b> <b>top</b> layers in the Manukau Harbour. The bridge itself consists of single-pour concrete columns and form traveller-constructed balanced cantilever decks.|$|R
25|$|Porsche AG {{announced}} on May 7, 2007 that the 911 Turbo Cabriolet {{would go on}} sale in September 2007. The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet {{became one of the}} fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coupé, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coupés, such as the poor aerodynamics of a <b>soft</b> <b>top,</b> a lack of torsional rigidity, and the consequential weight increase from structural members.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Z07 {{had been}} designed with production in mind. As a result, practical and regulatory considerations necessitated very few changes for the production model. Nevertheless, the windshield of the Z8 was extended upward, and a larger front airdam was fitted. Both changes were implemented to provide aerodynamic stability and a reasonably placid cockpit environment. The four-spoke steering wheel of the concept car {{was replaced by a}} three spoke design. The hardtop was changed from a double-bubble form with a tapering faring to a single dome with a truncated convex backside. The concept's exotic driver's side helmet fairing was eliminated to allow easy operation of the power <b>soft</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 50th Anniversary Edition (RPO Z25) {{was offered}} during the 2003 model year to commemorate a half-century of Corvette production. Available in {{convertible}} and coupe models (but {{not with the}} Z06), the 50th Anniversary Edition came with a special shade of red paint ("Anniversary Red Metallic") and shale two-tone leather interior; Anniversary Edition convertibles were adorned with a shale-colored <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> as well. A new option for Corvette in 2003, the F55 Magnetic Selective Ride Control Suspension was standard on the 1SC-equipped Anniversary Edition vehicles. Special ("Warm Nickel Metallic") painted aluminum wheels, embroidered upholstery trim, and badges completed the Anniversary Edition package. Also included were all of the convenience options offered on the upscale Corvette models.|$|E
50|$|The term {{coach trimmer}} {{derives from the}} days when car frames were {{produced}} by manufacturers and delivered to coach builders to add a car body and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, <b>soft</b> <b>tops,</b> and roof linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were often an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.|$|R
25|$|Public safety officers, such {{as those}} from the police, fire department, {{ambulance}} service, and customs, often wear peaked caps, especially on formal occasions. In the US, police forces use caps that have <b>softer</b> <b>tops</b> and are not round and rigid in form (notable are those worn in New York and San Francisco). British and Australian policemen have a checkerboard pattern on the cap band, and traffic wardens often have a reflective yellow strip.|$|R
50|$|The new {{convertible}} offered both a retractable hardtop and <b>soft</b> <b>tops,</b> {{with the}} Sebring's roofs manufactured by Karmann. A vinyl top {{came on the}} base LX model, a cloth roof on the Touring and Limited models with the option of a retractable metal hardtop. The convertible top retracts into the trunk with a power tonneau cover and a luggage protector for the top. The top can also be retracted with the remote keyless entry, meaning the top can be stowed without being inside the car or starting the engine.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{domestic}} market received the Type S edition {{for the last}} two years of production (2008–2009). Changes are similar to the U.S. market's CR edition, sharing the weight loss, a purpose built bodykit providing much higher downforce, bespoke wheels and interior. Although it shares the wheels with the CR edition, the Type S retains the rear tire size of 245/40R-17 for better handling. A specific Type S suspension setup with improved geometry was designed to enhance the handling, the setup is stiffer but more compromising than the CR setup to suit it better to everyday spirited driving and the Japanese touge experience. The Type S retains its <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> folding mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The main {{change for}} the 2012 models was the {{installation}} of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the power and torque outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a diesel particulate filter {{for the first time}} on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> body style to the general market. This had been a popular option for the Land Rover Series but by the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{model year}} {{marked the first}} time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.|$|E
60|$|His mate {{was a bit}} of a bounder, {{with one}} of those rakish {{military}} caps whose <b>soft</b> <b>tops</b> cock sideways or backwards. He was in Italian khaki, riding-breeches and puttees. He smoked his cigarette bounderishly: but at the same time, with peculiar gentleness, he handed one to the ginger Hamlet. Hamlet accepted it, and his mate held him a light as the bus swung on. They were like man and wife. The mate was the alert and wide-eyed Jane Eyre whom the ginger Mr. Rochester was not going to spoil in a hurry.|$|R
50|$|WGCY {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} commercial radio stations in North America to feature the Beautiful Music format, consisting chiefly of a mix of instrumental covers of pop songs and soft vocals (including <b>softer</b> <b>Top</b> 40 oldies, standards, and album cuts by MOR artists). In addition to its easy listening music, WGCY features frequent local newscasts, farm reports, and sports play-by-play and hourly newscasts from CBS Radio. A recent addition (2016) is the Friday Oldies Get Together featuring Lane Lindstrom. This program dates back 25 + years in this area playing the music of the 1960s and early-1970s.|$|R
25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} {{was not only}} the Corvette's first {{production}} year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different. All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors, and black canvas <b>soft</b> <b>tops.</b> Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today. They had independent front suspension, but featured a rigid axle supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear. The cost of the first production model Corvettes in 1953 was $3490.|$|R
500|$|The Wreck is {{distinguished}} by its old gold body and white <b>soft</b> <b>top.</b> The <b>soft</b> <b>top</b> has a chrome support strut, {{which features a}} brass classic Tech T and 1952 yellow jacket. The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run {{the length of the}} vehicle. The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride. The interior upholstery is solid white vinyl. The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it. There are two golden nylon pennants emblazoned with the words [...] "To Hell With Georgia" [...] and [...] "Give 'Em Hell Tech" [...] fastened to the front bumper.|$|E

5000|$|But {{despite its}} {{reputation}} for news, easy-listening music, and shows that homemakers enjoyed, the Yankee Network {{was no longer}} as influential as it had once been. After experimenting with various formats (including talk radio, big band, and a brief attempt to play some of the <b>softer</b> <b>top</b> 40 hits), Yankee found itself struggling for a niche. Affiliates had dwindled: a majority of stations now preferred {{to have their own}} local staff, rather than relying on a regional network. [...] Further, flagship station WNAC was preparing to switch to a top-40 hit music format (under the call letters WRKO). [...] The Yankee Network's parent company, RKO General, announced the network would be disbanded. It officially ceased operation on February 26, 1967.|$|R
