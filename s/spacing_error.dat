40|$|Coherent field imaging {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} of equal transmitting apertures spacing and equal spectrum of laser, and high-resolution image is reconstructed by iteratively computing the frequency spectrum. However, the inevitable transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> of laser is a key factor to affect the coherent field imaging quality in the application. Aiming at the problem of degrading imaging quality caused by the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> we discuss the mechanism of influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and propose a novel method of improving imaging quality from the perspective of suppressing the influence of transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error.</b> Firstly, the mechanism of the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and laser echo spectrum is analyzed in detail. Then we derive a frequency spectrum error propagation model. Based on the model, the iterative effect of frequency spectrum error is investigated and the trend of variation in imaging quality with frequency spectrum error is given. We propose a theoretical equation, in which the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> has no influence on frequency spectrum nor imaging quality. To solve the above equation, an optimized method of linear programming is proposed and the optimized matrix of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> is obtained. In practice, the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality can be largely counteracted by reasonably allocating aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> according to the optimized <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> matrix. The correctness and validity of the theoretical model are verified by a simulation experiment. The results show that the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index can be improved by about 100 % through using the proposed method, the greater the aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> the higher the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index obtained by the method will be. In addition, the method is easy to use practically and less costly as well. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed method can easily and effectively counteract the degrading effect of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality. The research can provide a theoretical basis for improving imaging quality and reasonably assigning transmitter aperture spacing accuracy of coherent field imaging telescope...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different tooth spacing errors. The simulation examined varying amplitudes of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs. The modification considered included both linear and parabolic tip relief. The analysis considered <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> that varies around most of the gear circumference (similar to a typical sinusoidal error pattern) as well as a shorter span of spacing errors that occurs on only a few teeth. The dynamic analysis was performed using a revised version of a NASA gear dynamics code, modified to add tooth spacing errors to the analysis. Results obtained from the investigation show that linear tip relief is more effective in reducing dynamic loads on gears with small spacing errors but parabolic tip relief becomes more effective as the amplitude of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> increases. In addition, the parabolic modification is more effective for the more severe error case where the error is spread over a longer span of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design robust tooth profile modification for improving dynamic performance of gear sets with different tooth spacing errors...|$|E

40|$|Most NLP {{applications}} {{work under}} the assumption that a user input is error-free; thus, word segmentation (WS) for written languages that use word boundary markers (WBMs), such as spaces, has been regarded as a trivial issue. However, noisy real-world texts, such as blogs, e-mails, and SMS, may contain <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> that require correction before further processing may take place. For the Korean language, many researchers have adopted a traditional WS approach, which eliminates all spaces in the user input and re-inserts proper word boundaries. Unfortunately, such an approach often exacerbates the word spacing quality for user input, which has few or no spacing errors; such is the case, because a perfect WS model does not exist. In this paper, we propose a novel WS method that takes into consideration the initial word spacing information of the user input. Our method generates a better output than the original user input, even if the user input has few <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> Moreover, the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art Korean WS model when the user input initially contains less than 10 % <b>spacing</b> <b>errors,</b> and performs comparably for cases containing more <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> We believe that the proposed method will be a very practical pre-processing module. ...|$|R

TSS increases use of performance-based navigation (PBN) arrival procedures during periods of high traffic demand. It enhances two Federal Aviation Administration operational systems with terminal metering and controller spacing tools. Sixteen high-fidelity human-in-the-loop simulations, involving more than five hundred hours of evaluation time, were conducted to mature TSS from proof-of-concept design to fully functional prototype. These simulations modeled arrival procedures at several U.

Two metrics are evaluated for these simulations: PBN Success Rate and Inter-Arrival <b>Spacing</b> <b>Error.</b> The PBN Success Rate shows a definitive trend when TSS is used. It increases from 42 % for today's operations to 68 % for terminal metering only and 92 % for terminal metering with controller-managed spacing tools.

The effects of time based spacing criteria, mixed aircraft types and wind conditions {{on the ability of}} an aircraft to maintain a time spacing behind a descending lead aircraft were investigated. The spacing performance of a previously used approximate time delay spacing criterion based on current lead aircraft speed was compared with an exact time delay spacing criterion based on lead aircraft position history. The exact time delay spacing criterion resulted in smaller time delay spacing errors and smoother true airspeed behaviour. The exact time delay (60 s) criterion was then used to compare the spacing performance of a heavy aircraft following a light with a heavy aircraft following a heavy for different wind conditions. The results show that a heavy aircraft followed a light with approximately 40 % more maximum time <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> than a heavy aircraft followed a heavy. Different effects for constant and turbulent winds were observed. Maximum <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> increased slightly with constant wind speed but always remained within 10 s up to maximum constant wind speeds of 87 knots (at 30 feet altitude) and 235 knots (at 29, 000 feet altitude).

This research employs the historical WIM data to analyze sensor health and compares the evaluation results of the methods. The results suggest the new triangulation method identified most possible WIM malfunctions that other methods sensed, and this method unprecedentedly monitors the process behavior with controls of time and meteorological variables. The SPC method appeared superior in differentiating between sensor noises and sensor errors or drifts, but it drew wrong conclusions when accurate WIM data reference was absent.

40|$|Research {{results from}} domains such as road highway traffic and {{military}} vehicle platoons conclude that string stability cannot be obtained when vehicles use only relative spacing information to maintain constant distance behind a predecessor. Air traffic studies confirm these results but such instability {{has not been}} shown for constant time delay based airborne spacing. Unlike constant distance based, constant time delay based spacing {{has the potential to}} enhance stability by anticipating changes in spacing using the preceding aircraft’s history. This simulation based study analysed the merging of aircraft by constant time delay based spacing over the period of the order of an hour to observe any build up of error propagation effects. Aircraft descended from 12, 000 feet to 4, 000 feet, each trying to achieve ninety seconds spacing with respect to its predecessor. The spacing anticipation time for each trailing aircraft to react to the preceding aircraft’s time history was varied from 0 to 20 s. Without anticipation, a time <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> was observed to propagate at about 20 knots groundspeed in a forwards direction (towards runway) growing to about- 3. 5 s (trail aircraft too early and too close).
