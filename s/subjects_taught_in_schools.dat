40|$|Global {{citizenship}} {{plays an}} important role in today's schools. Many <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> have already incorporated such ideas. Science and physics have also followed suit. However, when dealing with astronomy - a topic so seemingly far removed from society - it becomes difficult to imagine any links with global citizenship. At Nottingham Trent University observatory we have developed an activity ideal to transport the idea of global citizenship and deal with common astronomical misconceptions. It incorporates role playing in the inspiring environment of an astronomical observatory. In this activity stellar constellations with their myths and history pose an ideal opportunity to explore global citizenship. Students not only place themselves in someone else’s situation, but also compare their different reactions when faced with a common situation. This idea is extended to analyse the change in constellation culture throughout time and the affect politics has had on constellations. In this article we outline the details of this activity and how it deals with common astronomical misconceptions. We also demonstrate its implementation into astronomy taught at schools. First results showing the impact the activity had on the students will also be given...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the effects the state and national Technology Education standards have had on the Technology Education curriculum in public schools in South-central Wisconsin, specifically those located in CESA 2, of which 49 schools have Technology Education programs. As all <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> become standards based in their curriculum, it is important that we look at how this changes the quality of that curriculum. It is the goal of standards to improve education and thus improve student learning and future success. By looking carefully at how standards are actually impacting the classroom one can begin to draw conclusions if teachers are modifying curriculum to meet the standards or manipulating the system to make it look as iftheir curriculum is standards based, but really hasn 't changed since before the standards push. This is especially evident in the area of Technology Education where both the state and national standards have called for curricular shift from moreIII traditional shop type classes to more analytical and engineering based classes. This shift is supported by respected national agencies such as the National Science Foundation an...|$|E
40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} involved in photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences will {{be aware of}} a general world-wide shortage of undergraduates embarking on degree programmes in geomatics. Whatever {{the reasons for this}} shortage, it is apparent that this is a major issue that needs addressing to safeguard the future of the profession. There is a requirement to educate school leavers such that they are aware of geomatics – know what it is, what it involves and the exciting opportunities a career in the subject offers them. This paper illustrates how the UK is tackling the problem through the geomatics. org. uk project. Geomatics crosses the disciplines of mathematics, geography, ICT, physics, and many other <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> across the UK. Established in 2001, geomatics. org. uk is supported by the UK geomatics sector and aims to raise the discipline’s profile in schools by providing useful and timely learning and teaching resources based on contemporary research. Resources available to teachers include lesson plans, instrumentation, software and data that are nominally out of reach of schools due to excessive cost and insufficient training. All resources are aimed at the UK National Curriculum and exam specifications and are provided free to teachers. The management and distribution of resources is operated via a website, whilst a portfolio of nationwide teacher training courses initiates teachers into geomatics theory and practice. The website is not a stand-alone source of information; instead it operates as a portal to the geomatics industry, serving to promote the profession through raising public awareness. 1...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cross-cultural}} {{studies that}} employ survey methodology {{in a small}} number of countries are likely to continue, either as a pilot or as an in-depth analysis of phenomena that may be limited to a few countries or world regions, much of the future empirical work and theorizing will be based on large-scale studies that involve many countries. This trend is being encouraged by the emerging political and economic regional alliances and globalization processes. From among the different applied sub-disciplines of psychology, two have been particularly responsive to these developments. Educational psychology has been focused on comparing countries on measures of achievement in areas such as mathematics, language, science, civics and other <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools.</b> These, along with various measures of abilities, belong to a class of cognitive processes. Industrial/Organizational psychology, on the other hand, has focussed on what can be broadly defined as the study of cross-cultural differences in values, including personality and social attitudes and norms in order to gain an improved understanding of processes that affect communication among people from different world regions. These can be labelled as noncognitive processes. This special issue provides a snapshot of some recent large-scale cross-cultural work on cognitive and non-cognitive constructs. As it turns out, however, of the five studies included in this selection three have crossed the boundaries and contain information on both sets of constructs. These three studies examine the link between non-cognitive and cognitive processes using individual and country-level data. In this introduction I shall summarize the main findings of each study. In the last part I shall comment on {{some of the issues that}} arise from this line of research...|$|E

40|$|Students {{have trouble}} finding meaning in decontextualized one-size-fits-all {{curriculum}} and instruction that does not relate to their cultures and homes. The best way to contextualize education is to relate what students are learning to their heritage, land and lives. While students need to learn {{the knowledge and skills}} codified in state standards, they also need to have some choice in what they read and what type of learning projects they can become engaged in. A 2006 report on the National Science Foundation’s Rural Systematic Initiative notes that “Place-based education strengthens communities ” and is “inherently interdisciplinary and project-based, it builds on local resources and expertise without great cost ” (Boyer, pp. 114 - 115). This idea of teaching students about their specific locality and its people and their cultures and languages is not new. Neither is the criticism of teaching that focuses on test preparation and memorization, which can lead to school dropouts who give “boredom ” as the leading cause of their leaving school. Back in 1928 the Meriam Report, an investigation of the U. S. Government’s Indian Office, noted that in some Indian schools children were forced to “maintain a pathetic degree of quietness ” (p. 332). In the 1933 edition of his How We Think John Dewey called on teachers to engage The best way to contextualize education is to relate what students are learning to their heritage, land and lives. their students in “constructive occupations” or “projects ” that engage students ’ interest, have intrinsic worth, awaken curiosity, and are carried out {{over an extended period of}} time (pp. 216 - 217). These projects should integrate as many of the basic <b>subjects</b> <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> as possible. More recently, University of Toronto researcher Jim Cummins (1992) identified culturally appropriate experiential and interactive teaching methods that build on students’ background knowledge and engage their interest. The active learning strategies that Cummins and others advocate would go far in getting students motivated to come to school, learn, and stay to graduate. The “project method ” was used successfully with Indian students in th...|$|E
