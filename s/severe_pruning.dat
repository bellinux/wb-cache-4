40|$|The genus Carya {{is largely}} {{composed}} of taxa endemic to eastern North America. This entire group of long-lived, durable, and aesthetically pleasing trees has been ignored by horticulturists because of {{issues related to}} their production as well as performance in the nursery and landscape. Hickories develop large, dominant taproots and supposedly produce few lateral roots, which are often associated with increased transplant success. Hickory seedlings are also considered to exhibit a lag phase in shoot growth, an additional disadvantage that hinders their production. The main objectives of the research presented in this document were to explore potential production methods that may alter the root morphology of hickories that offer characteristics advantageous for horticultural use, and to examine the physiological responses of hickories endemic to bottomland environments to root-zone water content. The first root pruning experiment was performed to study the morphological responses of seedlings of Carya aquatica, Carya cordiformis, Carya laciniosa, Carya ovata, and Carya tomentosa to root pruning and root pruning plus auxin shortly after germination. The {{results of the study}} suggest that not all hickory taxa develop similarly. Additionally, root pruning and root pruning plus auxin do not hinder shoot growth, may enhance fibrous-first order lateral root formation, and can also promote taproot branching. The second root-pruning experiment was designed to investigate the effects of severity and timing of root pruning of one-year-old Carya cordiformis on root and shoot development. We found that one-year-old Carya cordiformis are tolerant of moderate and <b>severe</b> root <b>pruning</b> when dormant, and that <b>severe</b> taproot <b>pruning</b> may decrease root and shoot growth if performed once buds begin to swell. The moisture-stress experiment was performed to determine the tolerance of Carya aquatica and Carya laciniosa to various root-zone soil moisture levels, which may infer the capacity of these taxa to perform in extreme soil conditions typical of urban landscapes. Photosynthesis, stem water potential, root and shoot biomass, as well as leaf surface area of plants of Carya aquatica and Carya laciniosa exposed to drought and flood conditions were measured. These two species responded similarly to both drought and flooding. We conclude that the hickories as a group should not be dismissed from horticultural application because each taxon develops differently. Root pruning offers a viable technique for the modification of root morphology. Furthermore, both Carya aquatica and Carya laciniosa should be considered as resilient landscape selections and rootstocks. Each of the species of Carya included in this thesis deserves further study to facilitate their production for horticultural application...|$|R

Moderate root pruning significantly increased the concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, and total sugars in the root exudates and decreased the pH of rhizosphere soil. This treatment also increased the contents of available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and total organic carbon as well as high-, medium-, and low-activity organic carbon in rhizosphere soil. Moreover, moderate pruning increased the contents of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and enhanced basal respiration, in addition to decreasing the metabolic quotients in rhizosphere soil by 8. 9 %, 5. 0 %, and 11. 4 % compared with control, light, and <b>severe</b> root <b>pruning</b> treatments, respectively. Moderate pruning increased the growth rates of DBH, tree height, and volume to the highest levels.

40|$|Conversion of {{farmland}} to forestry is occurring {{at the rate}} of approximately 60, 000 ha/annum, much of it on hill country sheep and beef properties. The potential productivity of ex farm sites is high, mainly due to improved soil fertility but may produce trees with defects such as excessive branching, large branches and stem malformations. Adapting silvicultural practices to suit plantations on high fertility sites is necessary to effectively utilise this potential. However, many of the tools available for planning and assessing alternative silvicultural options in Pinus radiata stands have limitations for farm sites. This study utilises a 12. 5 ha stand of Pinus radiata established in 1973 on a Manawatu hill country sheep and beef property. Currently 'Tuapaka' has 31. 3 ha of Pinus radiata occupying land use capability class VI and VII. Of this total, 12. 5 ha is nearing maturity, while remaining areas are now reaching a stage where decisions on silvicultural management are necessary. The growth modelling system, STANDPAK, was used as an aid for developing and evaluating silvicultural options on Tuapaka. Existing Pinus radiata growth models have been primarily derived from traditional forest site data. They can be utilised for simulating growth on ex farm sites but will generally provide more accurate predictions of growth and yield if they are configured with local growth data. The EARLY and NAPIRAD growth models are recommended for simulating the growth of Pinus radiata on farm sites and formed the basis for the simulation of the Tuapaka stand. Inventory data, including diameter at breast height, mean crop height, and stocking were collected from the existing 12. 5 ha stand and used to configure these growth models and other STANDPAK components. Site index at Tuapaka was found to be 23 m, with a high basal area increment potential. The best STANDPAK configuration combined the growth models EARLY (high + 20 % basal area increment) and NAPIRAD (switched at mean top height 18 m). The results from this configuration predicted basal area to within 6 % of the field estimate. These configurations were used to simulate and evaluate the growth of a new stand (at the 1 ha level) for both clearwood and framing regimes. The combined influence of low site index and high basal area increment created problems associated with maintaining a target diameter over stubs (DOS) while utilising an acceptable number of pruning lifts. The required number of pruning lifts to achieve a 6. 0 m pruned height was able to be manipulated by delaying thinning, reducing the green crown length (CRL) at the first and second lifts, and maintaining a high ratio of unpruned trees through to thinning. Net present value (NPV) was primarily used as the selection criteria to determine the best regimes, because it reflects the final harvest revenues and associated silvicultural costs. The most profitable regime required a 3 lift pruning schedule. This regime provided the best compromise between final harvest value and silvicultural costs and was achieved by <b>severe</b> early <b>pruning</b> (CRL of 2. 0 m and 2. 2 m), delayed thinning, and maintaining a high ratio of unpruned to pruned trees. Clearwood regimes were more profitable than the framing regimes because of a higher average timber value which more than compensated for increased silvicultural costs and reduced log volume. The clearwood regime produced a final merchantable volume of 698 m 3 /ha, of which 37 % graded in the higher value pruned log class. This regime had a pre tax net revenue of $ 39, 500 /ha and an NPV of $ 2, 681 /ha (8 % discount rate). In contrast, the best framing regime produced a merchantable volume of 787 m 3 /ha, a net revenue of $ 18, 800 /ha, and a NPV of $ 1, 100 /ha. The best clearwood and framing regime were subjected to economic analysis at the estate level (31. 3 ha) to determine the best silvicultural options for existing and future stands on Tuapaka. The clearwood regime was the most profitable, having a pre tax IRR of 9. 1 %, compared with 7. 6 % for the framing regime. These returns are likely to exceed the potential returns from farming, particularly on steep hill country...|$|R
40|$|Syrah is an {{important}} wine grape in California but is potentially difficult to manage in the vineyard due to its excessive vigor. Vigorous grapevines require more labor for canopy management and tend to create excess shade, decreasing fruit quality. Winter pruning level, shoot thinning and leaf removal influence the overall density of the canopy and the subsequent degree of shade in the fruit zone. An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of two pruning levels with three degrees of labor-intensive canopy management techniques on berry maturation rate and harvest berry parameters for two growing seasons. In 2008, repeated measures analysis showed no significant effects of <b>severe</b> <b>pruning,</b> shoot thinning or both sides leaf removal on maturation rate of performance indicators. At harvest 2008, <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> caused a decrease in yield/meter trellis and Ravaz index.

Soil tillage, or cover cropping, was combined with either light pruning or <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> to study foliar nutrient variations. Soil N, P, K and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined in samples taken from the Ap 1 horizon in January prior to vine pruning.

These include Neoscytalidium novaehollandiae, Ne. dimidiatum, Pseudofusicoccum adansoniae, P. ardesiacum, P. kimberleyense, Lasiodiplodia sp. 1, L. iraniensis and L. pseudotheobromae. The pathogenicity of a selection of these species toward fruit and branches was tested. All were pathogenic to mango {{in comparison to the}} control, with Lasiodiplodia spp. being the most pathogenic. It appears that either geographic isolation or the unique growing conditions in the Kimberley may have provided an effective barrier to the acquisition or establishment of known botryosphaeriaceous pathogens. Wounds caused by mechanical pruning may provide an entry point for infection, whilst <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> may increase plant stress...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{properties}} of fruit bearing shoots: length, number of flower buds and vegetative buds and their ratio were studied in 11 cultivars of European plum and 11 cultivars of Japanese plum during a two-year period. Fruit bearing shoots {{were divided into}} two groups: long (shoots) and short (spurs). For all studied traits, statistically significant differences between plum cultivars were found. Japanese plums had lesser thickness and shorter internodes of shoots in relation to European plums. They also had a significantly higher number of flower buds both on shoots and spurs. Based on obtained results, recommendations for pruning can be made. Cultivars with a higher number of flower buds per 1 -m length and in relation to vegetative buds, like most varieties of Japanese plum and some varieties of European plum ("Stanley", "Topper", "Top", "Topking"), require <b>severe</b> <b>pruning.</b> On the other hand, cultivars with lower density of flower buds, such as "Čačanska rana" and "Golden Plum", can be pruned slightly...|$|E
40|$|The scab {{resistant}} apple variety ‘GoldRush’ can {{be grown}} in regions, where vineyards are common. At the LVWO Weinsberg ‘GoldRush’ is ripening about October 20 th. In organic fruit growing this variety must be thinned strongly, because it tends to alternate bearing. The intention of the small experiment in the organi-cally grown orchard Katzental was to reduce by special pruning measurements the time for thinning by hand and to improve the fruit quality. During the years 2001 to 2005 clear effects could {{be seen on the}} size of the apples. The time for hand thinning varied from year tot year depending from the setting of blossom clusters, but there was no success in reducing thinning time by pruning alone. There was a positive influence on the quantity of picked apples per hour. The trees grew more balanced, the number and the length of the one-year-old twigs/branch were higher in 2005. There was a middling effect of the <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> on the alter-nate bearing. Well-considered pruning is an important component within organic cultivation to produce ap-ple of high quality...|$|E
40|$|Pruning {{is crucial}} to balance {{productivity}} and fruit quality in blueberry orchards. Slight, conventional and <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> treatments were applied on 4 - and 5 -year old bluberry plants cultivar ‘Brigitta ’ to evaluate their effect on yield, leaf area, gas exchange and fruit load as driver of fruit quality traits. Yield and berries per plant decreased with increasing pruning severity, whereas canopy leaf area increased. The resulting fruit load ranged from 0. 2 to 1. 4 fruit per cm 2 leaf area. Fruit weight, dry matter, glucose and fructose were negatively related to fruit load, with fruit fresh weight decreasing to greater extent than sugars. Berry weight was restricted by source limitation during the initial cell division and initial cell enlargement fruit growth phases as indicated by decreased relative growth rate. Light-saturated photosynthetic rate diminished with increasing pruning severity indicating a sink limitation of photosynthesis. The strong association between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance shows a high corregulation in the response of carbon and water exchange to sink demand. Our results underline agronomic and physiological factors determining blueberry yield and fruit quality and can be useful for agro-technical management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract|Neural network pruning methods on {{the level}} of {{individual}} network parameters (e. g. connection weights) can improve generalization, as is shown in this empirical study. However, an open problem in the pruning methods known today (OBD, OBS, autoprune, epsiprune) is the selection of the number of parameters to be removed in each pruning step (pruning strength). This work presents a pruning method lprune that automatically adapts the pruning strength to the evolution of weights and loss of generalization during training. The method requires no algorithm parameter adjustmentby the user. Results of statistical signi cance tests comparing autoprune, lprune, and static networks with early stopping are given, based on extensive experimentation with 14 di erent problems. The results indicate that training with pruning is often signi cantly better and rarely signi cantly worse than training with early stopping without pruning. Furthermore, lprune is often superior to autoprune (which is superior to OBD) on diagnosis tasks unless <b>severe</b> <b>pruning</b> early in the training process is required. 1 Pruning and Generalization The principal idea of pruning is {{to reduce the number of}} free parameters in the network by removin...|$|E
40|$|The extreme {{efficiency}} of sequential search, {{and the natural}} tendency of tree pruning systems to produce wide variations in workload, partly explains why it is proving difficult to achieve more than 30 - 50 % efficiency for massively parallel implementations of the; algorithm. Here we introduce typical enhanced sequential algorithms and address the major issues of parallel game-tree searching under conditions of <b>severe</b> <b>pruning.</b> It is this pruning that makes the parallelization difficult. After examining previous work on parallel; algorithms, we present a new method called Dynamic Multiple Principal Variation Splitting (DM-PVSplit) and implement it on the AP 1000. In this algorithm, high performance is achieved by using some novel approaches: Parallel speculative search of candidate principal variations is used to reduce re-search delay and so obtain more quickly a better estimate of the subtree value. This is achieved by configuring a at processor arrangement as a dynamically changeable tree structure. Also, {{with the aid of}} a group-based scheduling strategy, the game tree is split dynamically at different levels. This provides better load balance and takes more advantage of parallelism. Preliminary experiments show that the scalability of the DM-PVSplit algorithm is good for massively parallel machines...|$|E
