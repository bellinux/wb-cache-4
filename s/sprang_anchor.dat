In order to solve this problem, we present a rule-based recognition algorithm which identifies the architecture and the topology elements of a MEMS sensor.

The proposed accelerometer {{consists of a}} proof-mass suspended by four <b>springs</b> <b>anchored</b> to bulk silicon, and in- tegrating on opposite sides one-dimensional photonic crystal (1 D-PhC) micromirrors, with additional on-chip U- grooves featuring end-point stoppers for readout optical fibers positioning.

40|$|Linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} an elastically anchored wing {{in a uniform}} flow is investigated both analytically and numerically. The analytical formulation explicitly {{takes into account the}} effect of the wake on the wing by means of Theodorsen's theory. Three different parameters non-trivially rule the observed dynamics: mass density ratio between wing and fluid, spring elastic constant and distance between the wing center of mass and the <b>spring</b> <b>anchor</b> point on the wing. We found relationships between these parameters which rule the transition between stable equilibrium and fluttering. The shape of the resulting marginal curve has been successfully verified by high Reynolds number direct numerical simulations. Our findings are of interest in applications related to energy harvesting by fluid-structure interaction, a problem which has recently attracted a great deal of attention.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{alleviate}} severe energy problems increasingly, large hydropower energy development project are constructed in our country. For underground engineering in these project, {{the existence of}} jointed rock mass will endanger the safety of project. Present numerical simulation of anchored discontinuous jointed rock-mass can not pertinently reflect the actual anchorage effects. This paper establishes complex calculation model {{in line with the}} actual condition: an entity element is used to simulate an anchor and a contact element is applied between the bolt and the rock-mass. The stress intensity factor at the wing crack tip is used as the basis for evaluating the stability and the calculated results are compared with the results produced by the virtual spring model (the calculation model which enables the anchor to be equivalent with the virtual spring). The crack-propagation prevention capacity of the entity element with bending degree of freedom is obviously better than that of the virtual <b>spring</b> <b>anchor</b> which only has tension and compression degree of freedom. The calculated results reveal the disadvantage of virtual spring model which is widely applied in engineering and more practical and effective method is brought forward. The conclusion can be offer reference to design and construction of similar engineering...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten animals were used as the control group and were not submitted to orthodontic force; the other animals were divided into groups {{according to the study}} period of tooth movement, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days. The investigation of pulp and periodontal changes included hyalinization, fibrosis, reactive dentin and vascular congestion. Statistical evaluation was performed between control and experimental groups and between periods of observation using non-parametric chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference concerning pulpal changes between control and experimental groups nor between periods of observation. The control group, at 3 and 5 days, revealed greater hyalinization of the periodontal ligament (p< 0. 05), whereas root resorption was significantly greater at 5 and 7 days (p< 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{analytical}} {{approach to the}} problem of energy pumping in strongly non- homogeneous nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) systems with single <b>anchor</b> <b>spring</b> under condition of initial impact. Energy pumping is a passive, almost irreversible transfer of mechanical energy from the main substructure of the system to the light auxiliary attachment. The mechanism of energy pumping in the system under consideration is a resonance capture. The approach is based on application of Laplace transformation to the principal asymptotic approximation of the equations of motion in complex form and using the power expansion of the solution in terms of time. Obtained temporal dependence of the system energetic characteristics gives a tool for estimation of energy pumping efficiency. In particular, we show that the system without an <b>anchor</b> <b>spring</b> in attachment is more efficient than the system with such a spring.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand of a highly sensitive and reliable pressure micro-sensor system, for implantable and non-implantable medical applications. The prerequisite of a miniaturized device for minimally invasive procedures, posed greater challenges in the complex integrated design of micro-system. Micro-sensor system designs in the recent advanced CMOS technologies are explored in this work for effective system miniaturization and improved performance. The material choices and geometry designs, which significantly influence the sensitivity and dynamic range of the micro-scale sensor devices, are well addressed. Cointegrations of MEMS devices with signal conditioning circuits that effectively reduce the parasitic effect are also performed for enhancing the overall system performance. In addition, system reliability is also improved with on-chip metal interconnections. The employed process technologies {{to a greater extent}} contributed to the high yield for these low cost micro-sensor systems. This research focuses on the design of integrated CMOS MEMS capacitive pressure sensors for diverse bio-medical applications. Two monolithically integrated capacitive pressure microsensor systems are designed, fabricated and experimentally verified. A novel micro-electromechanical capacitive pressure sensor in SiGeMEMS process, vertically integrated on top of a 0. 18 μm TSMC CMOS processed die is proposed. The perforated elliptic diaphragm, which is edge clamped at the semi-major axis is developed using poly-SiGe material. High performance on-chip CMOS conditioning circuits are also designed to achieve better overall sensitivity. Experimental results indicate a high sensitivity of around 0. 12 mV/hPa along with a nonlinearity of around 1 % for the full scale range of applied pressure load. The L-clamp <b>spring</b> <b>anchored</b> diaphragm provided a wide dynamic range of around 900 hPa. Another integrated capacitive pressure micro-system, developed using the advanced standard IBM CMOS process in two geometrical designs is also proposed. A step-sided elliptic diaphragm that overcomes the CMOS process limitations is fabricated to achieve regulated membrane deflections and improved sensitivity. A foundry compatible post-process technique, for a lateral release length of 125 μm is also performed successfully on the 130 nm CMOS platform. A current cross mirroring technique is utilized to enhance the transconductance of an on-chip operational amplifier to achieve a high single stage gain. Sensitivities of the fluorosilicate sealed absolute pressure sensors were measured to be 0. 07 mV/Pa and 0. 05 mV/Pa for the elliptic and rectangular element, respectively. In addition, the linear capacitive transduction dynamic range was found to be 0. 32 pF and 0. 23 pF, respectively, for the elliptic and rectangular element...|$|R
