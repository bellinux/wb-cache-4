40|$|Purpose: The steel solidifying process during {{continuous}} casting {{starts in the}} mould, where between 15 and 30 % of total heat is abstracted. The strand withdrawn from the mould should have a solidified shell to ensure a failure free operation of the continuous caster. For a steel {{continuous casting}} process, {{it is necessary to}} obtain the correct shell thickness of the strand forming in the mould. If the shell thickness is insufficient, it will break out and the liquid core will leak, causing pouring of one or more segments of the machine. The presented paper shows the results of calculations of the shell thickness of the strand withdrawn, made with various mathematical models and the ProCAST software. Design/methodology/approach: Three mathematical models with various degree of complexity with a complex numerical model were compared. Similar values of the <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> thickness were have been received, and small differences result from the degree of complexity of the applied calculation models. Findings: Similar findings related to the shell thickness were obtained. However, the use of more complex models is more likely to give correct and more accurate results. Practical implications: For a failure-free steel continuous casting process, it is necessary to obtain the correct shell thickness of the strand forming in the continuous caster mould. Originality/value: The presented paper compares the values of <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> thickness obtained on the basis of mathematical models with various degree of complexity with a complex numerical model of the continuous casting process. Similar findings were obtained...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the basic indicators of heat transfer in the continuous casting of steel, which can be described as an unsteady process with complicated boundary conditions for the solution. An analytical solution of this problem is practically impossible and, therefore, mathematical modelling is applied with a certain simplification of the real conditions and with a description of those criteria that influence the most the process of solidification and cooling. Using a simulation program and the knowledge of input parameters, it was possible to predict the distribution of the thermal field of a continuously cast blank in the course of its casting. Simulations also allowed us to deal with the issues of the inner structure, surface quality, mechanical properties of a continuously cast blank, metallurgical length, change in the thickness of a <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> and overheating of steel. Some results obtained with numerical simulations are documented for concrete examples. Web of Science 47681881...|$|E

The factory, the biggest munitions factory ever built, stretched for 9 mi from Eastriggs along the Solway coast as far as Longtown in England and 2 mi across. The factory took 10,000 navvies to build it, and employed 30,000 workers, mostly women.

40|$|Avoiding {{particle}} entrapment {{into the}} solidifying {{shell of a}} steel continuous caster is important {{to improve the quality}} of the continuous cast product. Therefore, the fluid flow dynamics in the steel melt and mushy zone, heat transfer and solidification of the steel shell, as well as the motion and entrapment of inclusion particles during the casting process were investigated using computational models. Solidification of the <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> is modelled with an enthalpy-formulation by assuming a columnar morphology in the mushy zone. The motion of particles is tracked with a Lagrangian approach. When the particles reach the solidification front they can be entrapped/engulfed into the solid shell or pushed away from the solidification front, depending on the mushy zone morphology and the forces acting on them. The current paper focuses on the mould region at a steel continuous caster, including the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) and 1. 2 m length of the strand. The results are validated with plant measurements and demonstrate the potential of the model to predict fluid flow, shell growth and the posi-tions and the amount of entrapped/engulfed particles in the solidifying strand...|$|E
40|$|Moving mould for {{the future}} … Due to {{mechanical}} reasons, conventional lubricated oscillating moulds limit the casting velocity. If the friction in the mould grows too strongly, the thin <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> can tear, in a worst case followed by a breakout. However these constraints are not applicable to moving moulds. RTSC (Rapid Thick Strip Casting) is an innovative concept {{for the production of}} hot strip. The particular innovation of the mechanism consists in replacing the stationary oscillating mould with a mould performing a caterpillar motion. A new mould design is able to eliminate former failures and problems. The key factor in the new design consists of a parallelogram-shaped strand cross section. Straight below the caterpillar-mould, a shaping machine is placed with a secondary cooling zone. This is where the conventional rectangular shape is formed by inline-shaping with liquid core. RTSC is a new technology offering the option of high productivity. Studies indicate that a casting speed in a range of 20 to 30 m/min at a final as-cast cross section of e. g. 20 mm x 1600 mm is possible. The strand width is easily adjustable and the final product only requires low metal forming degrees in comparison to conventional slabs...|$|E
40|$|Today {{continuous}} casting {{is the state}} of the art in industrial casting processes. The casting powder used fulfill various tasks such as preventing air contact, absorbing non-metallic inclusions from liquid steel, providing lubrication between <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> and mould wall and controlling heat transfer. The mould powder in contact with liquid steel surface forms a liquid slag layer. The jet of liquid steel from submerged entry nozzle is reflected at the mould wall forming a lower and upper flow pattern. The upper flow moves along the steel-slag interface and generates shear stress at the interface and waves. Viscosity-and density-differences between the two liquid phases leads under certain flow conditions to finger like protrusions. Reaching a critical flow velocity the protrusions can breakup and form slag droplets following the flow into the liquid steel-pool. These droplets can form finally non-metallic inclusions in steel material, cause defects in the final product and therefore should be avoided. Till now the physical mechanisms of slag entrainment are not completely understood. The interaction at the liquid-liquid interface was investigated using cold model study using a single-roller driven flow in oil-water systems with various silicon oil properties. The critical values of the dimension free capillary number Ca for droplet breakup marking the start of their entrainment in the lower fluid are determined over a wide-range of fluid properties defined as the product of viscosity ratio (dispersed liquid/continuous liquid) and density ratio (continuous liquid/dispersed liquid) Λ. With the knowledge of thermo-physical properties of steel-slag systems the critical capillary number Ca * for slag entrainment as a function of Λ could be derived. Assuming stable conditions at the interface and no reaction between the phases no sla...|$|E

40|$|Peritectic carbon steels, {{produced}} by conventional continuous casting, show slab surface defects {{as a consequence}} of the shrinkage caused by the delta-gamma transformation. Unsteady heat flux conditions between <b>strand</b> <b>shell</b> and mould plate leads to an irregular solidification. By following the hypothesis, that the cooling rate has an effect to the peritectic reaction, twin roll strip cast trials were done at a pilot strip caster at RWTH Aachen University. Local cooling rates of - 1000 K/s in combination with an eightfold higher heat flux compared to continuous casting are typical for strip casting process. The indication for effects from the strip casting process to the peritectic reaction was on the one hand the steady heat flux and on the other hand the strip surface quality. Trials were performed in 3 campaigns with the chemical analyses of peritectic carbon steels known from continuous casting. The campaigns just distinguish between the casting roll surfaces structure and the range of carbon content. All other process parameters were constant. The casting roll surface was developed from a fine, hexagonal open structure to a coarse hexagonal structure. The structure is regular and was {{produced by}} knurling. The carbon range was 0. 06 to 0. 17 wt %. The result of the 1 st campaign was that nearly all strips were attack by many cracks. The number of cracks rises to higher carbon content up to 0. 17 wt %. The maximum of defects around 0. 1 wt % of carbon, known from continuous casting, was not found. By proofing the strip surfaces, it was found out that the steel melt didn’t wet the roll surface intensive. An unsteady solidification process was the result. The results of the 2 nd campaign were different. Just very few cracks were remaining at the strip surfaces. No dependence between carbon content and number of crack were found. Once again the critical range around 0. 1 wt % carbon wasn’t noticeable by strips produced with the twin roll casting process. The important different in comparison to the first campaign was an excellent wetting behaviour between steel melt and roll surface. An imprint of the roll surface structure was found at all strip surfaces. A homogenous heat flux and solidification condition exists. The results of the 3 rd series, performed with a further regular roll surface structure, confirm the above explained facts. The geometric shape and adjustment were again diversifying to coarser values. The work could demonstrate that the twin roll process is suitable for the production of peritectic carbon steel grades. The key factor for solidification and heat flux is the wetting condition at the roll surface. Steel specific roll surface structures are required...|$|E
