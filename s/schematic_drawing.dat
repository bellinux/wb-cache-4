The iLoo was widely derided and press coverage subjected MSN and Microsoft to heavy criticism. On May 10, The Inquirer published {{a story in}} which Andrew Cubitt alleged that [...] "Microsoft stole his iLoo idea" [...] from his i-Loo invention. On May 12, Microsoft announced that the iLoo was a [...] "hoax perpetrated by its British division" [...] calling it an [...] "April Fool's joke" [...] and issued an apology for the confusion. The Associated Press, however, stated that they had previously received confirmation of the project from two of Microsoft's PR firms: Waggener Edstrom Worldwide and Red Consultancy. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer also stated that it received confirmation from Waggener Edstrom and was even provided with a <b>schematic</b> <b>drawing.</b> Furthermore, April Fools was almost a month before, and Microsoft had never before released a fake press release.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{structure}} unit of YB66, {{shown in}} figure 4b, is B80 cluster of 80 boron sites formed by the B10 to B13 sites. All those 80 sites are partially occupied and in total contain only about 42 boron atoms. The B80 cluster {{is located at the}} body center of the octant of the unit cell, i.e., at the 8a position (1/4, 1/4, 1/4); thus, there are eight such clusters (336 boron atoms) per unit cell. Two independent structure analyses [...] came to the same conclusion that the total number of boron atoms in the unit cell is 1584. The boron framework structure of YB66 is {{shown in figure}} 5a. To indicate relative orientations of the supericosahedra, a <b>schematic</b> <b>drawing</b> is shown in figure 5b, where the supericosahedra and the B80 clusters are depicted by light green and dark green spheres, respectively; at the top surface of the unit cell, the relative orientations of the supericosahedra are indicated by arrows. There are 48 yttrium sites ((0.0563, 1/4, 1/4) for YB62) in the unit cell. Richards and Kasper fixed the Y site occupancy to 0.5 that resulted in 24 Y atoms in the unit cell and the chemical composition of YB66. As shown in figure 6, Y sites form a pair separated by only 0.264nm in YB62. This pair is aligned normal to the plane formed by four supericosahedra. The Y site occupancy 0.5 implies that the pair has always one Y atom with one empty site.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} numerical simulation and experiment of nanoindentation testing. A commercial finite element code ANSYS is adopted in the numerical simulation, in which elastic-plastic properties are considered. A PMMA specimen and a three side pyramidal Berkovich probe tip {{is used in the}} indentation tests. While the elastic-linear work-hardening properties are adopted, the numerical results agree well with the experimental data for different indentation loads. It proves the numerical simulation can be used in the small scale analysis. Nanoindentation Test In experiments, a nanoindenter (Triboscope, Hysitron) assembled on an atomic force microscope (Autoprobe, CP-Research) is adopted, where the specimen is PMMA and a three side pyramidal Berkovich probe tip is used in the test. The nanoindentation testing is successfully proved to evaluate the hardness and the elastic modulus of materials. Nanoindentation is performed under a precisely continuous measurement of the force (load) and the displacement (depth) during the test.

40|$|The medical {{image data}} {{management}} system, BrainSUITE NET, a system enabling control of patient data and video signals in an operating room, shall {{be expanded to}} incorporate audio functionalities. This thesis establishes a basis for this implementa-tion. Within a market research, audio functionalities offered by market players are investi-gated. Being a functionality currently attracting attention, voice control is closer ana-lyzed. The desires and requirements of the surgeons are ascertained within a demand analysis, primarily by performing an international survey among 65 surgeons with the results presented and discussed. According to {{the outcome of this}} survey, audio func-tionalities that shall be implemented in a conceptual design are determined. During the design process of the concept, a risk analysis is performed detecting poten-tial hazards for the patient and user and defining measures avoiding or diminishing those hazards. The operating room’s acoustical characteristics are considered. The reverberation time and the critical distance are calculated, the effect of background noise on speech intelligibility is described and consequences for the system are drawn. Eligible microphone positions, directivities, and construction types are compared in consideration of the acoustical characteristics and the system conditions.

40|$|The {{judgement}} {{of healthy}} subject rating the emotional expressions {{of a set}} of <b>schematic</b> <b>drawn</b> faces is validated (study 1) {{to examine the relationship between}} mood (depressed/elated) and judgement of emotional expressions of these faces (study 2). Study 1 : 30 healthy subjects judged 12 faces with respect to the emotions they express (fear, happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, rejection and invitation). It was found that a particular face could reflect various emotions. All eigth emotions were reflected in the set of faces and the emotions were consensually judged. Moreover, gender differences in judgement could be established. Study 2 : In a cross-over design, 24 healthy subjects judged the faces after listening to depressing or elating music. The faces were subdivided in six ‘ambiguous’ faces (i. e., expressing similar amounts of positive and negative emotions) and six ‘clear’ faces (i. e., faces showing a preponderance of positive or negative emotions). In addition, these two types of faces were distinguished with respect to the intensity of emotions they express. 11 subjects who showed substantial differences in experienced depression after listening to the music were selected for further analysis. It was found that, when feeling more depressed, the subjects perceived more rejection/sadness in ambiguous faces (displaying less intensive emotions) and less invitation/happiness in clear faces. In addition, subjects saw more fear in clear faces that express less intensive emotions. Hence, results show a depression-related negative bias in the perception of facial displays. ...|$|R
40|$|The Detector Data Link (DDL) is the {{high-speed}} optical link for the ALICE experiment. This link shall transfer the data {{coming from the}} detectors at 100 MB/s rate. The main components of the link have been developed: the destination Interface Unit (DIU), the Source Interface Unit (SIU) and the Read-out Receiver Card (RORC). The first RORC version {{is based on the}} VME bus. The performance tests show that the maximum VME bandwidth could be reached. Meanwhile the PCI bus became very popular and is used in many platforms. The development of a PCI-based version has been started. The document describes the prototype version in three sections. An overview explains the main purpose of the card: to provide an interface between the DDL and the PCI bus. Acting as a 32 bit/ 33 MHz PCI master the card is able to write or read directly to or from the system memory from or to the DDL, respectively. Beside these functions the card can also be used as an autonomous data generator. The card has been designed to be well adapted to applications, which require small software overhead such {{the high-speed}} data acquisition systems. The implementation of the firmware will be presented. For the logic design we are using VHDL and <b>schematic</b> <b>draw.</b> Software library routines were written in C and are available on Linux OS.

Yet if boundaries are represented as sites of interface, gothic threats become opportunities for growth and generation. Individual texts, even realist ones, have always sutured together intertextual ingredients.
