5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD {{have higher levels of}} stress. <b>Siblings</b> {{of children}} with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than <b>siblings</b> of unaffected children and were similar to <b>siblings</b> {{of children with}} Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than <b>siblings</b> of children with Down syndrome; <b>siblings</b> of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|Preference {{is given}} to <b>siblings</b> of current or former Benet students. In 1993 the average {{admitted}} eighth grader scored in the 87thpercentile on the placement test. Applicants without <b>siblings</b> at the school were admitted only with scores above the 75thpercentile; applicants with <b>siblings</b> at Benet were admitted with scores as low as the 50th percentile on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
5|$|After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult {{measurements}} and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its <b>siblings</b> {{to leave the}} natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its <b>siblings</b> leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. In a study by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.|$|E

5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older <b>siblings</b> may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and <b>siblings</b> may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. <b>Siblings</b> are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older <b>siblings.</b> There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and <b>siblings,</b> as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

40|$|The small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked {{glycoprotein}} (<b>SIBLING)</b> {{family is}} closely related to osteogenesis. Until recently, little was known about their existence in articular cartilage. In this study, we systematically evaluated the presence and distribution of four <b>SIBLING</b> family members in rat femoral head cartilage: dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP 1), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). First, non-collagenous proteins were extracted and then separated by ion-exchange chromatography. Next, the protein extracts eluted by chromatography were analyzed by Stains-all staining and Western immunoblotting. IHC was used to assess the distribution of these four <b>SIBLING</b> family members in the femoral head cartilage. Both approaches showed that all the four <b>SIBLING</b> family members are expressed in the femoral head cartilage. IHC showed that <b>SIBLING</b> members are distributed in various locations throughout the articular cartilage. The NH 2 -terminal fragments of DMP 1, BSP, and OPN are present in the cells and in the extracellular matrix, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment of DMP 1 and the NH 2 -terminal fragment of DSPP are primarily intracellularly localized in the chondrocytes. The presence of the <b>SIBLING</b> family members in the rat femoral head cartilage suggests that they may play important roles in chondrogenesis. (J Histochem Cytochem 58 : 1033 – 1043, 2010...|$|R

5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three <b>siblings.</b> The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted <b>siblings,</b> who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E

40|$|Matrix {{proteins}} play {{important roles}} in tissue morphogenesis. We have studied the expression of genes encoding the related <b>SIBLING</b> glycoproteins osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein (DMP) during the development {{of male and female}} gonads during mouse embryogenesis. Opn mRNA was expressed specifically by Sertoli cells of the developing testis cords, in the mesonephric tubules of both sexes, and, transiently, in the Mullerian ducts of both sexes, as determined by whole-mount and section in situ hybridization. OPN protein was detected in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells and luminal cells of the mesonephric tubules, with small amounts associated with the plasma membrane of germ cells. We found no defects in developing testes of Opn-/- mice using a range of cell type-specific markers, suggesting that other <b>SIBLING</b> proteins may function in testis development. Dmp and Bsp mRNA was also expressed in the developing testis cords, supporting the view that all three <b>SIBLING</b> proteins may contribute to testis differentiation.
