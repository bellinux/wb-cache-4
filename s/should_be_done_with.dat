5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested {{that it should be}} kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E

Patients can also attempt to avoid products and medications with anticholinergic properties that may exacerbate urinary retention symptoms of BPH, including antihistamines, decongestants, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants; however, changes in medications <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> input from a medical professional.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decades}} that {{followed}} the abandonment of Altenhus as a fortress, it was at times debated what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the structure. In 1690, the population of Talvik requested {{the use of the}} timber of the blockhouse at Altenhus {{for the construction of a}} church, so the local people would no longer have to travel to Hasvåg for church services. Permission was granted, and in 1692-1694, the timber of the fortress was employed in the building of a church on Årøya.|$|E

25|$|Following {{widespread}} {{confusion and}} opposition, {{the second round}} of simplification was officially rescinded on 24 June 1986 by the State Council. Since then, the PRC has used the first-round simplified characters as its official script. Rather than ruling out further simplification, however, the retraction declared that further reform of the Chinese characters <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> caution. Today, some second-round simplified characters, while considered nonstandard, continue to survive in informal usage. The issue of whether and how simplification should proceed remains a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|Governor de la Torre {{consulted}} with the prosecutor Francisco Marcos Santaella {{as to what}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Barbudo. Santaella suggested that she be exiled from Puerto Rico and sent to Cuba. On October 23, 1824, de la Torre ordered that Barbudo be held under house arrest at the Castillo de San Cristóbal under the custody of Captain Pedro de Loyzaga. The following day Barbudo wrote to the governor, asking {{to be able to}} arrange her financial and her personal obligations before being exiled to Cuba. The Governor denied her request and on October 28 she was placed aboard the ship El Marinero.|$|E
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a torque wrench.|$|E

Steinberg, a Professor of Political Science at Bar Ilan University, argued that Human Rights Watch's response to the matter was [...] "too little, too late".

40|$|A recent {{national}} survey of clinical social workers confirmed that referring clients for psychiatric medication {{is one of the}} two most frequently performed social work roles in clinical practice related to medication management.

25|$|Exercises {{that are}} used to enhance back {{strength}} may also be used to prevent back injuries. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, transverse abdominus bracing, and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, it can mean that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight and to not work oneself past fatigue. Signs of fatigue include shaking, poor coordination, muscle burning and loss of the transverse abdominal brace. Heavy lifting <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the legs performing the work, and not the back.|$|E
25|$|Lana {{meets with}} Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), {{who seems to}} know that Lana is pregnant. Lana tries to deny that Dr. Thredson raped her and Mary Eunice gives her a {{document}} confirming her pregnancy. Lana and Kit discuss what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the hostage Thredson – she wants him dead; Kit needs him alive to prove Kit's innocence in the killings. They agree {{to get him to}} talk. She shows Thredson the pregnancy document and convinces him to confess. He relates the three killings to her and a hidden Kit plays back the recorded confession. Lana tells Thredson she has aborted the fetus with a coat hanger and Kit hides the tape in the hydrotherapy room. She later returns to kill Thredson with the coat hanger but he has been released and is missing. Mary Eunice stops her and sees the coat hanger, with which Lana admits to aborting the fetus. Mary Eunice assures her that the fetus still lives in Lana's womb.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{completely}} cleansing Spain of the Moriscos {{was proposed}} by Juan de Ribera, the Archbishop and Viceroy of Valencia, whose views were influential with Philip III. Philip's eventual decree to eliminate this 'evil sect' in 1609 {{was a popular}} move – the Moriscos were accused of collaborating with the Barbary Pirates to attack the coast, whilst their religion and distinct culture made them unpopular with Christians in Spain, especially in Valencia. Financially, the royal treasury stood to gain by seizing {{the assets of the}} removed peoples, whilst in due course those close to the crown would benefit from cheap land or gifts of estates. Other writers have emphasised the continuing 'anxiety and fear' that surrounded the Morisco presence in Spain, and the role this played in encouraging the expulsion. Estimates vary slightly, but between around 275,000 to over 300,000 Moriscos were forced out of Spain between 1609 and 1614. To accomplish this, the armada, or navy, and 30,000 soldiers were mobilized with the mission of transporting the families to Tunis or Morocco. Philip intervened in the problematic decision {{of what to do with}} Morisco children – should they be allowed to take them to Islamic countries, where they would be brought up as Muslims – and if they were to remain in Spain, what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> them? Philip paternalistically decreed that Morisco children under the age of seven could not be taken to Islamic countries, but that any children remaining in Valencia should be free from the threat of enslavement, and rejected some of Ribera's more extreme suggestions.|$|E

500|$|Wellek and Warren {{describe}} three {{views of}} a biographical approach, of which only one– the biographical aspects relating {{to the production of}} a work– can be of use; this use, however, is limited. They reject the views that works accurately reflect the author's life or that the author's life must be understood in order to understand a particular work. According to Wellek and Warren, works may indeed reflect the author's experiences, but they may also reflect an author's hopes and dreams, or literary tradition and convention, and as such are [...] "not a document for biography". Likewise, an understanding of personal style (what makes a work [...] "Miltonic", [...] "Keatsian", [...] "Shakespearean", or [...] "Virgilian") does not rely on knowledge of the author's life. They conclude that [...] "it seems dangerous to ascribe to [...] any real critical importance", and that such approaches, if undertaken at all, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "sense" [...] of the distinctions outlined above.|$|E
