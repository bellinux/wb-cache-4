5|$|Between {{the newly}} conquered Mongol {{territory}} and Pagan were a wide <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan {{as well as}} the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E

5|$|The Latter Day Saint {{settlers}} of modern-day Utah {{had established}} a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory. To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.|$|E

5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} a <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme system {{of military and}} administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height in nearly five centuries, and indeed {{for the next four}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane {{moved to the}} northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western Florida. At its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced across a wide <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E

There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E

5|$|In 1590, {{under the}} headship of Yoshishige's son Satake Yoshinobu, the Satake clan pledged fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara. After {{the fall of}} Odawara, Hideyoshi {{accepted}} them as vassals, and guaranteed their lordship of a 540,000 koku <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> territory in Hitachi Province. Having received recognition from Hideyoshi as the ruler of Hitachi Province, Yoshinobu's drive for unifying the province under his rule was strengthened. He brought {{nearly all of the}} province under his control, {{with the exception of the}} Tsuchiura and Shimodate areas, the control of which Hideyoshi had assured to the Yūki clan.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. This {{would make the}} storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The low number of fatalities is attributable to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled {{at the time of}} Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Well {{in advance}} of Vera's landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} ahead of the typhoon occurred across the Tōkai region of Japan starting on September23, when the storm reached peak intensity over open waters. In Nagoya, rainfall totals reached 10cm (4in). In {{other parts of the}} Tōkai region, nearly 20cm (8in) of rain was reported. The precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in the <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> rain. Steady rainfall occurred throughout Vera's passage of Honshu, though the worst of the rain-induced flooding occurred well after the typhoon's initial landfall. In Kawakami, Nara, a landslide killed 60people after crushing 12homes.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to walk through the heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|As a {{precursor}} low-pressure area, Sam brought widespread rainfall throughout a wide <b>swath</b> <b>of</b> northern Australia. Due to {{its proximity to}} the coast throughout its existence, associated rainfall continued to affect the region throughout Sam's existence. As Sam approached the coast, numerous warnings were issued, with storm warnings posted for Cape Leveque to Pardoo Station on 8December. Meteorologists indicated that the storm would {{be a threat to}} shipping in the immediate regions. Due to its impending threat to the northwestern coast of Australia, most of the residents of Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station were evacuated via helicopter. Upon landfall, though severe damage was wrought, damage was localized. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was a measurement of 973mbar (hPa; 28.74inHg). Some buildings were severely damaged, and trees, power lines, sheds, and fences were downed by the strong winds. Staff quarters and sheds in the Anna Plains Station were demolished. The cattle station also lost electrical power during the storm.|$|E
