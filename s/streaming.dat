50|$|To {{qualify as}} a <b>stream,</b> {{a body of water}} must be either {{recurring}} or perennial.

5000|$|Three {{kinds of}} <b>streams</b> are formed by headward erosion: insequent <b>streams,</b> {{subsequent}} <b>streams,</b> and obsequent and resequent <b>streams</b> (See Fluvial landforms of <b>streams.)</b> Insequent <b>streams</b> form by random headward erosion, usually from sheetflow of {{water over the}} landform surface.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for <b>stream</b> data processing that incorporates a <b>stream</b> database server as a fundamental component.

50|$|In the {{application}} of the Strahler <b>stream</b> order to hydrology, each segment of a <b>stream</b> or river within a river network is treated as a node in a tree, with the next segment downstream as its parent. When two first-order <b>streams</b> come together, they form a second-order <b>stream.</b> When two second-order <b>streams</b> come together, they form a third-order <b>stream.</b> <b>Streams</b> of lower order joining a higher order <b>stream</b> do not change the order of the higher <b>stream.</b> Thus, if a first-order <b>stream</b> joins a second-order <b>stream,</b> it remains a second-order <b>stream.</b> It is not until a second-order <b>stream</b> combines with another second-order <b>stream</b> that it becomes a third-order <b>stream.</b> As with mathematical trees, a segment with index i must be fed by at least 2i &minus; 1 different tributaries of index 1. Shreve noted that Horton’s and Strahler’s Laws should be expected from any topologically random distribution. A later review of the relationships confirmed this argument, establishing that, from the properties the laws describe, no conclusion can be drawn to explain the structure or origin of the <b>stream</b> network.|$|R
30|$|The mean <b>stream</b> {{length is}} a {{property}} {{related to the}} drainage networks and its associated surfaces. The mean <b>stream</b> lengths were calculated using the formula of total <b>stream</b> length of order divided by total number of <b>stream</b> segments of order. The mean <b>stream</b> length is higher in less <b>stream</b> order, and lesser in high <b>stream</b> order is due to variations in slope and topography. The mean <b>stream</b> length is 1622  km in the study area. The mean <b>stream</b> length {{is directly related to}} mean annual runoff; therefore, the highest mean <b>stream</b> length has relatively high mean annual rainfall runoff and relatively low mean annual rainfall runoff in less mean <b>stream</b> length. In the present study, mean <b>stream</b> length is indicating the high mean annual rainfall runoff.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 <b>Stream</b> {{temperature}} is a water quality parameter that directly influences {{the quality of}} aquatic habitat, particularly for cold-water species such as Pacific salmonids. Forest harvesting adjacent to a <b>stream</b> can {{increase the amount of}} solar radiation the <b>stream</b> receives, which can elevate <b>stream</b> temperatures and impair aquatic habitat. Oregon Forest Practice Rules mandate that forest operators leave Riparian Management Areas (RMAs) adjacent to <b>streams</b> in order to minimize the water quality impacts from forest harvesting. However, RMAs that contain overstory merchantable conifers are not required for small non-fish-bearing <b>streams</b> in Oregon, thus there is potential for increases in <b>stream</b> temperature to occur in headwater <b>streams</b> after harvesting. There is concern that increases in <b>stream</b> temperatures and changes to onsite processes in non-fish-bearing, headwater <b>streams</b> may propagate downstream and impair habitat in fish-bearing <b>streams.</b> The objectives of the following work are to assess the effects of contemporary forest management practices on <b>stream</b> temperatures of small non-fish-bearing headwater <b>streams</b> and to develop new knowledge regarding the physical processes that control reach-level <b>stream</b> temperature patterns. Summer <b>stream</b> temperatures were measured for five years in six headwater <b>streams</b> in the Hinkle Creek basin in southern Oregon. After four years, four of the <b>streams</b> were harvested and vegetated RMAs were not left between the <b>streams</b> and harvest units. The watersheds of the two remaining <b>streams</b> were not disturbed. Post-harvest <b>stream</b> temperatures were monitored for one year in all six <b>streams.</b> Each harvested <b>stream</b> was paired with one unharvested <b>stream</b> and regression relationships for maximum, minimum and mean daily <b>stream</b> temperatures were developed. Changes to temperatures of harvested <b>streams</b> were detected by comparing the mean pre-harvest regression relationship to the mean post-harvest relationship. Change detection analyses that considered the mean response among all four harvested <b>streams</b> indicated that maximum daily <b>stream</b> temperatures did not increase after harvesting, but that minimum and mean daily temperatures decreased significantly after harvesting. Additionally, diel <b>stream</b> temperature fluctuations were significantly greater one year after harvesting. Pre- and post-harvest surveys of canopy closure in the harvested and unharvested <b>streams</b> were completed in order to compare levels of <b>stream</b> shading before and after harvest. The post-harvest survey quantified canopy closure from remaining overstory vegetation as well as from logging slash that partially covered the harvested <b>streams.</b> The surveys indicated that mean overstory canopy closure in the harvested <b>streams</b> decreased by 84...|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} in morphometric {{analysis}} of a drainage basin is the designation of <b>stream</b> order; <b>stream</b> ordering as suggested by Strahler (1964) was used for this study. <b>Streams</b> that originate at a source are defined as first-order <b>stream.</b> When two <b>streams</b> of first order join, an order two <b>stream</b> is created. When two <b>streams</b> of different orders join, the channel segment immediately downstream has a higher order of the two joining <b>streams.</b> The order of a basin is {{the order of the}} highest <b>stream.</b>|$|R
30|$|Although, both <b>STREAM</b> and DCSTREAM utilize batch {{processing}} for <b>stream</b> clustering {{but there is}} no solution for monotonous data in <b>STREAM.</b> Therefore, <b>STREAM</b> attempts to cluster segment of data by which is not required to cluster. As a result, quality of clusters discovered by <b>STREAM</b> decreased especially for <b>streams</b> 7, 8 and 9 which include monotonous data, while DCSTREAM could detect monotonous data in these <b>streams</b> and ignored clustering them. Furthermore, KDDCUP 99 includes abrupt concept drift that is not recognizable by <b>STREAM.</b> Thus, sudden fall for quality can be seen from Fig.  7 in some <b>streams</b> e.g. <b>stream</b> 13. In <b>streams</b> 16 and 17, the quality decreased for both <b>STREAM</b> and DCSTREAM. In fact, outlier detection is the reason of decreasing quality. Data in these windows are in same class (normal) but the samples include outliers. However, DCSTREAM could achieve better quality than <b>STREAM</b> in this situation. There is a steep fall in quality for the first <b>stream</b> of data clustering by <b>STREAM.</b> First <b>stream</b> is very critical for clustering because of initialization. As it can be seen from Fig.  7 DCSTREAM is more successful than <b>STREAM</b> because DCSTREAM uses the two stages algorithm based on divide-and-conquer to avoid initialization problem of K-Means which is used by <b>STREAM.</b>|$|R
