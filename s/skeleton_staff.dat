By May 1941, there were nearly 750 people working in the government in London in all capacities.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1937, Hearst {{was forced}} by {{bankruptcy}} to sign {{over all of}} his holdings {{to a group of}} trustees called the Conservation Committee. Wyntoon was included, it was estimated the prior year to be worth $300,000. Headed by New York Judge Clarence J. Shearn, the trustees slashed Hearst's costs and halted the smaller side projects at San Simeon and Wyntoon which had kept so many contractors busy. Wyntoon was maintained only by a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> paid for by the Hearst Corporation. Hearst never hosted more than 14 guests at Wyntoon after the bankruptcy. From 1938 to 1940, Hearst's art collections were cataloged and sold, including items from Wyntoon. Hearst was made to pay rent out of his allowance when he stayed at any of his properties.|$|E

5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to make do with him a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper was}} {{launched}} {{with an initial}} print-run of 60,000, and was edited by a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> during the trial run, with plans to employ more journalists if it became a permanent publication. Initial contributors included Sunday Herald journalists Jamie Maxwell and Peter Geoghegan, as well as freelance reporter Sarah Cooper. During the initial week of publication, Walker spoke of his belief that The National would continue beyond the trial period, but said the decision was {{in the hands of}} its publishers. Following healthy sales in the first few days, Newsquest executives decided on 27 November to continue printing the newspaper, and to allocate it additional resources. On the same day, Neil Mackay, The Nationals news editor, confirmed that the paper would be published on a permanent basis. Publication then continued on weekdays until the introduction of a Saturday edition in May 2015.|$|E
5|$|Through 1944 'A' Force {{was slowly}} winding down. Clarke was {{involved}} in planning Operation Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff,</b> remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded.|$|E
50|$|Following the war, the BVE and BMI, {{as well as}} the Home Guard, {{ceased to}} existed. The BMA and BVRC were both demobilised, reduced to <b>skeleton</b> <b>staffs.</b> Both were quickly built back up to {{strength}} in 1951, and conscription, which had been used during the war, was re-introduced for both units (the BVRC suitably being retitled simply Bermuda Rifles), although the conscripts served on a part-time basis, whereas wartime service had been full-time for the duration. The last coastal artillery, the Examination Battery on St. David's Head, was removed from use in 1953, and the BMA converted to the infantry role (but remained nominally part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery). The last Imperial Defence Plan was issued the same year. After that, the local units no longer had a role under Imperial defence planning.|$|R
50|$|After the B-66s {{departed}} {{the base}} {{was returned to}} reserve status. The RAF used Chelveston for Civil Defence exercises. Mostly though, the station was maintained by a small RAF <b>skeleton</b> support <b>staff.</b> In August 1968, the station was put on alert during the Czechoslovakian Crisis, but no units were deployed there.|$|R
5000|$|The BMI and the BVE, {{as well as}} the Home Guard, {{were all}} {{permanently}} disbanded after the war. [...] "B" [...] Company, BMI, was disbanded on the 27 July, 1945, and its personnel absorbed into [...] "A" [...] Company, which was itself disbanded on the 1 March, 1946, with its personnel absorbed into the BMA's St. David's Battery. The BMA and the BVRC were both reduced to <b>skeleton</b> <b>staffs</b> with their personnel moved onto the Reserve, but were built back up in 1951 through new recruitment. In 1953, the coastal artillery in Bermuda was removed from use. The BMA converted to the infantry role, but was not retitled, and continued to wear the Royal Artillery uniform and cap badge until 1965, when it was amalgamated with the Bermuda Rifles (as the BVRC had been re-titled) to form the Bermuda Regiment.|$|R
5|$|The 52nd was {{initially}} a one-battalion regiment, but increased recruiting {{resulted in the}} creation of a second battalion in 1798. While the 1st Battalion saw some action in Spain and Portugal in 1800–1801, the 2nd remained stationed in England. In 1803 the regiment's fittest officers and men were concentrated in the 1st battalion, for training as light infantry, and the 2nd battalion was transferred to the 96th Foot. A new second battalion was raised in 1804. Both battalions saw extensive action during the Napoleonic Wars, and they were brigaded together for a time during the Peninsula Campaign, but heavy losses at Badajoz in 1812 resulted in the reduction of the 2nd battalion to a cadre (<b>skeleton</b> <b>staff).</b> The 2nd was eventually reformed with new recruits and saw service in Holland in 1813–14. Following the conclusion of the war in 1814, both battalions were billeted in England, where the 2nd's effectives were transferred to the 1st battalion, in preparation for further service. The 2/52nd remained in England during the Waterloo Campaign, and were disbanded in 1815. Subsequently, the 52nd remained a one-battalion regiment until their merger with the 43rd.|$|E
5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> to assist with the transition of power.|$|E
25|$|Canadair's top {{management}} {{was of the}} opinion that Lear’s concept was sketchy at best. Lear did not have an expert grasp of aeronautical engineering.

25|$|Growing {{shortages}} {{in the number}} of personnel after the Mexican War stretched the resources of the U.S. Army. At Fort Washington, as at many other posts, the garrison was withdrawn leaving only a <b>skeleton</b> maintenance <b>staff.</b> In fact, between 1853 and 1861, only one soldier, Ordnance Sergeant Joseph Cameron, was stationed full-time at the fort.|$|R

When the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place and the Pacific War suddenly ended, these plans were canceled. Most personnel either separated from the military or were reassigned to other units, while a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> arrived at Drew Field, Florida on 1 September. The unit was inactivated on 9 November 1945.|$|E
25|$|Following the accident, the MMA {{temporarily}} ceased {{operations on}} its lines between Lac-Mégantic and Jackman, Maine, effectively severing rail transport on its lines between Maine and Quebec, though rail traffic continued outside the affected area. In Quebec, MMA continued operation from Farnham with a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> after the derailment, having laid off 19 of its 75 workers without notice on July 19 {{and an additional}} five on July 30; these workers have not received severance and vacation pay owed. In Maine, 64 MMA employees were laid off {{as a result of}} the derailment.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} to cease {{publication of the}} Review is a difficult one made after a careful study of the magazines prospects in a challenging business climate, said Todd Larsen, chief operating officer at Dow Jones Consumer Media Group. In 2004, Dow Jones fired most of FEERs reporters and transformed it into a monthly publication. Articles were largely commissioned and only a <b>skeleton</b> editorial <b>staff</b> was retained. David Plott, FEERs editor at the time, described the upheaval in 2004 as a loss {{of one of the}} greatest concentrations of knowledge and expertise about the region assembled anywhere.|$|R

Two minor technical patches were later released by a <b>skeleton</b> crew of <b>staff</b> kept on the project, but Interplay had effectively ended their support.|$|R
5|$|In March 1916 the two cavalry corps were disbanded and {{the five}} {{divisions}} {{were assigned to the}} five British armies. A <b>skeleton</b> corps <b>staff</b> was retained to allow for the re-establishment of a new corps if one was required, which did happen the following September. At the same time, Gough was appointed as the Inspector General of Training of Cavalry Divisions. The cavalry divisions went through a period of training, re-organisation, and issuance of new equipment. One of the major changes was the withdrawal of the regiments' machine guns for their concentration in newly formed brigade machine gun squadrons, each of twelve sections with two machine guns to a section. The division also received a Light Armoured Car Battery equipped with six Rolls Royce Armoured Cars. The training covered topics such as how to cross trench systems using mobile bridging equipment, tactics to employ against an entrenched enemy, blowing up and filling in trenches, and skill at arms, including machine guns and bayonet fighting.|$|R
500|$|On {{the same}} day as the shootdown, Rear Admiral William A.

Surface search began immediately and on into September 13. U.S. underwater operations began on September 14. On September 10, 1983, with no further hope of finding survivors, Task Force 71's mission was reclassified from a [...] "Search and Rescue" [...] (SAR) operation to a [...] "Search and Salvage" [...] (SAS).|$|E
500|$|Britain withdrew {{most of its}} High Commission {{staff from}} Salisbury in the days {{following}} UDI, leaving a small <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff</b> to man a [...] "residual mission" [...] intended to help Gibbs keep the British government informed of local happenings. Several countries followed Britain's lead and closed their consulates in Salisbury, with one prominent exception to this being the United States, which retained its consulate-general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a [...] "US Contacts Office" [...] to circumvent the problem of diplomatic recognition. South Africa and Portugal maintained [...] "Accredited Diplomatic Representative" [...] offices in Salisbury, which were embassies in all but name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI overseas missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and Lourenço Marques. Unofficial representative offices of the Rhodesian government also existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a citizen of Belgium was employed to represent Rhodesian interests there. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, located at Rhodesia House on the Strand, remained {{under the control of the}} post-UDI government and effectively became its representative office in the UK. Like the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square, Rhodesia House became a regular target for political demonstrations. These continued even after Britain forced the office to close in 1969.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} planning maps plotted {{the first}} turnpike {{to the west}} of Detroit, running near US24 (Telegraph Road). This route was later proposed for I-75 itself; I-275 would have been the freeway to loop into downtown Detroit. [...] The proposed length was increased by December 1955; the extended Michigan Turnpike would have run from a connection across the Ohio state line to Toledo north through Detroit and Saginaw and eventually to {{the southern end of the}} Mackinac Bridge. By the following April, any extensions were cancelled leaving the turnpike to its original termini; the east–west companion road was also cancelled at that time. The MTA proposed a state constitutional amendment in January 1956 that would allow the Michigan Legislature to issue state-guaranteed bonds for part of the MTA's construction expenses. According to The Wall Street Journal, the authority [...] "struggled for survival" [...] in the face of opposition from the MSHD just two months later; the department's actions impaired the authority's appropriations from the state legislature and its ability to sell the necessary bonds to pay for construction. When the federal government approved the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula. This announcement undermined the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike. By August 1956, the MTA voted to reduce its operations to a <b>skeleton</b> <b>staff,</b> but moved forward in May 1957 on a bond sale to finance construction of the roadway. Financiers stated such a sale was only feasible if the turnpike was to be safe from competition. The Michigan Townships Association called for the abolition of the MTA in 1958. The legislature killed a bill to do so in June 1959, but it later voted to repeal the act that created the authority in 1962.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} lease of East Broad Top Railroad by the East Broad Top Railroad Preservation Association ended in April 2012. Negotiations {{between the parties}} continued into May 2012 but an operating agreement acceptable to both parties could not be reached. In {{part due to the}} late date and likely due to other factors it was decided not to operate the EBT in 2012, 13 or 14. The railroad facilities are currently maintained by a <b>skeleton</b> paid <b>staff</b> and FEBT volunteers. The EBTPA no longer has any involvement with on site activities at the EBT but continues to hold a purchase option for the railroad and is continuing to pursue funding for purchase. FRA inspections and paperwork were being kept up during 2012 on Locomotive #15 in case re-operation occurs. Although no public excursions were held in 2012 or 2013, diesel powered trains operated October 6, 2012 and October 12, 2013 for members of the FEBT. Motorcar excursions were operated October 11, 2014 for members of the FEBT.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda Militia Artillery (which {{had absorbed}} the {{remaining}} Bermuda Militia Infantry personnel) and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps were disembodied in 1946, retaining only <b>skeleton</b> <b>staffs</b> {{while most of}} their personnel {{were placed on the}} reserve. A new defence act was passed in 1949 and both units were brought back up to strength in 1951, with many discharged soldiers re-enlisting. Strength for both units was set at about 200 personnel. In 1953, when the coastal artillery batteries were taken out of use, the BMA, while still wearing the Royal Artillery cap badge, converted to the infantry role. This left the Colony wastefully maintaining two separate infantry units, each of a single company commanded by a Major. There was also, now, a Headquarters Bermuda Local Forces, which was a common battalion-level Headquarters Company for both the BMA and the Bermuda Rifles, though not part of either unit and with its own badge. This contained not only the headquarters, but also sub-units shared by both the BMA, such as signals and instructors. This headquarters, Commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel, fell under the garrison's Command Headquarters at Prospect Camp, commanded by a regular army Brigadier.After closure of the Royal Navy's dockyard commenced in 1951 (a process that lasted until 1958, leaving only a small naval base, HMS Malabar, within the former dockyard), the military garrison, which had existed primarily to protect the Royal Navy base, was also closed. The Command Headquarters, the last regular infantry unit (a company of the DCLI), and various supporting attachments and detachments (Royal Engineers, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Army Service Corps, et cetera) was withdrawn in 1957, and the two Bermudian territorials ceased to have any military tasking under Imperial defence planning (with 1953 being the last year an Imperial Defence Plan, under which their roles were assigned, was issued). Although the colonial government had only formed the two units at the behest of and under pressure from the British government, it chose to continue maintaining them entirely at its own expense (although defence falls within the remit of the national British government, rather than the internal government of the colony). The presence of the part-time units, and their abilities to take on all of the roles of the garrison, {{had been part of the}} British Government's justification for withdrawing the Command Headquarters and the regular infantry.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{services}} {{for persons with}} disabilities varies by state and sometimes by location within a state. While Medicaid and Social Security income, both SSI and SSDI, are federally mandated, each state is responsible for administering these programs in their state, {{as part of their}} services and supports for persons with disabilities. Each state designs its service delivery system differently and as a result, the portals for entry vary for each state. Some states administer services through a state government agency with subordinate offices throughout the state. Some states contract services out (privatize) and maintain a <b>skeleton</b> state government <b>staff.</b> Being a good advocate or self advocate is necessary to maximize services and supports.|$|R

Pikus-Pace, who was the reigning overall world cup leader at the time, suffered a compound fracture of her right leg that took her out of the running for a 2006 Olympic bid as well. Parsley suffered soft-tissue injuries to her right leg that severely hampered her ability to compete in the US team trials less than 72 hours after the accident.

500|$|Production in Sydney {{commenced}} {{the week}} beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out {{along with a}} <b>skeleton</b> crew. Additional <b>staff</b> were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted {{by a group of}} British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of [...] "hitting air". Initially startled by the move, Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised as he might have flinched if he had known what Pertwee was about to do. Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was unusual to see Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state.|$|R
