50|$|In 1978 Mainstream closed. Bob <b>Shad</b> <b>died</b> in 1985. In 1991, {{the label}} was {{restarted}} by his daughter, Tamara, and Humphrey Walwyn, {{the former head}} of BBC Records. It was bought by Legacy in 1993.|$|R
40|$|As {{noted by}} Persi Diaconis, the {{apparently}} simple problem of calculating the face probabilities of a <b>shaved</b> <b>die</b> defies exact mathematical analysis. However, this {{problem can be}} used to provide amusing and instructive examples of sufficiency, efficiency, information, ancillarity, and the value of statistical design...|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} hours, perhaps, {{there was a}} semblance of haste about it, {{but in the long}} quiet of the afternoon, as Jeff leaned forward towards the customer, and talked to him in a soft {{confidential}} monotone, like a portrait painter, the razor would go slower and slower, and pause and stop, move and pause again, till the <b>shave</b> <b>died</b> away into the mere drowse of conversation.|$|R
25|$|The Delaware River {{is used by}} American shad {{during their}} {{spawning}} run. The fish are the largest members of the herring family. They are an anadromous species, which means they are born and spawn in fresh water but spend {{the majority of their}} lives in salt water (of the Atlantic Ocean). After spending three to six years at sea, the shad return to the waters of their birth to spawn. Unlike salmon, not all <b>shad</b> <b>die</b> after spawning; some survive and return to the ocean.|$|R
50|$|The {{spawning}} fish select sandy or pebbly shallows and deposit their eggs primarily between sundown and midnight. Females release eggs in batches of about 30,000 eggs, {{though it has}} been estimated that as many as 156,000 eggs are deposited by very large fish. Total annual egg production is 200,000-600,000 eggs per female with larger fish producing more. In rivers north of Cape Fear the spent fish, now very emaciated, return to the sea immediately after spawning. In southern rivers, most <b>shad</b> <b>die</b> after spawning.|$|R
50|$|Yukuk <b>Shad</b> (r. 638-642, <b>died</b> 653) (or Illig Beg Tughluq or Chinese: 欲谷設/欲谷设) reigned in {{the final}} days of the Western Turkic Khaganate. His name Yukuk means Snow Leopard (Panthera Uncia) and title Shad means prince.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1951 season, Beard and {{teammate}} Alex Groza {{were banned}} from the NBA for life by then-commissioner Maurice Podoloff after the players admitted to point shaving during their college careers. This scandal was the CCNY point <b>shaving</b> scandal Beard <b>died</b> at his Louisville, Kentucky home in 2007.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} professions open {{to college}} graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau, so in 1835 {{he took a}} leave of absence from Harvard, during which he taught school in Canton, Massachusetts. After he graduated in 1837, he joined the faculty of the Concord public school, but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment. He and his brother John then opened the Concord Academy, a grammar school in Concord, in 1838. They introduced several progressive concepts, including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses. The school closed when John became fatally ill from tetanus in 1842 after cutting himself while <b>shaving.</b> He <b>died</b> in Henry's arms.|$|R
40|$|None supplied. From introduction: The {{reluctance}} of shad {{to pass through}} the orifice-type regulating sections of the fish ladders has been a serious problem at John Day Dam. During the shad run the pools of the regulating sections have become extremely crowded with fish and many <b>shad</b> have <b>died</b> in the ladders before spawning. The coordinated effort of Engineers and Biologists resulted {{in the development of a}} vertical slot fish ladder that effectively passed shad in the laboratory and provided adequate flow regulation in the Corps 2 ̆ 7 model of the John Day fish ladder. The objective of the evaluation study was to ensure that the new vertical slot regulating section would satisfactorily pass shad and all other species of fish that ascend the John Day fish ladders...|$|R
5000|$|On December 1995, Mosely {{was added}} as the 5th member in Inspection 12 as second guitar and vocals. His first show {{with the band}} was at a friend's {{backyard}} birthday party. Because {{he did not know}} any of their songs, he only played the cover section consisting of songs by NOFX and Weezer. The band went on to record six full length independent albums, and although being a relatively successful local band, Mosely recalls feeling like outcasts because of their preppy clothes and unorthodox style of punk rock, explaining that [...] "Whenever we'd play a show like Good Riddance or AFI, it would always be a real tough crowd. I used to hear it all the time about us being rich kids."The band went on a hiatus in 1999 when singer Dan McLintock joined fellow musician Ryan Key to audition for the Tooth & Nail band Craig's Brother. Ryan soon returned home and joined local band Yellowcard, and a year later Dan also returned, with a proposal from Fat Wreck Chords record label owner Fat Mike to record some new material for consideration for Fat Wreck Chords subsidiary Honest Don's Records. Guitarist James Trimble was by then studying in Tennessee to become an obstetrician so Ryan was asked to help with the recording of their Home EP. Yellowcards violinist Sean Mackin was also featured on strings. After the recording their record label debut album In Recovery in December 2000, drummer Scott <b>Shad</b> <b>died</b> after going into diabetic shock while driving his car, but the band persevered and drafted lifelong friend of the band Tim Grisnik as a drummer. They went on a U.S. tour and later returned to the studio to record their second album for Honest Don's, Get Rad. However, after eight months of recording songs, Honest Don's president reportedly told them, [...] "My label doesn't put out this kind of music. And I don't even know what to call it." [...] They were dropped from the record label and bought their recorded material back to finish the album themselves.The band would go on to release its newest album in 11 years, Redefine, in December 2014. The album features the return of original lead vocalist, Rob Reid, to the band.|$|R
50|$|Carbon-14 {{tests have}} {{indicated}} that Yde Girl died between 54 BCE and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years. She had long reddish blond hair, but {{one side of her}} head was initially thought to have been <b>shaved</b> before she <b>died.</b> Recent studies of Windeby I, however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest {{to one side of the}} head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from scoliosis. She stood at 137 cm, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.|$|R
25|$|Sun Yi's son, Sun Song (孫松), {{served as}} a Colonel of Trainee Archers (射聲校尉) and was made a Marquis of a Chief District (都鄉侯). Sun Song was known for being a gregarious and generous person and was the closest to Sun Quan among all of Sun Quan's younger male relatives. When Sun Song was {{stationed}} in Baqiu (巴丘), he was often reprimanded by Lu Xun, a senior Wu general and minister, for not maintaining good discipline in his unit and allowing his men to fool around. On one occasion, Lu Xun punished Sun Song's subordinates by ordering their heads to be <b>shaved.</b> Sun Song <b>died</b> in 231.|$|R
5000|$|A {{veteran of}} the Great War, Coolidge rose to {{prominence}} during his tenure as the governor of Massachusetts during the 1920s. In 1928, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president. However, as the United States had been experiencing an economic boom under the Socialist President Upton Sinclair, Coolidge was readily portrayed as another regressive Democrat. Despite Coolidge's promises to keep the Confederate States in check, his lack of accomplishment outside of Massachusetts, worked against him. Although he carried all of the New England states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and Vermont), Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, and Houston, he lost that election narrowly to the incumbent Vice President, Socialist Hosea Blackford. When Coolidge called Blackford to concede the race, he warned him that a [...] "bull market going {{as high as it}} is, will fall". Blackford thought it was just sour grapes and paid no heed. When Coolidge's words came true in 1929 and the Socialists and Blackford were blamed for the crash, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket again in 1932 with Herbert Hoover as his running mate. He won the 1932 election in a landslide. However, on January 5, 1933, President-elect Coolidge suffered a heart attack while <b>shaving</b> and <b>died,</b> less than a month before he would be inaugurated on February 1. (The Coolidge of our history died on the same date, but after he served as president from 1923 to 1929.) Herbert Hoover took his place as President-elect and would go on to be inaugurated as the thirty first President of the United States on February 1.|$|R
