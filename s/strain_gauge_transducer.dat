40|$|The {{literature}} on bone growth, fracture healing, fracture treatment {{and the effects}} of forces and movements on these is reviewed. Some methods of assessing the progress of fracture union are considered. The conclusion from this is that a fracture movement transducer is needed for use on an external fracture fixator, and the design criteria are outlined. The possible types of transducers are considered and a system of light falling on lateral effect photodetectors was used. The linearizing algorithms applicable to the employed detectors are discussed and tested. The electronic circuits were designed and revised, initially to produce a reasonable power consumption, and then to give a system with reduced noise levels and improved linearity. Isolation amplifiers were required to prevent leakage currents reaching the patient from the mains powered computer. The algorithms relating the movements of the transducer to the movements at the fracture site were derived, including the use of elasticity theory to calculate the bending of the fixator pins. The engineering descriptions of the patient tests and the methods of calculating the fracture stiffness are considered. The transducer was calibrated, and consideration was given to the effect of the fixator pins loosening in the bone.

40|$|Abstract [...] Observations in {{the field}} of lower limb {{prosthetic}} rehabilitation have shown that several transfemoral prostheses show signs of wear on some components of the knee unit. This is thought to be a result of severe loading developed during activities associated with kneeling. Some prostheses may have failed due to repetitive action of such loading. In order to determine the nature and magnitude of the loads developed during kneeling by persons with transfemoral amputation, and to investigate the influence of various prosthetic parameters, an analysis of the results of 162 tests in prosthetic knee hyperflexion was undertaken. The services of four males with amputation were enlisted. The measurements involved simultaneous use of two Kistler force platforms, a six-channel <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>transducer</b> mounted on the prosthetic shank, and a data acquisition system. The critical loads for this configuration were found to be the shear force on the knee hinge, the shear force imposed by the knee chassis on the shin, and the bending moment tending to hyperflex the knee. These loads ranged from 0. 6 to 6. 2 kN, 0. 9 to 6. 7 kN, and from 18. 3 to 155. 7 Nm, respectively. To achieve a comfortable kneeling position, some prostheses permit foot rotation about the pylon axis of 90 ° to allow the shank to be approximately parallel to the ground. Tests were also conducted with the prostheses in this configuration and the most influential prosthetic parameter was found to be the external rotation of the foot (toe-out angle). During kneeling, {{it was found that the}} loading was dependent upon the position of the torso relative to the prosthesis, but loads were much higher than those developed during level walking...|$|E

40|$|PhDThe {{initial phase}} {{of this study}} was to develop a force {{transducer}} to investigate occlusal forces during the process of mastication. The <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>transducer</b> was designed to attach to an Astra implant. A commercial pressure transducer was also used under one distal saddle of the denture. The calibration method was designed to record unilateral masticatory forces regardless of the site of loading. Five edentulous subjects with implant stabilised mandibular overdentures and maxillary complete dentures were selected for the study. Mandibular movements and unilateral Masseter muscle EMG were recorded. Experiments were designed to establish within subject differences related to cycle type, food type, EMG-force relationship, chewing side and cycle phase. Maximum biting force on a bite gauge and in the intercuspal position were also recorded. Details of force production during the closing and occlusal phases improved the description of the movement cycle and it's relationship to food breakdown. A classification of chewing cycles is proposed based on the force exerted in the closing and occlusal phases. This provides objective criteria for separating crushing, reduction and mush cycles. Peak forces varied between subjects, but are characteristic for the type of food within subjects. The different strategies used by subjects appeared to be partly related to the force capacity of the individual. The duration of force in the closing phase was related to the stage in the chewing sequence and indicated the degree of bolus resistance. A longer force duration in the closing phase was usually accompanied by a shorter occlusal duration and consequently an early occurrence of force peak relative to occlusion. The progressive change of jaw gap at the beginning of force was consistent with the expected reduction of particles through the masticatory sequence. The jaw gape at maximum velocity correlated with maximum jaw gape but both did not decrease progressively 2 Abstract through chewing sequences. Conversely, the jaw gape at which force exceeded 5 N showed patterns of progressive decrease especially with frangible foods. Integrated force and Emg showed high correlations during mastication, better than peak values. These correlations were, however, weaker than those found in static unilateral biting. The slope difference found between the two conditions contraindicate the use of Emg activity in static unilateral biting as an index for measuring masticatory forces. This study has, thus, validated a method for investigating masticatory forces and shown their value for analysis of dynamic aspects of the loads that occurs during mastication...|$|E
40|$|The {{relations}} between stress, stimulation rate and sarcomere length (SL) were investigated in 24 cardiac trabeculae isolated from right ventricles of mice (CF- 1 males, 25 - 30 g) and superfused with Hepes solution ([Ca 2 +]o = 1 mm, pH 7. 4, 25 °C). Stress and SL were {{measured by a}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>transducer</b> and laser diffraction technique, respectively. Stress versus stimulation frequency formed a biphasic relation (25 °C, [Ca 2 +]o = 2 mm) with a minimum at 0. 7 - 1 Hz (≈ 15 mN mm− 2), a 150 % decrease from 0. 1 to 1 Hz (descending limb) and a 75 % increase from 1 to 5 Hz (ascending limb). Ryanodine (0. 1 μm) inhibited specifically the descending limb, while nifedipine (0. 1 μm) affected specifically the ascending limb. This result suggests two separate sources of Ca 2 + for stress development: (1) net Ca 2 + influx during action potentials (AP); and (2) Ca 2 + entry into the cytosol from the extracellular space during diastolic intervals; Ca 2 + from both (1) and (2) is sequestered by the SR between beats. Raising the temperature to 37 °C lowered the stress-frequency relation (SFR) by ≈ 0 - 15 mN mm− 2 at each frequency. Because the amount of Ca 2 + carried by ICa,L showed a ≈ 3 -fold increase under the same conditions, we conclude that reduced Ca 2 + loading of the SR was probably responsible for this temperature effect. A simple model of Ca 2 + fluxes addressed the mechanisms underlying the SFR. Simulation {{of the effect of}} inorganic phosphates (Pi) on force production was incorporated into the model. The results suggested that O 2 diffusion limits force production at stimulation rates > 3 Hz. The stress-SL relations from slack length (≈ 1. 75 μm) to 2. 25 μm showed that the passive stress-SL curve of mouse cardiac trabeculae is exponential with a steep increase at SL > 2. 1 μm. Active stress (at 1 Hz) increased with SL, following a curved relation with convexity toward the abscissa at [Ca 2 +] = 2 mm. At [Ca 2 +] from 4 to 12 mm, the stress-SL curves superimposed and the relation became linear, which revealed a saturation step in the activation of force production. EC coupling in mouse cardiac muscle is similar to that observed previously in the rat, although important differences exist in the Ca 2 + dependence of force development. These results may suggest a lower capacity of the SR for buffering Ca 2 +, which makes the generation of force in mouse cardiac ventricle more dependent on Ca 2 + entering during action potentials, particularly at high heart rate...|$|E

The fact that no sex difference was observed on the rate of appearance in premotion silent period and on the premotor time would suggest that there are no sex difference on such a function of the nervous system. 主動筋に軽度の随意的な緊張を与えた状態から急速に反応動作をおこすと、動作に先行して主動筋に Silent period が出現する。本実験は、肘関節伸展動作を用いて、この動作前 silent period 出現率および動作開始時間･動作時間における男女差の有無を究明しようとした。被検者は、健常な 18 ～ 25 オまでの男女大学生、各々 33 名、合計 66 名である。本実験結果は、次のようである。 1) P. S. P. 出現率について a. 右肘関節伸展動作時に出現する p. s. p. 出現率は、 complete p. s. p. 試行で男子 37. 7 % (S. D. 27. 93 %) 、女子 31. 7 % (S. D. 29. 01 %) 、incomplete p. s. p. 試行で男子 19. 5 % (S. D. 10. 26 %) 、女子 21 ･ 5 % (S. D. 12 ･ 34 %) 、total p. s. p. 試行で男子 57. 4 % (S. D. 27. 59 %) 、女子 51. 8 % (S. D. 30. 20 %) であり、いずれの試行においても男女間に有意な差はみとめられなかった。 b. 左肘関節伸展動作時に出現する p. s. p. 出現率は、complete p. s. p. 試行で男子 32. 4 % (S. D. 30. 34 %) 、女子 28. 0 % (S. D. 26. 10 %) 、incomplete p. s. p. 試行で男子 20. 0 % (S. D. 13. 05 %) 、女子 23 ･ 2 % (S. D. 12. 80 %) 、total p. s. p. 試行で男子 52. 3 % (S. D. 26. 49 %) 、女子 51. 2 % (S. D. 26. 13 %) であり、いずれの試行においても男女間に有意な差はみとめられなかった。 2) 出現率の分布について a. complete p. s. p. 出現率は、男女とも 0 ～ 100 %まで幅広く分布し、出現率が高くなるにしたがって被検者数が減少する傾向を示した。 b. incomplete p. s. p. 出現率は、男女とも 0 ～ 60 %の範囲に分布していた。 c. total p. s. p. 出現率は、男女とも 1 ～ 100 %の範囲に分布し、最頻値は complete p. s. p. に比較して高くなった。 3) 右肘関節伸展動作時における全試行の動作開始時間の平均値は、男子 199 msec (S. D. 45. 3 msec) 、女子 200 msec (S. D. 43. 5 msec) であり、左肘関節伸展動作時のそれは、男子 203 msec (S. D. 53 ･ 2 msec) 、女子 208 msec (S. D. 47. 5 msec) であり、男女間にはいずれも有意な差は認められなかった。 4) 右肘関節伸展動作時における全試行の動作時間の平均値は、男子 107 msec (S. D. 26. 7 msec) 、女子 125 msec (S. D. 26. Omsec) であり、左肘関節伸展動作時のそれは、男子 110 msec (S. D. 25 ･ 3 msec) 、女子 134 msec (S. D. 32. 5 msec) であり、男女間にはいずれも 1 %水準で有意な差が認められた。これらの結果は、tonic discharge から phasic discharge へ移行する切り換え機構である動作前 silent period 出現率や刺激伝達時間である動作開始時間のような神経系の機能においては男女差のないことを示唆している...|$|E
