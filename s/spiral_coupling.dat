40|$|Fano {{resonance}} appears for conduction {{through an}} electron waveguide containing donor impurities. In this work, {{we consider the}} thin-film conducting chiral helimagnet (CCH) as the donor impurity in a one-dimensional waveguide model. Due to the spin <b>spiral</b> <b>coupling,</b> interference between the direct and intersubband transmission channels gives rise to spin-dependent Fano resonance effect. The spin-dependent Fano resonance is sensitively dependent on the helicity of the spiral. By tuning the CCH potential well depth and the incident energy, this provides a potential way to detect the spin structure in the CCH. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Analytic and six-degree-of-freedom motion base {{simulator}} {{studies have}} been conducted to better understand how the coupled roll-spiral and coupled roll-aileron actuator modes affect aircraft handling qualities. The results reported herein are preliminary and are subject to change until other aircraft and several more data points can be examined. The results obtained thus far indicate that when the roll-spiral coupled mode is brought about by unusual values of an aircraft's stability and control derivatives, the lateral-directional handling qualities will invariably be degraded. However, when the roll <b>spiral</b> <b>coupling</b> is brought about by a roll-rate command/roll-attitude hold stability and control augmentation system (SCAS), the requirements for satisfactory handling qualities can be correlated to the natural frequency and the damping of the coupled mode. Satisfactory handling qualities were also achieved when the lateral SCAS brought about a coupling of the roll mode with the aileron actuator mode. In this case, the pilot ratings indicate that the handling qualities may be correlated to the natural frequency of the coupled roll-aileron mode...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{the flow}} {{in a thin}} {{accretion}} disc like a dynamical system, we analyse {{the nature of the}} critical points of the steady solutions of the flow. For the simple inviscid disc there are two critical points, with the outer one being a saddle point and the inner one a centre type point. For the weakly viscous disc, there are four possible critical points, of which the outermost is a saddle point, while the next inner one is a <b>spiral.</b> <b>Coupling</b> the nature of the critical points with the outer boundary condition of the flow, gives us a complete understanding of all the important physical features of the flow solutions in the subsonic regions of the disc. In the inviscid disc, the physical realisability of the transonic solution passing through the saddle point is addressed by considering a temporal evolution of the flow, which is a very likely non-perturbative mechanism for selecting the transonic inflow solution from among a host of other possible stable solutions. For the weakly viscous disc, while a linearised time-dependent perturbation imposed on the steady mass inflow rate causes instability, the same perturbative analysis reveals that for the inviscid disc, there is a very close correspondence between the equation for the propagation of the perturbation and the metric of an acoustic black hole. Compatible with the transport of angular momentum to the outer regions of the disc, a viscosity-limited length scale is defined for the spatial extent of the inward rotational drift of matter.

40|$|The {{formation}} of self-organized patterns in predator-prey models {{has been a}} very hot topic recently. The dynamics of these models, bifurcations and pattern formations are so complex that studies are urgently needed. In this research, we transformed a continuous predator-prey model with Lesie-Gower functional response into a discrete model. Fixed points and stability analyses were studied. Around the stable fixed point, bifurcation analyses including: flip, Neimark-Sacker and Turing bifurcation were done and bifurcation conditions were obtained. Based on these bifurcation conditions, parameters values were selected to carry out numerical simulations on pattern formation. The simulation results showed that Neimark-Sacker bifurcation induced spots, spirals and transitional patterns from spots to spirals. Turing bifurcation induced labyrinth patterns and <b>spirals</b> <b>coupled</b> with mosaic patterns, while flip bifurcation induced many irregular complex patterns.

The proposed structure {{consists of}} a UWB semi-elliptical planar monopole, attached to an approximate trapezoidal spiral for 2. 45 -GHz Bluetooth application. The proposed antenna utilizes rectangular resonant spiral structures for rejection of quadruple frequency bands, i. e., WiMAX (3. 3 - 3. 6 GHz), WLAN (5. 15 - 5. 35, 5. 725 - 5. 825 GHz), and ITU 8 GHz.

The device uses eight electron guns and beam lines to achieve the required power level at a beam voltage of 190 kV, consistent with solid state power supplies. The electron gun operates with confined flow focusing, which is unique among current multiple beam sources, and allows operation at power levels consistent with producing 10 s of MWs of pulsed RF power. The circuit consists of a ring resonator input cavity, eight sets of buncher cavities, and a ring resonator output cavity. The RF output power is coupled into four rectangular waveguides equally spaced around the klystron. Eight individual collectors absorb the spent beam power in each beam. The klystron operates in a solenoid. The principle challenges in the design included development of the beam optics using confined flow focusing, shaping of the magnetic field in the gun region to avoid beam <b>spiraling,</b> <b>coupling</b> input power equally to all eight beam lines from a single input, and obtaining the required frequency and Q in the output cavity. The mechanical design was particularly complex due to the large parts count, number of braze and weld joints, and close proximity of the beam lines that limited access.

40|$|With {{increasing}} demand for nanoscale optical devices, {{the ability to}} confine the light on length scales smaller than those allowed by the diffraction limit of light has begun to attract enormous interest. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is offered by Plasmonics. Under certain conditions, a metal-dielectric interface supports Surface Plasmons (SPs), i. e. electromagnetic excitations strongly coupled to oscillations of free electrons in the metal. Thanks to these excitations, electromagnetic energy can be confined in a sub-wavelength volume close to the metal surface. This opens up the way {{for a wide range of}} opportunities and applications, from photovoltaics to biosensing. The focus of this thesis was to engineer metal-dielectric interfaces in order to excite plasmonic hotspots, i. e. nanometer-sized regions where the electromagnetic field is strongly enhanced. As hinted above, this can be achieved by conveniently meso- and/or nano-structuring the metal surface. The properties of metal-dielectric interfaces emerging from these studies are of particular interest in the field of molecular sensing, but are also of more fundamental interest. Different classes of devices are proposed. We started from digital plasmonic gratings, studying their excitation modes thoroughly. We then moved to nanostructures supporting a Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), specifically plasmonic nanoantennae, which are of special interest for the enhancement of well-established sensing techniques such as SERS. Coming to nanofocusing, we studied plasmonic wedges – which provide adiabatic nanofocusing at their ridge – as well as bull’s eye/Archimedean spiral structures, which can generate and focus Surface Plasmons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). Finally, we proposed a non-trivial integration of the above-mentioned effects, in the form of an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>coupled</b> to nanoantenna resonators.

The {{observational}} part includes new observations (detections) of molecular gas far out in <b>spiral</b> galaxies, <b>coupled</b> with existing maps of the HI, UV, and dust continuum emission. Modelling of the stellar UV-NIR emission including absorption by dust grains provides a picture of the intrinsic radiation fields.

Assuming the disks are co-planar, we characterize their deviation from axisymmetry by the fractional amplitudes, A_i and phases of the azimuthal Fourier components at radii R about the photometric galaxy center. We find that most disks exhibit a wealth of non-axisymmetric structures, specifically: (1) that about one third of them are substantially lopsided (A_ 1 /A_ 0 >= 0. 20) at 2. 5 disk exponential scale length, (2) that almost one half of them have strong two-armed spirals with an arm/interarm surface-brightness contrasts of order unity, and (3) that typical disks have some intrinsic ellipticity. We estimate that in the disk plane the characteristic ellipticity of the underlying potential is 0. 045 +- 0. 03. However, the <b>spiral</b> pattern <b>couples</b> significantly to the estimate of the intrinsic ellipticity, and our measurement may represent an upper limit on the ``true" potential triaxiality. We estimate the radial streaming motions of the disk stars, $v_R$, which are produced by these distortions.

The proposed structure {{consists of two}} co-planar semicircular dual band-notch monopole antennas, mounted with planar spiral. Individual antenna configuration provides an impedance bandwidth (VSWR < 2) for dualband i. e., both Bluetooth and UWB bands. For dual band-notch characteristic, two sets of <b>spirals</b> are capacitively <b>coupled</b> with the feed line of antenna.

For enhancing reception capabilities of the proposed structure, twin coplanar antennas are used to fulfill diversity requirements. However, due to coplanar and close proximity to each other, there is high possibility of mutual coupling between coplanar antenna elements. To address the mutual coupling between elements, cross-strip variablesized frequency selective structures are used.

There is a free edge effect on the electromagnetic signal, which is illustrated {{for the first time with}} the proposed EM technique. Detection of the air gap produced by inserting a thin piece into a machined subsurface groove is carried out. It is found that the developed CSI sensor is able to accurately resolve the location and extent of the air gap. The experimental results demonstrate that the sensor could offer an alternative relatively low cost method that can be fully automated for structural monitoring of aircraft and other composite structures...|$|R
40|$|Relating {{coupling}} {{and external}} quality factor of a filter {{to the physical}} parameters of the structure which is the final step of any filter design is usually complicated due to geometrical complexities of the filter, {{or in the case}} of microstrip resonators due to the lack of the exact solution for the field distribution. Therefore, common approach is using time consuming full wave simulations. In this paper active learning method (ALM) which is a fuzzy-based modeling technique developed by a procedure algorithmically mimics the information-handling process of the human brain, is proposed to overcome this drawback. Modeling steps of an unknown function using ALM will be described using an illustrative example. Afterwards, the modeling approach will be implemented to model coupling factor between two <b>coupled</b> <b>spiral</b> resonators (SRs) for two different coupling structures and external quality factor of the same resonator. Accuracy of the extracted surfaces is validated using two different criteria. Using the extracted surfaces; a four pole chebychev bandpass filter was designed and fabricated. Good agreement between the measured response and simulation validated the accuracy of the extracted surfaces again. Comparing the fabricated SR filter with a square open loop resonator (SOLR) one demonstrates more than 70 % of filter area reduction...|$|R
