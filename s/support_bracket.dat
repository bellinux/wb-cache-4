50|$|The slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety {{chains and}} a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting {{appliance}} {{also has a}} safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated {{by the weight of}} the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.|$|E
50|$|One {{edge of the}} {{expansion}} card holds the contacts (the edge connector or pin header) that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these were located in the <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins.|$|E

50|$|DubaiSat-1 has a {{hexagonal}} {{body with}} three deployable solar panels. The frame includes spacecraft adaptors, six longerons, , an inner ring that provides rigidity {{and stability of}} the satellite's camera, inner rods and three decks. Three spacecraft adaptors connect with shear brackets and mechanically couple the satellite and separation adaptor of the launch vehicle, the Dnepr Rocket. Each one of the spacecraft adaptors has separation sensors to monitor the separation condition between the satellite and the launch vehicle. The umbilical connector attaches on the lower surface of the bottom deck with its mounting <b>support</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the three}} team cars was {{designed}} around its intended driver integrating each driver’s requirements and preferences. The asymmetrically inclined valves (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical) were a significant departure for Henry and may be attributable to Sunbeam and Coatalen whose interest in desaxé configuration dated to 1911. Another unusual detail was the engine mounted directly on the chassis frame similarly to the 1921 'invincible Talbot-Darracq'. Following tests in Brooklands and Isle of Man prior to the Grand Prix, modifications were instigated to the tail <b>support</b> <b>bracket.</b> Different carburetor configurations and different tyre types were tried, axle ratios experimented with, aero screens and mudguards were installed or removed as required.|$|E
50|$|The Sholef's chassis, {{aside from}} a few minor modifications, is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Merkava Mk.III. The glacis plate is unchanged, except for the addition of a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> for the gun tube, which is folded down when not in use. As such, the Sholef and Merkava series share a large percentage of common components. The front-left side of the chassis has a prominent exhaust louver, along with a much smaller port just in front of it; the exact function of this port is uncertain, though the soot seen around it in photos of the Sholef suggests it may be a new or additional exhaust port, or perhaps an outlet for a smoke generator.|$|E

50|$|The AKML comes {{equipped}} with a side-rail used to attach a night vision device. The mount comprises a flat plate riveted to the left wall of the receiver housing and a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> fixed to the mounting base with screws. To shield the light-sensitive photo detector plate of the night vision sight, the weapon uses a slotted flash suppressor, which replaces the standard recoil compensator. The AKML can also be deployed in the prone position with a detachable barrel-mounted bipod that helps stabilize the weapon and reduces operator fatigue during prolonged periods of observation. The bipod is supplied as an accessory and is carried in a holster attached to the duty belt.|$|E

The mufflers were a little lower and changed from the flair look to a more straight style. The front pegs and controls were moved forward, the rear foot peg <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> became solid and the back rest was optional this year. The cast wheels changed from a ten-spoke to a five-spoke design and the access covers were chromed. The [...] "VT750C" [...] was available outside of the USA (Canada and Europe) with a larger engine displacement.|$|E
50|$|The {{traction}} pipe slot and {{the piston}} bracket were handed; {{that is the}} slot closure flap was continuously hinged on one side, and the piston <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> was cranked to minimise the necessary opening of the flap. This meant that the piston carriage could not simply be turned on a turntable {{at the end of}} a trip. Instead it was double ended, but the piston was manually transferred to the new leading end. The piston carriage itself had to be moved manually (or by horse power) to the leading end of the train. At Dartmouth Arms the station platform was an island between the two steam operated lines. Cubitt designed a special system of pointwork that enabled the atmospheric piston carriage to enter the ordinary track.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first car}} to be built; {{unpainted}} it was tested by J Chassagne the liaison {{officer for the}} project at Brooklands; this resulted in variety of modifications notably re-configuring of the <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> for the tail. It was shipped to the Isle of Man registered DA6436 and was tested again during practice for the 1922 Tourist Trophy and was found comparable to the 1922 3-litre Tourist Trophy Grand Prix Sunbeams. Later that year in Strasbourg, it was used by all three Team drivers for practice until its engine was ruined by fire before the race. Post-works, it was found fire damaged; works and modifications to engine and body ensued and private entries in speed events were made before the war. In 1941 the engine was removed and Riley engine and ENV gearbox used, a year later the body was replaced with a new full width two-seater body. Post war it passed through several hands {{and in the early}} 1970s it was rebuilt and rebodied with a 1922 Strasbourg style body as an authentic example. (See footnote below.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{solar array}} of a PV {{system can be}} mounted on rooftops, {{generally}} with a few inches gap and parallel {{to the surface of}} the roof. If the rooftop is horizontal, the array is mounted with each panel aligned at an angle. If the panels are planned to be mounted before the construction of the roof, the roof can be designed accordingly by installing support brackets for the panels before the materials for the roof are installed. The installation of the solar panels can be undertaken by the crew responsible for installing the roof. If the roof is already constructed, it is relatively easy to retrofit panels directly on top of existing roofing structures. For a small minority of roofs (often not built to code) that are designed so that it is capable of bearing only the weight of the roof, installing solar panels demands that the roof structure must be strengthened before-hand. In all cases of retrofits particular consideration to weather sealing is necessary There are many low-weight designs for PV systems that can be used on either sloped or flat roofs (e.g. plastic wedges or the PV-pod), most however, rely on a type of extruded aluminum rails (e.g. Unirac). Recently, tension-based PV racking solutions have been tested successfully that reduce weight and cost. [...] In some cases, converting to composition shingles, the weight of the removed roof materials can compensate the additional weight of the panels structure. The general practice for installation of roof-mounted solar panels include having a <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> per hundred watts of panels.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> with the timing chain cover. The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to {{the process}} feature of the coke dry {{quenching}} (CDQ), the factors of the destructive mechanism that influence the sequence function properties of the brick were analyzed. The countermeasures have been adopted for the defects of the bricks for CDQ, such as inferior thermal shock stability and short lifetime, etc. In order to search the effect of thermal expansion stress and mechanical load stress on the CDQ, the temperature field and stress field of the flue in the CDQ were analyzed according to the thermal elastic and plastic theory. The Drucker-Prager plasticity model combined with a tension cut-off criterion was described material behavior. All material properties were taken as temperature dependent. The result indicates that the <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> under high gradient temperature will bring on the highest thermal stress, which {{is the main reason}} of fracture of the <b>support</b> <b>bracket.</b> The cycling temperature has the ability to cause repeated crack propagation throughout the whole service period. To solve this problem, the design of the structure, the method of the heat exchange and the properties of the materials will be improved. The obtained results give a good insight into the reasons of material failure and help to find counter-measures for prolonging the lifetime of CDQ...|$|E
