50|$|In 1961, two {{withdrawn}} driving motors {{were converted}} to <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives.</b> These were numbered ESL118A and ESL118B, having previously been 2758 and 2749 respectively. After withdrawal, both units were preserved, eventually locating at the Spa Valley Railway but now moved to Quainton.|$|R
50|$|For {{the surface}} lines, two T Stock cars were {{converted}} into <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1961. They were permanently coupled together, and never ran independently. The de-icing equipment was fitted {{to the inner}} motor bogies, rather than being carried by separate bogies as on the tube-sized <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The cars were renumbered ESL118A and ESL118B, previously being 2758 and 2749 respectively. The locomotives {{were part of a}} leaf clearing experiment between 1978 and 1979, when they were marshalled into a train containing a brake van, a flat car, and Metropolitan electric locomotive Sarah Siddons. The flat car had two 2000 imp gal water tanks and a Merlin bus engine mounted on it, which was used to spray water at high pressure onto the running rails. L149, a ballast motor car, replaced the <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1979. In 1980, the flat truck was coupled between ESL118A and ESL118B to form a leaf cleaning train, and the high-pressure sprays were augmented by a mixture of sand and chromium or stainless steel granules, which was applied to the rails in a gel to improve adhesion. The metal granules ensured that the track signalling circuits continued to operate.After being withdrawn, both cars were preserved and are currently located at the Spa Valley Railway.|$|R
25|$|In 1925–28 {{the trains}} were reconstructed, {{replacing}} the gated ends with air-operated doors, allowing {{the number of}} guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock and {{the last of the}} original trains ran in service in 1939. Subsequently a number of motor cars were rebuilt as <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Central London Stock was {{retired from}} service, {{with the last}} run in regular service being on 10 June 1939, {{followed}} by a farewell special on 12 July 1939. Afterwards, 36 of the cars were rebuilt into 18 <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives,</b> numbered ESL100–ESL117, the driving ends of each car joined to make one double-ended vehicle. One of these trains {{can be found at}} the London Transport Museum Acton Depot.|$|R
50|$|As built, the <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{fitted with}} GE66 motors, which were prone to flash over. This was a {{particular}} problem when the motors were switched from series to parallel mode, {{and in order to}} mitigate this, the controllers were arranged so that the motors were permanently wired in series, and could not be switched to parallel mode. This limited the maximum speed, but they needed to run fairly slowly to ensure that the anti-freeze was adequately applied, {{and the fact that they}} did not need to stop at stations meant that they could be run between service trains on most lines without disrupting the timetable. In 1962, London Transport started to scrap the T stock cars from the Metropolitan line, and electro-pneumatic motor controllers were removed from them to be fitted into the <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives.</b> At the same time, the galvanised iron pipes which delivered the anti-freeze to the nozzles were replaced by plastic piping, which did not corrode and cause blockages, as the iron piping did. The traction motors could not be upgraded, however, due to the limited clearances in the bogies.|$|R
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel <b>locomotives,</b> electric <b>locomotives,</b> <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives,</b> pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sleet</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{redundant}} London Underground cars {{converted to}} help with the removal of ice that built up on the conductor rails. The main batch of eighteen tube-gauge locomotives were built between 1938 and 1941 from motor cars originally built in 1903. They were refurbished in the 1960s using equipment removed from redundant T-stock vehicles, and were joined by a pair of surface-gauge locomotives in 1961. In addition to de-icing duties, some of them were also used for experiments in clearing leaves from the running rails. They had all ceased to operate by 1985. One of the tube-gauge locomotives subsequently went to the London Transport Museum, and the surface-gauge cars went to the Spa Valley Railway.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive ESL103 was {{scrapped}} in 1954 as {{the result}} of collision damage sustained in 1948. It was deemed to be beyond economical repair. Gradually, de-icing gear was fitted to service trains, beginning with the A stock on the Metropolitan line, and the need for separate <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives</b> decreased. ESL100 and ESL112 were modified in 1972, so that they could be used to remove leaves from the running rails. Experiments were made to find a suitable fluid which would assist adhesion, but none was found. The two locomotives continued to be used for brushing leaves from the rails. All of the vehicles had ceased to be used by August 1985. ESL107 was the last to be withdrawn, and was preserved by the London Transport Museum.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the start}} of the 1935/40 Programme, which {{included}} large scale stock replacement, a number of motor cars from the Central London Railway became available, and forty cars, all built in 1903/4, were set aside for conversion into <b>sleet</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Each was built from a pair of motor cars; the front sections were cut off, {{to the rear of the}} front bogie, and were joined back to back to a new central section. The process began in 1938, and the first locomotive was ready for trial running on 22 December. It was 38 ft long, carried a single de-icing bogie under the centre of the car, and was numbered ESL100. There were teething problems with the design, as it was too short to bridge some of the gaps in the conductor rails, and so subsequent conversions were 50 ft long and included two de-icing bogies. By 1941, 18 locomotives had been built, and this number was deemed to be adequate.|$|R
