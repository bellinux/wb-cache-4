40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} {{performed in}} the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet during GIMEX- 90 / 91 show the regular occurrence of moderately strong barrier-winds. The barrier wind is a thermally generated jet that develops when the large-scale now advects warm tundra air towards the cold, melting ice sheet, creating a large local horizontal gradient of temperature. As a result, the geostrophic wind in the atmospheric boundary-layer acquires a component perpendicular to the temperature gradient. In the melting zone of the ice <b>sheet,</b> <b>barrier</b> winds interact with persistent surface-based katabatic winds. The forcing mechanisms and detailed two-dimensional structure of the barrier wind have been investigated with a mesoscale meteorological model. The model results confirm {{the important role of}} the warm tundra during the development of barrier winds. Barrier winds cause a pronounced rise in temperature and a strong increase of turbulent exchange in the lower melting zone: friction velocity and sensible-heat flux in the melting zone showed peak values of 1. 3 m s(- 1) and 300 W m(- 2) respectively. In combination with large positive net radiation, the daily melt rate increased to 10 cm water equivalent, which is twice the rate in typical katabatic wind conditions. This shows that barrier winds could {{have a significant impact on}} the melt regime of areas where the ice sheet ends in the tundra. Although barrier winds in this part of Greenland may occur less frequently than the observations during GIMEX- 90 suggest, they are of great importance for the climate of this and of other polar regions, such as the Antarctic, and so merit careful study...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillosis spores enter {{buildings}} during renovation or construction. Recent {{research shows}} a causal link between new construction in existing healthcare facilities and increased infection rates in at risk patients. Aspergillosis {{is a dangerous}} pathogen {{that can lead to}} death, especially in immune suppressed patients, who are most at risk. Not all patients have the same risk level of infection, but infection control is an important step in the construction process, as the Aspergillosis spores are transmitted on dust particles, {{to reduce the risk of}} fatal infections. Infection control barriers have been largely adopted for new hospital construction at an existing facility to reduce the incidence of infections caused by construction dust borne pathogens. Previous research on construction barriers at TAMU showed that a properly placed plastic <b>sheet</b> <b>barrier</b> stopped all particle movement for a pressure differential of 105 kiloPascals measured over twenty-four hours. It is not possible to maintain a sealed barrier during all construction, although this is the most effective means of stopping dust transmission intra-building, doors are often needed to access the construction site safely. This study extends the work on the sealed barrier to introduce a small door into the sealed barrier. The door area is five percent of the wall area. The purpose of the experiment is to study the rate of particle movement, size range of one to ten microns, through the barrier with a door present under a defined set of standard air flow conditions. The door will be opened and closed at different times during the experimental period. No dust could be observed to have moved through the doorway under the present study conditions. The results show that it is not a sufficient condition to assume that measuring air exchange rates is sufficient to determine the rate of dust movement; it appears to have an air surface velocity dependence that was not studied in this research. Future research is recommended to include the air velocity movement as a variable in the study...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that e-LBL for inorganic sheets is possible in a complex tricomponent film of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and Na+-montmorillonite (MTM). This system displayed clear e-LBL patterns in terms of both initial accumulation of materials and unusually thick individual bilayers later in the deposition process with film thicknesses reaching 200 µm for films composed of 200 pairs of layers. Successful incorporation of MTM layers was observed by scanning electron microscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis. Surprisingly, the growth rate was found to be nearly identical in films with and without clay layers, which suggests fast permeation/reptation of polyelectrolytes between the nanosheets during the “in-and-out ” diffusion of polymer. In considering these findings, e-LBL growth property is expected for a wide array of available inorganic nanoscale components and have a potential to greatly expand the e-LBL field and LBL field altogether.

40|$|In this study, the {{application}} of liquid polymer to form an intemal barrier to prevent the loss of moisture in concrete during curing and to improve the watertightness at the hardening stage was investigated. In normal practice, a barrier or seal type cure is achieved by applying external plastic sheets or spraying curing foam around {{the surface of a}} concrete structure. In some cases, this process may be difficult to perform properly, for example, concrete structures with large surface areas or with complicated shapes. Hence, liquid polymer (acrylic based) is introduced. However, the process is different from the extemal one.

30|$|A broad {{spectrum}} of potential triggering mechanisms of tsunamis exists throughout the Caribbean region. These include (i) earthquake-triggering tectonic movement (strike-slip motion, oblique convergence) along the boundary of the Caribbean and North American Plates (Grindlay et al., 2005) or the Venezuelan coast (Audemard et al., 2005); (ii) the Lesser Antilles subduction zone with earthquakes and various sources of explosive and effusive volcanism (e.g. Zahibo and Pelinovsky, 2001; Mattioli et al., 2007); (iii) morphological signatures of large-scale submarine mass failure, e.g. north of Puerto Rico (Grindlay et al., 2005; ten Brink et al., 2006) or on Curaçao (Hornbach et al., 2010); (iv) submarine debris avalanches along the Lesser Antilles arc (Deplus et al., 2001); (v) teletsunamis from the open Atlantic Ocean as triggered by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake (O’Loughlin and Lander, 2003) or by a future volcanic edifice collapse at the Canary Islands (Ward and Day, 2001).

The shallow morpho-stratigraphic sections (∼ 2 - 10 m depth) include 11 new TL and 14 C ages, and paleosol chronosequences, that differentiate cemented late Pleistocene dune deposits (20. 7 ± 2. 1 to 99. 8 ± 9. 4 ka) from uncemented Holocene dune deposits (0. 7 ± 0. 05 to at least 3. 2 ± 0. 3 ka). Large linear dune ridges (5 - 10 m in height) in the dune sheet interiors trend southeast and are generally of late Pleistocene age (∼ 70 - 20 ka). The late Pleistocene dune deposits reflect eolian transport of marine sand across the emerged continental shelf (30 - 50 km southeast distance) from low-stand paleo-shorelines (- 100 ± 25 m elevation), which were locally oriented nearly orthogonal to modeled deep-water wave directions (∼ 300 ° TN). During the Holocene marine transgression, onshore and alongshore wave transport delivered remobilized shelf-sand deposits to the nearshore areas of the large dune <b>sheets,</b> building extensive <b>barrier</b> islands and sand spits. Submerged back-barrier lagoons generally precluded marine sand supply to dune sheet interiors in middle to late Holocene time, though exceptions occur along some ocean and lagoon shorelines.

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{estimates}} that buildings account for 40 % {{of the global}} energy use. The IPCC believes substantial improvements to building efficiency can be implemented easily by improving building enclosures through increased levels of insulation, optimizing glazing areas and minimizing infiltration of outside air. Building enclosure design encompasses {{a wide range of}} parameters but the transport of heat, air and moisture through the enclosure is of primary importance. In predominantly cold Canadian climates, adequate thermal insulation, effective air barriers, and proper moisture control are crucial for energy savings and durability of the structure. For decades, standard construction practice in Canada dictated a polyethylene sheet behind the interior drywall layer to serve as a vapour barrier for assemblies with traditional fibre-based cavity insulation. If the polyethylene sheet was sealed carefully enough it had the added benefit of reducing air leakage. Unfortunately, vapour barriers place the emphasis on the wrong moisture transport mechanism; air leakage can have 10 times or greater the wetting potential than vapour diffusion. Regardless, code enforcement personnel continued (and continue in some areas) to require vapour barriers in all climates, all assemblies, and all occupancies. To do so, they overrule the provision in Part 5 of The National Building Code of Canada that states vapour barriers are not required if it can be shown that the uncontrolled vapour diffusion will not affect the operation of the building and systems, or {{the health and safety of}} the occupants. Foam plastic insulations perform better than fibre-based insulation in terms of the combined resistance to transmission of heat, air and vapour. This research investigated several types of open cell and closed cell spray polyurethane foam insulation in a variety of assembly configurations both in lab tests and hygrothermal simulations. The simulations were extrapolated to seven Canadian climate categories and three levels of interior relative humidity. The goal was to determine which spray polyurethane foam applications required the addition of a dedicated vapour barrier layer beyond what the foam itself could provide. The moisture content of the oriented strand board sheathing layer (OSB) in the tested and modelled assemblies was used as the performance evaluation point because during wintertime vapour drives, the wood sheathing is the most likely condensing surface. Prolonged high moisture content (greater than 20 %) in wood and wood products in wall assemblies leads to mould growth and decay. By this measure, if the wood sheathing moisture contents stay within the safe range (less than 19 %) a vapour barrier is not necessary. The results are presented in Table 7 - 4. The performance of assemblies containing closed cell spray foam was excellent for all climates and humidity levels. Their performance was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies incorporating a polyethylene <b>sheet</b> vapour <b>barrier.</b> The performance of assemblies with open cell spray foam was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies containing no vapour barrier. Open cell spray foam and fibreglass batt both require additional vapour control layers with all but the mildest Canadian climates with the lowest interior humidities. However, in those mild climates with low interior humidities, the only vapour control layer required was a medium permeance latex paint with primer. <br...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial tissues play an {{important}} physiological role. Tightly cohesive epithelial <b>sheets</b> form protective <b>barriers</b> that line organs, and in addition, fold into {{a wide variety of}} complex 3 D architectures with specialized functions. A key facet of tissue morphogenesis involves the aggregation of similar cells into cohesive groups. Here, we have analyzed the dynamics of aggregation using quantitative imaging techniques (Chapter II). We show that multicellular aggregation dynamics adhere to a transport-reaction model that is broadly appreciated for physicochemical systems. This model of aggregation dynamics differs from the classical equilibrium paradigm of cell aggregation based on differential adhesivity of cells to neighboring cells versus the underlying substratum. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for cell motility during developmental aggregation processes and provide design principles for promoting cell aggregation dynamics in contexts such as tissue engineering that are distinct from the currently accepted paradigm. Multicellular aggregation is reversible. In fact, the break-up of multicellular clusters (“cell scatter”) is not only important for developmental processes, but also contributes to metastasis. However, current molecular genetics studies of cell scatter are predominantly qualitative and do not provide a quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of molecular signals in inducing cell scatter. By developing and implementing an automated image processing algorithm, we quantify two aspects of cell scatter – the breakdown of cell-cell adhesions and the dispersion of detached cells – in mammary epithelial cells treated with different combinations of biochemical cues (Chapter III). We demonstrate that our metrics of cell scatter identify the effects of individual cues and detect synergies between them. We envision that this approach will be useful for mapping the relative potencies of regulators of cell scatter and may guide therapeutic strategies. Multicellular processes such as aggregation and scatter involve molecular-level changes within cell-cell adhesions. To complement imaging-based strategies at the cellular and multicellular levels, we developed a quantitative microtiter assay for examining the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins and associations between them (Chapter IV). Using two case studies related to cancer biology, we demonstrate that our assay provides a more detailed quantitative picture of molecular changes within epithelial adhesive structures, which can provide added insight into the regulation of morphogenetic events. ...|$|R

In {{this thesis}} {{corrosion}} inhibition performance of graphene and graphene oxide based composite/hybrid coatings was studied. Graphene is a two-dimensional one-atom-thick sheet of carbon having hexagonal lattice, {{and it is}} a basic structural unit of graphite. Graphene has proven {{to be one of the}} most popular advanced materials in recent developments. This carbon material is widely studied for advanced applications starting from energy harvesting to nanoelectronics and finishing with drug delivery because of many extraordinary properties of it. Among all of the properties the atom/ion barrier property was one of the most interesting for this work. Some studies to use graphene or graphene-based materials as a <b>barrier</b> <b>sheet</b> were published before starting this work and some appeared during the run of this investigation. Lately, the development of graphene and graphene oxide based functionalized biocompatible barrier coatings attracts a great attention among scientists and probably industrialists as well. But the use of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanoplatelets for corrosion protection of metal alloys was practically not studied before this work, despite the facts that the ideas of preparation the materials were known already decades, and as row material relatively cheap powder of natural graphite can be used. In this thesis the barrier properties of graphene/graphene oxide based nanostructured coatings, including composite and hybrid coatings were investigated towards corrosion protection. Investigations were carried through using different strategies: for the preparation of thin protective coatings spin-coating, electrochemical deposition and atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques were used. For the corrosion inhibition performance studies of synthesized graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide the hybrid coatings of graphene oxide-polypyrrole and the composite coatings of graphene-metal oxide laminates were prepared. The extent of protection ability of the coatings deposited onto AISI type 304 stainless steel and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy substrates was studied thoroughly by electrochemical methods, as open circuit potential and Tafel plots, voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry, and tested by standard ASTM G 48 A and long-time immersion tests in salt solutions. The studies revealed that prepared graphene and graphene oxide based hybrid and especially composite coatings well inhibit corrosion of the metal substrates. This definitely increases lifetime and stability of the metal details and equipment made from these materials, helping to preserve the materials and energy, thus helping to develop also a more sustainable society. ...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} neurological {{disease of the}} central nerve system that affects young adults with a higher prevalence in women (ratio 3 : 2). The neuropathology of the disease is characterised by demyelination of the white matter {{in the brain and}} central cord. MS may involve degeneration of white matter throughout the nervous system, with a predilection for specific target zones that includes the corpus callosum. The pathologic process may lead to motor problems, but halve of the patients has cognitive problems associated with MS. In this thesis, we focus on the cognitive problems and the relation with neuropathological brain damage. One of the brain areas preferentially involved in MS, is the corpus callosum. This brain structure is the largest white matter tract connecting both hemispheres. Research in callosotomy patients, acallosal patients and callosal section patients indicates that robust callosal damage may lead to interhemispheric transfer dysfunctions. In {{the first part of this}} thesis callosal problems in MS are explored. Damage to the corpus callosum in this patient group is subtler than in callosotomy patients. Moreover, the callosal damage strongly varies from patient to patient. In this thesis the redundancy gain paradigm, a behavioural measure to investigate interhemispheric communication is used. In this task, flashes of light are presented to the left, right or bilateral (left and right simultaneously) visual hemifield while the subject fixates to the middle of the screen. As soon as the subject detects a flash, he presses the response button with the left or right hand (detection task). An effect that is typically observed in healthy subjects is that reaction times to bilateral stimuli are faster than to unilateral stimuli. This effect is referred to as the redundancy gain effect. Previous research shows that the redundancy gain effect is enlarged in patients with callosal problems (acallosal patients or patients with callosal section). The results in this thesis show, in analogy with the results in patients with robust callosal damage, an enlarged redundancy gain effect for MS patients. These results demonstrate the sensitiveness of the redundancy gain paradigm to investigate callosal problems in MS. To explore the effect of the amount of callosal brain damage on the redundancy gain effect, the callosal damage needs to be quantified. For this purpose diffusion tensor imaging was used. With this technique, water diffusion in the white matter can be investigated. Water in the brain spreads preferentially along the direction of the axonal fibers. Intact myelin <b>sheets</b> are effective <b>barriers</b> for the water. Demyelination, an important pathological aspect of MS, leads to decreased delineation of the tracts along which the water spreads. This results in changed diffusion derived measures. Fractional anisotropy is an important diffusion derived measure for inter- and intravoxel fiber coherence. Previous research shows that fractional anisotropy is decreased in MS patients compared to healthy controls. To calculate the fractional anisotropy, diffusion measures along three directions are defined, more specific along the principal direction, along the direction of minimal diffusion and along a third Alternative Neuropsychological and MRI Measures in MS 89 Summary direction that is orthogonal to the previous two. With this information, the longitudinal and transverse diffusivity can be calculated. Longitudinal diffusivity is the diffusion eigenvalue along the principal direction, whereas the transverse diffusivity is the mean of the eigenvalues along the other two directions. Recent research shows that demyelination and axonal loss, specific for MS pathology, is characterised by increased transverse diffusivity. Hence, transverse diffusivity is a unique marker for MS. The results of this thesis confirm this and show that transverse diffusivity is significantly more increased than longitudinal diffusivity in MS patients compared to healthy matched controls. Thirdly, a correlation between the behavioural results, the redundancy gain effect, and the brain imaging measures, the diffusion derived measures, was found: the larger the transverse diffusivity, or in other words, the MS related callosal damage, the larger the redundancy gain effect in MS patients. Moreover, neither longitudinal diffusivity, nor callosal lesion load as defined on conventional T 2 images were additional factors in explaining this correlation. The results of the first part of this thesis show a) that the redundancy gain paradigm is a sensitive measure to investigate callosal brain damage in MS, b) that diffusion derived parameters are subtle measures to indicate MS related brain damage and c) that a significant correlation between callosal brain damage and the redundancy gain effect could be found in MS patients. In the second part of this thesis the focus was on the relation between cerebral brain damage as defined by diffusion derived measures and information processing speed in MS. Information processing speed is a cognitive measure tested by the Paced Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), two commonly used neuropsychological tests in MS. A significant correlation between the performance on the SDMT and transverse diffusivity in the whole brain was found in MS patients, indicating that demyelination and axonal damage, characteristic for MS pathology, are important factors for explaining the slowed information processing speed in MS. No correlation was found with the performance on the PASAT, which can be explained by the weaker psychometric qualities of the PASAT compared to the SDMT. First of all, the results of this thesis corroborate the heterogeneous pathological condition in MS. Research on callosal problems in MS can not be done without considering these individual differences. Based on our results, diffusion weighted imaging seems to offer a promising technique to determine cerebral damage in MS. Transverse diffusivity, considered to be a unique benchmark of white matter demyelination as seen in MS, is of special interest. Moreover, this diffusion derived measures correlate with cognitive (dys) function in MS, a correlation not consistently found for conventional imaging (lesion load on T 2 of T 1 images) ...|$|R
