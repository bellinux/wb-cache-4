50|$|Svagdricka, {{literally}} weak {{drink in}} Swedish, {{is a form}} of sweet, dark, low-alcohol (less than 2.25% ABV) malt beverage or small ale. In the early 20th century, there were local producers of svagdricka all over Sweden, but in recent decades its popularity has dwindled. It is top fermented, unpasteurized and resembles Russian kvass. It is one of the two old Swedish brews that has survived into modern times, the other one being gotlandsdricka. There are only a few manufacturers left and their production volumes display great <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> with peaks around Christmas and Easter when it is consumed with traditional Swedish food.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of prey species {{is often the}} determining factor for whether populations hunt cooperatively. When prey is abundant throughout a habitat, cooperative hunting is not an effective strategy. Solitary hunters can easily find food {{on their own and}} do not share their kill. This case arises when prey is small enough to be captured by an individual. In contrast, when patches of prey are focused in small areas of a habitat, predators are likely to live in groups to coordinate large attacks and kill more prey. This strategy illustrates the importance of group living in establishing cooperative hunting efforts. In this respect, cooperative hunting is not just a function of the species, but also of its environment. Consequentially, cooperative hunting most likely evolved in areas with scarce prey distribution, and patterns of this behavior are likely to vary with <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of available resources.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in the empirical behavior of inventories. A great deal of this research examines some variant of the production smoothing model of finished goods inventories. The overall assessment of this model that exists in the literature is quite negative: {{there is little evidence that}} manufacturers hold inventories of finished goods in order to smooth production patterns. This paper examines whether this negative assessment of the model is due to one or both of two features: costs shocks and <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> The reason for considering costs shocks is that if firms are buffetted more by cost shocks than demand shocks, production should optimally be more variable than sales. The reasons for considering <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are that <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> account for a major portion of the variance in production and sales, that <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are precisely the kinds of fluctuations that producers should most easily smooth and that seasonally adjusted data is likely to produce spurious rejections of the production smoothing model even when it is correct...|$|R

The results in this paper show that when the <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in consumption purchases are included in an analysis of the Life Cycle-Permanent Income model there is no evidence in the aggregate data against the model. The estimates of the parameters of agents' utility functions obtained here are plausible, and the data do not reject the overidentifying restrictions on the model. ...|$|R

It underwent a decline rate in GDP of -1.9%, somewhat higher than the Spanish percentage, -1.2%.

50|$|In {{the coastal}} regions of Bangladesh, {{which make up}} 32% {{of the land in}} the country, there are {{problems}} of salinity due to high tides and reduced flow in rivers during the dry season. There is already a natural <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of rising levels of salt water. During the dry season, a salt water front rises 240 km. This affects the salinity of the groundwater in the countryside. This effect is predicted to be more severe in the future because of climate change, because of rising sea levels. As a result, sea water will leak further into freshwater zones, which will have a broad reaching effect on the flora and fauna of the region that depends on the presence of fresh water. For example, if the sea level rises 88 cm, the water 40 km inland will be contaminated with a 5 ppt saline front. This would specifically affect the only freshwater region of the Tetulia River, the Meghna Estuary. The salinity level in the Meghna Estuary, the largest estuarine system in Bangladesh, may become too high to sustain agriculture and pisciculture. It could also lead to the extinction of some of the endangered species of the Estuary.|$|E

Huddling as an energy conserving mechanism is not as efficient as torpor. Before entering torpor, a sugar glider will reduce activity and body temperature normally in order to lower energy expenditure and avoid torpor. With energetic constraints, the sugar glider will enter into daily torpor for 2-23 hours while in rest phase. Torpor differs from hibernation in that torpor is usually a short-term daily cycle, which saves energy for the animal by allowing its body temperature to fall to a minimum of [...] to [...] When food is scarce, as in winter, heat production is lowered {{in order to reduce}} energy expenditure. With low energy and heat production, {{it is important for the}} sugar glider to peak its body mass by fat content in the autumn (May/June) in order to survive the following cold season. In the wild, sugar gliders enter into daily torpor more often than sugar gliders in captivity. The use of torpor is most frequent during winter, likely in response to low ambient temperature, rainfall, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in food sources.|$|E
