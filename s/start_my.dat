500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to <b>start</b> <b>my</b> portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, {{which is one of the}} reasons I wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E

[...] In [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin", Jackson's vocal range spans from G#3 to E5. Played in the key of E Major, the song is moderately bright with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. It has a basic sequence of D/E–E–D/E–E as its chord progression. The [...] {{at the end of the}} song, which comes directly from Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango's 1972 disco song [...] "Soul Makossa", is [...] "Mama-say mama-sah ma-ma-coo-sah". Makossa is a Cameroonian music genre and dance. Dibango sued Jackson and settled out of court for one million French francs, agreeing thereby to waive future rights to this recording but not future use of the material.|$|E
500|$|On xx, Croft and Sim {{touched on}} themes of love, desire, and loss in their songwriting, which Croft said has [...] "always been based around emotions, {{right from the}} <b>start.</b> <b>My</b> {{favourite}} songs are usually quite sad and I think heartbreak is something {{that so many people}} can connect with." [...] Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran [...] "a bit higher". Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and [...] "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on [...] "VCR", the yearning expressed on [...] "Heart Skipped a Beat", and the premature affection warned of on [...] "Crystalised". Petra Davis from The Quietus argued that the thematic crux of xx was in the succession of songs from [...] "Islands" [...] to [...] "Shelter", each of which saw [...] "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story." ...|$|E

2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store. She became inspired by how the duo self-financed and released their recordings, and bought herself out of her recording contract with Jive Records.

When he determined that his partner would not share the authority over the company, Tatangelo sold his part of the business.|$|E
