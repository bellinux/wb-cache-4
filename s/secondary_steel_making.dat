40|$|Gas {{stirring}} {{is commonly}} applied in <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> and {{the objectives of}} stirring is to enhance heat and mass transfer inside the ladle to achieve homogenization of temperature and composition, facilitate slag-metal interactions, and accelerate the removal of inclusions in the steel, however, {{it is difficult to}} monitor the stirring effect using just the gas line pressure and the volume flow rate due to leakages between the connectors and hook-ups. An intermittent view of the top disturbed surface has to be applied to monitor the stirring conditions during the actual operations, in which, the subjective judgement of the operator is required to control the stirring process. Acoustic technology and vibration analysis to monitor and control steelmaking process have found increasing application in recent years. It has been found that the sound emitted during certain metallurgical operations reflects the corresponding operating conditions and thus the acoustic response may be used to monitor and control the process. Vibration detectors have been used to determine the degree of stirring in a ladle in industry. Stelco and Nupro Corporation have used vibration sensors on the wall of ladles as a basis for ladle control systems and positive results have been reported by using vibration analysis to control gas flow into the ladle. However, no investigation has been reported that combined all the signals simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, the {{correlation}} between ladle glaze and non-metallic inclusions in the ladle treatment was studied. A number of industrial trials with full scale ladle and laboratory works were performed to investigate the inclusions in the ladle treatment. BaO was used as tracer in the ladle slag to investigate the effect of slag on inclusion composition {{and the formation of}} non-metallic inclusions by ladle glaze. BaO was detected in the inclusions of all followed heats. This observation showed strong evidence for the generation of non-metallic inclusions by the ladle glaze. The increase of the fractions of BaO containing inclusions and their average content of BaO in the first heat with tracer suggested that the effect of slag on the composition of inclusions was a very slow process. The detachment of ladle glaze and the chemical transformations of oxide solution in the MgO matrix were investigated. The experimental results evidently showed that the ladle glaze could be the source of inclusions continually during the ladle treatment. Samples of liquid oxide solution to simulate the liquid oxide inclusions carried over from EAF were equilibrated with molten steel under controlled atmosphere. The results along with thermodynamic calculation suggested that the SiO 2 content of inclusions from EAF could be considerably reduced by dissolved aluminium in the steel. This would explain the vanishing of inclusions containing high SiO 2 content after deoxidation. Due to the lack of experimental data, the viscosities of slags in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were measured using the rotating cylinder method in the temperature range of 1720 to 1910 K. Eight different slag compositions related to the <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> operations were selected. Viscosities in this system and its sub-systems were expressed as a function of temperature and composition based on the viscosity model developed earlier at KTH. The activities of oxide components in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 systems at 1873 K were measured by equilibrating liquid slag and metal. Either silicon or copper was used as the metal phase and the oxygen partial pressure was controlled with different mixing rates of Ar and CO gas flow in equilibrium with graphite. Iso-activity lines were drawn from the measured activity values in the isothermal section of the slag systems. Nine series of industrial trials were carried out using the same ladle in each series to examine the effect of ladle slag on the number of non-metallic inclusions in the next heat. It was found that the number of inclusions increased with SiO 2 content of the ladle slag in the previous heat. No clear trends were found for the effects of viscosity and MgO activity of the previous slag on the number of inclusions. Theoretical analysis based on the experimental results suggested that the formation of 2 CaO∙SiO 2 followed but the dusting of the compound made the refractory more porous, which was reasonable for the number of non-metallic inclusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on how Indian Railways can service the steel sector better. The steel sector is a core sector, with {{railways}} playing a critical role in its logistics. The paper examines the changing industry structure and brings to light the increased need for transportation, as compared to normal planning processes. Traditionally, crude and finished <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> was done in the same location by big producers having integrated plants. Now the industry has a large number of producers who primarily focus on crude <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> or finished <b>steel</b> <b>making,</b> necessitating the need for transporting crude steel to the finished steel makers.

40|$|Adoption of {{efficient}} end-use technologies {{is one of}} the {{key measures}} for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the working of energy programs and policies on carbon regulation, how to effectively analyze and manage the costs associated with GHG reductions become extremely important for the industry and policy makers around the world. Energy-climate (EC) models are often used for analyzing the costs of reducing GHG emissions (e. g., carbon emission) for various emission-reduction measures, because an accurate estimation of these costs is critical for identifying and choosing optimal emission reduction measures, and for developing related policy options to accelerate market adoption and technology implementation. However, accuracies of assessing of GHG-emission reduction costs by taking into account the adoption of energy efficiency technologies will depend on how well these end-use technologies are represented in integrated assessment models (IAM) and other energy-climate models. In this report, we first conduct brief overview on different representations of end-use technologies (mitigation measures) in various energy-climate models, followed by problem statements, and a description of the basic concepts of quantifying the cost of conserved energy including integrating non-regrets options. A non-regrets option is defined as a GHG reduction option that is cost effective, without considering their additional benefits related to reducing GHG emissions. Based upon these, we develop information on costs of mitigation measures and technological change. These serve as the basis for collating the data on energy savings and costs for their future use in integrated assessment models. In addition to descriptions of the iron and steel making processes, and the mitigation measures identified in this study, the report includes tabulated databases on costs of measure implementation, energy savings, carbon-emission reduction, and lifetimes. The cost curve data on mitigation measures are available over time, which allows an estimation of technological change over a decade-long historical period. In particular, the report will describe new treatment of technological change in energy-climate modeling for this industry sector, i. e., assessing the changes in costs and energy-savings potentials via comparing 1994 and 2002 conservation supply curves. In this study, we compared the same set of mitigation measures for both 1994 and 2002 [...] no additional mitigation measure for year 2002 was included due to unavailability of such data. Therefore, the estimated potentials in total energy savings and carbon reduction would most likely be more conservative for year 2002 in this study. Based upon the cost curves, the rate of change in the savings potential at a given cost can be evaluated and be used to estimate future rates of change that can be the input for energy-climate models. Through characterizing energy-efficiency technology costs and improvement potentials, we have developed and presented energy cost curves for energy efficiency measures applicable to the U. S. iron and steel industry for the years 1994 and 2002. The cost curves can change significantly under various scenarios: the baseline year, discount rate, energy intensity, production, industry structure (e. g., integrated versus <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> and number of plants), efficiency (or mitigation) measures, share of iron and steel production to which the individual measures can be applied, and inclusion of other non-energy benefits. Inclusion of other non-energy benefits from implementing mitigation measures can reduce the costs of conserved energy significantly. In addition, costs of conserved energy (CCE) for individual mitigation measures increase with the increases in discount rates, resulting in a general increase in total cost of mitigation measures for implementation and operation with a higher discount rate. In 1994, integrated steel mills in the U. S. produced 55...|$|E

40|$|Support {{structures}} for offshore wind turbines {{play a significant}} part {{in the cost of}} offshore wind energy. With current access systems a conventional boat landing is not necessary. <b>Secondary</b> <b>steel,</b> such as a boat landing and J-tube, influences wave loads. A way of taking the <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> items into account in the wave load calculation is through modifying the hydrodynamic coefficients. Wave loads are calculated using four design standards and the design of the monopiles of the Prinses Amalia Wind Farm. The wave loads results with and without <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> items can be used for a buckling check at the mudline for the specific case. This gives insight in the influence of the <b>secondary</b> <b>steel</b> items on wave load and wall thickness. Determining the drag coefficient using different standards will result in differences of the drag coefficient between 18 % and 22 %.
