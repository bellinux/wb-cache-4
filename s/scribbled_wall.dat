50|$|In 2005 LeWitt began {{a series}} of ‘scribble’ wall drawings, so termed because they {{required}} the draftsmen to fill in areas of the <b>wall</b> by <b>scribbling</b> with graphite. The scribbling occurs at six different densities, which are indicated on the artist’s diagrams and then mapped out in string {{on the surface of the}} wall. The gradations of scribble density produce a continuum of tone that implies three dimensions. The largest <b>scribble</b> <b>wall</b> drawing, Wall Drawing #1268, is on view at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery.|$|R

It was an absurd and obscene kind of impaling reserved {{for people who}} were made to be laughed at--for slaves and provincials, for dentists and small tradesmen, as you would say. I have seen the grotesque gallows-shape, which the little Roman gutter-boys <b>scribbled</b> on <b>walls</b> as a vulgar joke, blazing on the pinnacles of the temples of the world.

After being humiliated in {{the police}} force, and saving Tetsu from the yakuza, the two decides to get revenge on society by {{starting}} a revenge-for-hire operation. By <b>scribbling</b> on bathroom <b>walls</b> to advertise their business, Shingo and Tetsu offer their services to anyone with a problem.

Sharada, a conservative woman, insists that Anand must marry her {{if he wants}} to have his way with her. The romance proceeds, and appears to be Anand's salvation before things begin to collapse for him. On his marriage day, Sharada stumbles upon a diary containing details of his deranged life along with names of the girls he had killed <b>scribbled</b> on the <b>walls</b> of one of the rooms in his large house.|$|R
50|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song appear <b>scribbled</b> along the <b>walls</b> in the dark rooms. Even though the song {{features}} heavy distorted electric guitars, Brad Delson plays acoustic guitar and Phoenix plays acoustic bass in the video. The effects and imagery of the music video bring to the audience a sense of irritation and certain paranoia, {{which is what the}} song is about. At some point {{in the middle of the}} video, around 2:03, a strange blue figure runs past the band. Also note that at the end after the screen flashes black once, the band is gone, but their instruments are left where the band members were.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{the actual}} {{handwriting}} on the note has been apparently discredited. Most handwriting experts, both attached to the Chicago police and independent {{at the time of}} the original investigation, believed that Heirens had no connections to either the note or the <b>wall</b> <b>scribble.</b> Charles Wilson, who was head of the Chicago Crime Detection Laboratory, declared Heirens's known handwriting exemplars obtained from Heirens's handwritten notes from college agreed with the Police Department experts who could not find any connection between Heirens the note and the wall message. Independent handwriting expert George W. Schwartz was brought in to give his opinion. He stated flatly that [...] "The individual characteristics in the two writings do not compare in any respect." ...|$|R

Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's <b>scribbles</b> on the <b>walls</b> and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.|$|R
5000|$|Çelebicihan was {{not only}} the first {{president}} of the independent Crimean People's Republic and Mufti of Crimea, Lithuania and Poland he was also a poet and writer. In addition to his aforementioned works, his poems such as Ant Etkenmen (I've Pledged), Bastırıq (Prison), Ay gidi... (Oh for...), Savlıqman Qal Tatarlıq! (Farewell Tatarness!), Yolcu Ğarip (Poor Traveler), and Tilkiden Selâm (Greetings from the Fox) are his most popular poems. Ant Etkenmen became the lyrics of the Crimean Tatar national anthem, and according to Şevki Bektöre (another Crimean Tatar poet), [...] "... was sung for the first time during the historic Qurultay (1917)...." [...] His most memorable poem, however, is Savlıqman Qal Tatarlıq!, which he <b>scribbled</b> on the <b>walls</b> of Simferopol train station on his way to report to military service during World War I.|$|R
40|$|Graffiti is art, {{graffiti}} is crime, graffiti is beautiful, graffiti is ugly, graffiti is political, graffiti is style, graffiti is an ASBO, graffiti is Banksy. Regardless {{of where}} you sit in any debate {{on the value of}} graffiti, there is always one indelible truth: it exists. And to exist it must exist somewhere. It is in the study of this ‘where’ that we hope to learn something about the essence of these <b>scribbles</b> on <b>walls.</b> We ask: why is graffiti in this place and not in that place? We do this by taking a GIS approach to the question, in which we collect graffiti, digitise graffiti, analyse graffiti and visualise graffiti. We find that the physical factors which define the location of graffiti in the city centre are, for the most part, limited to perfunctory city constructs such as crossing guards, phone boxes and electricity boxes but that every now and again, city features come together {{in such a way as}} to create the opportunity for clusters of graffiti to exist. However, it is necessary that we not only locate graffiti in space, we also need to locate it within the motivations of the subculture to which it belongs. In the end we find graffiti to be a duel construct, made up of the desires of a global subculture and how the city allows these desires to be made manifest...|$|R

5000|$|In a February 2017 article {{published}} by GameNora, Scottish Games Reviewer Lauren Aitken scores All the Delicate Duplicates as 8 out of 10 and favorably compares {{the game with}} the television shows Stranger Things and The Twilight Zone, as well as stating: [...] "The game toys with your interpretation and perception…it doesn’t tell you where to go or present you with objectives; nor does it over-explain what is going on. It is down to you as an individual {{how much of the}} world you want to interact with, given that there a plethora of emails, text messages and random <b>scribbles</b> on the <b>walls</b> to read. If you interact with every single object, your understanding of the game obviously increases, such as the ever-increasing number of multi-universe and quantum physics-related books that appear as time progresses.  The developers ultimately rely on the player invested enough to read everything and explore each timeline fully. The result is a mind-boggling story told through a loose, non-linear narrative that challenges your perceptions and understanding of the game almost room-to-room.” ...|$|R
50|$|The journey progresses, Sue and Dixie {{discussing}} their new {{house and the}} baby. They move through grim motorways for a long time, and they then branch off into a bleak town, full of ugly square buildings, torn down posters and <b>scribbled</b> over <b>walls.</b> Sue is disgusted {{by the appearance of}} the town, believing they are only passing through, although she does not see Bruce's grim expression. The girls, horrified, pay attention, looking around, especially Dixie, who is frightened. Sue remains oblivious, talking to Bruce and even to the baby. Bruce pulls up at a grim house, which is revealed to be theirs, on Mercury Street, number 30. The house is frightening and rundown, and is even more worse than their previous home on the Bletchworth Estate. Sue, horrified, panics, claiming their real house is different, that the girl who discussed moving houses with her down at the council showed her lovely photos of their real house, with a prettily painted house and flowers in the garden. Martine, disgusted by her mother's ignorance and stupidity, alerts her {{to the fact that the}} girl down at the council obviously showed her pictures of the house years ago, when it was brand new. She has a go at Sue, although Jude tells her to shut up. Sue, refusing to admit her huge mistake, goes through the house, which is equally filthy and unkempt. She phones the Housing Department, and desperately pleads her case to them, but they ignore her. Sue, giving in and angry, cries on the floor. Bruce, anxious to get back to his house, tries to get her and the girls to help, but they refuse, all except Dixie. As Sue pulls herself together and they start to clean up, Dixie goes over the wall at the back of the garden and into the garden of one of the rich, prettily painted houses, and makes friends with a little girl called Mary.|$|R
5000|$|Augusta had an {{acknowledged}} {{political influence}} upon her son, who [...] "strove {{to follow the}} counsels she gave", and in which he trusted. Reportedly, she was in turn influenced by Lord Bute, who was appointed prime minister with her support in 1762. His appointment caused a serious crisis and exposed both Augusta and Bute of such public hostility that Bute had to resign from his post the following year. Thackeray described the public sentiments and the circulating rumours: [...] "Bute was hated with a rage {{there have been few}} examples in English history. He was the butt for everybody's abuse; for Wilkes, for Churchill's slashing satire, for the hooting of the mob who roasted his booth, his emblem, in a thousand bonfires; that hated him because he was a favourite and a Scotsman, calling him Mortimer, Lothario, and I known not what names, and accusing his royal mistress of all kinds of names - the grave, lean, demure, elderly woman, who, I dare say, was quite as good as her neighbours. Chatham lent the aide of his great malice to influence the popular sentiment against her. He assailed, in the House of Lords, 'The secret influence, more mighty than the throne itself, which betrayed and dogged every administration'. The most furious pamphlets echoed the cry 'Impeach the King's mother', was <b>scribbled</b> over every <b>wall</b> at the Court end of the town".|$|R
60|$|Whither go they next? A perverse destiny {{seems to}} perplex them with {{one after another}} of the riddles which mankind put forth to the {{wandering}} universe, and left unsolved in their own destruction. They enter an edifice of stern gray stone standing insulated {{in the midst of}} others, and gloomy even in the sunshine, which it barely suffers to penetrate through its iron grated windows. It is a prison. The jailer has left his post at the summons of a stronger authority than the sheriff's. But the prisoners? Did the messenger of fate, when he shook open all the doors, respect the magistrate's warrant and the judge's sentence, and leave the inmates of the dungeons to be delivered by due course of earthly law? No; a new trial has been granted in a higher court, which may set judge, jury, and prisoner at its bar all in a row, and perhaps find one no less guilty than another. The jail, like the whole earth, is now a solitude, and has thereby lost something of its dismal gloom. But here are the narrow cells, like tombs, only drearier and deadlier, because in these the immortal spirit was buried with the body. Inscriptions appear on the <b>walls,</b> <b>scribbled</b> with a pencil or scratched with a rusty nail; brief words of agony, perhaps, or guilt's desperate defiance to the world, or merely a record of a date by which the writer strove {{to keep up with the}} march of life. There is not a living eye that could now decipher these memorials.|$|R
6000|$|Undoubtedly {{the event}} of the day, {{whatever}} it may be, is apt to become unduly prominent, and to thrust itself obscuringly {{between us and the}} perhaps more important event of yesterday, where the public appetite demands fresh gossip rather than real news, and the press accordingly keeps its spies everywhere on the lookout for trifles that become important by being later than the last. And yet this minuteness of triviality has its value also. Our sensitive sheet gives us every morning the photograph of yesterday, and enables us to detect and to study at leisure that fleeting expression of the time which betrays its character, and which might altogether escape us in the idealized historical portrait. We cannot estimate the value of the items in our daily newspaper, because the world to which they relate is too familiar and prosaic; but a hundred years hence some Thackeray will find them full of picturesque life and spirit. The [...] "Chronicle" [...] of the Annual Register makes the England of the last century more vividly real to us than any history. The jests which Pompeian idlers <b>scribbled</b> on the <b>walls,</b> while Vesuvius was brooding its fiery conspiracy under their feet, bring the scene nearer home to us than the letter of Pliny, and deepen the tragedy by their trifling contrast, like the grave-diggers' unseemly gabble in Hamlet. Perhaps our judgment of history is made sounder, and our view of it more lifelike, when we are so constantly reminded how the little things of life assert their place alongside the great ones, and how healthy the constitution of the race is, how sound its digestion, how gay its humor, that can take the world so easily while our continent is racked with fever and struggling for life against the doctors.|$|R
6000|$|George III and his queen {{lived in}} a very unpretending but elegant-looking house, {{on the site of}} the hideous pile under which his granddaughter at present reposes. The king’s mother {{inhabited}} Carlton House, which contemporary prints represent with a perfect paradise of a garden, with trim lawns, green arcades, and vistas of classic statues. She admired these in company with my Lord Bute, who had a fine classic taste, and sometimes counsel took and sometimes tea in the pleasant green arbours along with that polite nobleman. Bute was hated with a rage of which there have been few examples in English history. He was the butt for everybody’s abuse; for Wilkes’s devilish mischief; for Churchill’s slashing satire; for the hooting of the mob that roasted the boot, his emblem, in a thousand bonfires; that hated him because he was a favourite and a Scotchman, calling him “Mortimer”, “Lothario”, I know not what names, and accusing his royal mistress of all sorts of crimes—the grave, lean, demure, elderly woman, who, I dare say, was quite as good as her neighbours. Chatham lent the aid of his great malice to influence the popular sentiment against her. He assailed, in the House of Lords, “the secret influence, more mighty than the Throne itself, which betrayed and clogged every administration.” The most furious pamphlets echoed the cry. “Impeach the king’s mother,” was <b>scribbled</b> over every <b>wall</b> at the Court end of the town, Walpole tells us. What had she done? What had Frederick, Prince of Wales, George’s father, done, that he was so loathed by George II and never mentioned by George III? Let us not seek for stones to batter that forgotten grave, but acquiesce in the contemporary epitaph over him:— ...|$|R
