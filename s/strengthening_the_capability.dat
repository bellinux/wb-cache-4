40|$|The middle {{mountain}} region of Nepal, which occupies some 30 % {{of the total}} land, is the homeland of 45 % of the total population, with agriculture being {{the main source of}} their livelihoods.

40|$|Most of the {{software}} companies can neither be typical software product based company like Microsoft nor afford to develop each customized application for individual customer from clean slate without taking into consideration of reuse. Software companies are under increasing competitive pressure for improving delivery parameters such as cost, quality, and time. Systematic reuse is an opportunity of continued cost reduction, quality improvement and lead time reduction in software delivery. Systematic reuse largely depends on the scope of delivering customized software applications in the same market segment repeatedly to multiple customers. Thorough market analysis provides basic inputs for defining generic product concept for delivering mass customized solutions. The problem of establishing a successful new business around a generic software product concept is not challenging because of shortage of ideas, but rather problems exist in proper analysis {{of the market and}}   adoption of   reuse capability for continued price reduction and quality improvement to deal with evolving market forces for delivering mass customized solutions. This paper, therefore, suggests the application of market positioning strategy to benefit from software reuse for delivering customized software solutions. In this paper, economics of software reuse has been integrated with market positioning for delivering customized software solution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to provide {{assistance}} in <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> of the Economic Analysis and Planning Unit (EAPU), Department of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries (DAFF) Having ascertained the need for efficient planning to increase agricultural production as a means of raising economic growth and improving standards of living, the Government has determined that little or no progress can be made toward these goals without major organizational and planning changes beginning in the EAPU and extended throughout DAFF at the earliest possible time. The project was organized and carried out under FAO auspices over a twelve-month period starting in October 1990, with DAFF designated to assure execution in a timely mannerBased on early project findings that EAPU required strengthening for fulfilling its assumed responsibilities, it was determined that four distinct sections should be established with additional positions to be created and filled to meet staffing requirements arising from the new organizational structure and assigned duties. Not the least of the tasks to be accomplished was preparation of the agriculture section of the country's Seventh Development Plan (DP 7), which called for important sectoral adjustment and specific plans to market new products deemed necessary for improving the country's export performance in relation to the balance of trade. Much of the latter ground was covered in an Agricultural Marketing Study, carried out by the FAO consultant and submitted to DAFF in September 1991 As a means of building an efficient system for monitoring and evaluating DAFF's various development programmes and projects, the project created a computer based information and data retrieval plan which, when fully operative, will afford a major source of data for planning purposes. The data base for Gross Margin Analysis to determine the potential contribution of various crops and products, old and new, to farm earnings was identified as another source of information for planning purposes. Further, to disseminate information on agricultural data required for DAFF planning activities, an FAO consultant organized a workshop from which emerged various conclusions as to the essential elements of DAFF's future studies and planning activitiesIn conclusion, the project achieved its aim of <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> of EAPU both in performing its various assigned duties and, specifically, in preparing the agriculture sector component of the Seventh Development Plan. It has also succeeded in involving all technical divisions of DAFF in sector analysis and development planning, applying models for policy analysis, formulating project proposals, and establishing a project monitoring and evaluation system in DAFF. While EAPU was not reorganized during the project, very specific recommendations were made concerning staffing changes to be implemented and programmes to be installed for further training of technical staff members. Once this has been accomplished, EAPU would be able to create supply-demand and other models deemed indispensable for determining the merits of various alternative policy objectives. EAPU should also use its better trained and more complete staff to set up an agricultural data base in DAFF. This project, which deserves priority attention because of the demand for agricultural data in the country, should attract significant financial participation from the numerous international organizations looking for such dataIn January of this year, the project was extended to provide a month of training in Thailand for an officer of the EAPU, and to supply two computers to replace those destroyed by cyclone Val in December 199...|$|E

40|$|His Majesty's Government (HMG) {{began its}} Community Forestry Development Project (CFDP) - Phase 1 in 1980 with the {{objective}} of establishing an institutional base for the long-term expansion of community forestry in Nepal. During {{the first phase of the}} CFDP, UNDP/FAO provided technical assistance to the activities funded under an IDA credit through project NEP/ 80 / 030. The experience of the first phase helped identify the organizational, legal, technical and economic constraints to the further expansion and development of community forestry. In April 1989 HMG approved the Master Plan for the Forestry Sector, which consists of twelve programmes including the Community and Private Forestry Programme. Under NEP/ 85 / 017, Community Forestry Development Project - Phase 2, UNDP/FAO provided technical assistance at the "programme level", assisting the Department of Forests (DOF) in implementing the Community and Private Forestry Programme throughout Nepal. The project built on experience gained during the first phase of the project in order to promote user group forestry and private tree farming. The project assisted in 1) the formulation of policy, legislative, and procedural frameworks; and 2) <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> of the DOF at the national, regional and district levels to encourage community based forest management. In particular, the project supported the newly formed Community Forestry Development Division (CFDD) of the DOF in its regular management of the Programme. The project assisted both with in-house activities of the CFDD and in coordinating activities of the Programme within DOF and with other organizations active in the forestry sector in Nepal. Project management concluded that although the Master Plan named CFDD the implementing agency for the Programme, the Division is not yet mature enough to carry out this major task. The Division lacks sufficient professional staff and is subject to frequent staff changes. In order to encourage user group forestry, the project fielded a Silviculturist expert who provided advice and training at central, regional and district levels. The project revealed that informal forest management arrangements are widespread and offer a foundation on which formally recognized systems can be built. To attempt to form a user group that ignores the presence of a local system would be counter productive. Those District Forest Officers (DFOs) that have begun to work with these informal groups find them enthusiastic and demanding of recognition. One of the main activities of the Programme is training, and NEP/ 85 / 017 extended training activities from the hill districts of Nepal to all 75 districts of the country. An important initiative of the project was the training of DFO staff that then trained user group members. With this activity the project began working toward the "training of trainers"; this work should be continued. The project noted that DOF staff lacked experience in natural forest management, and recommended that the successor project provide training to develop this and other technical skills among DOF staff. The project assisted in various ways in finalizing the Forestry Act which has since been passed by Parliament. Its operationalization is of immediate importance, as is also the formulation of enabling rules and regulations under the Act. The authority of the CFDD as the Programme implementor should be clarified, and the Division should be provided the necessary resources to assume its responsibility. The project also assisted in finalising the Operational Guidelines (since approved). Its implementation too is a matter of priority. In addition, policies and strategies for forestry development in the terai region require clarification by HMG Nepal. The project identified several constraints to the implementation of the Programme. The project recommended that field staff, in particular, the DFOs, remain at least three years at each duty station. Currently the staff is transferred too frequently, which interferes with the development of a working rapport with the user groups. To facilitate Programme implementation, the project recommended that resources, both financial and equipment, be supplied in a timely manner. Finally, the project urged that a successor project be formulated and implemented without delay, noting that momentum gained in Programme management will be lost if additional support to the CFDD is not forthcoming within a short time. The project recommended that, among other topics, grassroots level activities and agroforestry activities should be assisted in the successor project...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{valuable}} research is carried out in National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) in developing countries, but too little reaches {{the people who can}} use it, such as other scientists who need to build on advances and innovations, extension and development workers who need to turn this knowledge into practical approaches for farmers, and the farmers themselves who need the knowledge in order to increase agricultural production. When research results are unpublished or published badly, the research is wasted. Scientific publishing in ACP countries is poorly developed. There are very few well managed journals locally in which research scientists can publish their findings and there are even fewer publishers willing or able to publish books on original research Lack of trained manpower is among the major causes of this lag in publishing and book development. Many editors and other publications personnel are thrust into the jobs without any training. Research scientists themselves are not prepared for publishing their results. In agricultural colleges and universities, communication skills are overlooked while emphasis is placed on science. There are no formal institutional courses or short-term group training in the art of scientific writing or the production of agricultural technology transfer materials. CTA is committed to helping ACP countries improve their publishing capabilities through several activities including the following training programmes. TRAINING EDITORS In 1989, in collaboration with the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), CTA sponsored a 1 0 -day editing and publication workshop, in Ibadan, Nigeria. (See Spore 23 page 9). It became clear at this workshop that the need for this kind of training in ACP countries is great. A similar workshop is being organized for francophone editors, again in collaboration with IITA. It will be held in Cotonou, Benin, from 3 - 15 March 1992. These courses are meant to provide an introduction to all aspects of editing and publications management, for agricultural editors, information officers and journalists. The curriculum covers several topics including: good communications, the role of the editor, the editorial, production and printing processes and publication management. The courses include practical assignments and demonstrations of the latest technologies in publishing. Similar courses will be organized in the future in other regions. GETTING PUBLISHED In November 1990, CTA participated in the planning of a project designed to improve publishing capabilities for agricultural scientists in Africa. The project also aims at bridging the communication gap between researchers and the farmers through <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> of NARS in the production of technology transfer materials. This is a collaborative project between the African Association of Science Editors (MSE), the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA), and the OAU Semi Arid Food Grain Research and Development (SAFGRAD). This project is meant to cover a period of 3 years with at least 2 sets of training courses each year. The first of these courses took place in Lome, Togo, from 18 - 30 November 1991. The objective of the course is to reinforce the ability of agricultural scientists to publish results of their research by improving their knowledge and skills in scientific communication. It is also intended to give the trainees an insight into the world of journal publishing {{in order to reduce the}} risks of having their papers rejected for reasons of style and presentation. A course on writing and production of agricultural extension material is planned for 1992. CTA's support for strengthening publishing capabilities is not limited to Africa. In the Caribbean and Pacific regions, CTA Regional Branch Officers have, and continue to organize, courses on editing and publication, technical writing and report writing. USEFUL PUBLICATIONS Editing and publication: a training manual by lan Montagnes. Published by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), 1991. This is an invaluable tool, not only for trainers of editors, but for the editors themselves, publication officers, as well as authors, particularly 'at research institutes and extension agencies in the Third World. ' The manual was developed during a 3 -year editing and publication project co-sponsored by IRRI and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in collaboration with the University of Toronto Press. This manual can be used by other organizations to run their own training programmes and it is a useful reference for individual editors and authors. The contents are organized in 11 modules divided into 86 units following the logic of a book. However, in training, individual units can be selected and adapted. 'This is meant to be a fluid resource rather than a crystallized textbook. ' Editing and publication: a handbook for trainers. This handbook has been written as a companion to the training manual. It is based on the teaching experience the author gained during the courses that led to the preparation of the training manual.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{doctoral}} research study is making the most what a person knows and can do, as an outcome from their lifelong learning, so as to better contribute to organisational achievement. This has been motivated by a perceived gap in the extensive literature linking knowledge with organisational achievement. Whereas there is a rich body of literature addressing the meta-philosophies giving rise {{to the emergence of}} learning organisations there is, as yet, scant attention paid to the detail of planning and implementing action which would reveal individual/organisational opportunities of mutual advantage and motivate, and sustain, participation at the day-to-day level of the individual. It is in this space that this dissertation seeks to contribute by offering a mechanism for bringing the, hindsight informed, response “but that’s obvious” into the abiding explicit realm {{at the level of the}} individual. In moving beyond the obvious which is prone to be overlooked, the emphasis on “better” in the introductory sentence, is very deliberately made and has a link to awakening latent individual, and hence organisational, capabilities that would otherwise languish. The evolved LCM Model – a purposeful integration valuing the outcomes from lifelong learning (the L) with nurturing a culture supporting this outcome (the C) and with responsiveness to potentially diverse motivations (the M) – is a reflective device for bringing otherwise tacit, and latent, logic into the explicit realm of action. In the course of the development of the model, a number of supplementary models included in this dissertation have evolved from the research. They form a suite of devices which inform action and lead to making the most of what an individual knows and can do within the formal requirements of a job and within the informal influences of a frequently invisible community of practice. The initial inquiry drew upon the views and experiences of water industry engineering personnel and training facilitators associated with the contract cleaning and waste management industries. However, the major research occurred as an Emergency Management Australia (EMA) project with the Country Fire Authority (CFA) as the host organisation. This EMA/CFA research project explored the influence of making the most of what a CFA volunteer knows and can do upon retention of that volunteer. In its aggregate, across the CFA volunteer body, retention is a critical community safety objective. A qualitative research, ethnographic in character, approach was adopted. Data was collected through interviews, workshops and outcomes from attempts at action research projects. Following an initial thirteen month scoping study including respondents other than from the CFA, the research study moved into an exploration of the efficacy of an indicative model with four contextual foci – i. e. the manner of welcoming new members to the CFA, embracing training, strengthening brigade sustainability and leadership. Interestingly, the research environment which forced a truncated implementation of action research projects was, in itself, an informing experience indicative of inhibitors to making the most of what people know and can do. Competition for interest, time and commitment were factors governing the manner in which CFA respondents could be called upon to explore the efficacy of the model, and were a harbinger of the influences shaping the more general environment of drawing upon what CFA volunteers know and can do. Subsequent to the development of the indicative model, a further 16 month period was utilised in the ethnographic exploration of the relevance of the model within the CFA as the host organisation. As a consequence, the model is a more fully developed tool (framework) to aid reflection, planning and action. Importantly, the later phase of the research study has, through application of the model to specific goals within the CFA, yielded operational insight into its effective use, and in which activity systems have an important place. The model – now confidently styled as the LCM Model – has three elements that when enmeshed strengthen the likelihood of organisational achievement; and the degree of this meshing, as relevant to the target outcome, determines the strength of outcome. i. e. - • Valuing outcomes from learning: When a person recognises and values (appropriately to achievement by the organisation) what they know and can do, and associated others recognise and value what this person knows and can do, then there is increased likelihood of these outcomes from learning being applied to organisational achievement. • Valuing a culture that is conducive to learning: When a person, and associated others, are further developing and drawing upon what they know and can do within the context of a culture that is conducive to learning, then there is increased likelihood that outcomes from learning will be applied to organisational achievement. • Valuing motivation of the individual: When a person’s motivation to apply what they know and can do is valued by them, and associated others, as appropriate to organisational achievement then there is increased likelihood that appropriately drawing upon outcomes from learning will occur. Activity theory was employed as a device to scope and explore understanding of the issues as they emerged in the course of the research study. Viewing the data through the prism of activity theory led not only to the development of the LCM Model but also to an enhanced understanding of the role of leadership as a foundation for acting upon the model. Both formal and informal leadership were found to be germane in asserting influence on empowering engagement with learning and drawing upon its outcomes. It is apparent that a “leaderful organisation”, as postulated by Raelin (2003), is an environment which supports drawing upon the LCM model; and it may be the case that the act of drawing upon the model will move a narrowly leadership focused organisation toward leaderful attributes. As foreshadowed at the beginning of this synopsis, nurturing individual and organisational capability is the guiding mantra for this dissertation - “Capability embraces competence but is also forward-looking, concerned with the realisation of potential” (Stephenson 1998, p. 3). Although the inquiry focussed upon a need for CFA volunteer retention, it began with a broader investigation as part of the scoping foundation and the expanded usefulness of the LCM Model invites further investigation. The dissertation concludes with the encapsulating sentiment that “You have really got to want to”. With this predisposition in mind, this dissertation contributes to knowledge through the development and discussion of the LCM model as a reflective device informing transformative learning (Mezirow and Associates 1990). A leaderful environment (Raelin 2003) aids transformative learning – accruing to the individual and the organisation - through engendering and maintaining making the most of knowledge and skill – motivating and sustaining “the will”. The outcomes from this research study are a strong assertion that wanting to make the most of what is known and can be done is a hallmark of capability. Accordingly, this dissertation is a contribution to the “how” of <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> <b>capability,</b> and the commitment to applying that capability, of an individual and an organisation...|$|E
