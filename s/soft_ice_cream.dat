While almost from the beginning Good Humor faced competition from companies such as Jack and Jill Ice Cream, Bungalow Bar, etc., it was not until the advent of <b>soft</b> <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> trucks operated by companies such as Mister Softee that competition impacted sales. Insurance costs also increased because courts found ice cream vendors responsible for pedestrian accidents while crossing streets to and from the truck.|$|E

50|$|Falkenburg {{was offered}} a $100,000-a-year {{professional}} tennis contract. He turned it down, however, and instead decided to open an ice cream and fast food business in Brazil.
