25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E

25|$|The {{top-down}} approach anticipates nanodevices {{that must be}} built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. <b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes {{can be used to}} look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E

25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). <b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy involves the interaction of a <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{tip of a}} <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> {{can also}} be used to {{manipulate}} nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). Feature-oriented scanning methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode. However, this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy is the {{technical}} field of using microscopes to view objects {{and areas of}} objects that cannot be seen {{with the naked eye}} (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye).

25|$|This is a sub-diffraction technique. Examples of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> {{microscope}}s are {{the atomic}} force microscope (AFM), the Scanning tunneling microscope, the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope.

40|$|Commonly, {{location}} specific chemical identification {{by means}} of vibrational spectroscopy in the infrared region is largely restricted to samples of macroscopic dimensions, {{on the order of}} one to several microns; the scale of the examined area is completely determined by the diffraction limit of the incident radiation. However, chemical identification at length scales less than the diffraction limit is possible using a <b>scanned</b> <b>probe</b> technique, the <b>Scanning</b> Near-Field Infrared Microscope (SNFIM). Using a <b>scanned</b> <b>probe</b> technique in the near-field, resolution of chemical features on the order of h/ 20 or {approximately} 100 nm can be achieved.

25|$|Synthetic rubies have {{technological}} uses {{as well as}} gemological ones. Rods {{of synthetic}} ruby are used to make ruby lasers and masers. The first working laser was made by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960. Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> tips in a coordinate measuring machine.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{does not}} require special sample {{preparation}} and is typically performed under ambient conditions. It uses an AFM operated in noncontact mode that is intrinsically nondestructive and sufficiently gentle to be suitable for soft-matter and biological sample investigations. Nano-FTIR can be utilized from THz to visible spectral range(and not only in infrared as its name suggests) depending on the application requirements and availability of broadband sources. Nano-FTIR is complementary to Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), SNOM, AFM-IR and other <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> methods {{that are capable of}} performing vibrational analysis.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays it is {{possible}} to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and field ion microscope (FIM) images of the emitter. Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy and helium scanning ion microscopy (He SIM). Techniques for preparing them have been under investigation for many years. A related important recent advance has been the development (for use in the He SIM) of an automated technique for restoring a three-atom ("trimer") apex to its original state, if the trimer breaks up.|$|E

25|$|Nano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy) is a <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> {{technique that}} {{can be considered as}} a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E

2500|$|The {{thicknesses}} of SAMs can {{be measured}} using ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which also give information on interfacial properties. [...] The order in the SAM and orientation of molecules can be probed by Near Edge Xray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in Reflection Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (RAIRS) studies. Numerous other spectroscopic techniques are used such as Second-harmonic generation (SHG), Sum-frequency generation (SFG), Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), [...] as well as High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). [...] The structures of SAMs are commonly determined using <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM {{has been able to}} help understand the mechanisms of SAM formation as well as determine the important structural features that lend SAMs their integrity as surface-stable entities. In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and frictional forces of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface. These techniques have also shown physical differences between SAMs with planar substrates and nanoparticle substrates.|$|E

40|$|Port {{scanning}} is {{the first}} activity an attacker pursues when attempting to compromise a target system on a network. The aim is to gather information {{that will result in}} identifying one or more vulnerabilities in that system. For example, network ports that are open can reveal which applications and services are running on the system. How a port responds when probed with data can reveal which protocol the port utilises and can also reveal which implementation of that protocol is being employed. One of the most valuable pieces of information to be gained via <b>scanning</b> and <b>probing</b> techniques is the operating system that is installed on the target. This technique is called operating system fingerprinting. The purpose of this research is to alert computer users of the dangers of port <b>scanning,</b> <b>probing,</b> and operating system fingerprinting by exposing these techniques and advising the users on which preventative countermeasures to take against them.
