50|$|The SGML {{standard}} {{describes it}} in terms of maps and recognition modes (s9.6.1). Each entity, and each element, can have an associated notation or declared content type, which determines the kinds of references and tags which will be recognized in that entity and element. Also, each element can have an associated delimiter map (and <b>short</b> <b>reference</b> <b>map),</b> which determines which characters are treated as delimiters in context. The SGML standard characterizes parsing as a state machine switching between recognition modes. During parsing, there is a stack of maps that configure the scanner, while the tokenizer relates to the recognition modes.|$|E

40|$|Milk fat {{globules}} (MFGs) are fat droplets {{released in}} milk as vesicles with a tripartite membrane structure. MGF proteins (MFGPs) {{are involved in}} many metabolic processes, and are recently gaining growing attention. Sheep MFGPs were extracted and characterized by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (2 -DE/MS), and a <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> was established. Specifically, 29 MFGPs were successfully identified by tandem MS from 61 spots, localized in the <b>reference</b> <b>map,</b> and characterized for gene ontology. For comparison, skim milk and whey were also subjected to 2 -DE/MS, achieving identification of all the major sheep milk proteins and their localization in <b>reference</b> <b>maps.</b> Reproducibility of MFGP maps was then assessed; no significant variations were detectable when comparing samples from different healthy animals at the same stage of lactation. These results provide the first 2 -DE <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> of sheep MFGPs, opening the way to studies on their expression in different physiological and pathological conditions...|$|R

The Terra + Aqua MODIS and Terra MODIS LAI retrieved by the main algorithm and GEOV 1 LAI within the valid range were evaluated and intercompared using LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> to assess their uncertainty and seasonal variability The results showed that GEOV 1 LAI is the most similar product with the LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> (R 2 = 0. 78 and RMSE = 0. 59). The MODIS products performed well for biomes with low LAI values, but considerable uncertainty arose when the LAI was larger than 3. Terra + Aqua MODIS (R 2 = 0. 72 and RMSE = 0. 68) was slightly more accurate than Terra MODIS (R 2 = 0. 57 and RMSE = 0. 90) for producing slightly more successful observations. Both MODIS and GEOV 1 products effectively followed the seasonal trajectory of the <b>reference</b> <b>maps,</b> and GEOV 1 exhibited a smoother seasonal trajectory than MODIS. MODIS anomalies mainly occurred during summer and likely occurred because of surface reflectance uncertainty, shorter temporal resolutions and inconsistency between simulated and MODIS surface reflectances. This study suggests that further improvements of the MODIS LAI products should focus on finer algorithm inputs and improved seasonal variation modeling of MODIS observations. Future field work considering finer biome maps and better generation of LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> is still needed...|$|R

40|$|Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an {{important}} parameter of vegetation structure. A number of moderate resolution LAI products have been produced in urgent need of large scale vegetation monitoring. High resolution LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> are necessary to validate these LAI products. This study used a geostatistical regression (GR) method to estimate LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> by linking in situ LAI and Landsat TM/ETM+ and SPOT-HRV data over two cropland and two grassland sites. To explore the discrepancies of employing different vegetation indices (VIs) on estimating LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps,</b> this study established the GR models for different VIs, including difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI). To further assess {{the performance of the}} GR model, the results from the GR and Reduced Major Axis (RMA) models were compared. The results show that the performance of the GR model varies between the cropland and grassland sites. At the cropland sites, the GR model based on DVI provides the best estimation, while at the grassland sites, the GR model based on DVI performs poorly.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) protein mapping and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we have established proteome <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> of Medicago truncatula embryogenic tissue culture cells. The cultures were generated from single protoplasts, which provided a relatively homogenous cell population. We used these to analyze protein expression at the globular stages of somatic embryogenesis, which is the earliest morphogenetic embryonic stage. Over 3000 proteins could reproducibly be resolved over a pI range of 4 - 11. Three hundred and twelve protein spots were extracted from colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained 2 -DE gels and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS analysis and tandem MS sequencing. This enabled the identification of 169 protein spots representing 128 unique gene products using a publicly available expressed sequence tag database and the MASCOT search engine.

40|$|The {{remote sensing}} {{community}} {{has long been}} active in developing, evaluating, and comparing different classification algorithms {{using a variety of}} remotely sensed imagery. As an integral component of image classification, accuracy assessment is usually conducted to evaluate the agreement between the classified map and the corresponding reference data. However, current accuracy assessment practices are limited by the difficulties in obtaining high quality reference data and the lack of spatial representation of classification uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simulation approach to obtaining the desired reference data for better evaluation of classification algorithms. The simulation approach involves three components: 1) a real image scene, 2) a <b>reference</b> <b>map,</b> and 3) a simulated image scene. The real image scene is assumed as a random realization of a spectral probability model governed by an unknown underlying process, which is defined as the ground truth of the classification of the image scene. The <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> represents a reasonable estimate of the unknown process that generates the real image scene. The simulated image scene is generated as a random realization of the spectral probability model governed by the estimated process represented in the <b>reference</b> <b>map.</b> Specifically, an initial simulated image is firstly generated by independently sampling based on probability distributions estimated from the real image scene and <b>reference</b> <b>map.</b> Then, the initial simulated image is iteratively perturbed using simulated annealing to create a final simulated image which has similar spectral, spatial, and textual properties to the real image scene.
