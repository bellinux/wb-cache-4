5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken {{impression}} that the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, {{the effect of the}} rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

The changes were partially in recognition of the fact that {{a large part of the}} East Indies Station had been detached to Australian waters, and also reflecting growing concern for the strategic <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Pacific in general, and in Tahiti and New Zealand in particular. In 1884, the commander of the Australia Station was upgraded to the rank of Rear Admiral.|$|E
