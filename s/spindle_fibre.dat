The force-velocity relationship during tetanic stimulation exhibited the same biphasic shape as previously described for extrafusal muscle fibres. However, the maximum speed of shortening of the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibres</b> was merely 0. 95 ± 0. 006 lengths s− 1 (mean ± s. e. m., n = 11), which is approximately half the value recorded in extrafusal fibres of the same muscle. The maximum tetanic force, 91 ± 10 kN m− 2, n = 14, was likewise only approximately half that produced by extrafusal fibres. The force generated by the capsule segment was lower than that produced by the whole spindle resulting in elongation of the capsule region during a fixed-end tetanus. The intracellular calcium ion concentration reached during the plateau of the tetanus, 1. 7 ± 0. 1 μM (n = 8), was substantially lower than the value attained in extrafusal fibres under equivalent conditions. In accordance, the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibres</b> did not become fully activated during supramaximal electrical stimulation as indicated by the finding that the tetanic force could be further increased by 16. 6 ± 0. 04 % (n = 5) on addition of 0. 5 mm caffeine.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Eccles {{and his colleagues}} {{performed}} the research that would win Eccles the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model. This reflex is easily studied because it consists of only two neurons: a sensory neuron (the muscle <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre)</b> and the motor neuron. The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the spinal cord. When Eccles passed a current into the sensory neuron in the quadriceps, the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When he passed the same current through the hamstring, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, he saw an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP {{was not enough to}} fire an action potential in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron could cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.|$|E
40|$|Individual spindle fibres in {{prometaphase}} spermatocytes of the cricket, Neocurtilla hexadactyla, were irradiated with an ultraviolet microbeam. The stretched heteromorphic bivalent (X 2 Y) {{contracted to}} about 75 % of its pre-irradiation length after irradiation {{of either of}} its two oppositely directed spindle fibres (i. e., the X 2 or Y <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre).</b> The X 2 Y bivalent also contracted after irradiation {{of the connection between}} the kinetochores of the univalent Xi chromosome and the Y chromosome but it did not contract after irradiation of autosomal spindle fibres or of the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre</b> of the Xi univalent sex chromosome. The spindles sometimes shrank after irradiation, but contrac-tion of the X 2 Y bivalent was independent of spindle shrinkage. The data strongly suggest that the oppositely directed forces on a bivalent are not independent. One reason is that the X 2 Y contractions were asymmetrical: during contraction one kinetochore remained fixed in position while the other kinetochore (facing the opposite pole) moved towards the equator. In 75 % of the cases the stationary kinetochore was associated with the irradiated <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre.</b> Thus, we suggest that the irradiation of a <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre</b> produces a state analogous to rigor in the irradiated <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre</b> and, because of effects on the control system, produces relaxation of tension in the oppositely directed non-irradiated <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre,</b> so that the kinetochore associated with the non-irradiated <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre</b> moves towards the equator.

5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication.

40|$|We {{determined}} the kinetic polarities of chromosomal 9 pindle fibre microtubules in vivo: either the kinetochore or pole ends of chromosomal spindle fibres were irradiated with near-ultraviolet light to prevent depolymerization by colcemid. Irradiations began either just before or just after colcemid addition; cells were continually irradiated and continuously immersed in colcemid. Irradiations of kinetochore ends of chromosomal spindle fibres prevented depolymerization; irradiations of pole ends did not. Therefore, since colcemid acts by binding to the 'on ' (assembly) ends of microtubules, the on ends of chromosomal <b>spindle</b> <b>fibre</b> microtubules {{are at the}} kinetochores.

40|$|A {{total of}} 791 spindle poles was {{analysed}} {{with regard to}} intrafusal fibre composition {{in the first and}} second superficial lumbrical muscles from the right and left hindfeet of 9 male and 5 female adult cats. Bag and chain muscle fibres were identified by their myofibrillar ATPase staining profile in the B region, after either acid or alkaline preincubation. A high proportion of the spindle pole population (43. 2 %) was observed to contain three or more (up to 5) bag fibres; those poles were classified as multiple-bag spindle poles. In the 334 muscle spindles in which both poles were studied, 42 bag fibres (12. 6 %) were found to be of the 'mixed' type, that is a fibre in which the two poles differ in their ATPase staining profile (either bag 1 /bag 2 or bag/chain). The variability of the intrafusal fibre content observed in spindles of these muscles has been studied in relation to individual characteristics such as sex, weight and side of the animal. In general, multiple-bag spindles are more frequent in male than in female cats and in right as compared to left side muscles. Nearly all 'mixed' bag intrafusal fibres (38 out of 42) were observed in spindles containing 3 or more bag fibres. In 3 -bag spindles the proportion of 'mixed' bag spindles is approximately the same in male and female cats. The ratio of 'dynamic' (mean polar bag 1 content) to 'static' (mean polar bag 2 plus chain fibre content) intrafusal effectors per muscle tends to increase in spindles of right side muscles and to decrease in the heaviest animals.

In normal cats, and in cats 3, 6 or 9 months after section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve, medial gastrocnemius afferent fibres in continuity were impaled in dorsal rootlets for recording and stimulation. Receptor innervation was determined electrophysiologically by manipulation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Afferent fibre type was determined by the presence (group Ia or spindle group II) or absence (group Ib) of field potentials in the homonymous motoneurone pool in response to activation of the afferent fibre. In normal cats, two-thirds of recorded afferents innervated spindles; 89 % of these generated field potentials detected in the motoneurone pool. One-third of recorded afferents innervated tendon organs; none of these generated such field potentials. In operated cats, about half of the recorded afferents innervated spindles, about one-third responded abnormally or not at all to muscle manipulation, and fewer than one-tenth innervated tendon organs. Numbers of afferents which innervated spindles increased with time. The proportion of afferents generating field potentials was smaller in operated than in normal animals (40 % vs. 60 %) and declined progressively with time. Field potentials were generated by fibres in all categories of receptor reinnervation. This ability was lost at long post-operative intervals by fibres failing to reach the muscle. Conduction velocity of fibres fell in operated animals. Fibres reinnervating their original type of receptor (e. g. group Ia <b>fibre</b> [...] <b>spindle)</b> exhibited greater conduction velocity than fibres innervating an inappropriate receptor or no receptor. From these findings and other considerations (see Discussion) we conclude that following section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve: about 75 % of afferents regenerate into the medial gastrocnemius muscle, many more spindles than tendon organs become reinnervated, random populations of groups Ia and Ib (and probably <b>spindle</b> group II) <b>fibres</b> reinnervate <b>spindles,</b> <b>fibres</b> which fail to re-establish appropriate receptor innervation also fail to recover normal conduction velocity.

Early investigators (Nemec, 1904; van Regemorter, 1916; Strasburger, 1907; Sakamura, 1916) have shown that chloral hydrate produces uncoordinated chromosome movements and c-mitosis i. e. colchicine mitosis (Levan, 1938). Ris (1949) reported that chloral hydrate causes the disappearance of the mitotic spindle in grasshopper spermatocytes. Using eggs of Pleurodeles waltlii, Sentein (I 974) demonstrated that chloral hydrate alters the ultrastructure of chromosomes and arrests mitosis by destroying <b>spindle</b> <b>fibres.</b> Mole-Bajer (1969) found that immediately after chloral hydrate treatment in Haemanthus katherinae, the kinetochore and continuous microtubules were absent, but microtubules soon began to re-form anew. Since most of these studies were not quantitative, the chloral hydrate effect has mainly been described qualitatively. The simple eukaryote Aspergillus nidulans has certain advantages for the study of mitosis, the most important of which is that the genetics of the organism are well known. The cytology of mitosis in A. nidulans {{is similar to that of}} the higher eukaryotes in most respects (Robinow & Caten, 1969). During mitosis, the chromosomes condense, a mitotic spindle is formed, the chromosomes undergo anaphase separation, the spindle then disappears, the chromosomes relax and two daughter nuclei are formed (Robinow & Caten, 1969). As with many other fungi, the nuclear membrane remains intact during all phases of mitosis.

Extrafusal and intrafusal fibres in the young masseter, and for comparison young biceps, were examined for composition of fibre types and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms by means of morphological, enzyme-histochemical, biochemical and immuno-histochemical techniques. For evaluation of plasticity during life span the data for young muscles were compared with previous reported data for adult and elderly muscles. The results showed significant differences in extrafusal fibre types and MyHC expression between young masseter and young biceps and between young masseter and masseter in adults and elderly. Compared with young biceps, young masseter was more intricate in composition of extrafusal MyHC expression. Muscle spindles were larger and more frequent in the masseter than in the biceps. Masseter and biceps muscle spindles showed fundamental similarities but also marked differences in MyHC expression. The results suggest that the young masseter is specialized in fibre types already at young age and shows a unique fibre type growth pattern. Whereas masseter extrafusal fibres display marked plasticity in fibre types and MyHC isoforms during life span muscle spindles/intrafusal fibres are morphologically mature already at young age and precede extrafusal fibres in growth and maturation. Results showed similarities in intrafusal MyHC expression between young masseter and biceps, but also differences implying muscle specific proprioceptive control. Differences in fibre types and MyHC expression between young masseter and young biceps extrafusal fibres are proposed to reflect diverse evolutionary and developmental origins and accord with the masseter and biceps being separate allotypes of muscle...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of cuneate neurones to signal information derived from muscle <b>spindle</b> afferent <b>fibres</b> about static stretch or vibration of forearm extensor muscles was examined electrophysiologically in anaesthetized cats. Static stretch (< = 2 mm in amplitude) and sinusoidal vibration (at frequencies of 50 - 800 Hz) were applied longitudinally to individual muscle tendons {{by means of}} a feedback controlled mechanical stimulator, and responses were recorded from individual cuneate neurones and from individual <b>spindle</b> afferent <b>fibres.</b> Cuneate neurones sampled were located caudal to the obex and displayed a sensitivity to both vibration and static stretch of forearm muscles that was consistent with their input arising from primary spindle endings. In response to static muscle stretch, they displayed graded and approximately linear stimulus-response relations, and a stability of response level at fixed lengths that was consistent with these neurones contributing discriminative information about static muscle stretch. In response to sinusoidal muscle vibration the cuneate neurones also showed graded stimulus-response relations (in contrast to spindle afferents which at low vibration amplitudes attain a plateau response level corresponding to a discharge of 1 impulse on each vibration cycle). Lowest thresholds were at 100 - 300 Hz and bandwidths of vibration sensitivity extended up to ∼ 800 Hz. Temporal precision in cuneate responses to muscle vibration was assessed by constructing phase scatter and cycle histograms from which measures of vector strength could be calculated. Cuneate responses displayed somewhat poorer phase locking (and lower vector strengths) than spindle afferent responses to vibration (a reflection of uncertainties associated with synaptic transmission). Nevertheless, the remarkable feature of cuneate responses to muscle vibration is the preservation of tight phase locking at frequencies up to 400 - 500 Hz, which presumably enables these central neurones to contribute accurate temporal information for the kinaesthetic sense in a variety of circumstances involving dynamic perturbations to skeletal muscle...|$|R

Intrafusal (<b>spindle)</b> and extrafusal <b>fibre</b> types in masseter were compared with those in limb muscles and were identified by a combination of standard histochemical methods and indirect immunoperoxidase staining with antibodies specific for the various isoforms of myosin characteristic of fibre types in mammalian muscle. In general, the fibre-type properties of intrafusal fibres in masseter resembled those in limb muscle spindles, but the extrafusal fibre-type composition was unlike that in most limb muscles. In the rat masseter, most of the spindles were clustered together in a few very restricted areas. Extensive fusion of the external capsules of adjacent spindles, resulting in the formation of giant spindles, was seen in the cat and monkey masseter; this was sometimes accompanied by the enclosure of extrafusal fibres within the fused spindles. Common to all species, but strongest of all in the rat, was a close association between the distributions of muscle spindles and extrafusal Type I (slow twitch) fibres within the masseter complex.

40|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} is {{a mechanical}} process that requires {{assembly of the}} mitotic spindle – a dynamic microtubule-based force-generating machine (Dumont & Mitchison, 2009). Connections between chromosomes and the spindle are mediated by kinetochores, pairs of multi-protein complexes assembled on centromeric chromatin that harness the pushing and pulling forces associated with microtubule dynamics to power chromosome movement (Rago & Cheeseman, 2013). This structure {{is reported to be}} compliant (Wan et al., 2009; Maresca & Salmon, 2009; Uchida et al., 2009; Dumont et al., 2012; Drpic et al., 2015; Etemad et al., 2015; Tauchman et al., 2015; Magidson et al., 2016), which is the basis upon which it can transduce forces, and satisfy mitotic checkpoints. However recent studies have suggested that the kinetochore is a non-compliant linkage (Suzuki et al., 2014), while others negate the requirement for intra-kinetochore stretch to allow onset of anaphase (Etemad et al., 2015; Tauchman et al., 2015; Magidson et al., 2016). It is therefore crucial that the reasons for these differences are elucidated, and a new model developed to explain regulatory pathways sensitive to intra-kinetochore structure. I have developed a novel semi-automated imaging assay to track kinetochore proteins tagged with two different coloured fluorescent proteins in 3 D, coupled with a detailed assay for measurement of the required correction for 3 D chromatic aberration directly from cells. I reveal using three dimensional tracking that the kinetochore forms a non-compliant linkage between centromeric chromatin and kintetochore <b>spindle</b> <b>fibres.</b> Instead the outer kinetochore layer can swivel around the inner kinetochore/centromere, which results in a reduction in intra-kinetochore distance when viewed in lower dimensions, the only 3 D measurement thus far being by Etemad et al. (2015). I show that swivel provides a mechanical flexibility that enables kinetochores at the periphery of the spindle to engage microtubules. Swivel reduces as cells approach anaphase, explaining previous suggestions that the kinetochore needs to be stretched upon bi-orientation prior to anaphase onset (Maresca & Salmon, 2009; Uchida et al., 2009). Reduction in swivel suggests there is an organisational change linked to checkpoint satisfaction, and/or changes required in kinetochore mechanochemistry before sister chromatid dysjunction. I show that Cdk 1 inactivation is required to suppress kinetochore-microtubule dynamics in anaphase, and therefore may mediate required changes in kinetochore state. Finally, my work opens up the possibility to map the 3 D architecture of the kinetochore, and between different domains within proteins and complexes. With such an architectural understanding, it will now be possible to investigate the mechanisms of organisational changes that occur during cycles of microtubule attachment and the regulatory processes of error-correction and SAC activation/silencing...|$|R

40|$|Single unit {{activity}} in <b>spindle</b> afferent nerve <b>fibres</b> from the finger flexors, the anterior tibial muscle, and the calf muscles was recorded intraneurally with tungsten microelectrodes {{in patients with}} Parkinsonism with resting tremor and in spastic patients with clonus. During tremor of Parkinsonism, involving the receptor bearing muscles, the Ia afferent fibre discharge patterns {{were similar to those}} seen previously in healthy subjects during voluntary fast alternating finger or foot movements: besides the stretch discharges occurring during the relaxation phases, discharges also occurred during the contraction phases. Such contraction discharges, presumed to originate from intrafusal muscle fibre contractions, were not seen in the spastic patients during clonus. During the clonic oscillations each afferent stretch discharge was regularly followed by a stretch reflex contraction which on its falling phase elicited a new volley of impulses in the Ia afferent fibres. The findings are considered to support the notion that, like the contractions in normal voluntary alternating movements, the contractions in tremor of Parkinsonism are organized according to the principle of alpha-gamma coactivation, whereas the contractions in clonus are stretch reflexes causing pure alpha contractions...|$|R
40|$|The present {{experiments}} {{examined the}} capacity of external cuneate nucleus (ECN) neurones in the anaesthetized cat to respond to static and vibrotactile stretch of forearm extensor muscles. The aim was to compare their signalling capacities with the known properties of main cuneate neurones {{in order to determine}} whether there is differential processing of muscle spindle inputs at these parallel relay sites. Static stretch (≤ 2 mm in amplitude) and sinusoidal vibration were applied longitudinally to individual muscle tendons and responses recorded from single ECN neurones. The muscle-related ECN neurones that were sampled displayed a high sensitivity to both static and dynamic components of stretch, including muscle vibration at frequencies of 50 - 800 Hz, consistent with their dominant input being derived from primary <b>spindle</b> afferent <b>fibres.</b> In response to ramp-and-hold muscle stretch, ECN neurones resembled their main cuneate counterparts in the pattern of their responses and in quantitative response measures. Their coefficients of variation in interspike intervals during steady stretch ranged from ≈ 0. 3 to 0. 7, as they do in main cuneate responses, and their stimulus-response relations were graded as a function of stretch magnitude with low variability in responses at a fixed stretch amplitude. In response to muscle vibration, ECN activity was tightly phase locked to the vibration waveform, in particular at frequencies of ≤ 150 Hz, where vector strength measures (R) were high (R≥ 0. 8) before declining as a function of frequency, with R values of ≈ 0. 6 at 300 Hz and ≤ 0. 4 at 800 Hz. Both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of ECN responsiveness to the vibro-stretch disturbances were indistinguishable from those of the main cuneate neurones. The results demonstrate a high transmission fidelity for muscle signals across the ECN and no evidence for differential synaptic transmission across the parallel main and external cuneate nuclei. Earlier limitations observed in {{the capacity of}} cerebellar Purkinje cells to respond to primary spindle inputs must therefore be imposed at synapses within the cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sensory {{feedback}} from the moving limbs contrib-utes to the regulation of animal and human locomotion. How-ever, {{the question of the}} specific role of the various modalities is still open. Further, functional loss of leg afferent fibres due to peripheral neuropathy does not always lead to major alteration in the gait pattern. In order to gain further insight on proprio-ceptive control of human gait, we applied vibratory tendon stimulation, known to recruit <b>spindle</b> primary afferent <b>fibres,</b> to both triceps surae muscles during normal floor walk. This pro-cedure would disturb organisation and execution of walking, especially if spindles fire continuously and subjects are blind-folded. Vibration induced significant, though minor, changes in duration and length of stance and swing phase, and on speed of walking and kinematics of lower limb segments. No effect was induced on angular displacement of the ankle joint or trunk and head kinematics. This paucity of effects was at variance with the perception of the subjects, who reported illusion of leg stiffness and gait imbalance. These findings would speak for a selective gating of Ia input during locomotion and emphasise the notion that the central nervous system can cope with an unusual continuous input along the Ia fibres from a key muscle like the soleus. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a mechanical cutting force model for multi-tooth cutting processes, where initial position errors in radial and axial direction, eccentricity and edge wear {{are taken into}} account. The cutting forces are presented for each individual cutting edge, and {{in a system of}} coordinates where one axis is parallel to the cutting speed vector at any instant. The process parameter cutting resistance, Cr is derived from the measured main cutting force FM. Cr should be regarded as a parameter since it is always increasing with decreasing values of theoretical chip thickness h 1. A new way of measuring cutting forces in multi-tooth cutting processes is also presented. Eight cutting force components are measured on the tool close to each of the four cutting edges. The aroused signals are filtered, amplified, A/D-converted and put together in a serial stream for transmission through a hollow <b>spindle</b> via a <b>fibre</b> optic cable. The signals are sent from the rotating spindle to the frame of the machine over an air gap with Light Emitting Diodes. They are then demultiplexed, D/A-converted, and stored in a PC-based eight channel oscilloscope. With this measurement equipment it is possible to directly measure the cutting forces acting on each individual cutting edge...|$|R
40|$|Single unit {{activity}} in primary <b>spindle</b> afferent nerve <b>fibres</b> from finger and foot flexors was recorded with tungsten microelectrodes {{inserted into the}} median and peroneal nerves of healthy subjects. During voluntary fast alternating finger and foot movements, simulating the tremor of Parkinsonism, two types of discharges were seen in the Ia afferent fibres: (1) stretch responses occurring during the flexor relaxation phases, and (2) discharges occurring during the flexor contraction phases. Contrary to the stretch responses the spindle contraction discharges could be eliminated by a partial lidocaine block of the muscle nerve proximal to the recording site, indicating that they resulted from fusimotor activation of intrafusal fibres. On {{the basis of the}} temporal relations between {{the beginning and end of}} individual EMG-bursts, the start of the spindle contraction discharges and the latency of the stretch reflex in the muscles concerned, the following conclusions were drawn: the recurrent extrafusal contractions in movements of this type are initiated by the fast direct alpha route, but individual contraction phases generally last long enough to be influenced subsequently by the coactivated fusimotor loop through the spindles. It is postulated that this gamma loop influence during alternating movements helps to keep flexor and extensor muscles working in a regular reciprocal fashion with contractions adjusted in strength to the external loads...|$|R
40|$|A greatly {{expanded}} version of spike-triggered averaging (Mendell & Henneman, 1971), performed off-line on tape-recorded signals, was utilized {{to determine the}} presence or absence of functional connexions between stretch-afferent fibres and homonymous motoneurones. As many as 264 possible connexions between eleven Ia or <b>spindle</b> group II <b>fibres</b> and twenty-four motoneurones were studied in each single, acute experiment. Morphological and topographical factors influencing functional connectivity were analysed with the aid of wiring diagrams and connectivity matrices. In all experiments the greater the conduction velocity (i. e. diameter) of a Ia or group II fibre, the higher was the probability of its having functional connexions with homonymous motoneurones. The greater the longitudinal distance between the spinal entry points of Ia fibres and the location of a motoneurone, the less was the same probability. The influence of axonal conduction velocity of motoneurones on functional connectivity was apparent in some experiments, but not in others. In pooled data large motoneurones received functional connexions from a higher percentage of group II fibres than did small cells. The projection percentage reached 100 only when both Ia fibres and motoneurones were large, suggesting that motoneurone size influences the probability of functional connexions from group Ia as well as group II fibres. On a cell-to-cell level, connectivity apparently does not follow strict, deterministic rules. The results raise the question of how probabilistic connexions between afferent fibres and motoneurones give rise to deterministic outputs from the whole pool...|$|R
40|$|The late fetal {{development}} of rat extra-ocular and masticatory muscles was examined by myosin immunohistochemistry. The pattern of slow and neonatal myosin isoform expression in {{primary and secondary}} myotubes in these muscles was generally similar to that seen by others in limb muscles. We observed a consistent difference between the Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats {{in the degree of}} maturity reached by all muscles studied at a particular age. In both strains, extra-ocular muscles were also about one day in advance of the masticatory muscles. Thus, secondary myotubes were first seen at E 17 in Wistar extraocular muscles, at E 18 in Sprague-Dawley extra-ocular muscles and Wistar masticatory muscles, and at E 19 in Sprague-Dawley masticatory muscles. There was a strikingly early and complete type differentiation of primary myotubes in extraocular muscles, and tonic myosin first appeared before birth in presumptive extrafusal tonic fibres in the orbital layer of the oculorotatory muscles. Throughout the late fetal period, retractor bulbi was composed of fast myotubes only, but these myotubes were not arranged in classical clusters. In the masticatory muscles at E 17 /E 18 some slow primary myotubes started to express tonic myosin, and these presumptive <b>spindle</b> bag 2 <b>fibres</b> were located only in regions of the muscles known to contain spindles in the adult. Presumptive bag 1 fibres appeared about a day later (initially without tonic myosin), and in the region of the spindle cluster in anterior deep masseter extrafusal secondary myotube production appeared to be suppressed.
