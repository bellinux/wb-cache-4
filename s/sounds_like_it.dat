There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E

A BBC review stated [...] "part of the chorus <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis."

In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that because of its wide variety of musical styles, the album can be [...] "a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view". He concludes: [...] "None of it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess."

[...] Drawing similarities between the song and [...] "Heigh-Ho", Jacqueline Rupp of Common Sense Media commented, [...] "the 'Hi-Ho'-inspired 'Happy Working Song' will have kids giggling and dancing." [...] Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics wrote that [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] successfully [...] "ap'Whistle While You Work' most amusingly."

[...] "Sound effects {{used in the}} game will also blow you away," [...] Knutson said, [...] "Everything from the explosions, swords clashing, hundreds of incoming enemies storming your way, all <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> came directly from the movie!" [...] GameSpot's Greg Kasavin noted that [...] "Frame rate issues do affect each version of the game, to varying degrees, {{and none of the}} character models for the main characters look all that remarkable," [...] but conceded that [...] "all other aspects of The Return of the Kings graphics are outstanding [...] The game's audio is even more effective than the graphics at conveying the intensity of the action."

The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley, and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album [...] "an embarrassing endeavor that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> should have stayed locked inside Ice's studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take)."

The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England, described by Gaga as a [...] "magical message" [...] song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception. White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for {{coming up with the}} idea and the theme behind the song. [...] "We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> reads, but not like you think until you hear it," [...] he added.

[...] —Minaj describing the concept behind [...] "Pills n Potions". Minaj first mentioned the song in her promo single, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] which features Soulja Boy. She stated that the single would be released in two weeks. She revealed the title of the song at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards and afterwards hosted a Q&A on Twitter where she revealed information regarding the single.

Speaking to Billboard, she explained: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> urgency, <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> betrayal. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> running. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> fainting. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> love. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> - *gasp!*" [...] On May 19, 2014, Minaj revealed the single's cover art on Instagram.|$|R
500|$|For Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust, {{the song}} [...] "starts out {{dangerously close to}} 'Drops of Jupiter' territory, but luckily, there are no fried chicken or soy latte lyrics to be found here." [...] He also noted that, [...] "'When I Was Your Man' goes minimal with the musical accompaniment, {{featuring}} just Bruno and his piano, sounding halfway between an Alicia Keys ballad and Prince’s 'How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?'." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent called it a [...] "McCartney-esque piano ballad." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the song [...] "sounds {{like a cross between}} Stevie Wonder and Elton John," [...] also seeing [...] "a touch of Michael Jackson" [...] in his delivery. Sam Lansky of Idolator agreed, writing that [...] "while evoking Elton John, the track <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded live in a piano bar, with audible background noise, like the spooling of film on a projector." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that Mars lists everything he should have done for the one he loved before she broke up with him.|$|E
500|$|Leavin {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album {{was called a}} [...] "treat for any Cole fan" [...] by Andy Kellman of AllMusic, who drew attention to how it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded at a [...] "leisurely pace". Continuing this thought, Kellman noted that Cole was [...] "breez through an easygoing set of covers". The BBC's Chris Rogers defined the album as [...] "an ultra smooth mix of standards both tasteful and obtuse". Jay S. Jacobs of PopEntertainment.com compared Leavin [...] to Cole's 1999 release, Snowfall on the Sahara, and viewed it as [...] "jazzy but decidedly more modern and surprisingly strong". Peoples Ralph Novak, Chuck Arnold, V. R. Peterson, and Monica Rizzo commended Cole's decision to [...] "ditch the evening-gown fare on her new CD" [...] by recording more contemporary songs. Gugu Mkhabela from News24 awarded the album three out of five stars, describing the material as [...] "pure old school with a modern twist", with Cole providing [...] "a touch of class and some depth to boot".|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{was completed}} Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus {{had left on}} a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various independent labels, distributors, and zines. He recalled [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How do I do this?'" [...] A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" [...] manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of Slay Tracks; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the master recording produced by the company: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that–whatever.'" [...] 1000 copies of Slay Tracks were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting Austria.|$|E

500|$|In a 2011 Q, {{producer}} Jim Lemley {{said that}} [...] "Wanted 2 <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{will not happen}} any time soon if at all". That same year, James McAvoy said, regarding the sequel, [...] "I think the studio is keen to make it, and {{we really want to}} make it, but we want to make it if it's right and when it's right, and that might not be ever." [...] McAvoy also expressed interest in a sequel focusing on a character other than Wesley. Universal later brought Wanted screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write the sequel, which Haas described as happening [...] "right after the events that just happened; it'll pick up Wesley a few years later and go back in for another round", while also being [...] "Fox-less and loom-less." [...] Haas would later detail that the script featured a new female protagonist, who Wesley would recruit [...] "sort of in the Fox role." [...] Bekmambetov declared during the interviews for [...] that after many years of indecision as the Wanted sequel stalled in development, he proposed an idea to the screenwriters wherein the plot followed Wesley while featuring [...] "a great twist." ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was exemplary in that [...] "Swift is a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track {{to that of}} producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who he referred to as [...] "Swedish pop gods". He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed {{the role of a}} big sister instead of a big star, {{to be one of the}} best and the most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past. Leah Greenbelt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita".|$|E
500|$|... "Pyramids" [...] is a {{song that}} lasts nine-minute-and-54-seconds, it is of the R variety. It has been {{described}} as a [...] "nearly 10-minute epic that touches on everything from club music to good old-fashioned slow jam R" [...] and is [...] "an ambitious song with multiple movements." [...] The song features groaning club beats, psychedelic guitar noodling, crunchy synth leads, a funked-up beat, and [...] "Ocean's distinctive croon and lots of vague new-R angst". The opening segment sports the [...] "beautiful, warped R that Ocean has become known for", but from there the song transitions into a smattering of electro-house synths, Michael Jackson-influenced pop melodies, spaced out electronic segues, UK bass breaks, saxophone, and guitar solo courtesy of John Mayer." [...] The track is an [...] "R odyssey" [...] slinking from ancient Egypt, where wild cheetahs are on the loose and Cleopatra meets a [...] "snakey doom", to the present day where [...] "Frank is living that sleazy motel room life." [...] It serves as [...] "another case where the production far outstrips the vocal work", with [...] "clanging and chiming and choirs for the intro," [...] a dance break toward the middle that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "recorded in 2018", and a slow jam for the second half that closes the song.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} title was Sex for the Single Girl, {{but this was}} changed because [...] "it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was advocating sex for all single girls." [...] Brown had also written a section on contraceptive methods that was omitted from the final publication.|$|R
5000|$|The final track, [...] "21st Century Safety Dance", was {{described}} by Ivan in the press release for the album as a [...] "warning" [...] track, explaining his beliefs that all music would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> unless people [...] "got their act together".|$|R

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Music.j-total.net, {{the song is}} written in the key of F minor. During {{the first and second}} verse and pre-chorus, the song follows a key sequence of F minor. Through the first, second and third chorus, the song has a sequence of A#m7–D#m7–E–D#m7. During the bridge section, the key sequence changes to A#m7–C7–F minor. It opens with a percussion section that includes a drum machine and cymbals; it then carries on with Palm Products GmbH synthesizers and keyboards, as described by a member at Selective Hearing. In an interview with MSN Hotmail in 2008, Utada said about the song; [...] "I wanted to write quite a lively song and after writing it, I still feel that this has the most energetic feeling to it and that it’s probably the most polished song too." [...] She personally enjoyed the end result of the song, as she described the arrangement and lyrical content, and cited it one of her favorite songs form the album. A reviewer from Selective Hearing said that the song [...] "sound like throw backs to her R days." [...] The editor analyzed the song's music structure, and said that the [...] "sample at the beginning <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> might be from a Godzilla movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} a [...] "kaleidoscopic blend of pop, prog, punk, psych, and electronica". Drowned in Sound {{describes}} it as similar to Guerrilla with [...] "Beach Boys-esque psychedelic pop ... put to techno undertones" [...] while the NME has called Rings Around the World an [...] "expensive, glossy production ... lush and widescreen" [...] and suggested that it [...] "reaches for an effect so modern that at times it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could've {{been made in the}} '80s". The first single, [...] "Juxtapozed with U", is reminiscent of both the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s, and the [...] "plastic" [...] approximation of that music on David Bowie's 1975 album Young Americans, while [...] "No Sympathy" [...] has been described as the [...] "missing link between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young-scatted harmonies, jungle hi-hats and berserk sampler techno". The Dallas Observer compared [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] to tunes such as The Kinks' [...] "Waterloo Sunset", Dennis Wilson's [...] "Forever" [...] and Jack Bruce's [...] "Theme for an Imaginary Western" [...] while The Big Issue called [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] "surf-punk electro pop". Elsewhere on the album the eclectic range of sounds continues from the trip hop of [...] " [...] Touch Sensitive" [...] to the Status Quo-esque [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] and the [...] "electro country rock" [...] of [...] "Run!

500|$|The Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album [...] "a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality", and wrote that it [...] "fails {{to come up}} short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." [...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes {{a little something to}} Gwen Stefani," [...] as well as the album's [...] "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E
5000|$|A {{review by}} Allmusic {{called it an}} example of bop {{bordering}} on hard bop sound. For the 1980s {{it would not be}} considered very [...] "groundbreaking", but the album <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could have come out of the height of the bop era in the 1960s.|$|R
