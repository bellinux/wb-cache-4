Instantaneous and local gas-particle velocity, void fraction and turbulent parameters were obtained. Predicted time-averaged particle concentrations and velocities reflect the classical core-annular flow structure in agreement with experimental measurements, in particular, with those reported by Miller and Gidaspow [AIChE J. 38 (1992) 1801].

40|$|We {{explore the}} role of gas {{viscosity}} {{in the behavior of}} gas-fluidized beds of fine powders by means of experimental measurements using nitrogen and neon as fluidizing gases, and theoretical considerations.

Our experiments with neon reveal a discontinuous transition from heterogeneous fluidization to a highly expanded homogeneous fluidization state. We point out that increasing gas viscosity enhances the coherence of agglomerate swarms, which promotes a local void-splitting mechanism, thus improving the uniformity of fluidization. Our theoretical analysis predicts that further increase of gas viscosity would produce a full suppression of the bubbling regime, i. e., the uniformly fluidized bed would undergo a direct transition to a turbulent regime as seen in beds <b>of</b> nanoparticles <b>fluidized</b> by nitrogen and in liquid-fluidized beds of moderate-density beads...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze and compare the responses of three Process Analytical Technology (PAT) techniques applied simultaneously to monitor a pilot-scale fluidized bed granulation process. Real-time measurements using focused beam reflectance measurement (Lasentec FBRM) and near-infra red spectroscopy (Bruker NIR) were taken by inserting in-line probes into the fluidized bed. Non-intrusive acoustic emission measurements (Physical Acoustic AE) were performed by attaching piezoelectric sensors on the external wall <b>of</b> the <b>fluidized</b> bed. <b>Powder</b> samples were collected at regular intervals during the granulation process and characterized offline using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, stereo-optical microscopy and loss on drying method. PAT data comprising chord length distribution and chord count (from FBRM), absorption spectra (from NIR) and average signal levels and counts (from AE) were compared with the particle properties measured using offline samples. All three PAT techniques were able to detect the three granulation regimes or rate processes (wetting and nucleation, consolidation and growth, breakage) to varying degrees of sensitivity. Being dependent on optical signals, the sensitivities of the FBRM and NIR techniques were susceptible to fouling on probe windows. The AE technique was sensitive to background fluidizing air flows and external interferences. The sensitivity, strengths and weaknesses of the PAT techniques examined may facilitate the selection of suitable PAT tools for process development and scale-up studies...|$|R

Two mathematical models, based on the Janssen approach to evaluate stresses in powder containers, were developed in order to relate the torque measurements in the Fluidized Bed Rheometer to the flow properties of the powders measured with standard powder flow testers. Results indicate that the models were able to satisfactorily predict the torque measured by the msFBR. The larger complexity of the Walker (1966) [Walker, D. M., 1966.

The application of this procedure provided good results in terms of effective angle of internal friction and is promising for the ability of the system to explore powder flow at very low consolidation states...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> a <b>fluidized</b> <b>powdered</b> {{activated carbon}} (PAC) pilot (CarboPlus®) was studied in both nominal (total nitrification + post denitrification) and degraded (partial nitrification + no denitrification) {{configuration of the}} Seine Centre WWTP (Colombes, France). In addition to conventional wastewater parameters 54 pharmaceuticals and hormones (PhPHs) and 59 other emerging pollutants were monitored in influents and effluents of the pilot. Thus, the impacts of the WWTP configuration, the process operation and the physico-chemical properties of the studied compounds were assessed in this article. Among the 26 PhPHs quantified in nominal WWTP configuration influents, 8 have high dissolved concentrations (> 100 ng/L), 11 have an intermediary concentration (10 – 100 ng/L) and 7 are quantified below 10 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole is predominant (about 30 % of {{the sum of the}} PhPHs). Overall, 6 PhPHs are poorly to moderately removed (80 %), i. e. beta blockers, carbamazepine or trimethoprim, and 11 are well eliminated (60 – 80 %), i. e. diclofenac, naproxen or sulfamethoxazole. In degraded WWTP configuration, higher levels of organic matter and higher concentrations of most pollutants are observed. Consequently, most PhPHs are substantially less removed in percentages but the removed flux is higher. Thus, the PAC dose required to achieve a given removal percentage is higher in degraded WWTP configuration. For the other micropollutants (34 quantified), artificial sweeteners and phthalates are found at particularly high concentrations in degraded WWTP configuration influents, up to μg/L range. Only pesticides, bisphenol A and parabens are largely eliminated (50 – 95 %), while perfluorinated acids, PAHs, triclosan and sweeteners are not or weakly removed (< 50 %). The remaining compounds exhibit a very variable fate from campaign to campaign. The fresh PAC dose was identified as the most influencing operation parameter and is strongly correlated to performances. Charge and hydrophobicity of compounds have been recognized as crucial for the micropollutant adsorption on PAC, as well as the molecular weight. Finally, a PAC dose of 10 mg/L allows an average removal of 72 – 80 % of the sum of the PhPHs in nominal WWTP configuration. The comparaison of the results with those from the scarce other studies tends to indicate that an extrapolation of them to different PAC processes and to other WWTPs could be possible and relevant, taking into account the differences of water quality from WWTP to WWTP...|$|R
