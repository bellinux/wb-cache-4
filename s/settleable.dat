[...] Secondary {{treatment is}} traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed <b>settleable</b> solids and floating material. Secondary treatment is typically performed by indigenous, aquatic microorganisms in a managed aerobic habitat. Bacteria and protozoa consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. sugars, fats, and organic short-chain carbon molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form cells of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0°C and 40°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4°C and 32°C.|$|E

50|$|<b>Settleable</b> solids are the {{particulates}} that settle {{out of a}} still fluid. <b>Settleable</b> solids can {{be quantified}} for a suspension using an Imhoff cone. The standard Imhoff cone of transparent glass or plastic holds one liter of liquid and has calibrated markings to measure the volume of solids accumulated {{in the bottom of}} the conical container after settling for one hour. A standardized Imhoff cone procedure is commonly used to measure suspended solids in wastewater or stormwater runoff. The simplicity of the method makes it popular for estimating water quality.|$|E
50|$|A {{test for}} <b>settleable</b> solids in water, {{wastewater}} and stormwater uses an Imhoff cone, {{with or without}} stopcock. The volume of solids is measured after a specified time period {{at the bottom of}} a one-liter cone using graduated markings.|$|E
5000|$|A {{settling}} basin, {{settling pond}} or decant pond is an earthen or concrete structure using sedimentation to remove <b>settleable</b> matter and turbidity from wastewater. The basins {{are used to}} control water pollution in diverse industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and mining. [...] Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water. Although turbidity often varies directly with weight or volumetric measurements of <b>settleable</b> matter, correlation is complicated by variations in size, shape, refractive index, and specific gravity of suspended matter. [...] Settling ponds may be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion.|$|E

50|$|Sewage sludge {{treatment}} describes the processes used {{to manage and}} dispose of sewage sludge produced during sewage treatment. Sludge is mostly water with lesser amounts of solid material removed from liquid sewage. Primary sludge includes <b>settleable</b> solids removed during primary treatment in primary clarifiers. Secondary sludge separated in secondary clarifiers includes treated sewage sludge from secondary treatment bioreactors.|$|E
50|$|Removal of {{suspended}} particles by sedimentation {{depends upon the}} size and specific gravity of those particles. Suspended solids retained on a filter may remain in suspension if their specific gravity is similar to water while very dense particles passing through the filter may settle. <b>Settleable</b> solids are measured as the visible volume accumulated {{at the bottom of}} an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour.|$|E
5000|$|Total {{dissolved}} solids are differentiated from {{total suspended solids}} (TSS), in that the latter cannot pass through a sieve of two micrometers and yet are indefinitely suspended in solution. The term [...] "settleable solids" [...] refers to material of any size that will not remain suspended or dissolved in a holding tank not subject to motion, and excludes both TDS and TSS. <b>Settleable</b> solids may include larger particulate matter or insoluble molecules.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{alternative}} treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains <b>settleable</b> solids, grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, fixed-media filtration, and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.|$|E
50|$|HDS systems use {{the physics}} of flowing water to remove a variety of {{pollutants}} and are characterized by an internal structure that either creates a swirling vortex or plunges the water into the main sump. Along with supplemental features to reduce velocity, an HDS system is designed to separate floatables (trash, debris and oil) and <b>settleable</b> particles, like sediment, from stormwater. HDS systems are not effective {{for the removal of}} very fine solids or dissolved pollutants. The systems are also subject to scour and sediment washout during large storm events, e.g. a 10-year storm.|$|E
50|$|In two {{measurements}} in 1968, {{the specific}} conductance of Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 199 to 288 micro-siemens per centimeter at 25 C. The pH was measured {{to range from}} 4.4 to 8.8 and the acidity concentration ranged from 0 to 260 milligrams per liter in the 1960s and 1970s. The concentration of suspended solids ranged from 0 to 250 milligrams per liter and the concentration of <b>settleable</b> solids ranged between 0 and 4 milligrams per liter. The concentration of water hardness ranged from 12 to 160 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5000|$|Primary {{treatment}} of sewage is removal of floating and <b>settleable</b> solids through sedimentation. Primary clarifiers reduce the content of suspended solids and pollutants embedded in those suspended solids. Because of {{the large amount of}} reagent necessary to treat domestic wastewater, preliminary chemical coagulation and flocculation are generally not used, remaining suspended solids being reduced by following stages of the system. However, coagulation and flocculation can be used for building a compact treatment plant (also called a [...] "package treatment plant"), or for further polishing of the treated water.|$|E
50|$|Solid {{material}} in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled. Total dissolved solids or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is measured as {{the mass of}} residue remaining when a measured volume of filtered water is evaporated. The mass of dried solids remaining on the filter is called total suspended solids (TSS) or nonfiltrable residue. <b>Settleable</b> solids are measured as the visible volume accumulated {{at the bottom of}} an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour. Turbidity {{is a measure of the}} light scattering ability of suspended matter in the water. Salinity measures water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials.|$|E
50|$|Spent {{backwash}} {{water is}} either discharged without treatment to a sanitary sewer system or is treated and recycled within the plant. Historically, backwash water was discharged directly to surface water supplies; however, direct discharge is now highly regulated through NPDES discharge permits {{and is often}} discouraged. Used backwash water contains high concentrations of particulate material. Typical treatment processes include coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. High molecular weight synthetic organic polymers are sometimes added to facilitate the formation of <b>settleable</b> floc. Failure of a backwash treatment process and reintroduction of the resulting poor quality water into the main water purification plant flow stream can cause overall process upsets and result {{in the production of}} poor quality treated drinking water.|$|E
50|$|In Peru, {{the norm}} has only few {{parameters}} with limits. These parameters are: temperature (35 °C), fats and oil (100 mg/lt), PH (5 - 8.5), BOD (1000 mg/lt) and <b>settleable</b> solids. However {{a more comprehensive}} norm {{was developed by the}} ministry of housing, which now is under review and analysis of the environment ministry. In the present article, the values presented are the ones under approval. This new regulation was developed because of the damage that industrial wastewater is causing to the sewer system. For example, in year 2006 a study showed that 58% of the sample (24 companies) surpassed the limit of BOD5 established in the current norm. In the same year other study showed that 57% of the sample (9 companies) surpassed the same norm.|$|E

50|$|The {{feasibility}} {{study showed that}} the aerobic granular sludge technology seems very promising (de Bruin et al., 2004. Based on total annual costs a GSBR (Granular sludge sequencing batch reactors) with pre-treatment and a GSBR with post-treatment proves to be more attractive than the reference activated sludge alternatives (6-16%).A sensitivity analysis shows that the GSBR technology is less sensitive to land price and more sensitive to rain water flow. Because of the high allowable volumetric load the footprint of the GSBR variants is only 25% compared to the references. However, the GSBR with only primary treatment cannot meet the present effluent standards for municipal wastewater, mainly because of exceeding the suspended solids effluent standard caused by washout of not well <b>settleable</b> biomass.|$|E
50|$|The Kingdom of Norway {{maintains}} {{some claim}} to territories lost at {{the dissolution of}} the Denmark-Norway union. The Norwegian Empire, which was the Norwegian territories at its maximum extent, included Iceland, the <b>settleable</b> areas of Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Shetland among others. Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the Kalmar Union, the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from Denmark to Sweden, the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark. In 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the Ihlen Declaration, which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the Permanent Court of International Justice. Norway formerly included the provinces Jämtland, Härjedalen, Idre, Särna (lost since the Second Treaty of Brömsebro), and Bohuslän (lost since the Treaty of Roskilde), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the Thirty Years' War and Second Northern War.|$|E
50|$|Typically fresh {{wastewater}} has a musty odor and is cloudy with a grayish coloration as it {{is fresh}} and untreated. When deprived of oxygen the water becomes black from further with a foul odor. The odor is that of rotten eggs and the water becomes corrosive inviting problems to form in the pipes, so usually treatment workers {{try to keep it}} from getting too oxygen deprived while in pipes. Temperature can be anywhere between 45-75 F, but the temperature of water entering the system usually does not affect the pond, because it is designed to handle a variety of temperatures. The pH of the system is a huge factor in pond water characteristics with the water either being acidic 0.0-7.0 or basic 7.0-14.0. The pH levels are monitored {{to make sure that the}} water does not get too acidic and start to corrode the pipes. It is most desirable for the water to be more basic so as to prevent corrosion from the acid. Another set of characteristics is the contents of the water, like solids, suspended solids and dissolved solids. Dissolved solids are able to pass through most filters whereas suspended solids are just particles suspended in the water column easily caught in strainers or filters. Solids is just a general term for what would remain if all of the water was evaporated from a sample of the wastewater. To get into more technical terms colloidal solids are particles that are so small that they will not settle by gravity on their own. <b>Settleable</b> solids are pretty much self-explanatory as they are the solids that will settle on their own in a given period of time.|$|E

Overview Section 303 (d) (1) (C) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) implementing regulations (40 CFR Part 130) require the establishment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the achievement of state water quality standards when a waterbody is water quality-limited. A TMDL identifies the degree of pollution control needed to maintain compliance with standards using an appropriate margin of safety. The focus of the TMDL is the reduction of pollutant inputs to a level (or "load") that fully supports the designated uses of a given waterbody. The mechanisms used to address water quality problems after the TMDL is developed can include best management practices and/or effluent limits and monitoring required unde...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of water quality {{in terms of}} variables like dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), pH value, total dissolved solids (TDS) and salinity etc. is useful for evaluating the use of water for various related purposes. The widely used Streeter and Phelps models for computing biochemical oxygen demand {{and its impact on}} dissolved oxygen do not account for the <b>settleable</b> component of BOD and related implications. The model also does not account for the impact of storage zone on the stream’s DO. In the present work an attempt is made to develop a model which simultaneously accounts for the <b>settleable</b> component of BOD and the effect of storage zones onriver’s DO. An application of the model to real field data suggests that the cumulative impact of <b>settleable</b> BOD and presence of storage zone in the river is to shift the critical deficit closer to the point source and magnify its amount...|$|E
40|$|Particulate air {{pollutants}} from industrial emissions {{and natural resource}} exploitation represent {{an important contribution to}} soil contamination. These atmospheric particles, usually <b>settleable</b> particulate (which settle by gravity) are deposited on the ground through both dry and wet depositions. The most direct consequences of {{air pollutants}} on the ground are acidification and salinization, not to mention the pollution that can cause heavy metals as components of suspended particulate matter. A study of heavy metal concentrations in the <b>settleable</b> particulate matter in two locations has been performed with the aim to assess the influence of air pollution on soil composition. These two locations, (Almazora and Vila-real) are within the ceramic cluster of Castellón (Spain) and they have high industrial density. <b>Settleable</b> particulate samples were collected with a PS Standard British captor (MCV-PS 2) for monthly periods between January 2007 and December 2009. Heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Ni, Sb and Bi) have been analysed in the soluble fraction of <b>settleable</b> air particles using ICP-MS. The results related to the heavy metal concentration over the observation period show a high seasonal variability for heavy metal content in <b>settleable</b> particulate and a strong dependence on the rainfall in the study area. The maximum values of heavy metals were obtained in spring or autumn coinciding with the highest rainfall, while the lowest values were generally obtained during periods of low rainfall (summer). The annual variation of the results obtained in both populations shows a decline over the study period in the concentrations of heavy metals analysed. This fact is associated with the steady implementation of corrective measures in the main industrial enterprises in the area based on the treatment of mineral raw materials. Moreover, this decline is, in turn, a lower quantity of heavy metals entering the soil, which results in the presence of soils with low contamination by heavy metals in the sampling area...|$|E
40|$|The quantum {{mechanics}} of closed {{systems such as}} the universe is formulated using an extension of familiar probability theory that incorporates negative probabilities. Probabilities must be positive for sets of alternative histories that are the basis of fair <b>settleable</b> bets. However, in {{quantum mechanics}} there are sets of alternative histories that can be described but which cannot {{be the basis for}} fair <b>settleable</b> bets. Members of such sets can be assigned extended probabilities that are sometimes negative. A prescription for extended probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all histories that can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets of histories that are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of <b>settleable</b> bets. This formulation is compared with the decoherent (consistent) histories formulation of quantum theory.

40|$|A top-loading {{settling}} {{column is}} described {{and used to}} characterize the settling properties of the solids in the discharge water from a commercial rainbow trout production facility. Mass-based and phosphorus-based settling curves are presented. The median settling velocity on a mass-basis for the <b>settleable</b> solids was 1. 7 cm s 1. The median settling velocity for the <b>settleable</b> phosphorus was 1. 15 cm s 1. Manually stripping fecal material from rainbow trout resulted in <b>settleable</b> solids with a median settling velocity of 0. 7 cm s 1. Examination of the settling velocity curves show that halving the overflow rate (OFR) from 2 to 1 cm s 1 changes the removal efficiency from 0. 61 to 0. 73, an increase of about 20 %. Halving the OFR again to 0. 5 cm s 1 increases the removal efficiency to 0. 81, an improvement of about 11 %. Settling characteristics of aquacultural solids will vary from facility to facility.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{realistic}} values of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), an ultrasonic flow meter and an automatic water sampler were installed at the basin outlet for three Reno tributaries (Bologna Apennine, Italy). The basins have a similar geological setting: in the Sillaro basin, however, clays represent the dominant feature; in the Lavino basin, sandstone and clay marl are widely present; and {{the main part of}} the Savena watershed is characterised by sandrock, pebbly sandstone and clay marls. These differences are recognisable in the particle size distribution of the suspended sediment samples collected in these basins. The aim of this work is to estimate the SSCs of river water samples with two indirect methods, turbidity measurement and free <b>settleable</b> solids in Imhoff cones, and the relations with suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Alongside these investigations, laboratory analyses were performed in order to validate these methods under controlled conditions. The turbidity measurements were highly significant, but their reliability was influenced by the concentration and the particle size distribution. In order to estimate the SSCs, it was necessary to establish specific regression curves for each stream. The estimate of the SSC obtained through a free <b>settleable</b> solids analysis was not only reliable but also less sensitive to sample characteristics. The measure of the <b>settleable</b> solids after 1 and 24 h presented a constant relationship in all the samples from the three streams, due to the compaction of the sediment. The measure of the <b>settleable</b> solids after 24 h gave a better estimate of the SSC.

40|$|Investigating {{linkages}} between the compositions of suspended (seston) and benthic particulate matter {{is important to}} the understanding of organic matter (OM) cycling and nutrient retention in aquatic systems. We compared {{the quantity and quality of}} the truly suspended (TS) and <b>settleable</b> (SB) fractions of seston as well as benthic particulate matter in the tidal freshwater James River, Virginia. The mass of seston and OM was consistently higher in the TS fraction compared to the SB fraction. OM was preferentially retained in the TS fraction relative to seston. The proportional contribution of OM constituents (chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen) to the two fractions was consistent across observed concentrations whereas increases in seston concentration resulted in decreased proportions in the TS fraction. Benthic constituent reservoirs were large relative to the SB fraction but the higher proportion of OM in the SB fraction suggests that the <b>settleable</b> material was more labile...|$|E
30|$|Coagulation entails {{addition}} of coagulant to water {{in order to}} neutralize the charges on the colloidal particles, thus eliminating the repulsive forces that keep the particles apart, so that the particles come close enough to stick together.

40|$|Settling ponds {{properly}} designed, constructed, operated {{and maintained}} are absolutely necessary for improving effluent water quality.

The control of erosion of disturbed areas by surface runoff should also be incorporated into an overall sediment control plan. Settling ponds are used at placer mines for clarifying water due to their efficiency, simplicity and low cost. Settling ponds are efficient at removing <b>settleable</b> solids, generally those soil particles greater in size than from 0. 002 to 0. 02 mm in diameter. Settling ponds will permit the <b>settleable</b> solids, which includes the fine sand and silt fractions, to accumulate but are not successful in eliminating the turbidity caused by the presence of finely dispersed particles in the clay size range...|$|E
40|$|International audienceImplementation of the European Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD) {{requires}} Member States {{to expand}} their collective knowledge of priority pollutants (PPs) within receiving waters. To achieve this objective, information on the occurrence of PPs in surface waters and, more specifically, within densely urbanized areas needs to be collected. This study has therefore been designed to provide information on both PP occurrence and concentration build-up along a heavily urbanized transect of the Seine River in the Paris region (France). A large range of PPs were observed in <b>settleable</b> particles and, to a lesser extent, in the waters surveyed. In surface waters, a total of 18 PPs, including 15 priority hazardous substances, were indeed detected, yet concentrations rarely exceeded the limit of quantification. In fact, only diuron, DEHP, fluoranthene and para-tert-octylphenol are observed on a frequent basis, with concentrations ranging from < 0. 01 to 1. 0 microg l(- 1). As regards the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), 10 substances or groups of substances were found in surface waters to exhibit concentrations above the annual average value, while only the benzo(a) pyrene concentration exceed the maximum allowable level. As for the Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines, <b>settleable</b> particles collected in the Seine River appear to be heavily contaminated since most samples contain PP levels above the guideline values (18 PPs) and, in many cases, above the probable effect levels (15 PPs), which underscores that the levels of metals, PAHs and PCBs in <b>settleable</b> particles constitute a potential risk to freshwater organisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and industrial development achieved {{in our society}} is reducing air quality, with far-reaching effects on health, vegetation, climate, and historic monuments. Air pollution {{can be caused by}} factories, heavy traffic, agriculture, or other sources. One of the main pollutants in air is particulate matter. This particulate material includes <b>settleable</b> particles > 32 μm that remains airborne for relatively short periods of time and can be later sedimented, thus, the effects are most pronounced {{in the vicinity of the}} emitting sources. The study area is located in the town of Alcora, which is in the eastern region of the province of Castellón (Spain). The municipality of Alcora has a high density of industry, with a significant number of companies in the chemical and non-metallic mineral products industry. The area has a high traffic density due to the proximity of the town to various roads. These two factors point to a high concentration of atmospheric particulate pollutants. The aim of this study is to conduct a retrospective examination of changes in <b>settleable</b> particulate concentrations (quantify and measure concentrations), in the period between January 2000 and December 2005 and then analyse the particles to determine the mineralogical composition and origin of these particles. The work done indicated that the concentration levels of particulate sediments are within the allowable limits. Only twice were these values exceeded because of high precipitation and particulate intrusion from North Africa. The main mineral phases in the <b>settleable</b> particulate were quartz, illite and kaolinite, resulting from the activities of milling and grinding of raw materials used in the ceramic industry...|$|E
