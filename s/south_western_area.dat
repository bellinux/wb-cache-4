2500|$|In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish {{settlements}} on {{the northern}} and western coasts of the island were carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe, and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer {{to the city of}} Santo Domingo. This action, known as the Devastaciones de Osorio, proved disastrous; {{more than half of the}} resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped. [...] Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops - many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships. The settlements of La Yaguana, and Bayaja, on the west and north coasts respectively of modern-day Haiti were burned, as were the settlements of Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata on the north coast and San Juan de la Maguana in the <b>south</b> <b>western</b> <b>area</b> of the modern day Dominican Republic. French and English buccaneers took advantage of Spain's retreat into a corner of Hispaniola to settle the island of Tortuga, off the northwest coast of Hispaniola, in 1629. France established direct control in 1640, reorganizing it into an official colony and expanding to the north coast of Hispaniola itself, whose western end Spain ceded to France in 1697 under the Treaty of Ryswick. In 1655, Oliver Cromwell dispatched a fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir William Penn, to conquer Santo Domingo. After meeting heavy resistance, the English retreated, leaving behind more than 600 graves, 200 prisoners, and two siege-guns. Santo Domingo had suffered only thirty men killed.|$|E
