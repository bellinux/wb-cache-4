2500|$|Øyvind Skauenfeldt started leasing {{the airport}} from 1984, {{forwarding}} the lease to <b>Skylift,</b> which established a helicopter school at Jarlsberg. Sem Municipality attempted {{to resolve the}} issue by applying its right of first refusal to buy the airfield in 1985, and the following year launched plans to upgrade it to a [...] runway and establish it as public regional airport. The proposal was dismissed by Thor Solberg Aviation, who stated that the airport was not for sale. Sem Municipal Council abandoned the plans in 1987. Helifly established itself in 1989, the same year as Skauenfeldt's lease expired and Solberg failed to renew the operating license for the airport.

50|$|On Friday {{evening the}} show proper started as the spider 'stood up' {{to its full}} height {{and began to walk}} away from the arena. A huge crowd turned out, despite the heavy rain, to see this {{impressive}} sight. It walked around the Albert Dock area and proceeded onto the Strand main road, which was closed for the evening. A moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the big crowd, which made for an interesting crowd control challenge at times. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and touched various objects at the roadside, including the odd umbrella of a member of the public. At all times it was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of fortlift trucks and <b>skylifts.</b> This provided the event with its own impressive soundtrack as the beast moved along.|$|R

50|$|On 11 August 2012, a train stalled near Tun Sambanthan in Brickfields. The {{breakdown}} caused 183 {{passengers to}} be trapped {{for about two}} hours. The air conditioning system in the carriage was stopped when the power supply was cut. As a result, some passengers had to break the windows to allow air in while awaiting rescue. Fire and Rescue Department personnel later used a <b>skylift</b> to rescue passengers trapped in the carriage. Investigation revealed that the issue was due to a power supply disruption at the circuit breaker, causing the auxiliary power system to fail.|$|E

5000|$|The Montgomery Zoo {{began as}} a small menagerie in 1920 in Oak Park in {{downtown}} Montgomery. Initially started as a small children’s zoo {{as a part of}} a local community park, the zoo housed alligators, monkeys, bears and assorted other animals. There was a small train and carousel for the children. The zoo closed down between 1960 and 1971 due to racial tensions, and an unwillingness to integrate. [...] In 1972, the Montgomery Zoo reopened at its current location. The zoo began with six acres, a small petting zoo for the children, assorted monkeys, a flight cage designed after the 1906 St. Louis World’s Fair, and a chimpanzee named Benji. In 1976, the Montgomery Zoo hosted its first fundraising event entitled Zoo Day. This initial event grew to become an annual event and is now called Zoo Weekend. Today, an average Zoo Weekend will host as many as 18,000 guests. In 1989, ground-breaking took place expanding the zoo to 40 acres. After two years of construction, the community welcomed a new zoo in 1991. Barrier-free and multi-species exhibits highlighted the expansion, as well as the zoo being divided into five continental realms: Africa, Australia, Asia, North America and South America. Since then the zoo has continued to grow and expand. In 1992, the cougar and lynx exhibit was opened in North American realm, the Reptile House, jaguar, and ocelot exhibit were completed in South America; and the new chimpanzee and colobus monkey exhibits opened in the Africa realm. In 1993, the Bengal tiger exhibit opened in the Asian realm with one white and one orange tiger. In 1995, the bald eagle exhibit opened in North American realm and Monkey Island was completely renovated in South America. In 1996, the American black bear exhibit opened and the first baby cheetah was born. A few years later in 1998, the maned wolf and Indian rhino exhibits opened. In 1999, the new front gate entrance and gift shop opened. In 2003, the Mann Wildlife Learning Museum was completed and opened on zoo property. In 2004, the African elephant exhibit opened, housing three female elephants. In March 2008, the North American river otter exhibit opened featuring two river otters and an additional habitat for an alligator snapping turtle. In June 2010, the zoo opened the Giraffe Encounter and feeding stations at the river otters and koi fish ponds. The following year, both the Parakeet Cove and Horse Trail Rides were added as animal encounters. In August 2012, the Zoofari <b>Skylift</b> Ride was completed. Two months later, the Birmingham Zoo's two male lions, Baron and Vulcan were displayed in their exhibit at the African realm. Two years later, these two lions were sent to Salt Lake City's Hogle Zoo to breed with Woodland Park Zoo's two lionesses. The new American alligator habitat opened with four bachelor males in summer 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Reggie was {{explaining}} to Captain Lockman {{about how they}} failed to get the Kraken {{to get some of}} its blood. He then reveals Olaff Hargover is in hostage by a group of villains. Soon, at Norway, Lockman lets Steppenwolf go and keeps Meg hostage. After Meg knocks him out with a pile of dead fish, she goes {{to the other side of}} the ship and goes into Olaff's workshop and sees a submarine with a curtain. After removing the curtain from the sub, it is revealed that a bomb is on the sub. After putting the bomb on a speed boat and exploding at a far distance, a girl named Oola enters the workshop. She said that her father is in hostage by a group of villains now known as the Dagger League. Meanwhile, we see a man driving Steppenwolf to Olaff's house. The man drops Steppenwolf next to the house. As Steppenwolf enters the house, the house is wrecked and Olaff is seen tied up on the sofa with his left leg missing. He told Steppenwolf to look out. But it was too late. A member of the Dagger League has knocked out Steppenwolf out and tied him up on a chair. Fortunately, a dagger was near Steppenwolf and he grabs it with his legs and he unties himself and unties Olaff. There were about three of four Dagger League members. Olaff told Steppenwolf to get him artificial leg so they can all escape. After he crushes the first Dagger League member with a shelve with books, Steppenwolf finds Olaff's artificial leg upstairs on the bed and as he swings on a chandelier and gets back and he fixes Olaff's left leg by using the mechanical leg and he has a new leg. After Steppenwolf has killed the second Dagger League member, he and Olaff escape from the house. They then see a <b>skylift</b> that will take them to the other side for safety, but the path is broken. However, Steppenwolf jumps over the holes and he uses a big mallet and smashes the outside wall of the building where a piece of the wall falls and covers one of the holes and this makes Olaff safely cross over. As they cross over, two Dagger League members try to kill them by breaking the wires for the lifter to fall. However, Steppenwolf has managed to get the lifter to safety. They head to the oil works and as they enter the workshop, they find Meg and Oola. Oola told her father to put down his project hold for a while, because she said it is becoming far too dangerous. Olaff said to his daughter that the project is exactly what the Dagger League want. But the Dagger League don't realize that Olaff has a got a bone to stickclarification needed with the [...] "creature from hell".|$|E
