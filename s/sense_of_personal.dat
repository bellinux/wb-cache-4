I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will feel a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky {{lives in}} Moscow, Russia {{with his wife}} and five children. He and his first wife were {{divorced}} in 1998. On 21 April 2011, his son, Ivan, then 20, was kidnapped for a $4.4 million ransom. Kaspersky worked with a friend at the FSB and Russian police to trace the ransomer's phone call. They set up a trap for the ransomers, where they rescued his son and arrested many of the kidnappers. The incident had an influence on Kaspersky's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> security. He now travels with a bodyguard and security detail.|$|E

Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner {{inspired}} by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E

While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second Great Awakening(18001830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> salvation as experienced in revival meetings.|$|E

To effectively and comfortably manage the di sclosure <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> information, end-users will require a coherent conceptual model of privacy and convenient user interfaces to manage it. We describe a conceptual framework designed to support personal privacy management in ubiquitous computing by empowering users to adjust the precision of disclosed information. The framework relies on three key strategies: encapsulation, a priori configuration, and manual configuration. We describe a prototypical user interface built to instantiate this framework and we report {{the results of a}} formative evaluation of the framework. Results show our approach is superior to simple, automated disclosure paradigms but can be further refined...|$|R

Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.|$|E

A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

Gleaned from the author's 31 years of clinical experience, from research, and from the observations of other clinicians, some of these barriers represent limitations that are confined primarily to one of the parameters of love, while others affect the entirety of them. These barriers are, in the order that they will be discussed, (a) an inability to understand and treat persons as persons, (b) a lack of understanding and appreciation for love itself, (c) personal needs or motives that preclude deep investment in the person of another, (d) hypercritical tendencies that interfere with respecting and admiring others, and (e) <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> ineligibility for the love of other persons." ...|$|R

A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older).

A picturesque tale, first found in the manuscript chronicle of Dunmow, tells how Fitzwalter had a very beautiful daughter named Matilda, who indignantly rejected the immoral advances of King John. At last, as the maiden proved obdurate, John caused her to be poisoned, so that the bitterest <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> wrong drove Fitzwalter {{to take up the}} part of a constitutional leader.
