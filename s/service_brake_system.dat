Study {{about the}} {{performance}} of the <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> and the retardation systems of commercial vehicles during the descending speed control on roads with long length steep inclination in Brazil. Mathematical models, based in the equations of the energy balance during the vehicle braking process are used. The thermal performance of the <b>service</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> of the engine cooling system, and of retarders, are verified for the established maximum safety speeds for a vehicle traveling downhill. The simulations are performed with programs elaborated in the Matlab-Simulink platform and with the vehicles as per the European norm ECE R 13 requirements (test type II A) and the Brazilian norm requirement (NBR 10967) for the downhill functional test (test type III). The obtained results show {{that it is possible to}} have a forecast of the dissipated power in the engine and the retarder, of the capacity of dissipated heat of the radiator, and other parameters to guarantee the effective speed control of the vehicle, as per the requirements of the norms, even before the road test are performed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> has several advantages over traditional <b>brake</b> actuation <b>systems.</b> These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> Implementation of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> using a test bench, which is a loader <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> dynamics...|$|R
50|$|The drive {{terminal}} is {{also the}} location of a lift's primary <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> is located on the drive shaft beside the main drive, before the gearbox. The emergency brake acts directly on the bullwheel. While not technically a brake, an anti-rollback device (usually a cam) also acts on the bullwheel. This prevents the potentially disastrous situation of runaway reverse operation.|$|R
50|$|During the 17 to 26 {{months that}} the {{emergency}} <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was not operating, the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was tested daily, {{but since the}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> and emergency brake were tested simultaneously, {{there was no way}} to tell if the emergency brake was functioning without looking at the brake pads or hydraulic pressure gauges during the test. The test was always performed with the Sinai car traveling uphill, which meant that when the power was cut and the brakes applied (as part of the test), Sinai’s momentum caused the car to continue moving uphill a short distance (slackening the cable) and then to roll back from gravity, jerking the cable tight.|$|R

In this context, this study applies SERVQUAL for assessing service quality in a chain of car repair shops.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{there are}} multiple redundant <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> When a Normal Stop is activated from the control panel, the lift will be slowed and stopped using regenerative braking through the electric motor and the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> located on the highspeed shaft between the gearbox and electric motor. When an Emergency Stop is activated all power is cut to the motor and the emergency brake or bull-wheel brake is activated. In {{the case of a}} rollback, some lifts utilize a ratchet like system to prevent the bull-wheel from spinning backwards while newer installations utilize sensors which activate one or more bull-wheel <b>brakes.</b> All <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> are fail-safe in that a loss of power or hydraulic pressure will activate the brake. Older chairlifts, for example 1960's-era Riblet Tramway Company lifts, have a hydraulic release emergency brake with pressure maintained by a hydraulic solenoid. If the emergency brake/stop button is depressed by any control panel, the lift cannot be restarted until the hydraulic brake is hand-pumped to proper operating pressure.|$|R

Due to this <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and GVWR under 26001 lb, the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states. Even California does NOT require a CDL to operate an M35 on public roads because even though it has three axles and an air-assisted <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> the maximum gross weight is still under 26000 lb, making it eligible for class C on-road driving; and because the primary <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is hydraulic, not air.|$|R

50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring brake}} relay valve {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
50|$|The SWS {{characteristics}} were deeply analysed during {{and at the}} end of the testing period, when it had done 80 000 km. In the point of view of the driver, the performance is good and partly better than with a diesel bus. The only additional effort compared to a diesel bus comes from minding of the poles. The electrical <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is efficient, and therefore the lifetime of the <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> is longer. The drive motor at the rear axle is excessively noisy due to vibrations; the same issue concerns on the diesel engine. The heating system and main inverter cooling would need a further development. While the diesel generator ensured the power supply, the extra weight was seen as a drawback. The old and worn cables above the streets caused problems during service.|$|R
