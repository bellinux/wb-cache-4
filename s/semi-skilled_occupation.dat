40|$|This study {{examines}} the associations between lifecourse adversity and physical performance {{in old age}} in different societies of North and South America and Europe. We used data from the baseline survey of the International Study of Mobility in Aging, conducted in: Kingston (Canada), Saint-Hyacinthe (Canada), Natal (Brazil), Manizales (Colombia) and Tirana (Albania). The study population was composed of community dwelling people between 65 and 74 years of age, recruiting 200 men and 200 women at each site. Physical Performance was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Economic and social adversity was estimated from childhood adverse events, low education, <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations</b> during adulthood and living alone and insufficient income in old age. A total of 1995 people were assessed. Low physical performance was associated with childhood social and economic adversity, <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations,</b> living alone and insufficient income. Physical performance was lower in participants living in Colombia, Brazil and Albania than in Canada counterparts, despite adjustment for lifecourse adversity, age and sex. We show evidence of the early origins {{of social and economic}} inequalities in physical performance during old age in distinct populations and for the independent and cumulative disadvantage of low socioeconomic status during adulthood and poverty and living alone in later life...|$|R

Casual employment was very unstable, with very few individuals remaining in this state. In contrast, there was little mobility out of regular employment into other kinds of employment.

30|$|One of {{the more}} puzzling effects is that we find {{that in spite of}} the high {{concentration}} of Mexican immigrants in occupation ranges in which we find African-Americans that have very low education (less than high school-level education or are high school dropouts), there is no significant effect of Mexican immigrants on wages of African-Americans as a group in this education category. Following a formal model of occupation segmentation, we confirm that there is stronger pressure on wages of African-Americans in the more integrated occupations than there is in occupations with a strong Hispanic/Mexican immigrant niche. In other words, African-Americans compete, to a lesser degree, in “Hispanic/Mexican occupations”, while the more relevant “competition” between African-Americans and Hispanic/Mexican immigrants may be in more integrated, <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations.</b> In addition, we assess the effect on wages of African-Americans being clustered in certain occupations themselves. The result of this exercise shows, all else equal, that {{there appears to be a}} tendency for African-Americans to face a greater “wage penalty” or lower returns in predominantly black occupations, even after controlling for a number of characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Early feminist {{literature}} {{focused on}} gender disadvantage in analysing difference {{between women and}} men. These issues were almost always viewed from a white middle-class standpoint, and issues of race/ethnicity, as well and many other social characteristics were not scrutinized. As the voices of Black feminist scholars began to emerge, they argued that their disadvantage was viewed through the privileged lens of the white-woman's experience. Kimberl頃renshaw (1989), a prominent Black female lawyer, insisted that gender and race be studied together to fully understand how they create multiple-disadvantage for women of colour, and coined 'intersectionality' {{as a way of}} theorising more deeply about gender and race issues. This paper focuses on the job-seeking experiences of skilled migrant women in Australia and the disadvantage they experience due to gender and race issues.

30|$|For African-Americans in “Hispanic occupations”, a 1 {{percentage}} point {{increase in the}} share of Mexican immigrants in the PUMA {{is associated with a}} decrease in wages of 2.1  %. By contrast, for African-Americans in integrated, non-Hispanic-dominated occupations, a 1 {{percentage point}} increase in the share of Mexican immigrants in the PUMA corresponds to a stronger decrease in wages of 3.8  %. Similarly, for African-Americans in “Hispanic occupations”, a 1 percentage point increase in the density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations corresponds to a decrease in wages for African-Americans of 2.9  %. For African-Americans in more integrated occupations, a 1 percentage point increase in the density of Hispanic immigrants in those occupations is associated with an 8.2  % decrease in wages. These results suggest that, contrary to what intuition might dictate, there is stronger pressure on wages of African-Americans in the more integrated occupations than there is in occupations with a strong Hispanic immigrant niche. In other words, African-Americans compete, to a lesser degree, in “Hispanic occupations” with strong market segmentation, while the more relevant “competition” between African-Americans and Hispanic immigrants may be in more integrated, possibly <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations,</b> such as production and transportation, or even more-skilled professional occupations.|$|R

Over {{the next eight}} years, this rate grew to 34. 1 per cent, then remained close to that point until 1982, when it began to increase again. Over the following ten years, the rate more than doubled, growing from 36. 3 per cent in 1982 to 77. 1 per cent in 1992. The rate peaked in 1992, and has remained above 72 per cent into the 2000 s. In 2002, the Year 7 - 12 apparent retention rate was 75. 1 per cent. 1 While {{the apparent}} retention rate is often mistakenly considered a Year 12 completion rate, it does rise and fall as the completion rate rises and falls, and is a reasonable proxy for monitoring trends {{in the proportion of}} students who participate in senior secondary school education.

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComSouth African labour {{relations}} {{are associated with}} a history of extensive discrimination and segregation, subject to various types of discrimination during the apartheid era, including employment discrimination. This study explores the effect of Affirmative Action on the reduction (if any) of employment discrimination since the advent of democracy. It investigates whether the extent of employment discrimination by race and gender has decreased, 20 years since the economic transition. The first part of the study gives an overview of the South African labour legislations, both discriminative legislations and statutes aimed at redressing the imbalances of the past. The empirical part of the paper employs a sample that represents the labour force (excluding informal sector workers, agricultural workers, domestic workers and self-employed) aged between 15 and 65 years. The methodology in this study firstly estimates probit models describing the labour force participation, employment and occupational attainment, followed by the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, using data from OHS 1997 - 1999, LFS 2000 - 2007, QLFS 2008 - 2014 and NIDS 2008 - 2012. The OHS/LFS/QLFS decomposition results show that the unexplained component of the White-Black employment probability gap does not reveal any strong downward trend overtime. Also, results on the occupational attainment gap indicate that there was an increasing occupational attainment probability gap between Whites and Blacks which was partially driven by an increase in the unexplained component. This implies that Affirmative Action was not successful in reducing racial discrimination in the South African labour market. Additionally, the unexplained component is most dominant in the male-female employment gap decomposition. This suggests employment discrimination against females is very serious. However, the male-female highly-skilled employment likelihood shows no clear trend over time.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the ornamental horticultural employment opportunities in the metropolitan area of Omaha, Nebraska. The problem was defined in terms of the following objectives : (1) to identify employment opportunities by clusters of job titles or occupational areas; (2) to determine trends of occupational opportunities existing in the field of ornamental horticulture; and (3) to identify selected characteristics of employees in ornamental horticulture businesses: (a) level of education desired for future employees, and (b) ages of employees. Methods. The region of study, or universe, was designated as Omaha, Nebraska. For purposes of this study, only those firms and businesses that used an Omaha mailing address were included in the universe. The occupational family of ornamental horticulture was categorized on the. basis of the major function of the firm. The seven categories were: (1) Wholesale Florists; (2) Retail Florists; (3) Landscape Service; (4) Golf Courses; (5) Tree Service; (6) Nurseryman; and (7) Retail Vendor of Nursery Stock. Lists of firms and businesses were then compiled. Firms listed in categories 1 through 5 were taken from the yellow pages of the Omaha Telephone Directory, May 1969 edition. The firms listed in categories 6 and 7 were taken from the 1970 List of Nebraska Nurserymen, published by the Nebraska State Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry. This list contains names of all firms and businesses that are commercially involved with producing and selling perennial plants. All lists were cross checked to avoid duplications, and a table of random numbers was used to select a 25 percent random sample from each of these 7 categories. These firms and businesses were then contacted to obtain data. The data collection instrument used combined features of questionnaires used by Blezek and Zikmund at the University of Nebraska, Meaders at Michigan State University, and Griffin at the University of Missouri. Selected firms and businesses were then contacted to obtain data. Findings. There will be an average annual increase of 58 full-time men employees and 12 full-time women employees between 1970 and 1975. The largest number of new full-time employees will be in <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations,</b> with 112 new full-time men employees needed between 1970 and 1975. The number of new full-time employees needed in professional occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 36 men and 44 women employees. The number of new full-time employees needed in skilled occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 56 men employees. The number of new full-time employees needed in technical occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 36 men and 4 women employees. The number of new full-time employees needed in sales occupations in the period 1970 - 1975 will increase by 20 men employees and decrease by 8 women employees. The number of new full-time employees needed in managerial occupations in the period 1970 - 1975 will increase by 8 men employees and 4 women employees. There will be an average annual increase of 88 parttime men employees and 56 part-time women employees. The largest number of new part-time employees will be needed in <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations,</b> with 44 new part-time men employees needed between 1970 and 1975. The number of new part-time 2 ̆ 7 employees needed in professional occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 16 men and 20 women employees. The number of new part-time employees needed in technical occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 28 women employees. The number of new parttime employees needed in skilled occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 24 men employees. The number of new part-time employees needed in sales occupations will increase in the 1970 - 1975 period by 4 men and 8 women employees. The number of new part-time employees needed in managerial occupations will increase in the period 1970 - 1975 by 4 men employees. A total of 64 persons employed were 61 years of age or over. Because these persons will probably retire at age 65, the replacement of these employees can be considered as employment opportunities. A high majority of employers desired that employees have a high school education at almost all levels of employment.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of trade on the labour market in Malaysia. Specifically, we study {{the impact of a}} tariff cut in the motor vehicle {{industry}} on the different occupational wages and employment. Tariffs {{played an important role in}} Malaysia’s economic development; from an import-competing economy to an export-oriented economy. The literature on trade, wages and employment for Malaysia is limited because of inadequate occupational data to carry out econometric analysis. To fill this gap, we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for the Malaysian labour market, MyAGE_LM to analyze {{the effects of}} a reduction in motor vehicle tariffs. CGE models have theoretical rigour and extensive analytical capabilities for carrying out policy analysis. This thesis contributes to the literature by (i) Introducing labour supply with nine different occupational groups into the dynamic CGE model for Malaysia and (ii) Analyzing a reduction in the motor vehicle tariff rate in Malaysia. The policy simulation is a 5 per cent cut in the motor vehicle tariff rate. To facilitate the analysis of the tariff cut, the MyAGE_LM model incorporates the labour market mechanism similar to that of Dixon and Rimmer (2003; 2008). The simulation results for the impact of the tariff cut on macroeconomic indicators, sectoral outputs and nine categories of occupational wages and employment are presented. The results are analyzed in terms of major model mechanisms. The macroeconomic results of the tariff cut indicate that in the short run, with the government aiming for revenue neutrality through increased labour taxes, there would be a small welfare gain. We also found that in the short run, exports fell despite real devaluation. So, the export sectors do not benefit in the short run. In the long run, aggregate real wages increase, and there is an economy-wide gain in GDP and aggregate consumption. The sectoral results revealed that most export-oriented industries would experience an increase in output. There are some evident effects on occupational wages and employment. The occupational group that stands out is the semi-skilled occupational group, SklAgriFish. This occupational group experienced the biggest decrease in vacancies. SklAgriFish occupations do well because no workers in this occupation are employed in the motor vehicle industry. Also, a significant proportion of SklAgriFish workers are hired in the export-oriented Agriculture industry, and the Agriculture industry sells to FoodBevTob (which does well in the long run because of real devaluation). The PlantMachOpr occupation does relatively well because a high proportion of these workers is employed in OthMachEquip industry (export-oriented and a winner from tariff cut in the long run). In general, from the MyAGE_LM policy simulation, we find that the tariff cut did not have a significant impact on the labour market. There are only small changes in average real wages and employment. We find damped labour supply effects in both the short and the long run. <b>Semi-skilled</b> <b>occupations</b> gain relative to skilled and unskilled workers. Skilled workers do not do well.

40|$|As Australian {{society has}} changed over time, women have become more active {{participants}} in paid employment. Importantly, women, especially middle class women, make significant contributions to the economy. The principal aim of this thesis is to investigate factors that affect Australian middle class women&rsquo;s relationship with money and finance over time. It does so by investigating three factors that underpin financial capability. These are: 1. financial socialisation, which is foundational and predisposes an individual for future economic success; 2. economic inclusion, which enables a person to be financially literate {{to participate in the}} personal financial market, and 3. a fulfilling career that provides the opportunity for an individual to be well rewarded financially. With much research focused on low socioeconomic groups, the focus in this thesis is on middle class women, with class defined by income level. Prior to the 1960 s, most women worked in the unpaid domestic arena. It was only after the law and policies were changed to remove the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; in the public service sector that married women could fully participate in the labour market. These reforms plus two &lsquo;equal pay&rsquo; cases that were influential in 1969 and 1972 signalled women&rsquo;s move from the domestic to the economic realm. Women were now included in the labour force and were generally described as working class because they worked for low wages in unskilled or <b>semi-skilled</b> xi <b>occupations.</b> Married women who participated in paid work and advanced from work to create a career were seen as middle class women. The practical context in which this study arises is the problem that middle class women continue to face two main impediments in creating a secure financial future. One is that the gap in pay between women and men working full-time is nearly 20 percent. Another is that many women have interrupted work patterns due to family responsibilities. This problem is {{compounded by the fact that}} women now outlive men by at least five years, which means that, depending upon their retirement funding scheme, women will generally need more funds after they leave paid employment. This thesis argues that despite these difficulties, many middle class women have achieved their personal and economic goals. They have been able to do so because they have developed a strong capability and resilience. The thesis investigates the nature of this developmental process by employing a constructivist interpretive research methodology and using qualitative research methods. The empirical data was drawn from group discussions and face-to-face interviews with two distinct cohorts of women. The first cohort comprised twenty-two participants, of which five were adolescent women aged fourteen to sixteen years. The second consisted of twenty-six adult women, aged from their late twenties to mid-fifties. Analysis of these interviews resulted in the formulation of a conceptual model that identified the factors that influence women&rsquo;s financial capability. The thesis focused only on examining those women who were financially successful and not xii others. This thesis was anchored to factors that influenced financial capability and the role of socialisation, including socialisation theory, in this process. Six interlinked factors were identified that contribute to financial capability. First, the women&rsquo;s family provided adolescents with foundational economic knowledge. The next two factors, personal values and emotions, drove individuals&rsquo; decisions and behaviours. Fourth, experiences gained in various stages of life influenced these women&rsquo;s ability to manage finances. Fifth, the importance of relationships was a significant motivator for many women to be financially resilient. This is because caring for family and others occupied a substantial portion of their lives. Finally, and predictably, good financial decision making was fundamental to women&rsquo;s success or otherwise in providing for themselves and others. The thesis integrates these six factors into Sherraden&rsquo;s 2010 model of financial capability to provide a richer and more accurate account of the developmental process. Middle class women who are motivated by the values of independence, security and personal freedom tended to develop financial resilience, and thus were capable of managing their finances well. While family and &lsquo;significant others&rsquo; were initial influences in adolescence, the process of becoming financially capable was enriched by personal attributes, either inherited or learned from diverse life experiences. The external factor of financial inclusion, as well as formal and informal education in financial literacy, also assisted them in this developmental process. The significance of this thesis lies in demonstrating the range of diverse factors that xiii influence the evolution of women&rsquo;s financial capability. Without one or other of these factors, middle class women would be less able to manage their financial affairs, and thereby be even worse off when they retired...|$|R
