5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective of the Research This {{research}} {{explores the}} global <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies of technology intensive startup companies. By doing so, the study aims at narrowing the prevailing research gap in this area. Previous literature has primarily focused on large multinational corporation’s <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies and on mainly conceptual contributions. Thus, the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies of technology intensive startups have received limited attention, {{especially in the}} field of empirical research. Technology intensive startup companies often lack the knowledge and resources to develop detailed global <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies and thus, fail to sell their products to potential customers effectively. Therefore, it was seen as important to contribute to this crucial area of research. Given this, the objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate what determines a successful global <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy for a technology intensive startup. Methodology This study is qualitative and exploratory in nature. The utilized research method is a multiple case study, where four Finnish technology intensive startups were interviewed on their global <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies. The interviews aimed at identifying <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy best practices and success factors. An analytic induction approach, also known as abduction, was used for this research. In this approach, the researcher first deductively builds up a preliminary framework from existing theory, which is later inductively refined as a final analytical framework based on the empirical observations. Findings and Conclusions Based on the extensive literature review and in-depth empirical research, seven factors were found to determine the success of a global <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy for a technology intensive startup company. The found success factors were the following: clear company vision and strategy, <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> structure, <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> choice, high product quality, intermediary selection and support, seller competency and customer understanding. Especially the linkage of the overall company vision and strategy to the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy was seen as important for the success of the <b>sales</b> <b>channel.</b> This study contributes to existing theory by offering a holistic perspective to the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies of technology intensive startup companies and by finding critical success factors in this area. The main managerial implication of this thesis is the notion that <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies do have an impact on a startup’s success, as the employed <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy largely defines how and through which channel members the products are sold. This is why the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategy related matters require a significant amount of managerial consideration.

40|$|Objective of the Research Globalization of {{a company}} {{requires}} development of all strategies, including the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies, and utilization of new <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> structures. This thesis explores Finnish and Swedish ICT companies and their use of different <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies during their expansion to global markets. Based on a literature review on the internationalization and globalization {{of a company}} and <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies, the globalization drivers, global expansion phase and company resources were identified as potential influencing factors to strategy selection. Statistical analyses on the empirical data were conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} developed from theoretical framework. Methodology This study is quantitative and the data was analyzed using both descriptive and statistical methods, including binomial and multinomial logistic regression. The extensive database used in the thesis was collected for the GLOMARK study on global marketing strategies of both Finnish and Swedish ICT companies. A total of 2228 companies were contacted and 579 questionnaires were sent to the respondents qualified for the study. Altogether 424 companies completed the survey and database of the 261 respondents belonging to the research target group was created. However, {{for the purposes of this}} research, only companies classified as traditional internationals and globalizing internationals, total of 221 companies, were studied. Findings and Conclusions The findings of the thesis support the general view of the earlier studies that the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies need to be developed when companies move from traditional internationalizers to globalizing international phase. The results of the statistical analyses demonstrated that the <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies used by traditional internationalizers and globalizing internationals differ from each other. Both the global expansion phase and company resources were found to influence the use of multiple <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies. However, no support was found to the influence of globalizing drivers to the selection and use of <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies. The conclusion of the thesis is that in the ICT industry, globalizing internationals from SMOPECs’ with large sustainable resources increase the usage of multiple <b>sales</b> <b>channel</b> strategies in their foreign operations...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional methods, advanced demand modeling methods sense the expected impact of different decisions, understand {{the distinction between}} <b>sales</b> <b>channels,</b> anticipate {{the impact of the}} decisions, and create a unified view of the demand. For example, if the demand for a certain product is expected to increase by 5% due to a line extension, decrease by 2% due to a reduction in selling space and increase by 1% due to pricing decisions, the demand modeling engine takes all these factors into account in calculating the demand.|$|E
25|$|As sales progressed, Honda created {{two more}} <b>sales</b> <b>channels,</b> called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold {{products}} that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, {{such as the}} Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2009, General Motors {{announced}} the Chevrolet Caprice Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV). The Chevrolet Caprice is sold only {{to law enforcement}} agencies in the U.S. and Canadian market as of 2011. General Motors will not directly sell a Caprice PPV to the general public, however, some vehicles have been purchased by individuals via dealer <b>sales</b> <b>channels.</b> These included GM and dealer demonstrator vehicles, excess unsold dealer inventory, and purchases for demonstration use by law enforcement upfitters and other related businesses. The Caprice PPV is imported from Australia and is a captive import of the Holden Caprice from the WM range, not the short-wheelbase Holden Commodore from the VE Range, which is a main patrol car in Australia. However, these cars both share the Zeta platform. The Caprice comes with the 6.0L L77 AFM V8, which was standard in 2011 and has been optional since 2012; or the standard 3.6L LLT SIDI V6 engine, which became available nine months later. Both engines are E85 ethanol-capable.|$|E

25|$|The {{shift to}} smaller cars amid the oil crises doubled Japanese {{automobile}} market share from 10 to 20percent in the United States between 1970 and 1980; thus, causing economic {{tensions between the}} two nations. Toyota then began investigating the option of building a US production facility, following the announcements in January and April 1980 by Honda and Nissan, respectively, to manufacture automobiles locally. As investigations proceeded, Toyota proposed entering {{a joint venture with}} Ford in May 1980 to produce a compact car. Toyota advocated that its Camry be manufactured at a Ford factory and sold through the <b>sales</b> <b>channels</b> of both brands, but Ford deemed Camry to be in competition with a model it was developing, which became the Ford Tempo, leading to an impasse and then the cessation of negotiations in July 1981. Increasing Japan–United States unease culminated with the Japanese government, at the urging of its US counterpart, imposing a voluntary cartel in May 1981 with a threshold for the export of motor vehicles to the US. Toyota would eventually pursue circumvention; firstly by entering into venture by forming NUMMI with General Motors in 1984 to manufacture the Toyota Corolla, and then by setting up its own facility at Georgetown, Kentucky in 1988 for the next generation Camry.|$|E
