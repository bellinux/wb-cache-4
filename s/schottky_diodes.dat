5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes,</b> followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E

25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes)</b> are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes,</b> etc.) are widely used.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{detailed}} characteristics of erbium-silicided <b>Schottky</b> <b>diode,</b> fabricated on the p-type silicon are introduced and the interface of <b>Schottky</b> <b>diode</b> is analyzed using the current–voltage and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement methods. Moreover, by incorporating equivalent circuit model with the C–V measurement method, trap density, lifetime and Schottky barrier height are extracted in erbium-silicided <b>Schottky</b> <b>diode.</b> Also, short channel characteristics of SB-MOSFETs are analyzed using drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and subthreshold swing (SS) characteristics. Also, the simple DIBL model of SB-MOSFETs is proposed and {{compared with the}} scaling theory of double gate (DG) MOSFETs.|$|R
25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes,</b> like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E
2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes).</b> Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a center-tapped secondary produces a peak voltage loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through {{for a portion of}} each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each [...] "hump".|$|E
2500|$|Base {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed {{directly to the}} base via a fast switching diode , possibly after being shaped by a pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the large signal regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior trigger input circuits, and since ultra fast <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> are easily and cheaply found, this is the driver circuit employed in most modern avalanche transistor circuit. This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a Schottky diode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect can}} be {{significant}} when switching large currents very quickly. A certain amount of [...] "reverse recovery time" [...] tr (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) {{may be required to}} remove the reverse recovery charge Qr from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase. [...] In certain real-world cases {{it is important to consider}} the losses that are incurred by this non-ideal diode effect.
