5|$|<b>Shuffle!</b> {{had much}} pre-sale hype as the {{development}} team was largely composed of {{former members of}} BasiL, including Hiro Suzuhira and Aoi Nishimata, the illustrators for <b>Shuffle!.</b> <b>Shuffle!</b> was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of <b>Shuffle!</b> was the second highest-selling computer game for the last two weeks of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games semi-monthly sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night. It then ranked 18th and 50th in February before dropping off the chart in {{the first two weeks of}} March at 40th. The regular edition of the PC version of <b>Shuffle!</b> premiered at 9th in the chart in the last two weeks of February. It then ranked 5th and 40th in March, before its last appearance at 49th in the first half of April. <b>Shuffle!</b> On the Stage was released on October 20, 2005 and sold well (for a visual novel) during its first week, selling 29,732 copies by October 23.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} nine drama CD adaptations were {{released}} by Lantis for <b>Shuffle!</b> between 2004 and 2007. Five CDs were released monthly between May 26, 2004 and September 23, 2004, with each focused upon {{one of the}} five heroines of PC version of <b>Shuffle!.</b> Each drama CD contains between four to five tracks. For the PlayStation 2 version, an additional two CDs were released on February 22, 2006 and May 24, 2006, respectively, each focusing on Mayumi Thyme and Kareha, the two new heroines. For the second anime adaptation, <b>Shuffle!</b> Memories, two additional drama CDs were released on July 25, 2007 and October 24, 2007, focusing on Kaede Fuyou and Lisianthus, respectively. Three drama CDs appeared on the weekly Oricon albums chart of which the drama CD released for <b>Shuffle!</b> On the Stage focused on Kareha ranked the highest, peaking at #216 and remaining on the chart for one week.|$|E

50|$|Exon <b>shuffling</b> is the {{combination}} of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. Orthologous exon <b>shuffling</b> involves combining exons from orthologous genes from different species. Orthologous domain <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> of entire protein domains from orthologous genes from different species. Paralogous exon <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog <b>shuffling</b> involves <b>shuffling</b> of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides. This amplification products are then reassembled into full length genes using primer-less PCR. During these PCR cycles the fragments act as templates and primers. This results in chimeric full length genes, which are then subjected to screening.|$|R

It is a recap {{of the original}} <b>Shuffle!</b> anime, rearranging scenes from the original series into individual character specific episodes, and contains very little original content aside from the last episode. It features 13 pieces of theme music performed by Yuria, Miyuki Hashimoto, and the respective voice actors for the five heroines of <b>Shuffle!.</b> It was released across seven region 2 DVD compilation volumes in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{limited edition}} was {{released}} on January 30, 2004 and came with a special artbook featuring original drawings of the cast by twelve guest artists and a special edition box. The normal edition {{was released on}} February 27, 2004 on one DVD instead of three CDs and came with an original Shirotama & Kurotama keychain. The Standard Edition was released on December 17, 2004 on one DVD. An Anniversary Edition was released on November 22, 2007 and comes with a phone card of Sia and Kikyō. The PlayStation 2 version <b>Shuffle!</b> On the Stage was released in two versions on October 20, 2005: the regular version including {{the game and the}} DX version that included a 12cm figure of Lisianthus, a <b>Shuffle!</b> On the Stage Mix soundtrack CD, and a cell phone cleaner. The development of a Windows port of <b>Shuffle!</b> On the Stage titled <b>Shuffle!</b> Essence+ was announced on May 9, 2008 and released on October 30, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{and player}} {{character}} of <b>Shuffle!</b> is Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year {{high school student}} and the male protagonist to the series. Since a young age, he has placed the well-being of others before his own and dislikes seeing people in sorrow. Since he lost his parents in his childhood, he has been living with Kaede Fuyou, a life envied by many of his classmates. One of the heroines of <b>Shuffle!,</b> Kaede believes it her duty {{in life is to}} take care of Rin, which she takes upon herself in order to atone for her treatment of him in the past and bears a one-sided love towards Rin. Kaede appears again as the heroine in Really? Really!, a sequel to <b>Shuffle!,</b> that continues from Kaede's ending in <b>Shuffle!.</b> In middle school, the two meet and later befriend Asa Shigure, another heroine of <b>Shuffle!</b> who is in her third-year of high school. While she has a weak constitution, she makes up for it with her energetic tomboy personality and is an excellent cook. She has a habit of slapping Rin on his back.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{new types}} of perfect <b>shuffles</b> wherein a deck is split in half, {{one half of the}} deck is "reversed", and then the cards are interlaced. Flip <b>shuffles</b> are when the reversal comes from flipping the half over so that we also need to account for face-up/face-down configurations while horseshoe <b>shuffles</b> are when the order of the cards are reversed but all cards still face the same direction. We show that these <b>shuffles</b> are closely related to faro <b>shuffling</b> and determine the order of the associated <b>shuffling</b> groups...|$|R

40|$|Exon <b>shuffling</b> {{has been}} {{characterized}} {{as one of the}} major evolutionary forces shaping both the genome and the proteome of eukaryotes. This mechanism was particularly important in the creation of multidomain proteins during animal evolution, bringing a number of functional genetic novelties. Here, genome information from a variety of eukaryotic species was used to address several issues related to the evolutionary history of exon <b>shuffling.</b> By comparing all protein sequences within each species, we were able to characterize exon <b>shuffling</b> signatures throughout metazoans. Intron phase (the position of the intron regarding the codon) and exon symmetry (the pattern of flanking introns for a given exon or block of adjacent exons) were features used to evaluate exon <b>shuffling.</b> We confirmed previous observations that exon <b>shuffling</b> mediated by phase 1 introns (1 - 1 exon <b>shuffling)</b> is the predominant kind in multicellular animals. Evidence is provided that such pattern was achieved since the early steps of animal evolution, supported by a detectable presence of 1 - 1 <b>shuffling</b> units in Trichoplax adhaerens and a considerable prevalence of them in Nematostella vectensis. In contrast, Monosiga brevicollis, one of the closest relatives of metazoans, and Arabidopsis thaliana, showed no evidence of 1 - 1 exon or domain <b>shuffling</b> above what it would be expected by chance. Instead, exon <b>shuffling</b> events are less abundant and predominantly mediated by phase 0 introns (0 - 0 exon <b>shuffling)</b> in those non-metazoan species. Moreover, an intermediate pattern of 1 - 1 and 0 - 0 exon <b>shuffling</b> was observed for the placozoan T. adhaerens, a primitive animal. Finally, characterization of flanking intron phases around domain borders allowed us to identify a common set of symmetric 1 - 1 domains that have been <b>shuffled</b> throughout the metazoan lineage.

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the presence of}} LRTCs it is standard practice to compare the exponent of the actual data to the exponent of the data randomly <b>shuffled</b> [4]. By <b>shuffling</b> the data this should destroy any correlations present and so the exponent of the <b>shuffled</b> data {{is expected to be}} approximately 0.5. We compared the original sequence (whose DFA plot is shown in Fig.  11) with 500 <b>shuffled</b> sequences. The DFA plots for the <b>shuffled</b> sequences (data not shown) did not exhibit crossover points, with the same linear trend being observed across all box sizes. The mean exponent of the <b>shuffled</b> sequences was 0.50 with a range of 0.48 – 0.52. Therefore, as the exponents of the original sequence (at smaller box sizes) do not fall within the distribution of exponents for the <b>shuffled</b> sequences this further demonstrates that the original sequence exhibits complex temporal ordering with correlations that extend across a range of box sizes (up to the upper crossover).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{properties}} of the Croatian texts via complex networks. We present network properties of normal and <b>shuffled</b> Croatian texts for different <b>shuffling</b> principles: on the sentence level and on the text level. In both experiments we preserved the vocabulary size, word and sen-tence frequency distributions. Additionally, in the first <b>shuffling</b> approach we preserved the sentence structure of the text and the number of words per sentence. Obtained results showed that degree rank distributions exhibit no substantial deviation in <b>shuffled</b> networks, and strength rank distributions are preserved due to the same word frequencies. Therefore, standard approach to study the structure of linguistic co-occurrence networks showed no clear difference among the topologies of normal and <b>shuffled</b> texts. Finally, we showed that the in- and out- selectivity values from <b>shuffled</b> texts are constantly below selectivity values calcu-lated from normal texts.

40|$|Improvement of the {{biochemical}} {{characteristics of}} enzymes has been aided by misincorporation mutagenesis and DNA <b>shuffling.</b> <b>Shuffling</b> techniques {{can be used}} on a collection of mutants of the same gene, or related families of genes can be <b>shuffled</b> to produce mutants encoding chimeric gene products. One difficulty with current <b>shuffling</b> procedures is the predominance of unshuffled (“parental”) molecules in the pool of mutants. We describe a procedure for gene <b>shuffling</b> using degenerate primers that allows control of the relative levels of recombination between the genes that are <b>shuffled</b> and reduces the regeneration of unshuffled parental genes. This procedure has the advantage of avoiding the use of endonucleases for gene fragmentation before <b>shuffling</b> and allows the use of random mutagenesis of selected segments of the gene as part of the procedure. We illustrate the use of the technique with a diverse family of β-xylanase genes that possess widely different G and C contents. 14 page(s...|$|R
