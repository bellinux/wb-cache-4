5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill <b>site</b> <b>had</b> opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County <b>site</b> <b>had</b> been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E

5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave <b>site</b> <b>had</b> been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{establishment}} in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL {{became part of the}} British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} <b>site</b> <b>had</b> become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for heavy}} water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The heavy water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of heavy water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger complex at the Savannah River <b>Site</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled its purpose, supplying heavy water for the plutonium production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E
5|$|Hunslet Grange Flats (more {{commonly}} known as the Leek Street Flats) displayed brutalism. They replaced run down back to back houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The flats were popular at first; however, they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> been demolished even earlier.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, {{thirty five}} Knesset members (MKs) {{wrote to the}} army asking them to open Joseph's Tomb to Jewish {{visitors}} for prayer.

In the past few years the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> suffered from neglect and its appearance had deteriorated, with garbage being dumped and tires being burned there.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} neutralise the Würzburg system by developing countermeasures against it, Jones {{and his team}} needed to study one of the systems, {{or at least the}} more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed.

5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|Matt's brigade {{began moving}} to Tasa at 4:30 PM on October 15, before turning eastwards on Akavish. Heavy {{congestion}} {{on the roads}} made the brigade's progress very slow. A little after midnight, the brigade left Akavish and moved westward to the Yard, an area 700 meters long and 150 meters wide surrounded by protective sand walls. The <b>site</b> <b>had</b> been made long before the war.|$|E

5|$|On {{the border}} of Southcote and Tilehurst is the Meadway Precinct, which {{includes}} an Asda supermarket and a Boots pharmacy, {{as well as other}} smaller shops. The precinct opened in 1967, and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> become run-down and required modernisation. In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans to renovate the site.|$|E
5|$|Panglung Hermitage (spangs lung ri khrod) {{is located}} in the valley, {{northeast}} and downhill from Phur lcog.
