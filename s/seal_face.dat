50|$|A {{face seal}} is a seal {{in which the}} sealing {{surfaces}} are normal to the axis of the <b>seal.</b> <b>Face</b> seals are typically used in static applications and are used to prevent leakage in the radial direction {{with respect to the}} axis of the <b>seal.</b> <b>Face</b> seals are often located in a groove or cavity on a flange.|$|E
5000|$|The first Hydrostatic Seal was {{developed}} to replace current hydrodynamic seals; previous hydrodynamic seals were costly to manufacture and were tedious to assemble. First generation hydrostatic Seals used a two pressure system to establish equilibrium at the <b>seal</b> <b>face.</b> The <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> {{was developed}} to work under high pressure conditions, however the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> began to [...] and deteriorate during stress tests. Once ammonia ( [...] the liquid used in the first hydrostatic seal [...] ) was added, the two seal faces would make {{contact with each other}} and begin the erosion process. Cold water was then tested as the incompressible fluid, it has double the viscosity as ammonia, which showed favorable results. Since cold water had double the viscosity of ammonia, the water prevented the seals from making contact with each other, thus causing the system to run properly.|$|E
5000|$|The seals dual {{pressure}} zone helps maintain a constant {{pressure zone}} within the system. The constant pressure stabilizes the seal {{and does not}} allow the two <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> to come in contact. There are face control grooves on both of <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> that stabilize each face in the [...] direction. The slightest axial movement will cause the two <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> to touch and erosion of the seal will begin to occur.|$|R
50|$|The second Hydrostatic Seal was {{an attempt}} to resolve first {{generation}} hydrostatic seal problems: erosion of seals, high pressure build up, and stagnant fluids. Second generation hydrostatic seals had a redesigned <b>seal</b> face; new <b>face</b> control grooves were added to help stabilize the seals while under extreme conditions. Prior to the face control grooves, the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> were not balanced and would begin to move under high pressure conditions. Due to the movement, the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> would become misaligned when the seals moved, and that caused the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> to deteriorate, resulting in an unusable seal.|$|R

50|$|A Hydrostatic Seal is a {{non-contacting}} {{mechanical seal}} that operates under an equilibrium of forces. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic seals, Hydrostatic seals have two different pressure zones {{that are used}} to establish a balanced pressure zone between two seal faces. The two pressure system makes the seal unique because typical mechanical seals have one pressure zone that created causes a buildup of pressure that will eventually cause the seal to malfunction. After pressure has come to an equilibrium at the <b>seal</b> <b>face,</b> an incompressible fluid is then released between the two seal faces. The fluid creates a film around the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> that acts as a lubricant and as a medium for the substance flowing through the seal. Hydrostatic seals have been used in the aircraft industry; however they have seen very little commercial use because there is minimal research about the seals.|$|E

The seal's film stiffness compensates for varying operations by adjusting gap and pressure to maintain stability.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanical seals are {{generally}} classified into two main categories: [...] "Pusher" [...] or [...] "Non-Pusher". These distinctions refer {{to whether or}} not the secondary seal to the shaft/sleeve is dynamic or stationary. Pusher seals will employ a dynamic secondary seal (typically an o-ring) which moves axially with the primary <b>seal</b> <b>face.</b> Non-pusher seals will employ a static secondary seal (either an O-ring, high temperature graphite packing, elastomeric bellows or metal bellows). In this case, the face tracking is independent of the secondary seal which is always static against the shaft/sleeve.|$|E

Male and female Weddell seals are {{generally}} {{about the same}} length, though females can be slightly larger. However, the male seal tends to have a thicker neck and a broader head and muzzle than the female.

When fluid inertia effects are negligible and the <b>sealing</b> <b>faces</b> are slightly deformed, the following results are found for both laminar and turbulent flows: (1) The pressure profiles are independent of fluid properties; and (2) the parallel film leakage equation can be used, provided a characteristic film thickness is used.

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel <b>seal.</b> <b>Face</b> seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 7 Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{mechanical}} seal reliability is related to the state of the fluid between the seal faces.

40|$|TutorialSince the {{introduction}} of mechanical seals in nuclear boiling water reactor (BWR) feed pumps operating with high drive ratings, keeping mechanical seal reliability high became a challenge. A problem also encountered in fossil feed pump applications using similar electrically low conductive feed water, referred to as Combined Water Treated (CWT) feed water operation. After a short number of operating hours, rotating seal faces made from various kinds of silicon- or tungsten carbide materials show severe forms of edge chipping and crater type damages, while the opposing carbon graphite seal faces, may display a significant loss of <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> binder material, which inevitably results {{in the formation of}} uncontrolled radial flow channels across the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> gap. A unique phenomenon referred to as ?<b>seal</b> <b>face</b> generated electro corrosion? (EC). This tutorial discusses the pragmatic approach, which was applied to investigate what major contributing factors {{play a role in the}} development of <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> generated electro corrosion and how it can be avoided. While satisfactorily results are achieved for applications with a water purity down to 0, 5 ?S/cm using more traditional <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> materials, research shows that for the very purest of water qualities (i. e. electrical conductivities 0, 055 < X < 0, 5 ?S/cm), a new development step is required to suppress <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> generated electro corrosion.

5000|$|In addition, any {{misalignment}} of the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> will {{cause them to}} rub which will begin to [...] the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> and eventually cause the entire seal to become structurally unstable.

Etsion discovered that high pressures directed towards the outer <b>face</b> of the <b>seal</b> would cause static instability, while high pressure on the inner <b>face</b> of the <b>seal</b> would cause the seal to become more stable. In addition, axial misalignment would also cause the horizontal shaft to shift in the vertical direction; this misalignment would result in a faulty seal if the restoring force is not great enough to correct the shift in components.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 138. The {{mechanical}} seal {{is the least}} reliable component in centrifugal pumps. Most seals fail prematurely, i. e., before the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> wears out.
