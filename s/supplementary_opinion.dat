500|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1903, Paymaster Rishworth Nicholson of [...] {{assaulted}} a German Consul at a ball in Yantai, China. He was promptly brought up on charges of [...] "drunkenness", [...] "scandalous conduct tending {{to the destruction of}} good morals", and [...] "falsehood" [...] and taken to the Wisconsin for his court martial. Sebree and a group of six other officers found him guilty of the first charge, guilty of a lesser offense for the second charge, and not guilty on the third. His sentence was determined to be a reduction in grade equivalent to one year of seniority. Three of the officers, not including Sebree, wrote a <b>supplementary</b> <b>opinion</b> requesting clemency for Nicholson.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} individual willingness to pay (WTP) for green electricity. The experimental design comprises a public-choice scenario and a individual-choice scenario. It involves three different payment vehicles for the public promotion of renewables: direct tax, indirect tax, and CO 2 tax. We test for the extent of freeriding, the impact of different payment vehicles on individual WTP, and crowding-out effects caused by the public promotion of green electricity. Combined with data collected {{by means of a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>opinion</b> survey, our results indicate that individuals prefer binding collective contributions rather than individual market-driven activities in this field...|$|E
40|$|Plaintiffs, detainees at the Manhattan House of Detention for Men (MHD), more {{commonly}} known as the 2 ̆ 2 Tombs, 2 ̆ 2 brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commissioner of Corrections of the City of New York, the warden, the mayor, and various state officials. Plaintiffs alleged that the conditions of their detention constituted a denial of their rights under the first, fifth, sixth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found unconstitutional conditions did exist and ordered the city to submit a plan within thirty days to remedy the constitutional infirmities. Six months later, the city had failed to produce either a plan or the money required to effectuate necessary changes. The district court, in a <b>supplementary</b> <b>opinion,</b> held that unless such a plan were submitted by the city within thirty days the Tombs would be closed. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed as to the finding of unconstitutionality, but stayed the order closing the Tombs and remanded for further consideration of the remedy. Shortly after the decision, the city made the question of appropriate remedy moot by deciding to close the Tombs and shift its population to the city institution at Rikers Island...|$|E

40|$|The article {{studies the}} role of {{supplementary}} communicative units functioning as discourse markers in analytical articles and opinion columns of modern Russian and English newspapers. The dependence of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of different supplementary communicative units {{on the type of}} the article and on the language is discussed. The article proves that the use of <b>supplementary</b> units in <b>opinion</b> columns in Russian and in English has more common features than in analytical articles. The highest frequency of occurrence of these units is registered in Russian analytical articles, the lowest – in English articles. In Russian newspapers analytical articles and columns demonstrate more similar characteristics than in English materials. Supplementary communicative units with organizing functions occur more frequently in Russian articles, in English articles and columns they are equally rare. Regulative supplementary units are used equally often in all analyzed newspaper texts. There is a conclusion that regulative supplementary units tend to be more universal in their use in the two languages, while organizing units show greater dependence on the language. The presented analysis of the supplementary communicative units’ use can become one of the ways to take an inventory of persuasive language means in media discourse. These units produce a productive influence on the readers, help them interpret the text adequately; enhance their attention and mental activity...|$|R
