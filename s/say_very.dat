500|$|Hanson takes {{issue with}} the idea that {{there were only a few}} deaths, {{enumerating}} known deaths from hunger and exposure among survivors of the fire, [...] "huddled in shacks or living among the ruins that had once been their homes" [...] in the cold winter that followed, including, for instance, dramatist James Shirley and his wife. Hanson also maintains that [...] "it stretches credulity to believe that the only papists or foreigners being beaten to death or lynched were the ones rescued by the Duke of York", that official figures <b>say</b> <b>very</b> little about the fate of the undocumented poor, and that the heat at the heart of the firestorms was far greater than an ordinary house fire, and was enough to consume bodies fully or leave only a few skeletal fragments.|$|E
500|$|... "With Kershner," [...] Revill said, [...] "you had to {{keep the}} reins tight [...] you couldn't go overboard. It was the perfect example of the old adage 'less is more' [...] the Emperor doesn't <b>say</b> <b>very</b> much. But when he finally appears, it's {{at a point in}} the saga when everyone's waiting to see him. It's the Emperor, the arch villain of all time, and when he says there's a great {{disturbance}} in the Force, I mean, that's enough oomph!" [...] Years later, during production of Revenge of the Sith, Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by McDiarmid, and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised.|$|E
500|$|No one professes to {{have seen}} Home carried from window to window. Home told the three men who were present {{that he was going}} to be wafted, and he thus set up a state of very nervous expectation... Both Lord Crawford and Lord Adare say that they were warned. Then Lord Crawford says that he saw the shadow on the wall of Home {{entering}} the room horizontally; and as the moon, by whose light he professes {{to have seen}} the shadow, was at the most only three days old, his testimony is absolutely worthless. Lord Adare claims only that he saw Home, in the dark, [...] "standing upright outside our window." [...] In the dark—it was an almost moonless December night—one could not, as a matter of fact, <b>say</b> <b>very</b> positively whether Home was outside or inside; but, in any case, he acknowledges that there was a nineteen-inch window-sill outside the window, and Home could stand on that.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{insisted that}} he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153, saying: [...] "if the {{immigrant}} communities ... do not see the problems, if they can't feel {{what it is like to}} be a poor Malay, and don't feel for him, then I can <b>say</b> <b>very</b> soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil." [...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting [...] "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests." ...|$|E

My Republican colleagues will boil their eyes at that, but it is the most democratic country. It's a theocracy, no question about it. But it is possessed of the democratic tendencies that far outweigh those of, say, Bahrain or Saudi Arabia or even Egypt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bireir trees, alike the Mishriq and Bur {{varieties}} are of non-Nubian origin. Their fruits are praised for their quality, the flesh closing firmly upon the seed thereby staying soft and juicy {{for a long}} time. Their taste is attributed to be [...] "hot" [...] that is to <b>say</b> <b>very</b> sweet and tasty. Yusif (1995:277) quotes a local saying from the neighbouring Rubatab Country, by which a bird feeding too much on dates from the Bireir variety would suffer from a dry stomach, eventually causing it to drop dead from the sky. Bireir dates like Wad Laqai dates can be sold as a compressed cake called Agwah (عجوة). Bireir dates are also traditionally used {{for the production of}} local wine (Khumur, خمور).|$|E

2500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers wrote, [...] "the film's flash can't {{disguise}} {{the emptiness of}} these blasted lives. Trainspotting is 90 minutes of raw power that Boyle and a bang-on cast inject right into the vein". In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "Without a doubt, {{this is the most}} provocative, enjoyable pop-cultural experience since Pulp Fiction". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, wrote, [...] "Like Twister and Independence Day, this movie is a theme-park ride – though it's a much better one, basically a series of youthful thrills, spills, chills, and swerves rather than a story intended to <b>say</b> <b>very</b> much". Trainspotting has a 90% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 83 metascore on Metacritic.|$|E
2500|$|Chief American Horse was a {{delegate}} to many peace conferences in Washington. During the tumultuous times from 1865 to 1877, [...] American Horse advocated yielding {{to the government}} at any cost, being no doubt convinced of the uselessness of resistance. This quelled the people {{for the time being}} and up to the killing of Crazy Horse. [...] In the crisis precipitated by this event, American Horse was again influential and energetic in the cause of the government. [...] From this time on he became an active participant in the affairs of the Teton Sioux. [...] He was always noted for his eloquence, which was nearly always conciliatory, yet he could <b>say</b> <b>very</b> sharp things of the duplicity of the whites. [...] He had much ease of manner and was a master of repartee. [...] I recall his saying that ”if you have got to wear golden slippers to enter the white man’s heaven no Indian will ever get there, as the whites have got the Black Hills and with them all the gold.” “His record as a councilor of his people and his policy in the new situation that confronted them was manly and consistent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the charter}} records, the Warbelton family had borne the arms Lozengy or and azure from time immemorial, {{that is to}} say {{probably}} from about 1215 when the use of heraldic devices became widespread in England. At the same time the arms had also been adopted by the de Morville family of Knighton, Isle of Wight, Bradpole, Dorset and Wraxall, Somerset. A cadet branch of the Gorges family had married the heiress of the last de Morville early in the 13th century, that is to <b>say</b> <b>very</b> shortly after the Morvilles had adopted these arms. Yet the Gorges had by then chosen their own canting arms of a Whirlpool (Latin gurges) depicted by a blue [...] on a white field, blazoned Argent, a gurges azure. The senior branch of Gorges settled at Tamerton Foliot in Devon, whilst the cadet line, which had married the de Morville heiress, became seated in the former Morville manors in Somerset, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. It was perhaps to difference themselves from the Tamerton Foliot line that they relinquished the paternal arms of the gurges and take up the former Morville [...] "lozengy" [...] arms. Certainly this change had been made by Ralph III, 1st Baron Gorges (d.1324), before 1300 as the Caerlaverock roll of arms records, composed by heralds at the Siege of Caerlaverock, in which the alternative term [...] "masculy" [...] is used for [...] "lozengy": ...|$|E

2500|$|When Owen's own {{anonymous}} {{review of}} the Origin appeared in the April Edinburgh Review he praised himself and his own axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things, and showed his anger at {{what he saw as}} Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre-eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's [...] "disciples" [...] Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of [...] "abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation." [...] Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was [...] "extremely malignant, clever & I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, & very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts..... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me." [...] He commented to Henslow that [...] "Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents & alters what I <b>say</b> <b>very</b> unfairly..... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what a strange man to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!" ...|$|E
