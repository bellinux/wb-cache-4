5000|$|Most {{ideas for}} new {{products}} are either uninspired or impractical. Finding the [...] "sweet spot" [...] requires a balance {{that leads to}} both ingenious and viable ideas. This notion was expressed in a Harvard Business Review Article entitles “Finding Your Innovation Sweet Spot”. When we innovate we push our thinking outward, trying to create something new and {{different from what we}} have now. Yet {{we do not want to}} wander too far off. A [...] "great" [...] idea must be executable and palatable.The NFS principle assures that our ideation will generate ideas that are sufficiently removed from our current situation in order to be interesting, while nevertheless close enough to our core competence in order to be feasible.The SIT thinking process uses the FFF procedure and the five thinking tools in order to generate new forms (virtual products). These forms if unrestrained might lead to [...] "far" [...] ideas. The [...] "closed world" [...] condition for example acts as an inhibitor, making sure we don't wander too far out. This combination of opposite forces keeps us ideating in the <b>sweet</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

40|$|Punjab faces a {{sever problem}} of declining water tables {{by as much}} as 10 – 15 m in most parts. The paper focuses on {{groundwater}} behavior in various parts (Blocks) of the Punjab in categories of low to high rainfall regions, saline to <b>sweet</b> groundwater <b>zones,</b> scanty to extensive canal water supply areas, the uplands to riverbeds and the cropping pattern in terms of low to high water intensive crops. Any changes in these parameters will affect the recharge and withdrawal of groundwater. In was found that as the area under rice cultivation increased, there was a corresponding decline in ground water recharge. It is often advocated that pricing policy for wheat and rice (Minimum Support Price (MSP) and its effectiveness) and free electricity supply are responsible for the critical ground water situation in Punjab. The paper tires to examine this and look at policy measures needed to address the situation. Length: pp. 331 - 357 Water tableGroundwater rechargeWater balanceWater use efficiencyRiceRivers...|$|R
40|$|Shale gas {{reservoir}} stimulation procedures (e. g. hydraulic fracturing) require upfront prediction and planning {{that should be}} supported by a comprehensive reservoir characterization. Therefore, understanding shale depositional processes and associated vertical and lateral sedimentological variability is key in predicting the character and position of sweet spots and to estimate their geomechanical properties. The Toarcian Posidonia Shale Formation {{is considered to be}} the main shale gas prospect in the Netherlands. However the scale at which reservoir heterogeneities occur is unknown and not easily estimated from the limited subsurface datasets. Therefore, a multidisciplinary reservoir study was performed on an outcrop analogue in the Cleveland Basin (UK), including sedimentological, biofacies, petrophysical and geomechanical analysis. The results help developing predictive models of sweet spot detection and allow to generate pseudo logs that can be compared with surface data. In spite of the apparent mudstone uniformity at outcrop and hand samples {{it is clear that the}} Toarcian succession presents complex patterns of heterogeneity at mm to outcrop scales. Climatic control on run off and the input of riverine material and coinciding changes in production of organic material appear the main controls on the distribution of <b>sweet</b> spots and <b>zones</b> of high fraccability...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} revolution {{was a turning}} corner {{in the history of}} water management. New techniques helped to design multipurpose projects. Industrial expansion, urbanization, and changing life styles in the developed countries have ultimately resulted in multiobject ive planning with environmental quality and national economic development as co-equal objectives. However, there are still big lags between the developed and developing countries in this respect, and even in the developed countries, theory and practices of water management are following different directions. It is also true that application of sophisticated computerized models alone do not guarantee planned objectives. Inadequate data, non-availability of funds, standard materials and equipment, skilled labor, and inadequate implementation capabilities retard the execution of plans and inappropriate operation can scale down actual achievements. This calls for a periodic hindsight evaluation of operating projects. The "cost-effectiveness approach" {{has been found to be}} the best technique as it can be applied for "ex-ante" as well as "ex-post" evaluation, comparative evaluation of more than one objective, and for both tangible and intangible measures of effectiveness. For evaluation of water management under different socioeconomic conditions, performances of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District (WMID) in the U. S. A. and the Salinity Control and Reclamation Project No. 1 (SCARP-I) in Pakistan have been compared. While the American system is flexible enough to accommodate any subsequent technological innovation and can supply full water requirement for any cropping pattern, the water system in Pakistan is characterized by an inelastic 7 -day fixed roster for water supply, not capable of meeting crop needs even for 500 / of the presently irrigated area. The shortfall in SCARP-I can be attributed to conceptual lapses, idealized planning assumptions, inappropriate engineering design, water quality and managerial constraints. It is also clear that the desalination plant for treating return flow from Wellton-Mohawk cannot be justified on technical, economic, and environmental reasons. The following suggestions can be made to remove management constraints in the developing countries in general, and Pakistan in particular. 1. Improved technologies may be introduced by renovating existing studies and research programs at the university level. Technical assistance available from a number of foreign sources may be pooled and reorganized to meet the desired objective. Instead of individuals of single discipline, multidisciplinary teams of professionals should be trained abroad to make the process of planning and management more effective. 2. Nucleus planning cells may be created at the subdivision level to benefit from farmers' participation in water management. 3. Implementation capabilities must be improved to accelerate the pace of project execution. 4. Operation criteria must be evolved objectively at the planning and design stages. 5. Adequate financial allocation must be made during implementation and operation. 6. More dams are needed for flexible water management, power generation, and flood control. Water control should be shifted from barrages to dams as early as possible. 7. Latest rain harvesting and runoff agricultural techniques must be introduced in dry farming areas in the upland plateau. 8. Small farms should be aggregated into cooperative units of 250 to 350 acres and farm layout redesigned, water courses realigned and lined in sandy reaches. 9. Extension service should be reactivated to educate farmers, in addition to launching a crash program on the pattern of the literacy campaign in Iran. 10. Private tubewells in <b>sweet</b> water <b>zones</b> and public tubewells in saline and marginal zones will improve flexibility of the system and save large public funds for executing important complementary programs to optimize benefits from water managements. 11. More emphasis should be laid on planning, operation, and expost evaluation of public investments in the water sector...|$|R

40|$|The Marmara Sea {{along with}} the straits of Dardanelles and Bosphorus is the marine gateway that connects the Mediterranean and Black seas. Fossil palynomorphs are used to {{reconstruct}} the paleoclimate and paleoceanography of the Marmara Sea recorded in piston core MAR 02 - 89 P, from a water depth of 257 m on the upper slope basinward of the southeastern Marmara shelf. This is the first core from the region with a high resolution sedimentary record from approximately 30, 000 cal. yr BP to early Holocene {{with the exception of}} a hiatus from ~ 14, 850 - 12, 700 cal. yr BP. The long section of upper Pleistocene glacial and early postglacial sediments in Core MAR 02 - 89 P enables a more detailed interpretation of the palynomorphs within the eastern Marmara Sea region than has previously been possible. Geochemical data indicate increased total organic carbon (TOC), and development of more anoxic sedimentary conditions starting around 18, 000 cal. yr BP, with a gradual increase in marine production at 12, 700 cal. yr BP. The ratio of total sulphur to TOC displays five peaks from - 28, 500 - 10, 000 cal. yr BP, which correspond to spikes in Pediaslrul 11 algae and may indicate Black Sea flood events. Pollen records indicate four assemblage zones (5 - 2) within core MAR 02 - 89 P. Pleniglacial to late glacial zone 5 represents mixed oro-Mediterranean forest and steppe grassland, indicating some areas with > 600 mm rainfall/yr and warm enough to support a Castanea (<b>sweet</b> chestnut) refugium. <b>Zone</b> 4 in the cold Heinrich I-IS I and warmer Bølling-Allenrød equivalent intervals has increased presence of steppe grassland with Ephedra. Zone 3 in the Younger Dryas interval consists of predominantly steppe-forest, with sparse oro-Mediterranean forest, suggesting ~ 300 - 600 mm of annual rainfall. Preboreal to early Holocene Zone 2 records mesic euxinian forest with less steppe vegetation, because there is a reduction in pollen characterizing grassland areas and indicating 600 mm of rainfall year-round. Dinoflagellate cyst records show two assemblage zones, with a low salinity Spiniferites cruciformis-Pyxidinopsis psilata assemblage being replaced with a more diverse Operculodinium centrocarpum Spiniferites assemblage by 12, 700 cal. yr BP. Three subzones in Dinocyst Assemblage Zone 2 (D 2) may indicate changes in sea surface salinity (SSS) and temperature (SST). The marker species in the Dinocyst Assemblage subzone D 2 c indicate - 10 psu and cool water for the pleniglacial. Late glacial subzone D 2 b has assemblages indicating increased salinity (~ 13 - 17 psu) while late glacial subzone D 2 a assemblages suggest warmer SST during the Heinrich HSI and the start of the Bølling-Allenrød equivalent intervals. Dinocyst Assemblage Zone I (DI) consists of two subzones: dinocysts in pre-boreal subzone D 1 b indicate SSS of ~ 13 - 20 psu and cool to temperate surface water in contrast to subzone D 1 a Holocene assemblages indicating temperate to sub-tropical SST. From ~ 30, 000 - 14, 850 cal. yr BP, the Marmara Sea received water from the Black Sea during flood events. There is no record in core MAR 02 - 89 P for the interval of 14, 850 - 12, 700 cal. yr BP, by the end of this hiatus, sapropel development had begun, and Mediterranean dinocysts indicate Mediterranean water from the Aegean Sea was contributing to the Marmara Sea together with Black Sea water during and after the Younger Dryas event...|$|R
