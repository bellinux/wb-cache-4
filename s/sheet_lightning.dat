5|$|In-cloud {{lightning}} is {{the most}} common. It is lightning within a cloud and is sometimes called intra-cloud or <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning,</b> but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> is {{cloud-to-cloud}} lightning that {{exhibits a}} diffuse brightening {{of the surface}} of a cloud, caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away. The lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator, so it appears as only a flash, or a sheet of light. The lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes.|$|E
60|$|The speakers, sundry phantoms of the gone, Had risen like filmy {{flames of}} {{phosphor}} dye, As if the palest of <b>sheet</b> <b>lightnings</b> shone From the sward near me, {{as from a}} nether sky.|$|R
60|$|The {{room filled}} with a flash of white light so like a <b>sheet</b> of <b>lightning</b> that the boy went reeling backwards, half stunned and blinded by its {{dazzling}} intensity.|$|R
6000|$|... 112 The Dutch, {{who came}} like greedy hinds before, [...] To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield, [...] Now look like those, when rolling thunders roar, [...] And <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning</b> blast the {{standing}} field.|$|R
25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning,</b> but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E
500|$|Weaving {{plays a role}} in the {{creation}} myth of Navajo cosmology, which articulates social relationships and continues {{to play a role in}} Navajo culture. According to one aspect of this tradition, a spiritual being called [...] "Spider Woman" [...] instructed the women of the Navajo how to build the first loom from exotic materials including sky, earth, sunrays, rock crystal, and <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning.</b> Then [...] "Spider Woman" [...] taught the Navajo how to weave on it.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{province}} of Småland, Sweden, an account is recorded connecting Freyja with <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> in this respect. Writer Johan Alfred Göth recalled a Sunday in 1880 where men were walking in fields and looking at nearly ripened rye, where Måns in Karryd said: [...] "Now Freyja is out watching if the rye is ripe". Along with this, Göth recalls another mention of Freyja in the countryside: ...|$|E
60|$|Full many {{a dreary}} hour have I past, My brain bewilder'd, {{and my mind}} o'ercast With heaviness; in seasons when I've thought No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze On the far depth where <b>sheeted</b> <b>lightning</b> plays; Or, on the wavy grass outstretch'd supinely, Pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely: That I should never hear Apollo's song, Though {{feathery}} clouds were floating all along The purple west, and, two bright streaks between, The golden lyre itself were dimly seen: That the still murmur of the honey bee Would never teach a rural song to me: That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting Would never make a lay of mine enchanting, Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold Some tale of love and arms in time of old.|$|R
60|$|The storm {{broke with}} terrific fury. A seething torrent {{of rain and}} hail came with the rushing wind. Great heaven-broad <b>sheets</b> of <b>{{lightning}}</b> played across the black dome overhead. Zigzag ropes, steel-blue in color, shot downward. Crash, and crack, and boom the thunder split and rolled the clouds above. The lightning flashes showed the fall of rain in columns like white waterfalls, borne on the irresistible wind.|$|R
60|$|At sunset {{there was}} no let-up. The night {{was all the more}} hideous. Along the horizon flashed up the hot <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning</b> that were not of a summer storm. Angry, lurid, red, these upflung blazes and flames illumined the murky sky, showing in the fitful and {{flickering}} intervals wagons driving toward the front, and patrols of soldiers running toward some point, and great upheavals of earth spread high.|$|R
2500|$|When {{as a boy}} I {{was visiting}} the old Proud-Katrina, I was afraid of {{lightning}} like all boys in those days. When the <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> flared at the night, Katrina said: [...] "Don't be afraid little child, it is only Freyja who is out making fire with steel and flintstone {{to see if the}} rye is ripe. She is kind to people and she is only doing it to be of service, she is not like Thor, he slays both people and livestock, when he is in the mood" [...] I later heard several old folks talk of the same thing in the same way.|$|E
2500|$|... {{looked in}} all four {{directions}} {{and saw that the}} woman was not in the house. [...] Then he said, [...] "I will help you. [...] But , the Big Giant, is also my son. [...] I will give you weapons so that you may fight the monsters. [...] But I am the one who will strike the first blow when you fight against [...] the Big Giant. [...] I must do that myself." [...] Then he gave the twins helmets and shirts of hard flint scales, and , the chain lightning arrows, and , the <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> arrows, and , the deadly sunbeam arrows. [...] And to each he gave , the stone knife with the hard blade, and , the stone knife with the broad blade.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
60|$|This we did {{without a}} moment's hesitation, for the {{whistling}} wind burst, ever and anon, like thunderclaps among the trees, and tearing {{them from their}} roots, hurled them with violence to the ground. Rain cut across the land in <b>sheets,</b> and <b>lightning</b> played like forked serpents in the air, while high above {{the roar of the}} hissing tempest the thunder crashed and burst and rolled in awful majesty.|$|R
60|$|The {{last bit}} of blue sky yielded to the on-sweep of clouds. Like angry surf the pale gleams of gray, amid the purple of that {{scudding}} front, swept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley. The purple deepened to black. Broad <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning</b> flared over the western wall. There were not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the gathering darkness. The storm center was still beyond Surprise Valley.|$|R
6000|$|Pallid, as the {{reflection}} of the <b>sheeted</b> <b>lightning</b> on the [...] heavy-sailing night-cloud, became the face of Cain; but the [...] child Enos took hold of the shaggy skin, his father's robe, and [...] 100 [...] raised his eyes to his father, and listening whispered, 'Ere [...] yet I could speak, I am sure, O my father, that I heard that [...] voice. Have not I often said that I remembered a sweet voice? [...] O my father! this is it': and Cain trembled exceedingly. [...] The voice was sweet indeed, but it was thin and querulous, [...] 105 [...] like that of a feeble slave in misery, who despairs altogether, [...] yet can not refrain himself from weeping and lamentation. [...] And, behold! Enos glided forward, and creeping softly round [...] the base of the rock, stood before the stranger, and looked up [...] into his face. And the Shape shrieked, and turned round, [...] 110 [...] and Cain beheld him, that his limbs and his face were those [...] of his brother Abel whom he had killed! And Cain stood [...] like one who struggles in his sleep because of the exceeding [...] terribleness of a dream.|$|R
60|$|And {{they all}} looked was it <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.|$|E
6000|$|... [205] {247} By night, {{particularly}} in a warm latitude, every stroke of the oar, every motion of the boat or ship, {{is followed by a}} slight flash like <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> from the water.|$|E
60|$|All this time, and later, soft <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> {{expanded}} from a cloud in their path, enkindling their faces as they paced up and down, shining over the water, and, for a moment, showing the horizon as a keen line.|$|E
6000|$|... "No such thing! There {{will be a}} storm, and {{we shall}} be drowned. Oh, I wish I had never listened to your nonsense, and got into this horrible boat." [...] She {{was in a state}} for scolding, and scold she did, as the clouds rose higher, and <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning</b> more decided. [...] "How could you? You, who know nothing about boats, and going on, on, with those horrid {{tiresome}} verses--not minding anything--I wish I had never come near you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then came a cry which {{sounded like}} a moan and above it the shrill fearful yell {{of a man who}} feels himself {{dropping}} out of the world's hearing. Lessingham raised the lantern which stood on the beach by Jimmy's side. The line had broken. The body of its suspended traveller had disappeared! And just then, strangely enough, for the first time for over an hour, the heavens opened in one great <b>sheet</b> of <b>lightning,</b> and they could see the figure of one man left on the ship, clinging desperately to the rigging.|$|R
60|$|However, {{they had}} in one way done good service, for the shower had been as brief as it was violent, and the inky cloud was {{drifting}} away furiously towards the east, leaving the moon visible, near her setting, and allowing her white cold light to shine forth, contrasting with the distant <b>sheets</b> of pale <b>lightning,</b> growing fainter and fainter.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a lovely}} evening; the colours of a splendid sunset had died out and the breath of a warm breeze seemed to have {{smoothed}} out the sea. Away to the south the <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> was like the flashing of an enormous lantern hidden under the horizon. In order to change the conversation Mr Powell said: ...|$|E
60|$|Ascending to Khersiong, I {{found the}} {{vegetation}} very backward by the road-sides. The rain had cleared the atmosphere, {{and the view}} over the plains was brilliant. On {{the top of the}} Khersiong spur a tremendous gale set in with a cold west wind: the storm cleared off at night, which at 10 p.m. was beautiful, with forked and <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> over the plains far below us. The equinoctial gales had now fairly set in, with violent south-east gales, heavy thunder, lightning, and rain.|$|E
60|$|At length {{she rose}} and {{said with a sigh}} that she must be going back to where the Amasomi were in camp, as Masapo would need her to see to his food. By now it was quite dark, {{although}} I remember that from time to time the sky was lit up by <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning,</b> for a storm was brewing. As I expected, Saduko rose also, saying that he would see me on the morrow, and went away with Mameena, walking like one who dreams.|$|E
60|$|Again {{they came}} out, this time anxiously to consult sea and sky. The squall had cleared away, but the sky {{remained}} overcast. The two schooners, under all sail and {{joined by a}} third, could be seen making back. A veer in the wind induced them to slack off sheets, and five minutes afterward a sudden veer from the opposite quarter caught all three schooners aback, and those on shore could see the boom-tackles being slacked away or cast off on the jump. The sound of the surf was loud, hollow, and menacing, and a heavy swell was setting in. A terrible <b>sheet</b> of <b>lightning</b> burst before their eyes, illuminating the dark day, and the thunder rolled wildly about them.|$|R
60|$|And {{that night}} there {{came on a}} terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of thunder and {{blinding}} <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning.</b> He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not {{the shadow of a}} doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.|$|R
25|$|The Vaudeville Theatre is a West End theatre on the Strand in the City of Westminster. As {{the name}} suggests, the theatre held mostly {{vaudeville}} shows and musical revues {{in its early}} days. It opened in 1870 and was rebuilt twice, although each new building retained elements of the previous structure. The current building opened in 1926, and the capacity is now 690 seats. Rare thunder drum and <b>lightning</b> <b>sheets,</b> together with other early stage mechanisms survive in the theatre.|$|R
60|$|Holroyd and {{the captain}} {{came out of the}} cabin in which the swollen and contorted body of the {{lieutenant}} lay and stood together at the stern of the monitor, staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind them. It was a close, dark night that had only phantom flickerings of <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> to illuminate it. The cuberta, a vague black triangle, rocked about in the steamer's wake, her sails bobbing and flapping, and the black smoke from the funnels, spark-lit ever and again, streamed over her swaying masts.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were one}} or two cartloads of {{refugees}} passing along Oxford Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and {{along the edge of}} Regent's Park there were as many silent couples [...] "walking out" [...] together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> in the south.|$|E
60|$|When Ellen, utterly {{spent in}} body and mind, reached home that day a melancholy, sultry {{twilight}} was falling. Fitful flares of <b>sheet</b> <b>lightning</b> {{swept across the}} dark horizon to the east. The cabins were deserted. Antonio and the Mexican woman were gone. The circumstances made Ellen wonder, {{but she was too}} tired and too sunken in spirit to think long about it or to care. She fed and watered her horse and left him in the corral. Then, supperless and without removing her clothes, she threw herself upon the bed, and at once sank into heavy slumber.|$|E
60|$|He kept in {{the shadow}} of the cabin walls, then the line of orchard trees, then a row of currant bushes. Here, {{crouching}} low, he halted to look and listen. He was now at the edge of the open ground, with the gently rising slope before him. He could see the dark patches of cedar and juniper trees. On the north side of the cabin a streak of fire flashed in the blackness, and a shot rang out. Jean heard the bullet bit the cabin. Then silence enfolded the lonely ranch and the darkness lay like a black blanket. A low hum of insects pervaded the air. Dull <b>sheets</b> of <b>lightning</b> illumined the dark horizon to the south. Once Jean heard voices, but could not tell from which direction they came. To the west of him then flared out another rifle shot. The bullet whistled down over Jean to thud into the cabin.|$|R
6000|$|I read a little; {{wrote on}} the flyleaf of my {{diminutive}} Johnson, [...] "September 1st, Lyndsey for the last time.--M."; arranged my morrow's clothes on a chair, then sat down in my balcony to do nothing, to be nothing, merely to dream. But nature decreed otherwise. Soon after six by my grandfather's clock--it struck the hour out of its case, as if out of a sepulchre--a storm, which all the afternoon had been steadily piling its leaden vapours into space, began to break. Chizzel Hill with its prehistoric barrow was sunk to a green mound beneath those lowering cloudy heights, pooling so placid and lovely a blue between them. The very air seemed to thicken, and every tree stood up as if carved out of metal. Of a sudden a great wind, with heavy plashing drops of rain, swept roaring round the house, thick with dust and green leaves torn from the dishevelled summer trees. There was a hush. The darkness intensified, and then a vast <b>sheet</b> of <b>lightning</b> seemed to picture all Kent in my eyes, {{and the air was}} full of water.|$|R
60|$|Wolfert and {{his companions}} shrunk back is dismay. Still their curiosity would not allow them entirely to withdraw. A long <b>sheet</b> of <b>lightning</b> now flickered across the waves, and {{discovered}} a boat, filled with men, just under a rocky point, rising and sinking with the heavy surges, and swashing the water at every heave. It was with difficulty held to the rocks by a boat hook, for the current rushed furiously round the point. The veteran hoisted {{one end of the}} lumbering sea-chest on the gunwale of the boat; he seized the handle at the other end to lift it in, when the motion propelled the boat from the shore; the chest slipped off from the gunwale, sunk into the waves, and pulled the veteran headlong after it. A loud shriek was uttered by all on shore, and a volley of execrations by those on board; but boat and man were hurried away by the rushing swiftness of the tide. A pitchy darkness succeeded; Wolfert Webber indeed fancied that He distinguished a cry for help, and that he beheld the drowning man beckoning for assistance; but when the lightning again gleamed along the water all was drear and void. Neither man nor boat was to be seen; nothing but the dashing and weltering of the waves as they hurried past.|$|R
