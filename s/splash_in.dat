5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last <b>Splash</b> <b>in</b> August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E
5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and <b>splash</b> <b>in</b> the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E

25|$|After Pixies, Deal {{returned}} her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last <b>Splash</b> <b>in</b> 1993.

She resumed {{her role as}} The Breeders' guitarist for their third album Title TK in 2002 after her own stint in drug rehabilitation, and returned to Pixies when they reunited in 2004.

25|$|After {{confirming}} Richard Dickel as the coach, the new franchise made a <b>splash</b> <b>in</b> {{the off-season}} by signing many high-profile players, {{the first of}} which was 28-year-old former Australian Boomers' point guard Luke Martin. Former Manawatu Jets' big man Gareth Dawson, Conference Basketball League shooting guard Ian Cathcart, former Otago Nuggets' combo guard Pete Burgess, Australian-born former Harbour Heat sharp shooter Daniel Munday, and veteran big man James Paringatai all signed on with the Sharks for their inaugural season. Another coup for the Sharks came with the signing of former New Mexico State Aggies centre Martin Iti, who was able to play as a local due to holding both an Australian and a New Zealand passport.|$|E
25|$|The Blackhawks {{were eager}} to make a <b>splash</b> <b>in</b> the free-agent market, and offered big money {{to many of the}} top free agents. They were, however, denied, only being able to acquire two backup goaltenders in Patrick Lalime and Sebastien Caron. Chicago {{was one of the biggest}} buyers in the trade market, though, {{acquiring}} a future franchise player in left-winger Martin Havlat, as well as center Bryan Smolinski from the Ottawa Senators in a three-way deal that also involved the San Jose Sharks. The 'Hawks dealt forward Mark Bell to the Sharks, Michal Barinka and a 2008 second-round draft pick to the Senators, while Ottawa also received defenseman Tom Preissing and center Josh Hennessy from San Jose. Havlat gave the Blackhawks the talented, first-line caliber gamebreaker they so desperately needed. The Havlat trade was soon followed by another major trade – winger and key Blackhawk player Kyle Calder was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for grinding defensive center Michal Handzus. The move caused a stir in Chicago; Calder had won an increase in his contract through arbitration, which was accepted by the Hawks, but rather than ink their leading scorer, the Blackhawks decided to address their need for a proven center by acquiring Handzus. Injuries to both Havlat and Handzus hurt the Blackhawks, and Smolinski was eventually traded at the trade deadline to the Vancouver Canucks. On November 26, 2006, Blackhawks General Manager Dale Tallon fired head coach Trent Yawney and appointed assistant coach Denis Savard as the head coach. Savard had been the assistant coach of the Blackhawks since 1997, the year after he retired as one of the most popular and successful Blackhawks players of all time. The Blackhawks continued to struggle, and finished last in the Central Division, 12 points out of the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|The discography of American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} The Breeders {{consists of four}} studio albums, one live album, three extended plays, ten singles and twelve music videos. Kim Deal, then-bassist of American alternative rock band the Pixies, formed The Breeders as a side-project with Tanya Donelly, guitarist of American alternative rock band Throwing Muses. After recording a demo tape, The Breeders signed to the English independent record label 4AD in 1989. Their debut studio album Pod was released in May 1990, but was not commercially successful. After {{the revival of the}} Pixies and Throwing Muses in 1990, The Breeders became mostly inactive until the Pixies' breakup in 1993. With a new lineup, The Breeders released their Safari EP in 1992, followed by their second studio album Last <b>Splash</b> <b>in</b> 1993. Last Splash was The Breeders' most successful album; it peaked at number 33 on the United States Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1994. The album spawned the band's most successful single, [...] "Cannonball". The single peaked at number 44 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number two on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a <b>splash</b> <b>in</b> terms of the right imaging, you go ahead and do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} <b>splash</b> <b>in</b> the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
