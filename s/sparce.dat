40|$|Why {{does the}} European Blackbird’s dark {{coloration}} match the ground {{color of the}} less widespread of its breeding habitats, the riparian forest, although its main European population occurs in the pale-litter woodland? It is argued that crypsis of all the age stages was more necessary in riparian stands, as this habitat is more risky for the species owing to a high ground vegetation surrounding a foraging bird. Poorer crypsis of Blackbird plumage in pale-litter habitats may be a neutral feature, being compensated by easier scanning of the surroundings over the lower and <b>sparcer</b> herb vegetation and by a tendency to remain in dark sites. The black plumage of the Blackbird male, perhaps reinforced by sexual selection in pristine forest conditions may also retain its cryptic function...|$|R

Herein, we numerically simulate the late stages of terrestrial planet growth in circumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems with stellar separations between 0. 05 AU and 0. 4 AU and binary eccentricities up to 0. 8. In each simulation, the sum of the masses of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giant planets are included. Our results are statistically compared to a set of planet formation simulations in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system that begin with essentially the same initial disk of protoplanets. The planetary systems formed around binaries with apastron distances less than ~ 0. 2 AU are very similar to those around single stars, whereas those with larger maximum separations tend to be <b>sparcer,</b> with fewer planets, especially interior to 1 AU.

40|$|Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) {{have emerged}} as the method of choice for solving {{a wide range of}} machine {{learning}} tasks. The enormous computational demands posed by DNNs have most commonly been addressed through the design of custom accelerators. However, these accelerators are prohibitive in many design scenarios (e. g., wearable devices and IoT sensors), due to stringent area/cost constraints. Accelerating DNNs on these low-power systems, comprising of mainly the general-purpose processor (GPP) cores, requires new approaches. We improve the performance of DNNs on GPPs by exploiting a key attribute of DNNs, i. e., sparsity. We propose Sparsity aware Core Extensions (<b>SparCE)</b> - a set of micro-architectural and ISA extensions that leverage sparsity and are minimally intrusive and low-overhead. We dynamically detect zero operands and skip a set of future instructions that use it. Our design ensures that the instructions to be skipped are prevented from even being fetched, as squashing instructions comes with a penalty. <b>SparCE</b> consists of 2 key micro-architectural enhancements- a Sparsity Register File (SpRF) that tracks zero registers and a Sparsity aware Skip Address (SASA) table that indicates instructions to be skipped. When an instruction is fetched, <b>SparCE</b> dynamically pre-identifies whether the following instruction(s) can be skipped and appropriately modifies the program counter, thereby skipping the redundant instructions and improving performance. We model <b>SparCE</b> using the gem 5 architectural simulator, and evaluate our approach on 6 image-recognition DNNs in the context of both training and inference using the Caffe framework. On a scalar microprocessor, <b>SparCE</b> achieves 19 %- 31 % reduction in application-level.

40|$|A person {{working with}} diverse {{information}} sources—with possibly different formats and information models—may recognize and wish to express conceptual structures {{that are not}} explicitly present in those sources. Rather than replicate the portions of interest and recast them into a single, combined data source, we leave base information where it is and superimpose a conceptual model that is appropriate to the task at hand. This superimposed model can be distinct from the model(s) employed by the sources in the base layer. An application that superimposes a new conceptual model over diverse sources, with varying capabilities, needs to accommodate {{the various types of}} information and differing access protocols for the base information sources. The Superimposed Pluggable Architecture for Contexts and Excerpts (<b>SPARCE)</b> defines a collection of architectural abstractions, placed between superimposed and base applications, to demarcate and revisit information elements inside base sources and provide access to content and context for elements inside these sources. <b>SPARCE</b> accommodates new base information types without altering existing superimposed applications. In this paper, we briefly introduce several superimposed applications that we have built, and describe the conceptual model each superimposes. We then focus on the use of context in superimposed applications. We describe how <b>SPARCE</b> supports context and excerpts. We demonstrate how <b>SPARCE</b> facilitates building superimposed applications by describing its use in building our two, quite diverse applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) remain not fully understood. We report a unique case of antibiotic-induced TEN developed in a patient who also suffered from prolonged severe methotrexate-induced pancytopenia. The objective {{of the study was}} to explore the nature of the cutaneous inflammatory infiltrate and the density in dermal dendrocytes (DD). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify activated T lymphocytes (CD 45 R 0), monocyte-macrophages (Mac 387, CD 68), DD (Factor XIIIa), and Langerhans cells (CD 1 a). The proliferation marker (Ki 67) and the antibody to Fas receptor (CD 95 R) were also used to assess the distribution of the germinative pool of keratinocytes and the FAS-related apoptotic process, respectively. Numerous Factor XIIIa+ DD were present in the papillary dermis with only <b>sparce</b> perivascular CD 45 RO+ T lymphocytes and scattered CD 68 + or Mac 387 + macrophages. Double immunostainings revealed that a minority of Factor XIIIa+ DD co-expressed the CD 68 glycoprotein (a marker of phagocytic activity). No cells co-expressed factor XIIIa and Mac 387 immunoreactivities. CD 45 RO+ T lymphocytes, CD 68 + and Mac 387 + macrophages were absent in the epidermis. The expression of CD 95 R was present although restricted to the basal keratinocytes, while the L 1 -protein (Mac 387 +) was diffusely present in the epidermis. Langerhans cells (CD 1 a+) were <b>sparce,</b> but normal in distribution. The presence of a great number of Factor XIIIa+ DD without any possible recent recruitment from bone marrow suggests that these cells differentiated from resident cells of the skin. Indeed, there was no co-expression of Factor XIIIa and L 1 -protein, thus showing the absence of recruitment from monocytes. The simultaneous over-expression of Factor XIIIa and CD 68 in some DD indicates some phagocytic activity. In view of the absence of inflammatory cells in the epidermis, keratinocytes appeared responsible for their own destruction through CD 95 -mediated and/or calcium-dependent apoptotic pathways. This finding entails that TEN treatments should target the keratinocyte metabolism rather than the circulating inflammatory cells which presumably play a limited role, if any, in the epidermal destructive process.
