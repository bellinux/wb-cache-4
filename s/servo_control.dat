5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a swept-wing version of the earlier F9F Panther, in February–March 1948, the design was reconfigured with a T-tail and ultimately a variable-geometry wing. It featured a T-tail, with the horizontal stabilator, a small pivoting center body with a delta <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> at the nose and a larger rear delta main wing, mounted atop the vertical fin. The single turbojet engine was fed by cheek intakes. The high, shoulder-mounted wing could be moved to two positions: a 13.5° sweep for takeoff and landing and a 42.5° sweep for high-speed flight.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} changes of the {{controller}} itself, the <b>servo</b> <b>controls</b> also saw major improvements over the years. Around 200x, with the V+ version reaching ver. 14, the <b>servo</b> amplifier and <b>controls</b> {{were part of the}} robot, and hence separated from the main robot controller itself. This is when distributed controls were introduced by the company. The idea of having the amplifier and <b>servo</b> <b>controls</b> in the base of the robot was named AIB (Amplifier in Base). Adept still follows the AIB mantra, and has an AIB in the latest robot, Adept Quattro, reducing the footprint of the robot/manipulator/controller system.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{precision}} of temperature control achieved in clinical practice during therapeutic hypothermia in neonates {{has not been}} described. METHODS: The hourly rectal temperature recordings from 17 infants treated with <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> and an equal number treated with manually adjusted cooling equipment were examined. The target rectal temperature for all infants is 33. 5 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: During 6 to 72 h after start of cooling, the mean (95 % CI, variance) of the averaged rectal temperatures was 33. 6 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 4 degrees C to 33. 8 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C) in the manually adjusted group and 33. 4 degrees C (95 % CI 33. 3 degrees C to 33. 5 degrees C, 0. 04 degrees C) in the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> group (means, p= 0. 08; equality of variance, p= 0. 03). The variance was also significantly different between infant groups during 1 to 5 h after start of cooling, p= 0. 01, but not during rewarming. CONCLUSION: The rectal temperature can be maintained close to the target temperature with either manually adjusted or <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> equipment, but there is less temperature variability with the <b>servo</b> <b>controlled</b> system in use in the UK...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A constraint-aware eye-in-hand visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> law is proposed. The {{control law}} is {{designed}} for a robot manipulator with an uncalibrated camera mounted on its end-effector. The method uses an image-based command to describe the desired end-effector position with respect to an object with an unknown position. When starting from an unknown position, the control law uses feedback from the camera to move the robot towards the reference image while satisfying a set of system constraints. The visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> law is implemented via a nonlinear model predictive control framework to generate feasible and realistic robot trajectories that respect the robot’s joint limits and velocity limits. The control law explicitly keeps the target object within the camera’s field of view and avoids potential collisions with workspace ob-stacles. An appropriate representation of the robot’s whole-arm collision constraints is extracted from well-known path planning methods, such as probabilistic road maps and dynamic collision checking algorithms. Experiments using an uncalibrated eye-in-hand platform demonstrate {{the ability of the}} visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> law to achieve closed-loop positioning via collision-free trajectories, even when the initial object location is uncertain.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for semi-autonomous operation of an under-actuated underwater vehicle. The contributions of this paper are twofold: The first contribution is a visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> scheme that is designed to provide a human operator the capability to steer the vehicle without loosing the target from the vision system's field of view. It is shown that the under-actuated degree of freedom is input-to-state stable (ISS) and a shaping of the user input with stability guarantees is implemented. The resulting control scheme has formally guaranteed stability and convergence properties. The second contribution is an asynchronous Modified Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (MDUKF) for the on-line state and parameter estimation of the vehicle by fusing data from a Laser Vision System (LVS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The MDUKF has been developed in order to experimentally verify the performance of the proposed visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> scheme. Experimental results of the visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> scheme integrated with the asynchronous MDUKF indicate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed con-trol scheme. Experiments have been carried out on a small under-actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a test tank...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Visual Servoing is an {{important}} problem in robotic vision. In this paper we propose algorithms for visual servoing using novel view prediction. A visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> law robust to large proportion of noisy outliers in image data is proposed. The method employs robust statistical techniques and novel view prediction. We also propose a visual <b>servoing</b> <b>control</b> law which results in faster convergence into a desired position. This algorithm employs novel view synthesis to minimize an error {{over a number of}} future views. We also show that view prediction can be effectively used for retaining the image features in the camera field of view during the motion. These techniques are validated with experiments and compared with other robust methods in a simulation framework. I...|$|R

The system is immune to static and dynamic stylus drag which otherwise cause unwanted speed variances that change the pitch and tempo of the music.|$|E
50|$|The {{turnaround}} sections {{are potentially}} unstable, since {{movement of the}} rotor away from the magnets gives reduced magnetic attraction, whereas movements closer gives increased attraction.
