40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} {{intraoperative}} performance and postoperative outcomes after microcoaxial torsional phacoemulsification using {{the straight and}} the curved phacotip configurations. METHODS:Cataracts were treated using 2. 2 mm microcoaxial transversal phacoemulsification with either a 30 °straight or 30 ° curved phaco tip. Intraoperative measurements analyzed included the average ultrasound(U/S) power, the total phacoemulsification time, and the effective phacoemulsification time(EPT). The central endothelial cell density(ECD) and the central corneal thickness(CCT) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 7 and 30 d after surgery using noncontact specular microscopy. RESULTS:The study enrolled a total of 190 eyes(190 patients), 95 eyes in the curved tip group and 95 eyes in <b>straight</b> <b>tip</b> group. Intraoperative measurements showed significantly reduced total phacoemulsification time, and EPT in the curved-tip group, compared to the straight-tip group(P st - 3 rd quartiles) and 18. 0 (9. 0 - 30. 0) s in curved-tip group, and 38. 8 (16. 5 - 73. 5) s and 26. 0 (11. 0 - 49. 0) s in the straight-tip group, respectively. CONCLUSION:Transversal phacoemulsification performed with a curved tip provided more effective lens removal with a less total UST and EPT in all grades, except for grades IV, compared to a <b>straight</b> <b>tip...</b>|$|R

50|$|The IS-23 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft. It {{had a high}} {{cantilever wing}} with constant chord inboard and slight taper beyond with almost square tips. The wing was equipped with various high lift devices to achieve the required STOL capability. The tail surfaces were constant chord and <b>straight</b> <b>tipped,</b> though the fin and rudder were slightly swept. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The rudder was horn balanced, fitted with a trim tab and cut away at the bottom to allow movement of the single piece elevator, also horn balanced.|$|R

The maximum chord, at the wing root, was 5 m, compared with a span of 7.2 m; the aspect ratio was 2.1. The trailing edge carried deep chord control surfaces, two per side: the outer pair were used differentially like ailerons and the inner ones as flaps.|$|R

30|$|Detachment {{occurs when}} the maximum stress at the contact tip overcomes the {{limiting}} stress for adhesion. Although the asymmetric dependence of the normal and tangential forces at the detachment can be obtained with a tilted beam structure, the beam tip shape also affects this dependence. In the case of tips with heel elongation, the overall detachment force increased compared with <b>straight</b> <b>tip</b> structures. In the case of tips with toe elongation, {{the intensity of the}} detachment force on the pulling angle and its asymmetry differed from those of the other samples. These findings demonstrate that the anisotropic friction behavior of oblique beam arrays can be enhanced by tuning the geometry of the beam tips.|$|R

50|$|Its wood framed, plywood skinned {{fuselage}} was hexagonal {{in cross}} section, tapering markedly on its underside towards the tail. The wing was {{mounted on a}} pedestal which sloped away aft into the upper fuselage. The pilot's cockpit, open behind a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the pedestal and below the wing leading edge. The tail surfaces were straight tapered and <b>straight</b> <b>tipped,</b> with the tailplane mounted on the fuselage. The rudder extended down to the keel, operating within a small cut-out between the elevators and protected from the ground by a small underfin which served as a tail bumper. There was a short landing skid running from near the nose to just aft of the wing strut.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, {{the wing}} was built around two spars. Over {{most of the}} span the wings had {{parallel}} chord but the outermost section, where the ailerons were carried, tapered to <b>straight</b> <b>tips.</b> A pair of parallel aluminium struts inside streamlined spruce fairings took lift and drag loads to the lower fuselage longerons. There were additional vertical struts, small ones as on the F.190 but more sturdy ones under the outboard engines. The empennage of the F.280 was also {{similar to that of}} the F.190, with a double strutted rectangular tailplane carrying separate elevators, with a rudder cut-out between them. This deep rudder, tabbed and horn balanced was likewise square edged, mounted on a very wide chord, shallow, straight edged fin.|$|R

After determining the proper microcatheter position for the occlusion, using the radiopaque tip of the microcatheter, the coronary guide wire was pulled out and a mixture of 900 -μm microspheres (Embozene, CeloNova BioSciences, Inc., Newnan GA, USA) was flushed into the coronary artery under fluoroscopic control. When the lumen of the coronary artery distal {{to the tip of}} the microcatheter was completely filled with microspheres, the injection was stopped, the occlusion was confirmed by repeated angiography, and the microcatheter was removed. At the end of a 90 -min monitoring period, the occlusion was confirmed by repeated angiography, and the femoral artery was decannulated and surgically ligated, and the wound was closed.|$|R
