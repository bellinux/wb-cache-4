5000|$|Since 2004, the caBIG program used {{open source}} communities, adapted from other {{public-private}} partnerships. The caBIG program produced software {{under contract to}} software development teams largely within the commercial research community.

Depending on the terms in specific contracts, they might be accessible only by request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The timeliness of response to such requests might preclude a requester from ever gaining any secondary value from software released under a FOIA request. [...] The caBIG program placed the all caBIG software in a software repository freely accessible for download. Open <b>source</b> <b>means</b> anyone can modify the downloaded software; however, the licensing applied to the downloaded software allows greater flexibility than is typical. An individual or enterprise is allowed to contribute the modified code back to the caBIG program but is not required to do so. Likewise, the modifications can be made available as open source but are not required to be made available as open source. The caBIG licensing even allows the use of the caBIG applications and components, combined with additions and modifications, to be released as commercial products. These aspects of the caBIG program actually encourage commercialization of caBIG technology.|$|E

Unfortunately, rainfall has not increased to match the needs of the growing population and the need for irrigation of fields.River Ganges flows 24 km away in the Western direction of the city and control of this source is difficult. The River Sone flows from East to West, before it drains into the River Ganges, and is the source for the Big Sone Canal which transports water throughout the city through a network of sub-canals.There are in Jagdispur about 8 big and deep ponds which stores rain water and is used for irrigation and waist drainage. The higher elevation of Jagdispur than the surrounding towns is a concern since more people and the needs for irrigating fields calls for an increased demand on ground water. At one time a hand pump was all that was necessary to bring up ground water. Increasing the depth of ground water wells has not fulfilled all the increasing water use demands of Jagdispur.Government should take care and implement some new features for water conservation such as Rain Water harvesting so that this City couldn't face water crisis in future as is faced by other cities.|$|E

The interrelated societies that lived in southern New England at the time of English settlement attempts {{at the beginning of the}} 17th century referred to themselves as Ninnimissinuok, a variation of the Narragansett word Ninnimissinnȗwock, meaning roughly [...] "people" [...] and signifying [...] "familiarity and shared identity." [...] Squanto's band or tribe, the Patuxet, occupied the coastal area west of Cape Cod Bay. Squanto himself told an English trader that the Patuxet once numbered 2,000. They spoke a dialect of Eastern Algonquian common to peoples as far west as Narragansett Bay. The various Algonquian dialects of Southern New England were sufficiently similar to allow effective communications. The term patuxet refers to the site of Plymouth, Massachusetts and, according to some writers (who may have misunderstood their <b>source),</b> <b>means</b> [...] "at the little falls." [...] Politically it has been generally (although not universally) inferred that the Patuxet had been subjugated by the so-called Wampanoags (Pokanoket) and made part of the so-called Wampanoag confederacy. Since the Patuxet had been decimated by disease before European settlement (see below), there are no written records of Patuxet life by first-hand observers. In such a case reasonable conclusions about a culture's organization and beliefs may be made by reference to other tribes in the same area [...] "which may be expected to share cultural traits." [...] In this case the Southern New England tribes were closely related linguistically (through similar Algonquin languages), politically (by the Pokanoket suzerainty), economically (by trade) and ethnically.|$|E
50|$|Radio Lumbini is {{the first}} radio outside Kathmandu valley, which is totally run by the local {{initiatives}} i.e. by farmers, industrialists, educationists, lawyers, businessmen, teachers, journalists etc. It was established on 10 February 2000. It {{is the first}} cooperative radio in the South Asia run by Lumbini Information and Communication Cooperative Ltd. It is totally responsible towards the society and community.The demand of the age is to explore the inherent knowledge, skill and other possibilities and to utilize them properly. Similarly, to protect, to continue {{as well as to}} flourish our traditional values, to inspire the people to improve the flaws and weaknesses gradually and to end the increasing absurdity, escapism and negativity is the sole aim of the society. To make aware people of the above-mentioned negative attitudes, it is necessary to have discussion. So, Radio Lumbini will pay its attention to put an end of these negative feelings. On the other hand, this radio will focus to unearth the identification of the people of Terai especially minority, schedule caste of Rupandehi, Kapilvastu and Nawalparasi and to explore and develop the inner capabilities of the people living in this area. To fulfill the aim,Radio Lumbini will be a very powerful means of communication.ObjectivesRadio is regarded as the modern <b>source</b> <b>means</b> of knowledge and Science. It is the major source of information, education and entertainment in our country where more than sixty per cent people are illiterate. In such a dire situation of illiteracy, Radio Lumbini has determined the following objectives to awaken the conscience of the common folk dwelling in this area:To implant the social awareness in the field of information, education and entertainment;To help to bring social and economic change;To arise the voice of women advocacy, children, aged people and deprived group as well as the voice of disabled people;To keep close relationship with digitally divided people through ICT (Information communication and Technology) centre;To develop listener club to increase the feeling of co operation;To encourage the rural brilliance;To make every citizen responsible and involve him/her in the field of construction and development;To arise conscience among people in the field of education, health, environment, sustainable development, human rights, nutrition, sanitation as well as community awareness;To identify the modern agricultural technology, animal husbandry and the alternative sources of income;To inform the industrial, commercial, cultural, educational and civic activities of this area;To introduce, protect and flourish the dialects, culture, child literature and folk traditions that are prevalent in this area;To arise the feelings of mutual co-operation, friendship and fraternity among the people of different castes, language, religion and culture;To broadcast the co-operative feelings, skilled national industry and national marketing system.To make people aware of their rights and duties.To launch broadcasting campaign for the spiritual awareness of the origin of world peace.To launch poverty alleviation programme.Station InformationRadio Lumbini can be heard at 96.8 MHz. The station of this radio is situated at Manigram in Rupandehi District. Manigram, the dwelling place of radio station is 8 km south from industrial, historical, educational and commercial city, Butwal and 13 km north to Bhairahawa, the district headquarters of Rupandehi. Manigram lies to the centre of the birthplace of Lord Gautam Buddha, lumbini and his maternal place Devdaha.This radio can be heard at every part of Rupandehi, Nawalparasi and Kapilvastu some parts of Kapilvastu, Palpa, Arghakhanchi and Gulmi districts.|$|E
