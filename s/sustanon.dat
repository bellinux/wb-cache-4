50|$|On 8 July 1998 Macdougall tested {{positive}} to stimulants ephedrine and amfepramone. MacDougall's A and B samples both also recorded an epitestosterone to testosterone level {{greater than the}} allowable 6:1 ratio - indicating the possible use of steroids. On 28 August {{he pleaded guilty to}} using one banned stimulant and was found to have inadvertently used another and received an 11-match ban along with team mates Robbie O'Davis and Wayne Richards who each received 22-week bans. It was revealed during his appeal that MacDougall had suffered a severe head injury in 1993 that damaged his pituitary gland and it was essential that he take prescribed medication, called <b>Sustanon</b> 250, which included a banned steroid. This medication restored normal hormone levels in his body and without it, he would suffer potentially serious side effects {{and not be able to}} lead a normal life, let alone play football.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sustanon</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone isocaproate and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of <b>Sustanon</b> on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. <b>Sustanon</b> significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by <b>Sustanon</b> administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that <b>Sustanon</b> can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|E

40|$|The present histopathological {{study on}} male guinea pigs aims to {{investigate}} the potential histopathological alterations and damages in the kidneys structure induced by the repeated administration of two doses of <b>Sustanon</b> drug. The treated animals {{in this study were}} injected once every week with two <b>Sustanon</b> doses as follow (15 mg kg - 1 in group GII and 30 mg kg - 1 in group GIII) for a continuous treatment period of 6 weeks. The histopathological examination of the of kidneys cross sections of the treated animals in group (GIII) showed multiple abnormal alterations and damages in the kidneys in the following forms glomeruli atrophy and glomeruli fragmentation accompanied with dilatation of the urinary spaces, abnormal vasodilatation of blood vessels, irregular dilatations of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules associated with degeneration of epithelial cells in the tubules lumens. Furthermore, the worst histopathological damages induced by <b>Sustanon</b> doses appeared in the form of massive and intensive blood hemorrhage in different places of the nephritic tissues, severe rupture of walls of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and wide abnormal lacerations inside the nephritic tissues. These results may prove that abusing high doses of <b>Sustanon</b> for long periods by athletes can cause severe histopathological damages in the kidneys structure. One of important points which can be concluded from the current results is that physicians should take renal disorders in mind seriously as one of the predictable complications resulting from abusing these drugs such as <b>Sustanon.</b> Finally, the present study recommends that athletes and youths should be supplied with much more medical enlightenment about the health risks and the complications which resulted from abusing these drugs through media...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: In recent years, the {{intentional}} abuse of anabolic androgenic drugs by athletes has increased rapidly {{in many countries}} to become a serious negative phenomenon. Athletes, specially in power sports, abuse these drugs such as <b>Sustanon</b> in high doses to obtain a rapid and huge increasing in the muscles mass and to improve their performance during the sport competitions. This abuse causes severe adverse effects among the abusers. Approach: The present physiological study was performed {{to answer the following}} question: could <b>Sustanon</b> abuse induce marked abnormal alterations in some hormones levels and in the kidneys functions?. The current study was needed {{due to the lack of}} sufficient information about the hormonal and nephritic adverse effects caused by <b>Sustanon</b> abuse in particular. This study on male Guinea pigs aimed to investigate the potential abnormal alterations in the levels of some hormones and in the kidney functions induced by repeated administration of two <b>Sustanon</b> doses. The treated animals were injected intramuscularly (i. m.) once a week with <b>Sustanon</b> doses as follow (15 mg Kg - 1 in group G II and 30 mg Kg - 1 in group G III) for a continuous treatment period of 6 weeks. Results: The results of the blood biochemical measurements showed statistical significant decreases in means of the serum levels of: Triiodothyronine (TT 3), Thyroxine (TT 4) and Insulin specially in the treated group (G III) (0. 42 Â± 0. 38 ng mL - 1, 3. 79 Â± 0. 15 Âµg dL - 1, 0. 62 Â± 0. 43 Âµl. U mL - 1, respectively) compared to the control group according to (t-test). This was accompanied by significant increase in mean of cortisol serum levels in the treated group (G III) (63. 44 Â± 4. 90 Âµg L - 1). At the same time, marked significant increases were recorded in the means of the serum levels of the blood compounds related to the kidney functions (Blood urea, Uric acid, Creatinine, Albumin and Na + and K +) in the treated group (G III) (53. 9 Â± 2. 70, 4. 76 Â± 0. 62, 1. 63 Â± 0. 24 Âµg dL - 1, 3. 38 Â± 0. 14 gm dL - 1, 10. 73 Â± 1. 65 and 143. 8 Â± 9. 55 Âµmol L - 1, respectively) compared to control group according to (t-test). The results have been described and discussed in full details within the text. Conclusion/Recommendations: The current hormonal results proved the occurrence of severe abnormal alterations in the serum levels of the thyroid gland hormones, Cortisol and Insulin under the influence of <b>Sustanon</b> treatment. This indicated that abusing <b>Sustanon</b> for long periods by athletes can cause serious pathological hormonal disorders in the abusers. In addition, the present nephritic results can be considered as strong proof that abusing <b>Sustanon</b> for long periods by athletes can induce severe defects and disorders in the kidney functions. This may lead to cause serious pathological damages in the kidneys structure in the late stages. Due to these serious adverse effects, it is recommended that much more official and medical restrictions should be applied to prevent abusers from obtaining these drugs in order to decrease the continuation of this negative health problem. In addition, the study recommends also that athletes and youths should be provided with much more medical information and enlightenment about the health risks and the complications of abusing these drugs through media...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to investigate the pathological effects of <b>sustanon</b> which {{is a type of}} anabolic androgens in different doses on testes of rats. The experiment included 100 rats randomly divided into five groups 20 rats to each group. The first group is considered as a negative control given diet and water only. The second group is considered a positive control treated weekly for 60 days with sesame oil intramuscularly, while groups III, IV and V treated with diluted <b>sustanon</b> in 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly weekly for 60 days respectively. The animals were euthanized on the periods 15, 30 and 60 day then samples of testes were taken and put in Bouin's solution and then placed in buffered neutral formalin 10 % for histopathological section.

40|$|Background: Pubertal {{delay and}} growth {{retardation}} {{are common in}} children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Aims: To assess pubertal status and growth {{in a group of}} boys with IBD undergoing testosterone therapy for pubertal induction. Methods: Retrospective study of height, weight and pubertal status in 8 boys with IBD before and after testosterone therapy. Height velocity (HV) over the 6 months before each assessment was converted to standard deviation score. Markers of disease activity and concomitant medication were recorded. Response was based on an advance in pubertal status and a greater than 50 % increase in HV. Results: Eight boys with IBD, median age 14. 8 years, had pubertal induction using either monthly injections of 50 mg <b>Sustanon</b> or daily 2. 5 / 5 mg Andropatch. Seven boys showed an advance of pubertal status. Six boys had a greater than 50 % increase in HV; median HV at T 0 was 1. 6 cm/year (0, 5) compared with 6. 9 cm/year (1, 11. 7) at T 6 (p = 0. 005).

40|$|Anabolic {{steroid use}} is {{becoming}} increasingly more popular in the United States. Many deleterious effects have been described in the literature, yet {{there is still much}} to be understood. Our case describes a severe cardiomyopathy {{as a result of an}} extensive anabolic-androgenic steroid regimen in a weightlifter. A 38 -year old male with no past medical history presented to our emergency department complaining of worsening dyspnea over two weeksâ duration. Pertinent findings showed a patient in atrial fibrillation with marked jugular venous distension, extensive pulmonary crackles, and lower extremity edema. Diagnostic evaluation included imaging demonstrating cardiomegaly with marked pulmonary edema. Echocardiography showed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 16 % with severe biventricular failure and biatrial and biventricular enlargement. Our patient ultimately admitted to the use of a âsophisticatedâ anabolic steroid regimen, including using trenbolone enanthate, testosterone enanthate, <b>sustanon,</b> stanozolol, oxandrolone, clenbuterol, as well as tamoxifen and anastrozole. Clinic follow-up three weeks after the initiation of heart failure medications with discontinuation of the steroid regimen showed improvement in his cardiac function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 38 %. Our case demonstrates the possibility of a severe cardiomyopathy as a result of anabolic steroid use. It also suggests that prompt discontinuation of such substances can lead to reversibility of the condition. Our case also emphasizes the complexity of a steroid regimen in an abuser...|$|E
40|$|Puberty {{is highly}} {{important}} for the accumulation of bone mass. Bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) can be affected in transgender adolescents when puberty is suppressed by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), followed by treatment with cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT). We aimed to investigate the effect of GnRHa and CSHT on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) in transgender adolescents. Gender dysphoria was diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-IV (TR). Thirty four female-to-male persons (transmen) and 22 male-to-female persons (transwomen) were included. Patients were allocated to a young (bone age of < 15 years in transwomen or < 14 in transmen) or old group (bone age of â¥ 15 years in transwomen or â¥ 14 years in transmen). All were treated with GnRHa triptorelin and CSHT was added in incremental doses {{from the age of}} 16 years. Transmen received testosterone esters (<b>Sustanon,</b> MSD) and transwomen received 17 -Î² estradiol. P 1 NP, osteocalcin, ICTP and BMD of lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were measured at three time points. In addition, BMAD and Z-scores were calculated. We found a decrease of P 1 NP and 1 CTP during GnRHa treatment, indicating decreased bone turnover (young transmen 95 % CI - 74 to - 50 %, p= 0. 02, young transwomen 95 % CI - 73 to - 43, p= 0. 008). The decrease in bone turnover upon GnRHa treatment was accompanied by an unchanged BMAD of FN and LS, whereas BMAD Z-scores of predominantly the LS decreased especially in the young transwomen. Twenty-four months after CSHT the BTMs P 1 NP and ICTP were even more decreased in all groups except for the old transmen. During CSHT BMAD increased and Z-scores returned towards normal, especially of the LS (young transwomen CI 95 % 0. 1 to 0. 6, p= 0. 01, old transwomen 95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 8, p= 0. 04). To conclude, suppressing puberty by GnRHa leads to a decrease of BTMs in both transwomen and transmen transgender adolescents. The increase of BMAD and BMAD Z-scores predominantly in the LS as a result of treatment with CSHT is accompanied by decreasing BTM concentrations after 24 months of CSHT. Therefore, the added value of evaluating BTMs seems to be limited and DXA-scans remain important in follow-up of bone health of transgender adolescent...|$|E
40|$|Background: Impotence is a {{consistent}} inability to sustain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. Testosterone administration in men with liver cirrhosis improves {{the sense of}} well-being, increase serum proteins and reduces edema without serious adverse effects. Oral, alkylated forms of testosterone can create a situation of liver toxicity. There {{is little evidence that}} other methods of administration cause liver dysfunction. Most doctors be indecisive on prescribing androgen preparations in patients with liver disease, so this work was designed to study the effect of androgen replacement (injectable form) on the murine diseased liver, and subsequently whether it can be used safely in men with chronic liver disease or not. Objective: To evaluate the effect of exogenous injectable androgen and praziquantel on the diseased liver of mice. Setting: National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI). Materials and methods: Forty male mouse (weighing 25 - 30 g) were infested subcutaneously with Schistosoma mansoni (100 cercariae/animal), and then they were divided into four groups. Mice in the first group were infected only and used as infected control group. Mice of group II and IV were given the Schistosomicide, praziquantel in a dose of 0. 3 mg/mouse. Androgen (<b>Sustanon)</b> was injected intramuscularly in a dose of 0. 125 mg/mouse, (three doses, 3 weeks apart) in group III and IV. At the end of the trial all animals were then sacrificed to study histopathologically the possible effects of androgen on the liver tissue. Liver function tests were done in animals of group I, III, and IV, first prior to study and finally by the end of study. Results of assayed liver function tests and histopathological examination were tested for statistical significant association. Results: there were marked elevation of the liver enzymes in mice of group IV compared to the corresponding control (p 0. 05) compared to group I. There was a reduction of granulomas diameter in group III and IV (animals injected with androgen) in comparison to group I (P> 0. 05 and P< 0. 01) respectively. Also comparison between the four groups as regards the type of bilharzial granulomas, it is clearly evident that the predominant type of granulomas in the androgen treated groups is the cellular type (38 % and 57. 1 %) in group III and IV respectively and this may reflect the possible beneficial effect of androgen on the diseased liver...|$|E
