5|$|While still {{residing}} in Lawton, Crawford's stepfather {{was accused of}} embezzlement. Although he was acquitted in court, he was blacklisted in Lawton, and {{the family moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri, around 1916. Following their relocation, Cassin, a Catholic, placed Crawford at <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes</b> Academy in Kansas City. When her mother and stepfather separated, she remained at <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes</b> as a work student, where she spent far more time working, primarily cooking and cleaning, than studying.|$|E

The original Sisters included Emilie St. Joseph, ThaÏsie-Marie, Jeanne Gabrielle, Valérie St. Antoine, <b>St.</b> Clément, <b>Agnés</b> <b>St.</b> Charles, Marie St. Aubin, Emilie, and Eléonore.

5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes,</b> and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure {{that there would be no}} politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.|$|E
5|$|After an {{earthquake}} in 1853, the reliquary enclosing {{an image of}} Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Our Lady of Mount Carmel), originally situated at the Mount Carmel chapel, {{was moved to the}} Santa María de la Cabeza castle, where Santos Berrizbeitia built a new chapel in 1912 to protect the image; it was later moved to <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes</b> Church. The ditch was filled in for construction of the Mount Carmel chapel and the deteriorated parapets were demolished. The original slopes and terraces present on Diaz Fajardo's 1737 map were probably also buried in the process. The chapel in the castle was the final resting place for Berrizbeitia; his remains, originally interred at Holy Trinity Cemetery (which he had built), were exhumed and moved five years after his death.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the medieval}} parish church of St Mary in Old Town, another {{remarkable}} church building in Eastbourne is the redbrick St Saviour's and St Peter's. Originally consecrated under the former name in 1872, it was designed by George Edmund Street but merged with St Peter’s in 1971 when the latter was made redundant and demolished. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of Ransom is a generously proportioned building with a tall Gothic interior. One of the windows commemorates the exiled Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, Prince Lev Sapieha, {{who lived in the}} town, and there is much other artwork in the building. The recently formed Personal Ordinariate of Anglicans reconciled to the Catholic Church meets at <b>St</b> <b>Agnes,</b> another Victorian Gothic building.|$|E

5|$|In his post-baseball career, Day {{worked as}} a {{bartender}} in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position {{as a security guard}} until 1979. Before Day's death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and induct Day into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day's Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day's discreet demeanor and humble personality often understated his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame's voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes</b> Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of British power, English {{education}} gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local languages. These changes were orchestrated by Lord Elphinstone, {{the governor of the}} Madras Presidency. His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board in 1841. Accordingly, a high school department of the university was established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with each college becoming central to many local schools (zilla schools). The earliest English-medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the region. In 1858, the department of education was founded in Mysore and by 1881, there were an estimated 2,087 English-medium schools in the state of Mysore. Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central College in Bangalore (1870), Maharaja's College (1879), Maharani's College (1901) and the Mysore University (1916) in Mysore and the <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes</b> College in Mangalore (1921).|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Day {{opened a}} new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were {{successful}} enough to amicably separate their businesses. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and <b>St</b> <b>Agnes</b> and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon {{established himself as a}} quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of his competitors, Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's Catechism in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing the Catechism in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's Catechism.|$|E

5000|$|Christian {{churches have}} {{existed in the}} area covered by this list since Anglo-Saxon times, {{although}} architectural features from that era are uncommon. Norman features are much more common and are found in many churches, including <b>St</b> Martin, Burton <b>Agnes,</b> <b>St</b> Mary, Fridaythorpe, All Hallows, Goodmanham, and St Nicholas, Newbald. [...] All but three of the churches in the list were built before the 17th century, {{and all of them}} contain features of English Gothic architecture, all periods of this style being represented. Three churches were built in the 19th century. The Chapel of the Virgin and St Everilda at Everingham (1836-39) is a Roman Catholic chapel in Italianate style. [...] The other two churches are in Gothic Revival style: St Leonard, Scorborough (1857-59), and St Mary, South Dalton (1858-61). [...] Gothic Revival architecture is also found in additions made to churches during the 19th and 20th centuries in, for example, St James, Nunburnholme, and All Saints, Skipsea.|$|R
5|$|Doris Louise Sands {{was born}} on 19 June 1921 in <b>St.</b> <b>Agnes,</b> New Providence, The Bahamas, to Sarah Elizabeth (née Fyne) and John Albert Sands. After {{completing}} her secondary education, Sands began teaching {{at the age of}} fifteen. On 3 January 1943 at Zion Baptist Church in Nassau, Sands married Ratal Allen Johnson. They subsequently had one son and Johnson worked for 17 years to earn the money to further her education. Around 1953, she was able to enroll at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education. She returned to the Bahamas in 1956 and joined the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). Granted a four-year government scholarship to further her education in Canada, Johnson enrolled in a master's degree program in educational administration. Beginning her studies at MacDonald College of Education of McGill University, she earned her master's degree and began work on her doctorate at the Ontario College of Education at the University of Toronto. In the midst of her studies, the government terminated the scholarship during her third year of studying abroad, under the guise that her master's degree had been completed. Johnson believed that the scholarship was terminated because she had been active in organizing. She helped found the Women’s Suffrage Movement in the Bahamas, and in 1958 both the Bahamian Federation of Labour and the National Council of Women, traveling home intermittently during her studies to work towards enfranchisement. She returned home, but was advised that the only available positions for teaching administrators were in outlying islands.|$|E

Anne Carroll further enhanced her almost unbelievable record in this competition by winning her fourth club championship medal in five seasons.|$|R
