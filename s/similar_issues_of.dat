2500|$|Forming {{communities}} in the Red River and the Saskatchewan valleys, they initially had fewer problems with {{the expansion of the}} Canadian state westward during the 19th century than did their francophone cousins. They tended to identify more with the politically and economically dominant British culture of Canada at this time. [...] Additionally, the Anglo-Métis / Countryborn had a more sedentary lifestyle of farming than the francophone Métis community, whose men were generally hunters and trappers. The French-speaking Métis were somewhat more nomadic, due to their reliance upon hunting as a trade and food resource. The Countryborn played a role in both the Red River Rebellion (or [...] "Red River Uprising") of 1869 and the Northwest Rebellion (or [...] "Northwest Uprising") of 1885, as they suffered from <b>similar</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> racial discrimination and land problems as their francophone brethren.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} latency, simple stop-the-world garbage {{collectors}} pause program execution for garbage collection, which can happen at arbitrary times and take arbitrarily long, making them unusable for real-time computing, notably embedded systems, and a poor fit for interactive use, {{or any other}} situation where low latency is a priority. However, incremental garbage collectors can provide hard real-time guarantees, and on systems with frequent idle time and sufficient free memory, such as personal computers, garbage collection can be scheduled for idle times and have minimal impact on interactive performance. Manual memory management (as in C++) and reference counting have a <b>similar</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> arbitrarily long pauses in case of deallocating a large data structure and all its children, though these only occur at fixed times, not depending on garbage collection.|$|R

50|$|The Navy has had warrant {{officers}} {{among its}} ranks since 23 December 1775, when John Berriman received a warrant {{to act as}} purser aboard the brigantine, USS Andrew Doria. That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains. Until 1912, a midshipman graduating from the United States Naval Academy was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an ensign. Although based on the British Royal Navy warrant officer ranks that were in place until 1949, the United States had never needed to address an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> aristocracy, which resulted in warranted officers in the Royal Navy. However, the United States Navy experienced a <b>similar</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.|$|R

50|$|Another {{issue in}} futile care theory {{concerns}} {{the range of}} ethical options when care is determined to be futile. Some people argue that futile clinical care should be a market commodity that {{should be able to}} be purchased just like cruise vacations or luxury automobiles, as long as the purchaser of the clinical services has the necessary funds and as long as other patients are not being denied access to clinical resources as a result. In this model, Baby K {{would be able to get}} ICU care (primarily ventilatory care) until funding vanished. With rising medical care costs and an increase in extremely expensive new anti-cancer medications, the <b>similar</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> equity often arise in treatment of end-stage cancer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an empirical study of decision-making when changing the architecture in embedded systems.

This study investigates the information needed to make a decision about a system refactoring. Scenario-based interviews have been conducted with managers and system architects from companies developing embedded systems. The results show that the companies investigate <b>similar</b> <b>issues</b> regardless <b>of</b> their industry sector. The most wanted information prior to a decision is also presented...|$|R

50|$|Ellen Brooks {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California. She {{received}} both her Bachelor’s degree and her Master’s degree in Fine Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1968 and 1971 respectively. Her early works dealt primarily with human figures, notably Beach Piece, an early work in which she employed the photographic medium to address issues of alienation versus bodily presence in space. The work, which featured larger-than-lifesize nude figures in various poses of recline, was installed on Venice Beach, from which the figures appeared to half-emerge from the sand. During her graduate studies she constructed a series of flats Flats 1-5 which were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970 exhibition Photography Into Sculpture. The flats addressed <b>similar</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> scale to Beach Piece from the opposite direction, incorporating the viewer’s vantage point from above to obfuscate the objects’ situation in space.|$|E

The area has quik clay, so the bridge needed piling. At Røra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inderøy the right-of-way had to be moved because of poor soil mechanics. There were <b>similar</b> <b>issues</b> north <b>of</b> the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a supporting being built.
