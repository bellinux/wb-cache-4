5000|$|Corylus yunnanensis is {{a species}} of {{hazelnut}} found in western China. It is a small tree or shrub. The flowers have triglar shaped petals. The <b>round</b> <b>nuts</b> which are encased in a very tough oval shaped shell and can be consumed by humans. The plant is not commercially grown for the nuts, rather they are sometimes used as ornamental plants. They are located in Western Guizhou, Hubei, South Western and Western Sichuan, and Western Yunnan.|$|R
50|$|Gahnia aspera grows as a strappy tussock 50 - 100 cm high by 50 - 150 cm across, {{with leaves}} to 80 cm long. The {{underside}} of the leaves and leaf edges are sharp and can easily cut human skin. The creamy flowers grow in spikes from {{the centre of the}} plant and appear from October to January. They are followed by shiny red or red-brown <b>round</b> <b>nuts,</b> which measure 4.5 to 6.0 mm long, 2.5 to 4.0 mm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|These {{are very}} similar to the <b>round</b> base <b>nuts,</b> but with an , or slab shaped, base. These are used in channels, tubes, or other tight quarters.|$|R
50|$|Gahnia sieberiana grows as a tall strappy tussock to 2 m {{high and}} wide, with rough flat leaves. The leaf margins have tiny {{serrations}} that are sharp and can cut {{the hands of}} those handling the plant. The tall black flowers grow in spikes from the centre of the plant and can rise another metre above the clump, appearing in spring and summer. They are followed by shiny red or red-brown <b>round</b> <b>nuts,</b> which measure 2.5 to 4.0 mm long, 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|There is one (1) slot {{for each}} node in a TTP network. A node always {{transmit}}s data (parameters) during its slot, {{even if the}} node has no data to send. However a node will only transmit the parameters that it is configured to send for the specific <b>ROUND</b> that the <b>slot</b> is in. A node may transmit parameters 1,2,3 in its <b>SLOT</b> during <b>ROUND</b> x and parameters 4,5,6 in its <b>SLOT</b> during <b>ROUND</b> y.|$|R

50|$|The seed heads, or infructescences, of Leucadendron are woody cone-like structures. This {{gave rise}} to their generic common name cone-bush. The cones contain {{numerous}} seeds. The seed morphology is varied and reflects subgeneric groupings within the genus. A few such as the Silvertree, Leucadendron argenteum have a silky-haired parachute, enabling the large <b>round</b> <b>nut</b> to be dispersed by wind. A few are rodent dispersed, cached by rats, and a few have elaiosomes and are dispersed by ants. About half the species store the seeds in fire-proof cones and release them only after a fire has killed the plant {{or at least the}} branch bearing the cone. Many such species hardly recruit naturally except after fires.|$|R

50|$|There are few {{differences}} between both viroids in the effects caused on fruit: CTiVd causes small nuts, while CCCVd causes <b>round</b> and reduced <b>nuts.</b> Moreover, CTiVd has 254 nucleotides of length, while CCCVd has 246.|$|R
30|$|This {{approach}} {{consists in}} both TXs transmitting simultaneously {{regardless of the}} resulting interference, hence requiring one time <b>slot</b> per transmission <b>round.</b> We refer to this approach as INTF (interference).|$|R

The gap, set by the {{distance}} between the nut {{and the end of the}} tube, regulates the influx of the air in a way similar to the open slots of the Bunsen burner. The Teclu burner provides better mixing of air and fuel, which is what allows it to achieve higher flame temperatures than the Bunsen burner.|$|R

40|$|Scalable Resource Allocation (ScRA) {{algorithm}} is developed {{to improve the}} mobile network radio resource utilization [l]. The traditional mobile dimensioning {{is based on the}} “busy hour” traffic intensity, and this Static Resource Allocation (StRA) methodology {{does not seem to be}} able to provide efticient radio resource utilization for the future/present multi services environment, with their expected spatially and temporally varying loads. This is in hindrance for the introduction of wireless IP based services, for which the demand is rapidly increasing. This paper provides an extension analysis by incorporating single slot FIFO and single <b>slot</b> <b>Round</b> Robin (single <b>slot</b> RR), blocked-call cleared (BCC) and blocked-call delayed (BCD) strategies in the ScRA scheme. By employing the ScRA scheme in an example GSM and GPRS network, we specifically investigate and evaluate the system throughput for both the circuit-and packet-switched networks. The findings show that single slot FIFO ScRA and single slot RR ScRA schemes obtained no difference in system throughput. On the other hand, when BCD is implemented in ScRA scheme, there is significant throughput gain...|$|R

CFQ {{in the quest}} of being fair divides the I/O bandwidth (time <b>slots)</b> in <b>round</b> robin fashion amongst all the contending processes. This results in increase {{of the total number}} of disk head movements for serving the same I/O access requests, as different applications (processes) access data from multiple regions of the disk in a cyclic manner.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese walnut (J.ailantifolia) {{is similar}} to butternut, {{distinguished}} by the larger leaves up to 90cm long, and <b>round</b> (not oval) <b>nuts.</b> The variety cordiformis, often called the heartnut has heart-shaped nuts; the common name of this variety {{is the source of}} the sectional name Cardiocaryon.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{deciduous}} tree {{growing to}} 30 m tall. The foliage {{is similar to}} Pterocarya, with pinnate leaves 20-25 cm long with five to eleven leaflets, the terminal leaflet present; the leaflets are 5-14 cm long and 2-6 cm broad. The flowers are catkins; the male (pollen) catkins are produced in clusters (not singly as in Pterocarya), the female catkins 25-30 cm long at maturity, bearing several small winged nuts with a circular wing 2.5-6 cm diameter right <b>round</b> the <b>nut</b> (instead of two wings at the sides as in Pterocarya).|$|R

40|$|Producing less, but {{selling for}} more. That, in a nutshell, {{is the new}} {{philosophy}} being embraced by farmers in Burundi, who are launching themselves headlong into diversification. The golden age of coffee, which accounted for 80 % of export revenues before the civil war, is now {{drawing to a close}} in this small, land-locked country. The fall in world prices, together with climate-related problems have disheartened many farmers, who are now turning to new crops (roses, vetiver, passion fruit) in an effort to penetrate more export-oriented markets. A case in point is a project to grow macadamia nuts (Macadamia ternifolia) launched by ISABU, the agricultural research institute in Burundi. Served as a snack, the white kernel of this small <b>round</b> <b>nut</b> is increasingly sought after in Western markets. Its extremely fine oil is prized for cosmetic use. The Burundi government has made a US$ 250, 000 (206, 000) grant to create a nursery containing several thousand macadamia saplings. Each farmer will receive 20 small trees, which, in 2 -years time, should yield between 400 and 800 kg of nuts. The shelled nut currently fetches US$ 12 (about 10) a kilo on the international market. Producing less, but selling for more. That, in a nutshell, is the new philosophy being embraced by farmers in Burundi, who are launching themselves headlong into diversification...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{manufacturing}} artifacts {{on the performance}} of infrared frequency selective surfaces (FSS) is investigated in this article. For cross-slot structures, these artifacts include slot length variation, slot width variation, the variation of spacing among elements, structural center broadening, and <b>slot</b> edge <b>rounding.</b> Quantitative measures of these effects on FSS transmission spectrum are obtained via a three-dimensional (3 D) periodic finite-difference time-domain method. The study shows that peak transmission intensity, resonant wavelength, and half-max bandwidth of the transmission spectrum can be significantly affected by these manufacturing artifacts...|$|R
