The Method 0010 <b>sampling</b> <b>train</b> collects semivolatile organic compounds with boiling points above 100 EC. Some of these semivolatile organic compounds may not be amenable to gas chromatography and will require the application of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantitative analysis. The use of HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) is an analytical technique that may also be applied. A solvent exchange from methylene chloride to a more polar solvent such as acetonitrile or extraction with a solvent other than methylene chloride will probably be required for successful application of HPLC techniques.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{sampling}} and analysis method for arsenic emissions during pyrolysis of arsenic containing wood, such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood, has been developed. The procedure {{is based on the}} NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standard for arsenic trioxide sampling. Validation for this specific application is needed since pyrolysis of arsenic containing wood leads to a gas stream containing sticky tar compounds and aerosols. Validation was carried out through tube furnace experiments using both CCA treated wood and arsenic trioxide powder as input. The outlet of the tube furnace was coupled to a cooling section and <b>sampling</b> <b>train.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>train</b> consisted of one or more filter sections and impingers. Different combinations of filters (untreated or impregnated) and impingers, as well as different combinations of washing solutions were tested.

For the working conditions considered (pyrolysis at 350 degreesC for 20 minutes with a nitrogen flow rate of 100 Nl h(- 1)) the combination of a quartz cooling tube and a cellulose ester membrane filter impregnated with a Na 2 CO 3 -glycerol solution was sufficient to capture the arsenic. Two extra impingers (the first one containing 50 ml HNO 3 1 M in the case of CCA treated wood and 50 ml NaOH 0. 1 M in the case of As 2 O 3 and the second one containing 50 ml NaOH 0. 1 M) were added downstream of the filter section as backup either in case of filter failure or to check whether all the arsenic released is captured by the cooling tube and filter. status: publishe...|$|E

Therefore, a pilot study has been created to get a more accurate estimate {{of whether or not}} there is pesticide breakthrough while wearing a half mask respirator and 15 mil nitrile gloves and if so, when that breakthrough occurs. An ambient <b>sampling</b> <b>train</b> and a <b>sampling</b> <b>train</b> behind a cartridge were created to compare the air concentrations in respirators, and positioned near the applicator during pesticide application. Passive media patches were placed underneath gloves to measure dermal exposure. Charcoal media was used to sample for horticultural oil, and PUF media was used to sample for chlorpyrifos. Two sites were sampled; chlorpyrifos and horticultural oil was sprayed at Site A and only horticultural oil was sprayed at site B. Media was changed out once a day. The sampling media was tested for hydrocarbons, alkanes, aromatics, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, pentadecane, siloxanes and trimethyl benzene. The concentrations of the compounds were measured, and the frequency of breakthrough was calculated for each kind of media. A mass-to-mass ratio, comparing the ambient concentrations from the cartridge concentrations, was also calculated. The results show that the PPE that is worn is not providing adequate protection from the pesticides that are being sprayed, but more study is needed to elaborate on these results.

The phase distribution and concentrations are needed to determine strategies of exposure assessment, hazard control, and worker protection. However, procedures for establishing phase distribution and concentration have not been standardized. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare measurements of an airborne semivolatile pesticide (chlorpyrifos) by phase using two different procedures. Six pesticide applications in two facilities were studied and at each site, samples were collected for three time slots: T 1, the first 1 or 2 hr after the commencement of application; T 2, a 6 -hr period immediately following T 1; and T 3, a 6 -hr period after the required re-entry interval (24 hr for chlorpyrifos). Two phase-separating devices were co-located at the center of each greenhouse: semivolatile aerosol dichotomous sampler (SADS) using flow rates of 1. 8 l x min(- 1) and 0. 2 l x min(- 1), corresponding to a total inlet flow rate of 2. 0 l x min(- 1) with a vapor phase flow fraction of 0. 1; and an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), along with a standard OVS XAD- 2 tube.

Fine particle mass emission rates and fine particle elemental chemical composition are measured as well. The emissions profiles collected by use of the dilution source sampler are used to develop receptor-based air quality models that use organic compounds as tracers to determine source contributions to gas-phase and particle-phase air pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere. These models are applied to study source contributions to the existing particulate and gas-phase organic air pollution problems in Southern California and in California's San Joaquin Valley.
