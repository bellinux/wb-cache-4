The model allows us to characterize cooperation networks - networks in which each seller cooperates (by providing high quality goods) with every buyer that is connected to her. To this end, we provide conditions under which: [1] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate depend only on her beliefs with respect to her local neighborhood - a subnetwork that includes <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> and is of a size that is independent {{of the size of the}} entire network; and [2] the incentives of a <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> to cooperate can be calculated as if the network was a random tree with <b>seller</b> <b>s</b> at its root.

The method which is used in this research is the quantitative with positivistic approach. This research used The Reasoned Action Theory and The Reference Group Theory. This research is using non probability samling technique. The population in this research is girls age 10 - 16 in Indramayu district. While the sample is 60 respondens. The data is analyzed with the aid of SPSS aplication with Pearson correlation test. The result of this research indicate there is correlation between the intensity of parent – child communication and girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early with significance value is 0, 001 and Pearson correlation value is - 0, 434.

If the intensity of parent – child communication is low, then girl 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>interest</b> to marry early is high.

In the 1970 s, leftists began targeting U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests,</b> including military personnel. By 1980, the left had killed ten Americans. Although severely crippled following Turkey's 1980 coup, Devrimci Sol-the most prominent group-re-emerged in 1990 and dramatically increased attacks against U. <b>S.</b> <b>interests</b> during the Gulf War, perpetrating 75 percent of all terrorist-related U.

Their analysis improves on the existing literature and understanding by addressing the dynamics of market expectations in shaping views on interest rate and monetary policy changes and by recognizing nonlinearities in the link between U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and emerging market bond spreads, {{as the level of}} interest rates affect the market's perceived probability of default and the solvency of emerging market borrowers.

The nonparametric model exhibits greater out-of-sample forecast accuracy than that of the linear predictors for most U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate series.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{stressed}} the role of movements in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates and country spreads in driving business cycles in emerging market economies. At the same time, country spreads have been found to respond to changes in both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate and domestic conditions in emerging markets. These intricate interrelationships leave open a number of fundamental questions: Do country spreads drive business cycles in emerging countries or vice versa, or both? Do U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates affect emerging countries directly or primarily through their effect on country spreads? This paper addresses these and other related questions using a methodology that combines empirical and theoretical elements. The main findings are: (1) U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rate shocks explain about 20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging market economies at business-cycle frequency. (2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in emerging economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in U. <b>S.</b> <b>interest</b> rates, country spreads first fall and then display a large, delayed overshooting; (5) U. S. -interest-rate shocks affect domestic variables mostly through their effects on country spreads. (6) The fact that country spreads respond to business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates aggregate volatility in these countries. (7) The U. S. -interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks identified in this paper are plausible {{in the sense that they}} imply similar business cycles in the context of an empirical VAR model as they do in the context of a theoretical dynamic general equilibrium model of an emerging market economy.
