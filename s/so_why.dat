5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. <b>So,</b> <b>why</b> are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

Well, at first, in the 1930s and 1940s, they tried, {{and they got}} riots in the streets: mass picketing, secondary strikes, etc. But after Taft-Hartley, unions couldn't retaliate like this, or they would end up with penalty fines and jail sentences.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} Grant whether Cameron had {{encouraged}} the Metropolitan Police to [...] "drag their feet" [...] on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, {{and stated that}} police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: [...] "20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> would they want to open up that can of worms?...

500|$|... "For {{too long}} in this society, we have celebrated {{unrestrained}} individualism over common community. For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest.

We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference." ...|$|E

These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> shouldn't they be so today."

500|$|Jeremy Davis—the band's bassist—expounded on {{what they}} felt before {{releasing}} the song, [...] "After we started writing weird stuff like 'Ain't It Fun', we got nervous.

[...] York considered {{that the decision to}} bring a gospel choir would have been difficult to approve if the original lineup of the band had remained. The track was mixed by Ken Andrews, and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studios.|$|E
500|$|Raoul Berger, in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, disagrees; {{the words}} of the statute were clear, and the only {{application}} that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the Constitutional Commentary, concurs: [...] "If that were <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> did they not say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?" ...|$|E

500|$|A {{disagreement}} arose {{regarding the}} number of chemical weapons sites in contested areas of Syria, with the Syrian foreign minister stating that one-third of sites are in such areas.

[...] According to the OPCW chief, one abandoned site is in rebel-held territory and routes to others lead through rebel-held territory. Malik Ellahi of the OPCW states that few of the locations inspectors must visit will be difficult to access.|$|E
500|$|Corgan and Chamberlin {{continued}} to {{record as a}} duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles [...] "Superchrist" [...] and [...] "G.L.O.W." [...] later that year. That November, the group released the DVD If All Goes Wrong, which chronicled the group's 2007 concert residences in Asheville, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, [...] "The listening patterns have changed, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track {{to set up the}} single? It's done." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Process {{theology}} typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather {{than seeing}} God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands", {{and as the}} being who is supremely affected by temporal events. [...] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – <b>so</b> <b>why</b> would this be a praise-worthy quality in God? [...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. [...] However, process theology has been formulated {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a [...] "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.|$|E
500|$|Wark's {{autobiography}} Wark On {{was published}} on 9 April 2009. The book contained material that gained media interest.

[...] "Wark used {{his share of the}} cash to help pay for his wedding while a team-mate bankrolled a house extension. He added: [...] "Other teams had done it, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> shouldn’t we? [...] Nowadays it's illegal but in those days it was regarded as a perk." [...] The report also highlighted Wark's [...] "dig" [...] at the current [...] "crop of stars" [...] at Anfield.

500|$|According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, Smallville's Clark Kent was {{a better}} {{representation}} of the original material and remained [...] "true {{to the heart of}} the story" [...] by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told: [...] "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?" ...|$|E
