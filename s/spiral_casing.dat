40|$|Plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) of subsea wells {{often involves}} removal of steel casing. In {{some parts of}} the well the casing is cemented in place making the operation of retrieving the casing more complex. The conventional methods for retrieving casing are unpredictable in terms of time consumption and consequently cost. This thesis has investigated the current guidelines and regulations that apply for P&A. Further, the conventional methods for removing cemented casing have been analyzed and compared to alternative approaches that have not yet been field proven. A case study on a Cut and Pull operation performed by Statoil was assessed to identify key operational issues. The case study suggested {{that there is a need}} for new approaches for freeing cemented casing. An alternative method for removal of cemented casing has been proposed, namely the Spiral Cut Approach (SCA). Laboratory testing of small scale spiral cut specimens were performed, and it was found that the spiral cut allows the cement to debond successively along the surface of the specimen exposed to torsional loading, thus freeing the casing. FE-analysis were performed to investigate the criticality of the spiral cut pitch and the required torque for a fullscale casing. The method is based on debonding one joint of casing from the cement before moving on to the next casing joint. After the spiral cut has been made between the casing couplings, each casing joint is exposed to sufficient torque to overcome the cement bond between each casing joint (approximately 12 m). Finally, a drillstring deployed pulling tool is connected to the upper section of the casing string and the casing is retrieved in one go. Operational steps and tools necessary to perform the SCA have been assessed. The laboratory testing, FE-analysis and operational assessment indicated that a significant higher number of casing joints can be pulled in one go using the SCA. A time comparison based on the case study and an assessment of the SCA, indicated that a total time saving of 2 days can be made by using the SCA to retrieve 100 m of cemented casing. However, more work will have to be carried out for more detailed verification of the SCA. This includes development of a effective tool for <b>spiral</b> cutting of <b>casing,</b> a combined tool for applying torque and pull for retrieval of cemented casing and lastly an assessment on the effects of using extended diameter couplings. </p...|$|R

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of fluid flow characteristics in a 360 ^∘ turn around <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> {{plays an important role in}} its design. The objective in this study is to propose an optimum <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> configuration by reducing the total pressure loss and increasing the spiral velocity coefficient and average radial velocity at the exit of <b>spiral</b> <b>casing.</b> For this, three different configurations of <b>spiral</b> <b>casing,</b> viz. accelerated, decelerated and free vortex type, with different aspect ratios (ARs) are numerically simulated.

The results show that the average radial velocity along the exit of spiral casings is more for elliptical cross-sectional spiral casings of AR> 1 when compared to circular cross-sectional spiral casings. The total pressure loss is found to be at minimum for decelerated spiral casings.

40|$|Hydropower is a {{versatile}} renewable {{source of power}} generation able to change rapidly operating conditions. Hydropower plants may today work over a larger operating range than designed for due {{to the introduction of}} renewable sources of energy and the deregulation of the electricity market. Such operating conditions may involve large stresses and losses due to complex unsteady and transient flow phenomena, which have {{to be taken into account}} under design or refurbishment phase. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost-effectiveness comparing to model testing used since a century in the development of turbines. However, issues have still to be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines such as partly separated flow at curved surfaces, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry as well as numerical artefacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. The first part of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the three-dimensional flow of the axial Hölleforsen model <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> and distributor, where the influence of the penstock on the flow is analysed using different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions. Comparisons with experimental results indicate the importance of the penstock to perform accurate simulation in the present case.

The main task of the current research work is to simulate the flow through the penstock, <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> and distributor (guide vanes and stay vanes) of the Hölleforsen model, well known as the Turbine- 99 test case.

Flow in the penstock and spiral casings are very complex with several flow phenomena appearing simultaneously: such as separation, turbulence and unsteadiness. This is due to the viscosity, boundary conditions and complexity in the geometry. To gain some information on the flow characteristics, numerical simulation of the complex three-dimensional turbulent viscous flow through the penstock, <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> and distributor of the turbine is performed. Conservation mass and momentum equations of the flow are analysed using finite volume method with the software ANSYS CFX 10. 0. The objectives are to study the effects of the inlet boundary conditions and also to achieve the boundary conditions for subsequent simulations including the runner and ultimately the entire system. The flow in {{hydropower plant}} is turbulent and highly unsteady. Therefore analysing the effect of the upstream geometry and different turbulence model are of great interest to analyse how the boundary conditions affect the runner and draft tube flow.

The CFD codes ANSYS 13 and OpenFoam are applied. In this study impact of the blade geometry to compressor characteristic is investigated and possibilities of efficiency, pressure coefficient and working range increasing of centrifugal fan are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concentrated}} on mathematical modeling of high frequency pulsations in pump turbines, {{which are the}} source of high-cycle continuous stress of the <b>spiral</b> <b>casing</b> cover, wicket gates and runner. There are proposed the solutions using the transfer matrix for the tube with a constant and conical cross-section. The paper compares variations of cylindrical and conical tubes, changes in boundary conditions. There are the models of PSPP Dlouhé Stráně made only of cylindrical tubes comparing to the model with cylindrical and conical tube...|$|E
