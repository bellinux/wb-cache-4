50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on warehouse lending. Main risks of fraud include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false documents of title. The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to investors.|$|E

If the lack of regulation that is concerned with the transfer of non performing credits to the secondary market (the re-selling market) is able to create a decrease in the liquidity of the resale market and affects indirectly the supply and demand in the lending market, the legal rules that is concerned with the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> for the goal of securitization and the purchase of securities (as asset backed securities) are not always suitable to resolve the problem. Some of them mine the liquidity in secondary market and if this one becomes illiquid, we could have on the capital market: no incentive for lenders to extend credit; raising of the costs of loan and no good situation for high risk companies to get loans...|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in Mexico {{in order to determine}} the size, future growth and current status of the Mexican residential mortgage market, and to assess the potential for securitization. Securitization offers good prospects of liquifying the mortgage loans enabling these funds to be reinvested into the housing market. In the long run, securitization can also attract other sources of capital, both foreign and domestic, to the housing market. The key elements of structuring these securities lie in the underwriting standards and loan origination systems that are effectuated. Poor origination and collecting practices will hinder the success of securitization.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect <b>of</b> {{restrictive}} consumer <b>loan</b> rate ceilings on {{the provision of}} and charges assessed by commercial banks for consumer savings and demand deposit services. The study uses data that were collected in four distinct local markets that differed extremely {{with regard to the}} applicable rate ceilings. The 31 banks that provided information for the study represented 88. 6 percent of the banks serving consumers in the four market areas. Because consumers shop for consumer financial services in their relevant local market, an accurate evaluation of the effects of rate ceilings on terms for household demand and savings deposits can be obtained by holding other socio-economic conditions constant and analyzing differences across market areas. 'The results of the study indicate that in Arkansas, where rates on all types of consumer credit were restricted by the rate ceilings during the study period, the service and overdraft charges assessed on demand deposits were significantly higher than those in states with unrestrictive rate ceilings, holding other things constant. Furthermore, in contrast to the other markets, in Arkansas the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> services was tied more specifically to the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> other consumer services sold by the bank. However, the rates paid on savings deposits were not lower in the Arkansas market relative to those paid in the other markets analyzed...|$|R

40|$|While {{portfolio}} lenders often faced {{a decision}} to hold for investment or sell newly– originated commercial mortgages, conduit lenders originated loans exclusively for sale into securitization markets. In so doing, conduit lenders may have alleviated a “lemon’s problem ” in selection <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> for <b>sale</b> in secondary markets, resulting in reduced mortgage risk premia and improved pricing of conduit commercial mortgage loans. In this paper, we investigate the adverse selection hypothesis, via modeling and empirical evaluation of pricing of conduit- versus portfolio-backed commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and loans. We construct an information economics model of conduit lending. Theoretical results indicate that conduit lending helped to resolve asymmetric information problems so as to mitigate “lemon’s discounts ” in <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> portfolio <b>loans</b> in CMBS markets. Our empirical analyses of 141 CMBS deals and 16, 760 CMBS loans show that upon controlling for well-established determinants <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> pricing, conduit loans enjoyed a 30 bps pricing advantage over portfolio loans in the CMBS market. Empirical results are robust to alternative model specifications. Results suggest the importance of mitigation of lemon’s problems associated with <b>loan</b> <b>sales</b> to re-structuring <b>of</b> securitization markets. I...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide {{financial}} markets increasingly depend on structures that reduce risk by interposing intermediaries between investors {{and the companies}} obligated to pay them. This reduction of risk may be offset, however, by the risk that an intermediary will fail, and its creditors then will claim against assets held by the intermediary {{for the benefit of}} investors. If the intermediary holds assets solely in a custodial capacity, this risk traditionally is addressed by agency and trust law. What is novel, however, is that intermediaries in a wide rang of domestic and international dealings- including the trading of investment securities, the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> participants, and securitization transactions- now hold assets in which they, as well as investors, share beneficial rights. The sharing of these rights creates significant uncertainty as to whether the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s creditors can look to all those assets, or merely to the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s interest therein, for repayment. This 2 ̆ 2 intermediary risk 2 ̆ 2 not only affects individual investors and increases transaction costs but also can be systematic: the failure of an intermediary may trigger a chain reaction of failures of investing institutions that contract with the intermediary. Moreover, the problem of the intermediary risk raises innovative legal issues that blur the boundaries between commercial law and property. This Article analyzes how legal systems worldwide should respond to this risk. If concludes that a uniform rule is needed to regulate intermediary risk in cross-border commercial and financial transactions, and it examines how such a rule should be implemented in an international law context...|$|R
50|$|Glanvill {{described}} one action {{which had}} features of both debt and detinue. They were the same. In his time, {{the form of}} the writ was a demand for a sum of money which could be issued for various reasons. “Debt” or detinue could be demanded for return <b>of</b> the <b>loan</b> <b>of</b> money, the price <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> the <b>loan</b> <b>of</b> a chattel, letting to hire, or a deposit. The writ was available for a creditor against a surety on the default of the principal debtor. Glanvill speaks of debt and its writ as being a retrieval of “debt that is due”, or ‘’detinue’‘. Later, and by the time of Bracton, detinue had been more or less separated from primary actions in debt, Detinue had come to be restricted to actions against bailees. After Bracton, the special situation of ‘’de bonis asportatis’‘, the taking of chattels by a bailee or theft of these from a bailee gave rise to the special situation of trover. Trover became fully formed in the reign of Elizabeth I of England. By the end of Bracton’s life and into the reign of Edward I, debt was confined to contract law, while detinue was concerned with the developing issues of personal property.|$|R

40|$|Loan {{securitization}} {{has become}} a widely used method for consolidating collections <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> into financial instruments with sufficiently stable statistical properties {{that they can be}} freely traded. In recent years the concept has been generally extended, creating a class of asset backed securities, financial instruments which are created from a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> sources, including credit card, commercial real estate and even financial investment (hedge fund) lending. In this paper the money and <b>loan</b> supply implications <b>of</b> these instruments within a fractional reserve banking system are examined. It appears that the interaction of these instruments create an infinite loop within the monetary system, which removes the limit on loan creation that should be imposed by the bank’s reserve requirement. This has effectively disabled the ability of the central bank’s reserve requirements to limit the expansion of credit by commercial banks, leading directly to the current credit crisis. The evidence suggests that loan securitization and the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> commercial bank <b>loans</b> outside the regulated banking industry are incompatible with the stable operation of a fractional reserve banking system. 1 Prologue...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the source of health care funding for heads of households related to the management of severe malaria in children admitted to a Kinshasa reference hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1, 350 hospitalised children under the age of 15 years treated for severe malaria in Kinshasa reference hospitals from January to November 2011 and the heads of households of these children. Results: Only 46 % of heads of households reported having sufficient funds directly available in the household budget. The remaining 54 % had to call upon external sources <b>of</b> funding (<b>sale</b> <b>of</b> assets, <b>loans,</b> pawning goods). The use <b>of</b> a <b>loan</b> tended to increase significantly mainly for households with a low (adjusted odds ratio = 6. 2), and intermediate socioeconomic status (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 8) and for households working in the informal sector (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 5). Similarly, the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> assets was more frequently reported for households working in the informal sector (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 4)) and for female heads of households (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 9). Conclusion: The management of severe malaria is a burden on household income. The majority of heads of households concerned needs to use external funding sources. A State subsidy for this management would help to reduce the risk <b>of</b> debt and <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> assets, especially for the poorest households.
