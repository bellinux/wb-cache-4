5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with <b>social</b> <b>exclusion</b> and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E

They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.

There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not?

The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Originally based on a National Vocational Qualification, the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment.

In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

25|$|Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used {{to examine}} ways in which {{societies}} can remedy <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> These tactics affect youth because they deal with the labor market and thus young people just beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and welfare to those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> This method suggests punishment {{as a means of}} remedying <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the labor market as the enemy to <b>social</b> <b>exclusion</b> and therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force.|$|E

25|$|Youth {{exclusion}} {{is a form}} of <b>social</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{in which}} youth are at a social disadvantage in joining institutions and organizations in their societies. Troubled economies, lack of governmental programs, and barriers to education are examples of dysfunctions within social institutions that contribute to youth exclusion by making it more difficult for youth to transition into adulthood. European governments have recently recognized these shortcomings in societies organizational structures and have begun to re-examine policies regarding <b>social</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Many policies dealing with <b>social</b> <b>exclusion</b> are targeted at youth since this demographic of people face a transition into adulthood; defining career and lifestyle choices that will affect the future culture and structure of a society.|$|E

25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{and poor}} {{infrastructure}} forces {{the poor to}} adapt to conditions beyond his or her control. Poor families that cannot afford transportation, or those who simply lack any form of affordable public transportation, generally end up in squat settlements within walking distance or {{close enough to the}} place of their formal or informal employment. Ben Arimah cites this <b>social</b> <b>exclusion</b> and poor infrastructure as a cause for numerous slums in African cities. Poor quality, unpaved streets encourage slums; a 1% increase in paved all-season roads, claims Arimah, reduces slum incidence rate by about 0.35%. Affordable public transport and economic infrastructure empowers poor people to move and consider housing options other than their current slums.|$|E

25|$|After the Bar Kochba Revolt of 132-135 CE, the Romans {{engaged in}} mass executions, expulsions, and enslavement, {{destroying}} {{large numbers of}} Judean towns and forbidding Jews from settling in Jerusalem or its environs (Dio Cassius, Roman History 69.12-14); there was no further Jewish government or overarching legal system thereafter in Judaea; this effectively turned the expatriate Jews of the Diaspora into a permanently exiled people, deprived of their homeland.
