Cooperation, non-cooperation and predation are the main strategies of the two dominant players, namely OCP (Morocco) and Phosrock (USA) during the period 1960 - 2000. These strategies are analyzed by 'prisoner dilemma' and 'limit pricing' models. We consider a two-steps game within a duopoly according to Kreps-Scheinkman framework with Cournot and Bertrand duopoly hypothesis.

50|$|As generalists, black rats express great {{flexibility}} in their foraging behavior. They are predatory animals and adapt to different micro-habitats. They often meet and forage together {{in close proximity}} within and between sexes. Rats tend to forage after sunset. If the food cannot be eaten quickly, they will search {{for a place to}} carry and hoard to eat at a later time. Although black rats eat a broad range of foods, they are highly selective feeders; only a restricted number of the foods they eat are dominant foods. When black rat populations are presented with a wide diversity of foods, they eat only a small sample of each of the available foods. This allows them to monitor the quality of foods that are present year round, such as leaves, as well as seasonal foods, such as herbs and insects. This method of operating on a set of foraging standards ultimately determines the final composition of their meals. Also, by sampling the available food in an area, the rats maintain a dynamic food <b>supply,</b> <b>balance</b> their nutrient intake, and avoid intoxication by secondary compounds.|$|E

Annually, it imports larger quantities of vegetables than there are produced by agricultural holdings. The <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables {{is the basis of}} an analysis of vegetable consumption on the level of entire country and allows the comparison with other countries. Data have shown that the degree of self-sufficiency varies a lot between years due to weather conditions. Although the conditions for vegetable growing in Slovenia are favourable, domestic production is too low to meet the domestic consumption. Many investigations have also shown that Slovenian people consume too small amounts of vegetables. This statement is supported by the <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables. The human consumption per capita in Slovenia is gradually increasing, but it is still low in comparison with the EU countries...|$|E

We find that an EM increases agent participation and investment thereby increasing demand and supply. Because of tradeoffs between incentives for investment the EM chooses a profit allocation between agents resulting in limited agent participation. In addition, when price depends on demand and <b>supply</b> <b>balances,</b> price and volume in the market can increase simultaneously...|$|R

Competitive equilibria exist. Nevertheless, eventhough there is a well defined money market, competitive equilibrium allocations are indeterminate. On an event tree with N nodes, of which S terminal, there are N + S degrees of nominal and, possibly real, indeterminacy. Monetary policy removes some degrees of indeterminacy through a choice of instruments, set according to a state-contingent rule. Interest rates are suitable instruments for the control of expected inflation but not of the variability of inflation. Monetary policy is also effective due to redistributive effects and nomina...|$|R

Using a dynamic open economy aggregate supply - aggregate demand model with imperfect capital mobility and structural vector-autoregressions, the authors consider real oil price, <b>supply,</b> <b>balance</b> of payments, real demand, and monetary disturbances. Empirical results indicate that inflation is driven by monetary and real demand disturbances while output is mainly driven by aggregate supply disturbances. The historical decomposition shows that {{a substantial portion of}} inflation is aggregate demand-driven core inflation. A credible disinflation program accompanied by structural reform is likely to stabilize the economy with little output costs.

40|$|Using a state-of-the art {{computer}} model of global {{supply and demand}} for food and feed commodities, this book projects the likely changes in the fisheries sector {{over the next two}} decades. As prices for most food commodities fall, fish prices are expected to rise, reflecting demand for fish that outpaces the ability of the world to supply it. The model shows that developing countries will consume and produce a much greater share of the world's fish in the future, and trade in fisheries commodities will also increase. The authors show the causes and implications of these and other changes, and argue for specific actions and policies that can improve outcomes for the poor and for the environment. <b>Supply</b> <b>balance,</b> Trade, Aquaculture, Fishery management, Economic analysis, Environmental factors, Developing countries...|$|E

40|$|Fossil fuels still {{constitute}} {{an important source}} of energy in the world, but they need to comply with more strict environmental requirements. The coal industry, the basic primary energy supplier to the Polish economy, not only faces new environmental regulations but also restructuring and changes in the industry¿s organisational structure. The issues of primary importance are the medium and longterm prospects of achieving a suitable quantity and quality of coal supplied, as well as suitable costs. The structure of power generation needs to adjust to emissions limits with given fuel supplies. The paper discusses the construction of a coal <b>supply</b> <b>balancing</b> system which has been developed and applied as a decision support for rational planning of the development of the Polish coal industry. It consists of two linked groups of models: coal <b>supply</b> and coal <b>balancing.</b> Such a structure allows it to respond to the problems emerging for the most part from new environmental regulations, and to select policies that will lead to sustainability in the industry.

40|$|Analyses of {{national}} markets for organic agricultural products are {{constrained by the}} lack of official statistics on production, consumption or international trade in any European country. As a result there are several, often very contradictory and inconsistent estimations on the amount of the organic production or consumption in the EU or even in individual EU countries. The main sources for market data estima-tions are surveys with market actors and sometimes extrapolations of household or retailer panel studies. One possibility to reduce the problem of inconsistent market data for a geographical region is to use the method of <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheets (SBS). By using SBS which compare the resources and uses of a product, it is easier to detect inconsistencies between produc-tion, consumption or foreign trade data.
