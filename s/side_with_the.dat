5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood side by <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders {{a short time later}} during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E

5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E
5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable events during this period was the Treaty of St. Louis in which the Sac and Fox tribes ceded northeastern Missouri, {{northern}} Illinois and southern Wisconsin to the United States. Resentments over this treaty were to cause the tribes to <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British during the War of 1812 in raids along the Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and was to spur the Black Hawk War in 1832.|$|E

5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although {{it could have been}} used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose to <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jewish people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being {{a symbol of the}} recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E
50|$|In a three player game, the {{indifferent}} player {{may choose}} who he <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> in <b>the</b> {{case of a}} challenge. A player who correctly challenges another player wins the game. The loser of a game gains two points, The winner six, and the sider (if he <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> winner) gains four or two (if he <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loser). Equations games become more intricate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of factorials, vulgar fractions, and even logarithms, in the Senior division.|$|R

25|$|In the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), most Indian tribes owned black slaves, {{and they}} <b>sided</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy.

5|$|The {{first day}} of the attack was a success, but on the second day, the Germans were {{reinforced}} with heavier weapons and were able to blunt the attack, inflicting high casualties. The force was successful despite heavy casualties, and German forces were forced to retreat. On 1 August, the corps arrived in the Vesle area near the Marne River, where it assumed command of the 3rd Division, 28th Division, and 32nd Division from the French XXXVIII Corps, placing side-by <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. I Corps for a few days. Troops continued to advance until September when they withdrew to form the new First United States Army.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E
5|$|Threni {{has three}} movements, {{corresponding}} to the three chapters of the Lamentations of Jeremiah from which the texts used in the work are taken. The following is a summary.

5|$|After {{the bishops}} refused to pass judgment, the barons {{attempted}} to do so, but Becket refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission. Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to Becket and suggested a compromise, which Becket refused. Becket went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in Flanders on 2November 1164. Foliot was sent, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hilary of Chichester, Bartholomew Iscanus, the Bishop of Exeter, Roger of Worcester, the Bishop of Worcester, William d'Aubigny, the Earl of Arundel, {{and a group of}} royal clerks, to Thierry the Count of Flanders, Louis VII the King of France, and Pope Alexander III. Their mission was to prevent the archbishop from being given refuge, but despite their efforts Louis of France agreed to grant Becket refuge. Foliot's delegation met with more success at the papal court; although they did not succeed in securing a decision in the king's favour, neither did the pope <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> archbishop.|$|E

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} may occur during the campaign, for example {{as a consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the middle or upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations. While religion no longer plays a central role (as in Medieval II: Total War), it is still important in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in influencing diplomatic relations between nations.|$|E
