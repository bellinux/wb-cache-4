25|$|As {{libraries}} {{became more}} attuned {{to the needs of}} researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as OCLC and RLIN in the United States, in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a <b>shared</b> <b>database.</b> This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.|$|E

50|$|TAC is {{the main}} feature of Tibero for {{providing}} high scalability and availability. All instances executed in a TAC environment execute transactions using a <b>shared</b> <b>database.</b> Access to the <b>shared</b> <b>database</b> is mutually controlled for data consistency and conformity. Processing time can be reduced because a larger job {{can be divided into}} smaller jobs, and then the jobs can be performed by several nodes.Multiple systems share data files based on shared disks. Nodes act as if they use a single shared cache by sending and receiving the data blocks necessary to organize TAC through a high speed private network that connects the nodes.Even if a node stops while operating, other nodes will continue their services. This transition happens quickly and transparently.|$|E
50|$|Ideally {{the cluster}} of servers behind the load {{balancer}} should be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected.
