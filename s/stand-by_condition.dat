At pre-defined times, Sercos Energy components are brought into a standstill condition {{in order to}} save energy.

40|$|Some of the {{considerations}} {{involved in}} the design of aircraft fuel tanks for liquid hydrogen are discussed herein. Several of the physical properties of metals and thermal insulators in the temperature range from ambient to liquid-hydrogen temperatures are assembled. Calculations based on these properties indicate {{that it is possible to}} build a large-size liquid-hydrogen fuel tank which (1) will weigh less then 15 percent of the fuel weight, (2) will have a hydrogen vaporization rate less than 30 percent of the cruise fuel-flow rate, and (3) can be held in a <b>stand-by</b> <b>condition</b> and readied for flight in a short time...|$|E
40|$|The present {{purpose of}} this program is to produce high-purity uranium- 234 (99 %) and polonium- 209 for the {{scientific}} community, both Governmental and non-Governmental. In addition, facilities for separation and purification of protactinium- 231, thorium- 230, and thorium- 229 are maintained in <b>stand-by</b> <b>condition</b> for the resumption of these processes when conditions warrant. The uranium- 234 isotope is separated from aged plutonium- 238 material, purified, and converted to solid U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }. This oxide is subsequently shipped to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for distribution through their Isotope Sales Group. The principal use of uranium- 234, which is recovered from aged plutonium- 238, is in fission detectors used to monitor reactors. Approximately one-third of the total uranium in a fission detector is uranium- 234. The other two-thirds is uranium- 235. A typical detector might contain 15 mg total uranium. As the neutron flux in the reactor causes fission of the uranium- 235 in the detector, it also converts the uranium- 234 to uranium- 235...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} the first integrated active quenching circuit (I-AQC) that drives an avalanche photodiode (APD) above its breakdown voltage, {{in order to}} detect single photons. Based on the I-AQC, we developed a compact and versatile photon-counting module suitable for applications in which very weak optical signals have to be detected, as for instance, photon correlation spectroscopy, luminescence measurements, and laser ranging. The prototype photon-counting module features quenching pulses up to 60 V amplitude, minimum dead time of less than 36 ns, corre-sponding to a saturated counting rate exceeding 25 Mcounts/s, user-controllable hold-off time, for reducing the afterpulsing effect, and nanosecond gating capability. The power dissipation is 60 mW in <b>stand-by</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the module size is less than 1 cm 2 cm. Index Terms—Active-quenching circuit (AQC), application spe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This work aims {{to reduce}} the energy {{consumption}} and thus increase the availability of blast furnace compressors of a steelmaking company, located in Alto Paraopeba region in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, through the elimination of waste points in the compressed air distribution. In order to develop this work, an ultrasound test in the compressed air line was performed to identify and quantify leaks in the flow. Once the leaks were identified, they were eliminated through corrective maintenance and improvements, and then the energy consumption scenarios {{before and after the}} improvements were compared. As a result, the average monthly electricity consumption in the reporting period decreased by 57. 2 %. In addition, one compressor was set aside in <b>stand-by</b> <b>condition,</b> as in the original plant. Thus, one can prove the efficiency in eliminating of waste points in compressed air distribution, since the reduction of energy consumption is important for the company to remain competitive, as the cost of electric energy affects the final price of the final products...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{procedures}} used {{to investigate the}} persistence, location and abundance of scattered ("matrix cells") and/or clustered ("matrix areas") stem cells in the brain, responsible for proliferation in adult terrestrial heterothermic vertebrates have included an induced transient drop in body temperature in specimens subsequently deprived of encephalic areas. In a set of coordinated investigations focused {{on the influence of}} an exposure to a drastic thermally environment on these activities, we gave priority to Triturus carnifex, since there is a much larger amount of detailed, unequivocal experimental evidence available for this species than for other vertebrates of the same evolutionary level. In the present study, cold-shocked newts were examined after a stay at external temperature (the most suitable one based on previous experience) to allow the maximal expression of cerebral proliferation. In a qualitative evaluation, the brain of experimental specimens compared with that of normal individuals seemed not to show, contrary to expectations, more pronounced cell proliferation as assessed by Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen immunolabelling of neural-like cells in the S phase of cell cycle. This discrepancy with previous reports from other authors may depend on having used cold stress alone, while other traumatic stimuli (operatory shock, encephalic injury) administered by the previous authors might have induced a greater number of cells to move from a <b>stand-by</b> <b>condition</b> to proliferation, allowing for reparative and/or regenerative phenomena. © 2013 Firenze University Press...|$|E
