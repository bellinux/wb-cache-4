5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel girder bridge, the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to <b>scouring</b> of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, <b>scouring</b> was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. <b>Scouring</b> had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E

In this study, field experiments were performed at the Si-Lo Bridge in the lower Cho-Shui River, the longest river in Taiwan, to collect scour-depth data using a sliding magnetic collar, a steel rod, and a numbered-brick column. By separating each <b>scour</b> component, a methodology for simulating the temporal variations of the total <b>scour</b> depth under unsteady flow conditions is proposed. The proposed total-scour model integrates three <b>scour</b> components, namely general <b>scour,</b> contraction <b>scour,</b> and local <b>scour.</b> The collected field data, comprising both general <b>scour</b> and total <b>scour</b> depths, are used to validate the applicability of the proposed model.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of an expert}} system (CAESAR for Catalog and Expert Evaluation of <b>Scour</b> Risk and River Stability) for an initial evaluation of <b>scour</b> and stream stability was assessed. Three alternative <b>scour</b> indices are used to compare with the evaluation results of CAESAR. These <b>scour</b> indices include the Observed Streambed <b>Scour</b> index, the INDOT Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index, and the Simon Potential Streambed <b>Scour</b> Index. Ten bridges in Indiana are selected for evaluation in this study. The <b>scour</b> indices and the field inspection information required by CAESAR are retrieved from the USGS data base.

40|$|Abstract: The {{equilibrium}} <b>scour</b> geometry {{around a}} circular pier protruding vertically on a <b>scoured</b> channel bed was experimentally investigated. In order {{to conduct a}} comparative study, measurements within an equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole at a square pier, an equilateral triangular pier, and a at plate with sides, facing the approaching ow, equaling {{the width of the}} circular pier were taken. Flow in an equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole under a clear water regime was considered for 4 separate tests. Tests were carried out for approaching ow having undisturbed constant ow depth greater than the pier width with a depth-averaged approaching ow velocity of about 68. 2 % representing the critical velocity of the uniform sand bed. It was observed that all the equilibrium dimensionless <b>scour</b> parameters, namely <b>scour</b> depth, length, width, area, and volume, depend on the eective pier width equal to the diameter of the smallest circumscribing circle of the pier. When the eective pier diameter increases and approaching ow depth is constant, <b>scour</b> parameters increase. Based on the results, some empirical equations are proposed for the <b>scour</b> depth, <b>scour</b> length, <b>scour</b> width, <b>scour</b> area, and <b>scour</b> volume. These equations may be utilized to estimate <b>scour</b> geometry in future studies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experiment designed to assess the time-development of <b>scour</b> around an offshore wind turbine collared monopile over a number of tidal cycles. One collar shape and location was investigated. The <b>scour</b> developed more slowly and the <b>scour</b> depth was shallower than for the case of a smooth monopile throughout the majority of the first half-cycle. This difference reduced quite rapidly during the second half-cycle and the <b>scour</b> depth at the end of two tidal cycles was essentially the same as for the smooth monopile. The time development of the <b>scour</b> was compared with results from existing empirical models for the time-development of <b>scour</b> under unidirectional flow. As expected, these models give a much smoother evolution of <b>scour</b> and different <b>scour</b> rates than those measured. Time variation in <b>scour</b> depth was better reproduced with a simplified approach for prediction of the time-varying development of <b>scour.</b> This also highlighted a problem with estimation of the time scale {{for the development of the}} equilibrium <b>scour</b> depth.

5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more <b>scouring</b> with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E

The developed probabilistic procedures are consistent with LRFD approaches for bridge design used by structural and geotechnical engineers. As a necessary first step in developing the statistical parameters for risk and reliability analyses, the key bridge <b>scour</b> equations (HEC- 18 pier <b>scour,</b> Florida DOT pier <b>scour,</b> HEC- 18 contraction <b>scour,</b> and NCHRP 24 - 20 abutment <b>scour)</b> were tested against available laboratory and field data sets. The results which are summarized in this presentation include: · The pier <b>scour</b> equations (HEC- 18 and FDOT) are design equations which do not under predict observed <b>scour</b> very often. Consequently, the probabilistic reliability indexes for pier <b>scour</b> compare favorably with those used by structural and geotechnical engineers in LRFD applications for bridges. · In contrast with the pier <b>scour</b> equations, the HEC- 18 contraction <b>scour</b> equations are essentially predictive, given that they are derived from sediment transport principles and theory. Therefore, under predictions of observed <b>scour</b> are much more common, and the resulting reliability is very low compared to typical target values used in LRFD applications. · The NCHRP 24 - 20 equations for live-bed and clear-water abutment <b>scour</b> both use a calculation for contraction <b>scour</b> and then apply an amplification factor to account for the additional <b>scour</b> caused by local effects at the tip of the abutment. The <b>scour</b> predicted by this method is the total <b>scour</b> at the abutment. The reliability of the abutment <b>scour</b> equations was found to be intermediate between those of the pier <b>scour</b> and contraction <b>scour</b> equations.

It is shown that especially the OptiPile design tool, developed by HR Wallingford for assessing <b>scour</b> risk and <b>scour</b> protection stability, predicts the <b>scour</b> depth very well. Local <b>scour</b> is generally taken into account in the design of support structures for offshore wind turbine projects by assuming a design <b>scour</b> depth corresponding to the most likely extreme local <b>scour</b> depth both for fatigue and ultimate limit state design. Hence, the foundations for offshore wind farms in sandy areas are most often designed with a <b>scour</b> protection system. Nevertheless, cost comparison on recent projects seems to indicate that a design without <b>scour</b> protection can be feasible in some areas. In addition {{it can be argued that}} always designing for the extreme local <b>scour</b> depth, which will for most locations be experienced for a current only situation, is too conservative as imposed wave actions will tend to reduce the <b>scour</b> depth. In the paper this is demonstrated using the OptiPile design tool together with reported time scales for <b>scour</b> development and a suggestion for an alternative to the traditional design approach is presented for debate, as it is recognized that much more evi-dence supporting such a design approach will be needed.

The time scale of propeller <b>scour</b> is approximated by applying the Breusers' time-dependent <b>scour</b> equation.

In areas with sandy seabed conditions, erosion of sediment by the actions of wave and current can negatively influence foundation capacity. An accurate prediction model of <b>scour</b> around the piles is therefore required. Well-accepted <b>scour</b> prediction methods exist; both for the equilibrium <b>scour</b> depth and the time scale of <b>scour</b> [1] around single piles. These standard formulas have been combined with metocean data and a hindcasting model to calculate the expected <b>scour</b> depth around piles of wind turbine tripod foundations. Other causes of <b>scour,</b> such as pile-pile interaction, effect of proximity of structural members to the seabed, and seabed mobility were also assessed {{in order to determine the}} amount of global <b>scour</b> to be considered. The <b>scour</b> predictions were compared to measurements taken at an offshore wind turbine foundation at Park Alpha Ventus (PAV) in the German North Sea [2]. The data showed very good agreement with the measured <b>scour</b> around the piles. Both the equilibrium <b>scour</b> depth and time scale of <b>scour</b> were well predicted using the hindcasting model. The measured <b>scour</b> below the central column of the tripod structure exceeded expectations; this is believed to be due to a pumping effect during storm episodes. Finally, the effect of <b>scour</b> on the vertical effective stress around the tripod piles was assessed with a finite element model. Local <b>scour</b> had an important effect while <b>scour</b> below the centre of the structure had a much more limited effect. Considering the combined effects of multiple pile interaction, <b>scour</b> below the central column, and making an allowance for seabed mobility, an equivalent global <b>scour</b> depth for pile capacity calculations was established...|$|R
