40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{quantitative}} information on the operating life capabilities of wind turbine rotor blade concepts for root-end load transfer, a series of cantilever beam fatigue tests was conducted. Fatigue tests were conducted on a laminated wood blade with bonded steel studs, a low cost steel spar (utility pole) with a welded flange, a utility pole with additional root-end thickness provided by a swaged collar, fiberglass spars with both bonded and nonbonded fittings, and, finally, an aluminum blade with a bolted <b>steel</b> <b>fitting</b> (Lockheed Mod- 0 blade). Photographs, data, and conclusions {{for each of these}} tests are presented. In addition, the aluminum blade test results are compared to field failure information; these results provide evidence that the cantilever beam type of fatigue test is a satisfactory method for obtaining qualitative data on blade life expectancy and for identifying structurally underdesigned areas (hot spots) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{deals with}} a new design of a joint between a steel pipe and a PE-HD pipe, which is called a {{transition}} piece and is intended for transmission of liquid and gas media. As a pipe fitting it connects a PE-HD pipeline, which is usually laid underground, outside a building, and a steel pipeline, which is mounted in a building. Design/methodology/approach: Paper gives some theoretical considerations on welding steel with PE-HD and other joining processes suitable for dissimilar materials such as metals and plastics. A production technology, stress calculations for the joint and an analysis of testing of the transition piece are described. An experimental research of a new “joint” between steel and PE-HD pipes is given. Findings: The most important part in formation of a joint between steel and PE-HD pipes is played by an internal sleeve of high-alloy stainless steel, which expends the PE-HD pipe mounted {{in the interior of}} the expanded part of the steel pipe by elastic mechanical force. Theoretical stress calculations indicating the force required to tear the PE-HD pipe from the transition piece constitute an important part. An analysis of pressure and strength tests under different conditions, i. e. with different temperatures, moisture conditions, inner overpressures and underpressures, is given. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of application of this research work for study an other of the transition piece, which are consisted of an other dissimilar materials. Practical implications: Such joints, called transmission pieces, are possible applied to residential premises where the steel part makes the beginning of a <b>steel</b> <b>fitting</b> {{in the house and the}} PE-HD pipe the end of the outside pipeline network. Originality/value: The paper presents a completely new design of the transition piece, which does not consist of any screw elements or seals made of materials susceptible to quick aging...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Aims and objectives: The general aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the personal respiratory exposure and biological monitoring of manganese (Mn) present in welding fumes as well as its neurological influence on welders. The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the respiratory exposure of welders to Mn present in welding fumes; (ii) to assess the biological Mn load of welders via the use of nail clippings; (iii) to establish possible correlations between respiratory exposure to Mn and its presence in nail clippings, and (iv) to determine the possible difference in finger dexterity and coordination between Mn exposed welders and a control group. Methods: A gravimetrical method was used to determine the respiratory exposure of welders. A cassette containing a 0. 8 -μm, cellulose ester membrane filter, attached to the side of a welding helmet provided, was connected via a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>fitting</b> to the inside (respiratory zone) of the helmet. Chemical analysis (metal content) of the welding fumes was done according to the NIOSH 7300 method, using Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma, Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Nail clippings were collected at the beginning and end of the study to determine the Mn level in the nails in both welders as well as paired controls. The nails were deposited into small, plastic vials and also analysed according to the NIOSH 7300 method. A Perdue pegboard and mirror drawing test was also conducted to determine the influence of Mn exposure on finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination of welders. Results: Mn exposure in the welding fumes did not exceed the occupational exposure limit – recommended limit (OEL-RL) (1 mg/m 3) of the Regulations for Hazardous Chemical Substances (RHCS), although two of these exposures exceeded the action level (0. 5 mg/m 3). No statistical significant correlations were found between the Mn respiratory exposure and the Mn found in the nails of the welders. Mn in the nails of exposed welders was statistical significantly higher (p = 0. 003) than that of controls. The only statistical significant differences found in the motor function tests between the controls and welders were the test which was done by using their non-dominant hand in the beginning of the study (p = 0. 016) and when the non-dominant hand values were pooled (p = 0. 012). The usage of both hands simultaneously showed results that leaned toward statistical significant decrease of the welders compared to the control subjects (p = 0. 090). In all these cases the controls inserted more pins than the welders. Only one moderately positive correlation (r = 0. 612; p = 0. 02) was found between Mn in the welding fumes and the number of errors made in the mirror drawing coordination test done by the welders. Discussion and Conclusions: The Mn in the nails of the control group was significantly lower than the Mn in the nails of the welders. This indicates that Mn respiratory exposure may influence Mn body burden although no correlation between Mn in welding fumes and Mn in nails were found. Nail Mn may serve as a biomarker to determine Mn body burden. Only the use of the non-dominant hand of the control subjects compared to the welders showed a significant decrease in finger dexterity of the welders. The moderately positive association between the Mn in the welding fumes and the number of errors made in the mirror drawing coordination test done by the welders indicates that with an increase in Mn in welding fumes, a decrease in hand-eye coordination will occur. It can be concluded that welders’ finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination may be influenced by the exposure to Mn in the welding fumes. Master...|$|E

50|$|Some {{concern has}} been raised {{with regard to the}} use of {{aluminium}} alloys almost exclusively in the construction of Sea Fighter’s hull, as well as future vessels based on the design.

30|$|The {{adjustability}} {{of wooden}} pipelines {{to the local}} terrain is considered as advantageous; however, there are some limitations {{that need to be}} considered.

Second, wooden fittings, e.g., tee branches or reducers, are not feasible contrary to <b>fittings</b> made of <b>steel,</b> concrete, or polymer material. Nevertheless, through specific integration of <b>steel</b> <b>fittings,</b> close changes in direction, branching, joining, etc., can be implemented. Against this background, the connectivity of the wooden section with parts of different materials is of great interest.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have <b>steel</b> <b>fittings</b> swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|R
