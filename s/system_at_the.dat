5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle. Entering or leaving the <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jamaica or Howard Beach stations requires that a $5 fare be paid using a MetroCard. A $1 fee is charged for all new MetroCard purchases. Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during off-peak with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway <b>System.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E

Additionally, it was both the first hurricane (as opposed to a tropical storm), and the first major hurricane, named with a Greek letter.|$|E
5|$|Connections to San Francisco's local {{light rail}} system, the Muni Metro, are {{facilitated}} primarily through the twin-level Market Street subway.

Some Muni Metro lines connect with (or pass nearby) the BART <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Balboa Park and Glen Park stations.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction on the freeway. The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway <b>System</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of construction. On average, between 25,500 and 37,840vehicles use the highway daily.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{development}} and increased settlement led the Pennsylvania General Assembly to establish Cummings Township in 1832 from land taken from parts of Mifflin and Brown Townships. The new township {{was named for}} John Cummings, who was an associate judge in the local court <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Early industry in the township included lumber and quarries for flag and building stone. In 1839Clinton County was formed from {{the western part of}} Lycoming County, with much of the eastern border of the new county formed by the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1900 hurricane, Galveston {{adopted a}} {{commission}} government (in 1960 {{the city would}} switch to council-manager <b>system).</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice; though the council members were tolerant of small-scale activities which {{had always been a}} part of the city, they were more concerned about organized crime. As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable, the council became far more accepting of the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy. According to some reports this was because the Maceos bought the cooperation of the council members, taking advantage of easily corruptible structure of the commission.|$|E
5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW <b>system.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC <b>system.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, a new US223 bypass {{was built}} around Adrian, {{resulting}} in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{is home to}} {{the public}} Adlai E. Stevenson High School and to the schools that compose the {{elementary}} Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. It serves as the headquarters for corporations including the global outsourcing company Aon Hewitt, and was the base of operations for the Newman/Haas Racing team. The village of Lincolnshire hosts several annual festivals (including one mirroring the Taste of Chicago) in either commercial establishments such as City Park or the Village Green, or in one of its nine public parks. The village maintains a police department that closely collaborates with its local school districts. Lincolnshire manages a public works <b>system</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direct expense of the village; it retrieves all of its water from the city of Highland Park, which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan. The village has a council–manager government and is a home-rule municipality. The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth J. Brandt.|$|E
