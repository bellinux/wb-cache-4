40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} to quantify losses by Alpine vegetation in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, typical <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow were investigated {{in the growth}} period. The intercepting rainfall of <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow were studied by using water balance method and ANOVA statistical analysis method. The experimental results indicate that: under different coverage of <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow, rainfall interception in the growing period (June-September) both show an increasing trend. And, both the maximum rainfall interception and maximum interception rate emerge in September under different vegetation cover of <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow. However, With vegetation degeneration, interception quantity and interception rate of <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadows</b> and Alpine meadows both show decreasd trends. Interception amount and interception rate show decreased tend along with the degradation of <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow, which indicate that the degradation of meadow is unfavorable for <b>Swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> and Alpine meadow to prevent the rain landing the earth directly...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the photic zone of Oceans, {{the major source of}} organic matter in <b>swamps,</b> sea <b>grass</b> <b>meadows</b> and estuaries is detritus derived from vascular plants. The bulk of vascular plant detritus is composed of the structural polymers commonly referred to as lignocellulose. Usually less than 10 % of litter material produced in mangrove forests is consumed alive (Bosire et al. 2005), the remnants become part of the detritus food chain. Wilson (1985) found that 80 % of the decomposition from Spartina alterniflora is largely decomposed in situ, and after 1 [*]year only 10 to 40 % of the initial weight of plant litter still remains. Regardless of what initially thought both lignin and lignified plant tissues can also be degraded in the anaerobic sediments (Benner et al. 1984). The degradation of organic matter in mangrove sediments is mediated by both aerobic and anaerobic microbial processes using a variety of electron acceptors (Kristensen et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Using the eddy {{covariance}} method, from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, {{we conducted}} the observation {{and analysis of}} ecosystem CO 2 flux in 3 types of alpine meadow vegetation (Kobresia humilis, Potentilla fruticosa shrub and Kobresia tibetica <b>swamp</b> <b>meadows)</b> on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The {{results show that the}} Kobresia humilis meadow, the shrub <b>meadow</b> and the <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow's</b> highest CO 2 uptake rates are 16. 78, 10. 42 and 16. 57 pmol-m(- 2) -s(- 1) respectively, while their highest CO 2 release rates are 8. 22, 7. 73 and 18. 67 mu mol-m(- 2) -s(- 1) respectively. The Kobresia humilis meadow and shrub meadow's annual atmospheric uptakes are 282 g CO 2 /m(2) and 53 g CO 2 /m(2), respectively, while <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow's</b> annual atmospheric release is 478 g CO 2 /m(2). This proves that the Kobresia humilis meadow and the shrub meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have relatively low potential for CO 2 uptake and release compared to C 4 grasslands, a number of lowland grasslands, and forests. Moreover, <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> has relatively high release potential. This, in turn, reveals clear differences in carbon source/sink between different types of vegetation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau alpine meadow ecosystem. These differences are mainly brought by differences in the vegetations' photosynthetic capacity and soil respiration...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystems in alpine mountainous {{regions are}} {{vulnerable}} and easily disturbed by global environmental change. Alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow,</b> a unique grassland {{type in the}} eastern Tibetan Plateau that provides important ecosystem services to the upstream and downstream regions of international rivers of Asia {{and other parts of}} the world, is undergoing severe degradation, which can dramatically alter soil hydraulic properties and water cycling processes. However, the effects of alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> degradation on soil hydraulic properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, soil moisture content (SMC), field capacity (FC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K s) together with several basic soil properties under lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD) and severely degraded (SD) alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> were investigated; the variations in SMC, FC and K s with alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> degradation and their dominant influencing factors were analysed. The results showed that SMC and FC decreased consistently from LD to SD, while K s decreased from LD to MD and then increased from MD to SD, following the order of LD [*]>[*] SD [*]>[*] MD. Significant differences in soil hydraulic properties between degradation degrees were found in the upper soil layers (0 – 20  cm), indicating that the influences of degradation were most pronounced in the topsoils. FC was positively correlated with capillary porosity, water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon, and silt and clay content; K s was positively correlated with non-capillary porosity (NCP). Relative to other soil properties, soil porosity is the dominant factor influencing FC and K s. Capillary porosity explained 91. 1  % of total variance in FC, and NCP explained 97. 3  % of total variance in K s. The combined effect of disappearing root activities and increasing sand content was responsible for the inconsistent patterns of NCP and K s. Our findings suggest that alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> degradation would inevitably lead to reduced water holding capacity and rainfall infiltration. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effects of vegetation degradation. Further hydrological modelling studies in the Tibetan Plateau and similar regions are recommended to understand the effects of degraded alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadows</b> on soil hydraulic properties...|$|R

40|$|Alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> on the Tibetan Plateau {{is among}} the most {{sensitive}} areas to climate change. Accurate quantification of the GPP in alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> can benefit our understanding of the global carbon cycle. The 8 -day MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary production (GPP) products (GPP_MOD) provide a pathway to estimate GPP in this remote ecosystem. However, the accuracy of the GPP_MOD estimation in this representative alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> is still unknown. Here five years GPP_MOD was validated using GPP derived from the eddy covariance flux measurements (GPP_EC) from 2009 to 2013. Our results indicated that the GPP_EC was strongly underestimated by GPP_MOD with a daily mean less than 40 % of EC measurements. To reduce this error, the ground meteorological and vegetation leaf area index (LAI(G)) measurements were used to revise the key inputs, the maximum light use efficiency (epsilon(max)) and the fractional photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR(M)) in the MOD 17 algorithm. Using two approaches to determine the site-specific epsilon(max) value, we suggested that the suitable epsilon(max) was about 1. 61 g C MJ (1) for this alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow</b> which was considerably larger than the default 0. 68 g C MJ(- 1) for grassland. The FPAR(M) underestimated 22. 2 % of the actual FPAR (FPAR(G)) simulated from the LAI(G) during the whole study period. Model comparisons showed that the large inaccuracies of GPP_MOD were mainly caused by the underestimation of the epsilon(max) and followed by that of the undervalued FPAR. However, the DAO meteorology data in the MOD 17 algorithm did not exert a significant affection in the MODIS GPP underestimations. Therefore, site-specific optimized parameters inputs, especially the epsilon(max) and FPAR(G), are necessary to improve the performance of the MOD 17 algorithm in GPP estimation, in which the calibrated MOD 17 A 2 algorithm (GPP_MODR 3) could explain 91. 6 % of GPP_EC variance for the alpine <b>swamp</b> <b>meadow...</b>|$|R

Grapevine and clover showed the largest growth response and spore production. Mycorrhizal infection was lowest in <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Very poor correlations were observed, on an overall basis, between spore production and per cent root infection or infected root length.

Sporulation {{was positively correlated with}} growth enhancement by mycorrhizal plants, and growth increments per unit infected root followed the same trend as spore numbers per unit infected root, i. e. largest for grapevine and lowest for meadow-grass.
