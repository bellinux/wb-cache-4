The paper {{proposes a}} unitary {{approach}} of adaptive {{output feedback control}} for non-affine uncertain systems, about which the positive knowledge refers to the relative degree r. Given a reference model, {{the objective is to}} design a controller that forces the measured system output to track the reference model output with bounded error. The components of the so called pseudocontrol, thought on a superposition effects principle, are the following: 1) the output of reference model, 2) the output of a Kalman type stabilizing compensator of the pair of systems composed by a) an output dynamics of a set of integrators of order tantamount to the assumed known relative degree r of the controlled system and b) an internal model, of order r – 1, oriented to the tracking error decreasing in the presence of <b>step</b> <b>input</b> <b>signals,</b> and 3) the adaptive control designed to approximately cancel the error of approximate dynamic inversion by virtue of whom the real control is hereby determined from pseudocontrol.

The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. <b>Step</b> <b>input</b> <b>signal</b> was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented.
