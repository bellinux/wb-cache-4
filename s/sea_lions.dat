5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish {{territories and}} try to attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{are used}} in {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, males {{migrate to the}} northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near {{the breeding}} rookeries. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> can stay at sea {{for as long as}} two weeks at a time. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. Gulf of California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf year-round.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> have color vision, {{though it}} {{is limited to the}} blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an {{adaptation}} for living in marine coastal habitats. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{were used}} in the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (<b>sea</b> <b>lions),</b> MK6 (dolphins and <b>sea</b> <b>lions),</b> MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|Female California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of}} a 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> off California and more than 30 days for <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E

40|$|Background: Accurate formal taxonomic designations {{are thought}} to be of {{critical}} importance for the conservation of endangered taxa. The Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (GSL), being appreciated as a key element of the Galápagos marine ecosystem, has lately been listed as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN. To date there is, however, hardly any scientific evidence, whether it constitutes a separate entity from its abundant Californian neighbour (CSL). In this paper, we delineate the taxonomic relationships within the genus Zalophus being comprised of the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion,</b> the Californian <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and the already extinct Japanese <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (JSL). Results: Using a set of different phylogenetic reconstruction approaches, we find support for monophyly of all three taxa without evidence of reticulation events. Molecular clock estimates place time to common ancestry of the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and the Californian <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> at about 2. 3 ± 0. 5 mya. Genetic separation is further suggested by diagnostic SNPs in the mitochondrial and nuclear genome. Microsatellite markers confirm this trend, showing numerous private alleles at most of the 25 investigated loci. Microsatellite-based estimates of genetic differentiation between the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and the Californian <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> indicate significant genetic differentiation. Gene diversity is 14 % lower in the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> than in the Californian <b>sea</b> <b>lion,</b> but there is no evidence for recent bottleneck events in the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion.</b> Conclusion: Based on molecular evidence we build a case for classifying the Galápagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Zalophus wollebaeki), the Californian <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Zalophus californianus) and the Japanese <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Zalophus japonicus) as true species. As morphological characters do not necessarily fully reflect the rapid divergence on the molecular level, the study can be considered as a test case for deriving species status from molecular evidence. We further use the results to discuss the role of genetics in conservation policy for an organism that already is under the general protection of the habitat it lives in...|$|R

5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E

5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} {{the killing of the}} <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> {{pointing}} out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River.
