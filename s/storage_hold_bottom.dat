50|$|An en primeur wine {{gives the}} owner {{the right to}} receive the {{respective}} bottles of wines once the producer has completed the maturing phase of the wine.

For example, the 1982 vintage of Château Latour, was sold at £250 a case en primeur in 1983, while valued in 2007 at £9,000, although the major part of this price increase occurred after bottling.|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} order-quantity model {{considers the}} tradeoff between ordering cost and storage cost {{in choosing the}} quantity to use in replenishing item inventories. A larger order-quantity reduces ordering frequency, and, hence ordering cost/ month, but requires holding a larger average inventory, which increases <b>storage</b> (<b>holding)</b> cost/month. On the other hand, a smaller order-quantity reduces average inventory but requires more frequent ordering and higher ordering cost/month. The cost- minimizing order-quantity is called the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). This chapter builds intuition about the robustness of EOQ, which makes the model useful for management decision-making even if its inputs (parameters) are only known to be within a range of possible values. This chapter also provides intuition about choosing an inventory-management system, not just an EOQ...|$|R
