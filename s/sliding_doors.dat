5|$|The {{station is}} the subject of John Schlesinger's 1961 {{documentary}} film Terminus, while the 1970 British Transport film Rush Hour includes several scenes filmed in the station. The underground scenes in the 1998 romantic comedy <b>Sliding</b> <b>Doors</b> were partly shot at Waterloo tube station.|$|E
5|$|The board noted that: {{the test}} {{planners}} {{had failed to}} identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> and sharp turns.|$|E
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on each side.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{operator}} (or <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> opener or automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operator) is {{a device}} that operates a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access door was {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> when fuel was being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> from opening too far when the fuel filler door was open.|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R
5|$|In 1903 the District tested two seven-car trains with {{different}} control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access {{to the car}} was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand operated <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
5|$|The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car {{electric}} {{trains in}} 1903. A {{third of the}} vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with {{an equal number of}} motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on each side.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> gear. There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types {{do not have a}} perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used.|$|R

5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural {{styles are}} {{visible in the}} Estate. Originally constructed in the Federal style for Henry Bates Grubb between 1800 and 1805, Mount Hope Estate was the most formal ironmaster's mansion built in the area between 1750 and 1850. In 1895, Daisy Grubb oversaw significant changes, adding a Victorian ballroom, a billiard room, chandeliers, and parquet floors, and converting original hinged doors to <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> while still maintaining much of the original construction, including the original facade and fireplace mantels.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{along the length of the}} carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E

5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among {{the oldest of the}} Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into <b>sliding</b> <b>doors.</b> The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, <b>Sliding</b> <b>Doors</b> and Maybe Baby.|$|E

5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> at the ends, leading onto {{a platform for}} boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
5|$|The {{first order}} for {{electric}} multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being {{withdrawn from the}} Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 × 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on the busy circle and centre <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted from 1911.|$|E
