25|$|Widows and widowers {{observed}} {{three days}} of fasting and silence, wherein they did not bathe or comb their hair, and may even shave their hair and eyebrows as a <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> of grief. They abstained from eating cooked food until the mourning period ended. In {{the case of the}} death of a datu, his wives, or children: the community was placed under strict mourning requirement called the pumaraw where no one was to wear colored clothes, climb coconut trees, or fish in certain streams; and spears were to be carried point down and side arms blade up. A mournful silence was to be conserved, and families could be enslaved as punishment for breaking the mourning interdict.|$|E
60|$|From the {{earliest}} times the Cross {{has been the}} <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> of Christians. St. Paul tells us his great hope, his great business, what God had sent him into the world to do, was this--to make people know the love of Christ; to look at Christ's Cross, and take in its breadth and length and depth and height.|$|E
60|$|And {{therefore}} it is, {{that from the}} earliest times the cross has been the <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> of Christians. We keep it up still, when we make {{the sign of the}} cross on children's foreheads in baptism: but we have given up using {{the sign of the cross}} commonly, because it was perverted, in old times, into a superstitious charm. Men worshipped the cross like an idol, or bits of wood which they fancied were pieces of the actual cross, while they were forgetting what the cross meant. So the use of the cross fell into disrepute, and was put down in England.|$|E

6000|$|It was extraordinary, but {{the fact}} of her interest, by immensely surprising, by {{immediately}} agitating him, blinded him at first to her identity and, for the space of his long stare, diverted him from it; with which even then, when recognition did break, the sense of the shock, striking inward, simply consumed itself in gaping stillness. He sat there motionless and weak, fairly faint with surprise, and there was no instant, in all the succession of so many, at which Kate Cookham could have caught the <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> of his intelligence. Yet that she did catch something he saw--for he saw her steady herself, by her two supported hands, to meet it; while, after she had done so, a very wonderful thing happened, of which he could scarce, later on, have made a clear statement, though he was to think it over again and again. She moved toward him, she reached him, she stood there, she sat down near him, he merely passive and wonderstruck, unresentfully [...] "impressed," [...] gaping and taking it in--and all as with an open allowance on the part of each, so that they positively and quite intimately met in it, o the impertinence for their case, this case that brought them again, after horrible years, face to face, of the vanity, the profanity, the impossibility, of anything between them but silence.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was to go}} to Loughlinter {{with her}} brother and her brother's wife, leaving her father at Saulsby on the way. The Chilterns were to remain with her for one week, and no more. His {{presence}} was demanded in the Brake country, and it was with difficulty that he had been induced to give her so much of his time. But what was she to do when they should leave her? How could she live alone in that great house, thinking, as she ever must think, of all that had happened to her there? It seemed to her that everybody near to her was cruel in demanding from her such a sacrifice of her comfort. Her father had shuddered when she had proposed to him to accompany her to Loughlinter; but her father {{was one of those who}} insisted on the propriety of her going there. Then, in spite of that lesson which she had taught herself while sitting opposite to the glass, she allowed her fancy to revel in the idea of having him with her as she wandered over the braes. She saw him a day or two before her journey, when she told him her plans as she might tell them to any friend. Lady Chiltern and her father had been present, and there had been no <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> in her outward manner of the mingled tenderness and soreness of her heart within. No allusion had been made to any visit from him to the North. She would not have dared to suggest it in the presence of her brother, and was almost as much cowed by her brother's wife. But when she was alone, on the eve of her departure, she wrote to him as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|What queerer {{consequence}} of their not mixing than their talking--for {{it was what}} they had arrived at--almost intimately? She wished {{to get away from}} him, or indeed, much rather, away from herself so far as she was present to him. She saw already--wonderful creature, after all, herself too--that there would be a good deal more of him to come for her, and that the <b>special</b> <b>sign</b> of their intercourse would be to keep herself out of the question. Everything else might come in--only never that; and with such an arrangement they might even go far. This in fact might quite have begun, on the spot, with her returning again to the topic of the handsome girl. If she was to keep herself out she could naturally best do so by putting in somebody else. She accordingly put in Kate Croy, being ready to that extent--as she was not at all afraid for her--to sacrifice her if necessary. Lord Mark himself, for that matter, had made it easy by saying a little while before that no one among them did anything for nothing. [...] "What then"--she was aware of being abrupt--"does Miss Croy, if she's so interested, do it for? What has she to gain by her lovely welcome? Look at her now!" [...] Milly broke out with characteristic freedom of praise, though pulling herself up also with a compunctious [...] "Oh!" [...] as the direction thus given to their eyes happened to coincide with a turn of Kate's face to them. All she had meant to do was to insist that this face was fine; but what she had in fact done was to renew again her effect of showing herself to its possessor as conjoined with Lord Mark for some interested view of it. He had, however, promptly met her question.|$|E
