5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} <b>seek</b> <b>a</b> full term as governor in 1903.

Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
