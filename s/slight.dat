5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a <b>slight</b> forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a <b>slight</b> forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E

5|$|While <b>slight</b> {{variations}} on the standard genetic code had been predicted earlier, none was discovered until 1979, when researchers studying human mitochondrial genes determined that they used an alternative code. However, the mitochondria of many other eukaryotes, including most plants, use the standard code. Many <b>slight</b> variants have been discovered since, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E

5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this <b>slight</b> over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under <b>slight</b> tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

50|$|A <b>slighting</b> is the {{deliberate}} destruction, partial or complete, of a fortification without opposition. Sometimes, such {{as during the}} Wars of Scottish Independence and the English Civil War, the intention was to render the structure unusable as a fortress. In England, during the Middle Ages adulterine (unauthorised) castles if captured by the king would usually be <b>slighted.</b> During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Robert the Bruce adopted a strategy of <b>slighting</b> Scottish castles to prevent them being occupied by the invading English. A strategy of <b>slighting</b> castles in Palestine was also adopted by the Mamelukes in their wars with the Crusaders.|$|R
