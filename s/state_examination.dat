40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study were (1) to {{ascertain}} for Literature major, Mathematics-Physics major, and General Pedagogy major, the significance {{of the relationship between the}} school's performance in each required course and their overall performance in the State Examinations; (2) to investigate for each major the significance of the relationship between the school's performance in all the required courses and their overall performance in the State Examinitations; (3) to develop for each major, a prediction equation to be used to predict school's performance in the State Examinitations; and (4) to analyze the degree of concordance, across teh three majors, in the ways courses common to them correlated with the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations.</b> A total of 58 rural and urban schools from Shaba Province were used in this study. Twelve offered Literature major and presented 275 candidates, sixteen offered Mathematics-Physics major and had 300 candidates, and twenty-eight offeredd General-Pedagogy major with 935 candidates. All these schools participated in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations</b> in June 1976. A correlation matrix was developed for each major, using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (S. P. S. S). In this matrix each variable was compared singly with the other variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were completed for each major, in order to identify courses contributing significantly to the school's performance in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations.</b> The results of these analyses were used to develop, for each major, an equation to be used to predit school's performance in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations.</b> A multiple correlation coefficient was computed for each major, to test for the signigicance of the relationship between the school's performance in all the required coursed and their overall performance in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations.</b> A kendall's coefficient of concordance was computed and its significance tested. The following findings were established from the analyses: 1. In each major, certain required courses contributed significantly to school's performance in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations.</b> 2. The overall correlation in each major, between the school's performance in all the required courses and their performance in the <b>State</b> <b>Examinations</b> was significant. 3. A prediction equation was developed for each major. 4. The courses common to the three majors did not contribut to the school's performance, in the same way, across the three majors. Ngoba E.

25|$|Stoiber {{attended}} the Ignaz-Günther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, {{where he received}} his Abitur (high school diploma) in 1961, although he had to repeat one year for failing in Latin. His national service was with the Gebirgsdivision mountain infantry division in Mittenwald and Bad Reichenhall and was cut-short due to a knee injury. Following his military service, Stoiber studied political science and then, in the fall 1962 in Munich, law. In 1967, he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He was awarded a doctorate of jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second <b>state</b> <b>examination</b> with distinction.|$|E
25|$|Brosius studied {{chemistry}} and pharmacy at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and in 1974 graduated and completed the Staatsexamen (<b>state</b> <b>examination)</b> in Pharmacy. Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. work in bio{{chemistry and}} molecular {{biology at the}} Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin Dahlem in which Heinz-Günter Wittmann was department head. While determining the primary structures of several E. coli ribosomal proteins, he developed manual micro-methods for isolating peptides using two-dimensional separation on cellulose thin layer plates (instead of using a series of chromatography columns) followed by dansyl-Edman degradation. This reduced the required protein material by one to two orders of magnitude towards the 100 nMol range. This method was shortly thereafter superseded by automated protein sequencing operating in the low picoMol range.|$|E
25|$|Severance Union College {{struggled}} {{to meet these}} requirements; school regulations and coursework were altered, faculty evaluated and enlarged, its foundation and its board clarified. It received its recognition as a professional medical school on May 14, 1917. In 1922 the governor-general Makoto Saito issued Revised Ordinance on Chosun Education (개정조선교육령). It called for more strict qualification of the faculty, and Severance reacted obediently and further recruited more members with degrees from accredited institutions in North America and Europe. Japan did not completely ignore the competence of this institution; in 1923, Severance recovered its right to give medical licenses to its graduates without <b>state</b> <b>examination,</b> a right which had been lost since 1912. Moreover, in March 1934, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture further recognized Severance in allowing its graduates the right to practice medicine anywhere in Japanese sovereignty.|$|E
