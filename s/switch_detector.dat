40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{architecture}} of attention-based control for artificial agents. The agent {{is responsible for}} monitoring adaptively the user in order to detect context switches in his state. Assuming a successful detection appropriate action will be taken. Simulation results based on a simple scenario show that Attention is an appropriate mechanism for implementing context <b>switch</b> <b>detector</b> systems. ...|$|E
30|$|Based upon this, a {{generalised}} <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> is formulated, and {{a general}} expression for its probability of false alarm is derived, which can then be used to set threshold multipliers in practice. To illustrate this, a new <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> is examined, based upon a Lomax distribution, which has become of much interest to researchers at Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) as a potential alternative to the standard Pareto model.|$|R
30|$|A general {{formulation}} of a <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> was presented, {{and it was}} shown how the set S_ 0 could be selected so that it became equivalent to that used for the case of Exponentially distributed clutter. This meant that setting the threshold multiplier for a <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> {{could be done in}} a uniform way regardless of the underlying clutter model. Consequently, this generalised the Pareto case in Weinberg (2014 b).|$|R
30|$|The results {{shown in}} Figs. 4, 5 and 6 {{demonstrate}} that the <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> has a greater capacity to manage interfering targets than the non-switched detector on which it is based. It also has slightly better performance than an OS based detector. These results are common to the two polarisations. In terms of false alarm regulation, the <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> tends {{to reduce the number}} of false alarms, especially in the presence of interference, as Fig. 6 shows.|$|R
30|$|Recently, noise-activated {{switching}} {{has gained}} attention {{due to its}} role in qubit detection. Examples of <b>switching</b> <b>detectors</b> include the {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) [8 – 10], where switching occurs between the superconducting and dissipative state and is driven by quantum fluctuations, and the Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA) [11 – 14], which has been employed in the delicate task of detecting a qubit state in a minimally invasive fashion [15]. In this case, the <b>detector</b> can <b>switch</b> between different, weakly dissipative, dynamical states based on quantum activation [16] or dynamical tunneling [17]. Using an appropriate choice of a reference frame, switching between such dynamical states can also be described as escape from a static metastable well [16, 17]. <b>Switching</b> <b>detectors</b> are currently receiving renewed attention for their potential as microwave photon counters [18 – 20].|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how the {{application}} of a switching CFAR to Pareto clutter introduced in Weinberg (2014 b) can be used to formulate a general <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> for application to any clutter model of interest. The key feature of a <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> is that it pre-processes the clutter range profile to censor anomalous measurements of clutter. The approach in Weinberg (2014 b) shows that the statistical structure of this censored clutter range profile, for the Pareto case, is equivalent to that as formulated in Cao (2008), for the Exponentially distributed clutter case. It will be shown that this can be generalised further, so that the censored set can be specified so that the properties of it for the Pareto case can be applied to an arbitrary clutter model.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of interference, the {{detector}} (17) performs the best in maintaining the desired Pfa. The <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> only slightly improves on the performance on the detector (16). It {{is interesting to note}} that in the presence of interference, the resultant Pfa is smaller than the design Pfa. From a practical perspective, this is better than having an increase in the false alarm rate.|$|R
30|$|It is of {{interest}} to investigate whether the <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> (18) improves {{on the performance of}} (16) when subjected to interference. Additionally, it is {{of interest}} to assess the performance of (18) relative to (17), since OS-based CFARs are robust to interference (Gandhi and Kassam 1988). This is done by simulating clutter from the model (15), where μ is matched to estimates obtained from real radar clutter.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide insight}} into the qubit {{measurement}} process involving a <b>switching</b> type of <b>detector.</b> We study the switching-induced decoherence during escape events. We present a simple method to obtain analytical results for the qubit dephasing and bit-flip errors, which can be easily adapted to various systems. Within this frame we investigate potential of <b>switching</b> <b>detectors</b> for a fast but only weakly invasive type of detection. We show that the mechanism that leads to strong dephasing, and thus fast measurement, inverts potential bit flip errors due to an intrinsic approximate time reversal symmetry. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
30|$|Although {{this paper}} is focused on <b>switching</b> <b>detectors,</b> it is worth commenting {{on the fact that}} these are not the only {{solution}} to managing irregularities in clutter for CFAR processes. In particular, Smith and Varshney (1997) introduced a variability index (VI)-CFAR algorithm. This detector, designed to operate in independent Exponentially distributed clutter returns, has the CFAR property and is shown to manage interfering targets well. Additionally it is shown that it regulates the Pfa reasonably well. This detector partitions the clutter range profile into two sets, and runs a test to see whether there is variability in the two. It then tests to see whether the means of the two differ. Based upon these tests, and appropriate variation of the CA-CFAR is selected. An investigation revealed that when applied to the Pareto case, this detector becomes dependent on knowledge of the Pareto shape parameter, and hence is not a CFAR detector for the case of Pareto distributed clutter returns. Furthermore, even with the application of an maximum likelihood estimator for the Pareto shape parameter, the algorithm becomes computationally expensive to run in comparison to a <b>switching</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Switching</b> <b>detectors</b> {{were first}} {{examined}} in Cao (2008), which developed a switching CFAR {{based upon the}} cell-averaging (CA)-CFAR for target detection in Exponentially distributed clutter. It is shown in Cao (2008) that {{the performance of the}} CA-CFAR can be improved in the presence of interference through a switching process. This approach has thus generated much interest and stimulated ongoing research into the technique’s refinement and application to other clutter environments (Meng 2009; Erfanian and Vakili 2009; Tablet and Soltani 2009; Zhang et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|We {{discuss the}} noise {{occurring}} during a classical dissipative switching process {{as it would}} be detected by a quantum bit used as a detector for noise. In particular we study the switching-induced decoherence during escape events. We present a simple method to obtain analytical results for the qubit dephasing and bit-flip, which goes beyond the simple Born-Markov notion of the qubit as a spectrometer for noise but still allows us to correlate its behavior with the noise source. These results also provide insight into the qubit measurement process involving a <b>switching</b> type of <b>detector,</b> showing under which conditions <b>switching</b> <b>detectors</b> can be operated fast and with low error. In particular, the state in the end recovers from temporary bit flip errors due to an intrinsic approximate time reversal symmetry, whereas the switching process mostly produces low frequency pure dephasing noise.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, we {{have studied}} the {{interaction}} between a switching particle that {{could be part of}} a detector with a qubit. We have shown how the stochastic dynamics of the detector are correlated with the qubit. A <b>switching</b> <b>detector,</b> such as the one modeled here, presents several qualities which makes it desirable as a nonlinear qubit detector. The strong decoherence suffered by the qubit as the classical particle climbs up the potential barrier affects strongly the coherence, leading to a fast measurement. The equally strong bit flip errors acquired during the process are reversed by the quasi time-reversal symmetry of most trajectories.|$|R
30|$|The {{idea behind}} a <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> is to {{determine}} whether any of the statistics in the clutter range profile can be classified as being irregular. Such irregularities in measurements {{could be due to}} clutter power level increases or spurious interfering targets. These irregularities, once identified, are censored from the detection process. Suppose S_ 0 is a subset of the clutter range profile, consisting of clutter returns deemed not irregular. It will be shown how to select S_ 0 so that the statistical properties of it in the Pareto case can be applied to arbitrary clutter models.|$|R

50|$|A taut wire {{perimeter}} security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually {{mounted on a}} fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick {{that there is no}} need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of <b>switches</b> or <b>detectors</b> that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These <b>switches</b> or <b>detectors</b> can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.|$|R

Concurrently, the separation between the diverse functions, namely <b>switches,</b> <b>detectors</b> or emitters increases significantly the final number of components on chip. Such technical limitations may be overcome by introducing agile devices able, for example, to simultaneously detect, process and emit a coherent signal. Such a pathway has been explored with different approaches that bear advantages and drawbacks. Polaritons have often been proposed as promising candidates for multifunctional devices. Here we present an optical switch based on polariton lasing. An incident monochromatic signal is channeled into several polariton laser beams at different wavelengths by a novel relaxation mechanism which combines bistability, phonon interactions, long polariton lifetime and bosonic stimulation. We demonstrate spin logic operations conserving the original polarization state that is fully imprinted onto the coherently emitted signals...|$|R
30|$|The {{realization}} of Si photonics requires {{a series of}} components, including continuous-wave (CW) coherent light sources, modulators, amplifiers, <b>switches,</b> <b>detectors,</b> and couplers. Great efforts {{have been made to}} fabricate these various components, and successes have been achieved to some degree: Modulators based on the electro-absorption effect [1 – 4] have been demonstrated, Si-based avalanche photodetectors with a 340 -GHz gain bandwidth product have been realized [5], a nanophotonic switch has been made by IBM [6], and on-chip and off-chip couplers have also been demonstrated [7, 8]. Among these components, coherent light sources and amplifiers are the most challenging {{because of the lack of}} a Si-compatible high-gain material. Bulk Si is a very inefficient emitter because of its indirect bandgap. An alternative approach is to introduce rare-earth ions as impurities into Si [9]. Erbium-doped materials are widely studied as active media in planar Si-compatible optical amplifiers [10, 11] owing to the radiative emission of erbium at 1.54 μm, which is a strategic wavelength for telecommunications [12 – 14].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the design of electronic circuitry for accurately locking the average frequency of a klystron tube to the resonant frequency of a high-Q microwave cavity which contains air and an unknown amount of water vapor. The reflex klystron is frequency modulated with a 10 KHz sine wave which sweeps the klystron frequency over a narrow range {{in the vicinity of}} the cavity resonant frequency. Modulating signal and crystal detector signal are compared in a <b>switching</b> <b>detector</b> circuit which accumulates an error signal. Feedback transmission of the error signal to the repeller electrode of the klystron is accomplished by a phototransistor optical coupling. Integrated circuits are used for signal and error amplification. The results show that sensitivity of the control circuit is approximately 1. 11 MHz per dc volt of error signal. Frequency bandwidth in which the serve-loop circuit will lock onto the resonant frequency of the cavity is approximately 5 MHz at a center frequency of 11 GHz.
