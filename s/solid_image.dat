Polo Ralph Lauren, which was founded in 1967, began using a <b>solid</b> <b>image</b> of a horseman playing polo as their logo after the release of their men’s fragrance in 1978. A few years later, USPA released a men’s fragrance in a similar dark blue package with a <b>solid</b> <b>image</b> of two horsemen playing polo as their logo. The judge ruled that USPA would be allowed to use the logo as so long as they make changes to clearly distinguish it from Polo Ralph Lauren so it does not confuse consumers.

In order to respect the scheduled time and constraints, the project is characterized by: a) the use of different techniques for the optimization of equipment, human resources and working time; b) the systematic use of remote sensing techniques: total station, 3 D laser scanners, 3 D orthophoto, <b>solid</b> <b>image.</b> c) testing the functionality of a new software (beta release) for the vectorial transformation of the <b>solid</b> <b>image.</b> The survey operations have been characterized by the cooperation of researchers associated with two different disciplines: Topography and Representation. In fact, the complexity of the baroque architecture required a careful consideration of the decorative details to be represented. On the basis of this experience, it is possible to come to the following considerations: - especially in presence of external constraints, typical of real cases, the time required to human engagement for the integration of different procedures outclasses the time of automated acquisition and processing; - the vectorial transformation of solid images is effective for continuous surfaces, while it is difficult to apply to discontinuous surfaces.

40|$|A digital photo image can be considered, {{with a good}} approximation, as {{a central}} {{perspective}} of the acquired object. If {{the internal and external}} orientation parameters of the camera are known, it is possible to establish the direction in the space of each point of the object which is represented by a pixel in the image. Using a dense digital surface model (DDSM) of the acquired object each pixel (and therefore each direction in the space) can be associated to the value of distance between the centre of perspective and the point of the object that is represented by the pixel itself. In this way each pixel can be made to the 3 D position of the corresponding point of the object in an absolute reference system. The DDSM can be derived from an existing map or by using surveying instruments and procedures. A series of new instruments, based on laser technology, have recently been introduced onto the market. These instruments offer the possibility of obtaining a DDSM in a quick and cheap way. The integration of the DDSM geometric data with the image radiometric data allows a new concept of the <b>Solid</b> <b>Image</b> to be obtained. Solid images can be used in architectural, archaeological and land surveying applications to determine, in real time, the position of any point in a 3 D reference system, using a common PC or to carry out correct three-dimensional measurements (lines, areas, volumes, angles, …), by just selecting some points on the image. In addition, with the <b>Solid</b> <b>Image</b> even unskilled users can easily plot profiles, sections and plans using simple drawing functions, generate stereo models and realistic 3 D models.

40|$|The 3 D data {{recording}} for 3 D GIS {{is one of}} the main aims of scientific researchers and those who manage the environment and territory. Terrestrial LiDAR and photogrammetric techniques are effective methods of acquiring environmental data and of integrating their in digital products (i. e. solid images and solid true orthophotos). These techniques have shown remarkable effectiveness in many case studies or when the area of interest is limited. This integration is powerful, but it is not available for large area because a lot of time for the acquisition is required. A possible solution is to use a mobile system where LiDAR, GPS and camera sensors are contained. Different commercial solutions are available, but the cost (> 300 k€), the requirement of high skill and the low flexibility of the system reduce the number of potential application fields. The Geomatic group of the Politecnico di Torino has realized a mobile metallic platform that can be installed on any vehicle, where several sensors could be installed (i. e. GPS antenna, webcams, IMU, etc.). In this paper, the authors explain their attempts to use a mobile vehicle that was instrumented only with low cost sensors (i. e. LiDAR, GPS receivers and webcams) in order to have extensive use the LiDAR-photogrammetric integrated techniques for 3 D {{data recording}}. This kind of system requires dedicated procedures, in particular devoted to calibrating the system (absolute reference system), to elaborate the raw data with dedicated algorithms.
