Those equations were written taking into account higher harmonics of the Earth gravitational potential and the atmospher drag. The investigation was carried out using the atmosphere density model of GOST 25645. 115 - 84. Time intervals up to 10 days in March – April 1999 were considered when the station made uncontroled flight in the gravitational orientation mode. Its ballistic factor was practically constant that time, and the station did not undergo the action of any control force and torque. Taking into account of actual variations of the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> allowed to increase essentially theaccuracy of approximation of values of the phase vector on time intervals more than 5 days. At approximation of these values on time intervals less than 3 days, the prize in accuracy was absent practically. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E

Analysis of Nimbus 4 reprocessed BUV data was extended to cover the period from April 1970 through December 1975. Temporal and latitudinal variation of biases and yearly change in global biases between the satellite and ground based ozone measurements are indicated. The bias-corrected 6 -month-running filtered global means are shown, and the correlation coefficient between ozone and the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> remains high at 0. 94.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{magnitude}} of the Sq variation has good correlation with solar activity indices such as sunspot numbers and the solar F 10.7 index [e.g., Sellek [1980]; Schlapp et al. [1990]; Macmillan and Droujinina [2007]; Torta et al. [2009]; Elias et al. [2010]; Takeda [2013]. Sellek ([1980]) showed that the annual mean Sq amplitude obtained at San Juan at a low latitude is linearly proportional to the annual mean sunspot numbers using observation data during 1929 to 1965. Schlapp et al. ([1990]) also reported on the linear relationship between the sunspot numbers and Sq amplitude, but they pointed out that the position of the linear regression line is different for each solar cycle. Moreover, their analysis results [Schlapp et al. [1990] shown in the figure (Figure  3) suggest that the maximum value of the Sq amplitude tends not to become very large for an increase in sunspot numbers from 100 to 150. The present statistical analysis results suggest that the relationship between the solar F 10.7 index and Sq amplitude is approximately linear, but the response of the Sq amplitude obtained at 37 of 69 geomagnetic stations is nonlinear to the solar F 10.7 index as shown in Figures  1 and 5. The rate of increase in the Sq amplitude decreases as the solar F 10.7 index becomes high. On the basis of the present analysis results, the assumption of a linear relationship between the Sq amplitude and <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> used in the correlation analyses of previous works may not always be correct. Therefore, when we perform the correlation analysis between the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> and the Sq amplitude in order to remove the effects of solar activity, we should consider this nonlinearity for the long-term analysis of the Sq variation at each geomagnetic station.|$|E

30|$|Recently, Mielich and Bremer (2013) {{analyzed}} {{more than}} 100 stations {{in order to}} detect the best index to filter solar activity from foF 2 and hmF 2. They conclude that F 10.7 is a better index for {{the description of the}} solar activity than Rz. Damboldt and Suessmann (2012) filtered the solar cycle influence using a Comité Consultatif International des Radiocommunications (CCIR) ionospheric prediction model, which uses Rz as a solar EUV proxy. They obtained a trend reversal in hmF 2 in 1963 to 1964 with negative trends from 1942 to 1963 and positive trends from 1964 to 2005, which is in contrast to the results reported in most other publications of ionospheric long-term trends. A plausible cause of this would be that CCIR uses Rz as <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index.</b>|$|E

Both models use a <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> as a proxy for the solar EUV radiation. In the case of SUPIM, the solar EUV fluxes are computed from the EUV 94 solar EUV flux model which uses daily values of Lyman-alpha, He I, and F 10.7.

Investigating the relative sunspot numbers over the past 150 years, solar cycles of more prolonged minima are observed. Since 1920 solar activity is quite high ('modern maximum') and cycle 23 might be the herald of the end of this phase. Comment: submitted to ASP Conference Serie...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{different}} solar activity indices like sunspot numbers, sunspot areas, flare index, magnetic fields, etc., {{allows us to}} investigate the time evolution of some specific features of the solar activity and the underlying dynamo mechanism.

30|$|An initial {{approach}} to the IRI assimilation task could be for GIRO to determine an “effective” <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>index</b> (R 12) value {{as a function of}} time to be used instead of the predicted R 12 value for the month of interest. The index R 12 is the only independent parameter in IRI and can be manipulated to minimize the cumulative discrepancy between the model and available observations similar to the methods reported by Hernandez et al. (2002) and Zolesi et al. (2004). Such single parameter approach will likely not be fully satisfactory for global coverage of the model. It will be better to expand the assimilation algorithm by evaluating and minimizing varying global differences between model and observations, rather than assuming a constant bias. Using the capability of the GIRO to store sensor measurements in the database, the assimilation algorithm would analyze the latest 24 -hour history of differences between the IRI prediction and the ionogram-derived characteristics to mitigate those differences. The Galileo correction model is based on similar techniques (e.g., Rogers et al., 2005).|$|E
