Die Arbeit ist in zwei Kapitel unterteilt, welche unabhängigen Publikationen entsprechen (der Status der Publikationen ist am Ende der Arbeit angeführt). Beide Kapitel beschäftigen sich mit folgender Fragestellung: Wie viel genetische Varianz, lokale Adaptation und Differenzierung lässt sich durch die Interaktion der evolutionären Kräfte Migration, Selektion und Rekombination erhalten? Um auf diese Frage einzugehen wird die Evolution eines phänotypischen Merkmals (welches durch zwei Loci bestimmt ist) unter räumlich variierender Selektion in einer strukturierten Population untersucht. Im ersten Kapitel wird ein Modell mit zwei Inseln behandelt. Der Einfluss genetischer Architektur auf den Erhalt genetischer Varianz, lokaler Adaptation und Differenzierung wird analysiert. Ein Hauptziel ist die Berechnung der kritischen Migrationsrate, unter welcher alle Genotypen koexistieren können. Im zweiten Kapitel wird die Interaktion von Selektion und Migration zwischen mehreren Inseln untersucht. Verschiedene Migrationsstrukturen und Selektionsszenarien werden ver- glichen, und zwar in Bezug auf ihr Potential ein Merkmalsgefälle (cline) zu erhalten. Des Weiteren wird der Einfluss der Migrationsverteilung und räumlich variierender Selektion auf die Form des Merkmalsgefälles im phänotypischen Mittelwert, der genetischen Varianz und ”Linkage Disequilibrium“ ermittelt. In this thesis, I present my {{research}} in the area of theoretical population genetics that I have carried out during my doctoral studies at the University of Vienna. The thesis is <b>structured</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>chapters,</b> and each corresponds to one publication. Both chapters are connected by the overarching question of {{my research}}, i. e., what is the potential of migration-selection balance to maintain quantitative genetic variation, local adaptation, and differentiation? To address this question, the evolution of a phenotypic trait (determined by two loci) that is under spatially varying selection in a subdivided population is investigated. In the first chapter, 'A two-locus model of spatially varying stabilizing or directional selection on a quantitative trait', the influence of the genetic architecture (locus effects and linkage) on the maintenance of genetic variation, local adaptation, and differentiation is studied by employing a two-deme model. Special focus is put on the determination of critical migration rates below which variability can be maintained. In the second chapter, 'Clines in quantitative traits: The role of migration patterns and selection scenarios`, the interaction of selection and migration between multiple demes is explored. Different spatial structures and selection scenarios are compared in their capability to maintain clines. The influence of isolation by distance and spatial heterogeneity in selection on the shape of clines in the phenotypic mean, the genetic variance, and linkage disequilibrium is elaborated...|$|E

Franchising has known dynamic growth both in the world and the Czech Republic. This bachelor's thesis is <b>structured</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main <b>chapters,</b> the first of which provides a comprehensive outline of the major advantages and disadvantages in operating business under franchise, along with key principles behind franchising.

40|$|Unequal social {{relations}} and domination by individuals and groupings {{in a society}} can be created and maintained by violence. But this generally is inadequate for the legitimation of that situation or for the acquiescence of those less privileged; {{the maintenance of the}} inequality is affected by language, by devaluing the subjugated's language and by using language to create the impression of the legitimacy of the unequal relations. This study aims to explore some aspects of how language and specifically speech acts are structured to create unequal {{social relations}} and link this to discourse practices that maintain this inequality. Language is, however, not an inflexible medium; as {{it can be used to}} shape the subjugated's consciousness to regard the inequality as normal, it can also form and reflect a resistance consciousness. Language and power mesh in many ways. Chapter one will deal generally with issues of language and power relations in society. This dissertation hopes to focus on how ideology and power are present in and <b>structured</b> <b>into</b> utterances. <b>Chapter</b> <b>two</b> will show that the speech act theory can be extended to include ideological force or intent as part of a speech act. This intent is structured in the details of the utterance; and that will be the area of chapter three, which reviews the "critical linguistics" thinking around discourse analysis of manipulative intent; and the last chapter will focus on how language can be a means of resisting social domination and creating true consensus...|$|R
