5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> that is {{structurally}} homologous {{to other}} tetrapods, though {{with a number}} of variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
25|$|The balance {{system works}} with the visual and <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems</b> (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to {{maintain}} orientation or balance. For example, visual signals are sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings. These signals are processed by the brain, and compared to information from the vestibular, visual and the <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

25|$|Projectional radiographs {{are useful}} in the {{detection}} of pathology of the <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> {{as well as for}} detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely radiopaque) or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle.|$|E
25|$|Its first {{depiction}} in artwork was on lacquer-ware boxes {{from the}} ancient State of Chu. This type of harness put pressure upon the sternum, where the line of traction is directly linked with the <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> of the horse, allowing for nearly full exertion. It was in universal use {{by the time of}} the Chinese Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), depicted in artwork of hundreds of different carvings, stone reliefs, and stamped bricks showing it featured on horses pulling chariots. This type of breast-strap harness became known in Central Asia and elsewhere with the Avars, Magyars, Bohemians, Poles, and Russians during the 7th to 10th centuries. After Central Asia, the first breast-strap harness was spread to Europe by the 8th century (in depicted artwork), and became more widespread by the following 9th century (for example, depicted in a tapestry of the Oseberg ship burial).|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{entities}} {{may contain}} and {{be controlled by}} assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form {{is based on the}} creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> set up).|$|E

50|$|Sense {{of balance}} or equilibrioception {{is one of}} the {{physiological}} senses related to balance. It helps prevent humans and animals from falling over when standing or moving. Balance {{is the result of a}} number of body systems working together: the eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space (proprioception) ideally need to be intact. The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The balance system works with the visual and <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems</b> (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. Visual signals sent to the brain about the body's position in relation to its surroundings are processed by the brain and compared to information from the vestibular, visual and <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Bird anatomy, or the {{physiological}} structure of birds' bodies, shows many unique adaptations, mostly aiding flight. [...] Birds have a light <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> and light but powerful musculature which, along with circulatory and respiratory systems capable {{of very high}} metabolic rates and oxygen supply, permit the bird to fly. The development of a beak has led to evolution of a specially adapted digestive system. These anatomical specializations have earned birds their own class in the vertebrate phylum.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{egg laying}} breeds often suffer from {{osteoporosis}} {{which results in}} the chicken's <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> being weakened. During egg production, large amounts of calcium are transferred from bones to create egg-shell. Although dietary calcium levels are adequate, absorption of dietary calcium is not always sufficient, given the intensity of production, to fully replenish bone calcium. [...] This can lead to increases in bone breakages, particularly when the hens are being removed from cages {{at the end of}} laying.|$|E

The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the <b>skeletal</b> <b>system</b> is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement.|$|E

40|$|Skeletal tissues {{represent}} a key novelty of vertebrates, moreover, structural diversification and phenotypic adaptation of cartilaginous, bony and dental elements determine life strategies of each vertebrate lineage. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) constitute {{the most diverse}} vertebrate group with striking diversity in skeletogenesis and <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems.</b> In this thesis, comparative developmental analyses of craniofacial skeletal tissues and structures in bichirs (Polypteriformes) and sturgeons (Acipenseriformes), was analysed. These basal lineages differ essentially in their strategy of skeletogenesis. Bichirs represent heavily armoured forms with massive exoskeleton, they also comprise thick ganoid scales and dental structures that cover the whole oropharynx. Sturgeons, on the contrary, are primarily cartilaginous fishes with rather reduced skeleton and with teeth that are completely lost during larval development. Skeletogenesis was studied on a unique series of embryonic and larval stages of the Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus) and the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) by whole-mount staining of their cartilage and mineralized tissues followed by fluorescent microscopy visualisation. Growth dynamics of their <b>skeletal</b> <b>systems</b> was described and compared; expansion of their bony surfaces during ontogeny [...] ...|$|R
