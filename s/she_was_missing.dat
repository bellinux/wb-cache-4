5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier Dawson {{said that}} the {{military}} would probably never {{know what had happened}} to Sarbi while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing,</b> but said that her good health indicated somebody had been looking after her. A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador explosive detection dog stated that it was probably due to the breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> would never be known, suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL).|$|E
25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no-one else in Australia who would know <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Nina {{returned}} to win Jack back, after becoming an actress in the Indian film industry and realising {{that she was}} alone. Goodrem told TV Week, [...] "she's been doing wonderful things in Bollywood and has been with her dad. But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> the love of life back in Australia, so she came back." [...] Nina's arrival coincided with Jack's decision to get his life back together following a car crash due to his partying. Jack was [...] "shocked" [...] and [...] "overwhelmed" [...] to see Nina. Goodrem explained that Nina reminded him of what he once had and that he still had feelings for her. She said that she believed Jack and Nina were soul mates and added: [...] "They {{have had a very}} rocky relationship, but I think they're even now." [...] As Jack and Nina talked things through, they [...] "fall back into each other's arms". Jack chose to leave Erinsborough to be with Nina.|$|E
500|$|The reappearance of storylines left {{dangling}} {{at the end}} of {{the first}} season was noted with approval by Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News and VanDerWerff, who both mentioned not only the big one about Quinn and Puck and baby Beth but also Artie's love of directing, and variously added Rachel and Shelby, and movement on the Will and Emma relationship. The fact that Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley, however, was greeted with derision by both reviewers—Urban called it [...] "mind-bogglingly idiotic"—and others as well. Reiter found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, this is about as realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University." [...] Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of [...] "Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> her daughter grow up" [...] to take a part-time job in Lima as [...] "ridiculous", and the whole scenario as [...] "more than a little bizarre".|$|E

[...] Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, [...] "I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." [...] She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred. During redirect examination, Baez asked Holloway if George Anthony had told her that Caylee was dead while stating publicly that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing,</b> to which she replied yes.|$|E

2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E
