5|$|Tibbets {{flew the}} lead bomber Butcher <b>Shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first American {{daylight}} heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a marshalling yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew {{with him in}} Enola Gay. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.|$|E

25|$|The IWW {{also built}} on its {{existing}} presence in Ann Arbor, which had existed since student organizing {{began at the}} University of Michigan, to launch an organizing campaign at the University Cellar, a college bookstore. The union won National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification there in 1979 following a strike, and the store would become a strong job <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> union until it was closed in 1986. The union launched a similar campaign at another local bookstore, Charing Cross Books, {{but was unable to}} maintain its foothold there despite reaching a settlement with management.|$|E
25|$|While the XC-123A {{proved too}} {{uneconomical}} for production, the XC-123 had greatly impressed the Air Force, which issued {{an order for}} five pre-production aircraft, designated C-123B. The prospect of large follow-up orders, however, raised an issue of capacity, as Chase's factory lacked sufficient space to construct large numbers of aircraft. Therefore, in 1951, 49 percent of Chase was purchased by Kaiser-Frazer, who received a contract for 300 C-123B aircraft to be constructed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Chase became an engineering <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company, with Stroukoff remaining with the facility as its chief engineer.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1976, the ALRB {{ran out of}} its budgeted {{money for}} the year, {{as a result of}} a massive amount of work in setting up farmworker elections. The California {{legislature}} refused to allocate more money, so the ALRB closed <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> year. In response, Chavez gathered signatures in order to place Proposition 14 on the ballot, which would guarantee the right of union organizers to visit and recruit farmworkers, even if it meant trespassing on private property controlled by farm owners. The proposition went before California voters in November 1976, but was defeated by a 2–1 margin.|$|E

25|$|When the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad {{took over}} the {{facilities}} of the Rochester and State Line Railroad, it acquired {{little in the way}} of usable maintenance assets. To remedy this deficiency, the R bought land in the Lincoln Park section of Rochester and, in 1881, built a machine shop for repair work. In 1882, they erected a roundhouse, today at the corner of West Avenue and Buffalo Road. (The turntable has been preserved by the Rochester chapter of the National Railway Historical Society, while the building itself has been converted for use by a scrap company.) This facility, with its fourteen-stall enginehouse, was the central <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire line. The other end of the line (at the time) was in Salamanca, where the company built a smaller facility, including a two-stall enginehouse, a turntable, and the Ramsey Transfer mechanism needed for interchange with the Erie. Additional facilities were installed at Perry and Gainesville in the 1880s, along with more at Ashford Junction and Clarion Junction.|$|E
500|$|Frederick Treves {{first met}} Merrick that November {{at a private}} viewing, before Norman opened the <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day. Treves later {{recalled}} in his 1923 Reminiscences that Merrick was [...] "the most disgusting specimen of humanity that I had ever seen ... at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version {{of a human being}} as this lone figure displayed." [...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed. To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that covered his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.|$|E

He started building a new carriage, this time with a heavier steel harness. He described the appearance of the vehicle as a [...] "small truck". The wheel axles were also made of steel and the entire front axle was constructed to swivel. A central column was built of steel and laid across the axles {{in such a way as}} to allow it move in all directions within a small radius to accommodate any sudden movements by the motor or vehicle.|$|E

500|$|In a {{deposition}} of 1598, Barley refers to his age as [...] "xxxiii yeeres or thereabowt", placing his {{date of birth}} around 1565. Evidence suggests that Barley may have been born in Warwickshire. Little else is known about his early life. Barley was in London by 1587, having completed an apprenticeship with the Drapers' Company in that year. He trained as a bookseller under Yarath James, a small-time publisher. James operated out of a shop in Newgate Market, near Christ Church Gate, in the 1580s. His interest in ballads was shared by Barley, who published {{a number of them}} during his lifetime. By 1592, Barley had opened his own shop in the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill, whose register recorded his marriage to a Mary Harper on 15 June 1603 and christenings and burials of people associated with his family. He conducted business out of this <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next twenty years.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it around his neck, and rubbed it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E
