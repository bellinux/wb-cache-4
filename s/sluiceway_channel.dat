40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} research hydraulic processes at the intake structures of diversion {{power plants in}} winter. On {{the basis of the}} physical modeling results the flow characteristics of <b>sluiceway</b> <b>channel</b> of water intake on the river Issyk-Ata, Kyrgyzstan were determined. Statistical models of discharges of elements of <b>sluiceway</b> <b>channel</b> with their mutual influence were obtained, using the methods of experimental design and data analysis. The influence of the concentration of brash ice on the <b>sluiceway</b> <b>channel</b> and its elements is described. The comparison of experimental data with data obtained by other authors before is made by comparing flow coefficients. Recommendations for normal operation of ice pass at sluiceway track channel of water intake structure for diversion power plant are given...|$|E
5000|$|The filter {{beds are}} located on a 16 acre {{straddling}} the border between Marlborough and Southborough {{on the west side}} of the Sudbury Reservoir, and are now largely overgrown with vegetation. They are roughly bounded by three roadways: Walker Street to the north, Massachusetts Route 85 to the west (which is Maple Street in Marlborough and Marlboro Street in Southborough), and Acre Bridge Road in Southborough, which becomes Framingham Road in Marlborough. The northern most portion, where Marlborough Brook enters after crossing under Walker Street, is a 1.5 acre settling reservoir. From this, water was diverted over a stone and concrete weir into a channel running along the eastern edge of the beds. Sluiceways controlled the channeling of water into a series of 17 beds to the west, which consist of shallow basins with about 2 ft of sand set at the bottom on top of a tile bed. The water would filter through these beds by gravity. Further down the main <b>channel</b> another <b>sluiceway</b> <b>channeled</b> water into a larger holding bed, or into a second series of 10 [...] "natural" [...] beds, which fashioned out of already-extant gravel.|$|R
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a <b>sluiceway,</b> or <b>channel,</b> that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|R

500|$|The {{effects of}} {{glaciation}} have made Kitchen Creek {{within the park}} [...] "unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front", {{as it is the}} only one with an [...] "almost continuous series of waterfalls". Before the last ice age, Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin; during the ice age, glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop. About 20,000years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a <b>sluiceway,</b> or <b>channel,</b> that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Glacial deposits of debris [...] thick formed a dam blocking water from Ganoga Lake and what became Lake Jean from draining into Big Run, a tributary of Fishing Creek. The water was instead diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek.|$|R
