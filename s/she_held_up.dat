2500|$|On Madonna's next {{appearance}} on SNL, after singing [...] "Bad Girl", <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{a photo of}} Joey Buttafuoco and, saying [...] "fight the real enemy", tore it up.

60|$|<b>She</b> calmly <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her lips, and Mannering kissed {{them after}} a moment's hesitation. She {{remained}} {{by his side}} even {{when he turned to}} say farewell to Berenice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shirts for Boo, sir. Four, {{and this}} is the last," [...] she answered, with pardonable pride, as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> and nodded toward the pile in her basket.|$|R

6000|$|AMY. 'No; I {{thought of}} that. But she couldn't, you know, even though <b>she</b> was <b>held</b> <b>up.</b> Mother couldn't help {{thinking}} {{the scene was}} a good omen, though.' They both look at the ceiling again. 'How still they are.' ...|$|R
