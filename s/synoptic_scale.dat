5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale).</b> Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere. Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone.

Without {{taking into account the}} earth's rotation they hypothesise that the horizontal atmospheric energy spectrum should scale as k&minus; 5 / 3 at all scales. We point out that the approximate k&minus; 3 -spectrum at <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> has been observed by a number of non-aircraft means since the 1960 s and that general circulation models and other current models have successfully produced this spectrum.

5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> winds).

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is monitored by Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion). Within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> low pressure area, originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation {{with the average}} wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots (50km/h)).|$|E
30|$|The diurnal cycle {{has been}} {{established}} by (i) as the fundamental phenomenon in particular near the coastlines over the IMC. It is forced by the land–sea temperature difference mainly due to the daytime insolation (dependent on latitude and season) and the nighttime sprinkler-like rainfall itself and partly by interannual SST variations. It is synchronized over almost the whole IMC and forces cloud convection systems from meso to <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{derivation}} of the meridional {{momentum flux}} arising from a multiscale horizontal velocity {{field in the}} intraseasonal, planetary, equatorial synoptic-scale dynamics (IPESD) multiscale models of the equatorial troposphere is presented. It is shown that, because of the balance dynamics on the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales,</b> the synoptic-scale component of the meridional momentum flux convergence must always vanish at the equa-tor. Plausible Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) models are presented along with their planetary-scale meridional momentum fluxes. These models are driven by synoptic-scale heating fluctuations that have vertical and meridional tilts. Irrespective of {{the sign of the}} synoptic-scale meridional momentum flux (direction of the tilts) {{in each of the four}} MJO examples, the zonal and vertical mean meridional momentum flux convergence from the planetary scales always drives westerly winds near the equator: this is the superrotation characteristic of actual MJOs. The concluding discussion demonstrates that equatorial su-perrotation occurs when the planetary flow due to the vertical upscale momentum flux from <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> reinforces the horizontally convergent flow due to planetary-scale mean heating. 1...|$|R
40|$|The size {{distribution}} of moist {{regions in the}} tropical atmosphere exhibits two modes of organization, one at <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> and the other at planetary scales. We show {{the existence of these}} two modes in two data sets: columnintegrated precipitable water and outgoing long-wave radiation. A simple two-column model of radiation and convection in the Tropics helps interpret the presence of these two modes. The coupling between radiative effects and low-level atmospheric dynamics provides a plausible mechanism for scale selection. 1...|$|R
5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is a {{microscale}} {{meteorological phenomenon}} occurring over {{a very small}} distance, {{but it can be}} associated with mesoscale or <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts.

In the troposphere, previous NWP results are recovered, namely the emergence of distinct regimes and the maximisation of the growth rate on <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> at early times; in the middle atmosphere, the predictability decay is slower.

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal <b>synoptic</b> <b>scale</b> cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the {{atmosphere}} {{can be divided into}} distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{energy spectrum}} {{as a function}} of horizontal wavenumber over the range from a few kilometers to the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> was obtained by Nastrom et al. (1984) and Nastrom and Gage (1985). They found that the spectra follow the − 3 power law in the range 1000 to 3000 km and the − 5 / 3 power law in the horizontal scales less than a few hundred km (about 400 – 500 km). While the − 3 power law is interpreted as the property of quasi-geostrophic turbulence (Charney, 1971), the formation mechanism of the − 5 / 3 spectral slope in the atmospheric mesoscales is still uncertain. Lilly (1983) suggested that inverse energy cascade could occur in stratified turbulence. However, Métais et al. (1994) showed that effective upscale energy cascade and a − 5 / 3 spectral slope are not realized for the parameter range of the atmospheric mesoscales. Although Koshyk et al. (1999, 2001) performed the numerical simulation using the GFDL-SKYHI GCM and achieved reproduction of the − 3 slope in the <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> and the − 5 / 3 slope in the mesoscales, there is no study using a simple dynamical model which supports and reproduces their results.

40|$|One of the unexplained {{striking}} {{features of}} tropical convection is the observed statistical self-similarity in clusters, superclusters, and intraseasonal oscillations through complex multiscale processes {{ranging from the}} mesoscales to the equatorial <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> to the intraseasonal/planetary scales. Here new multispatial-scale, multitime-scale, simplified asymptotic models are derived systematically from the equatorial primitive equations on the range of scales from mesoscale to equatorial synoptic to planetary/intraseasonal, which provide a useful analytic framework for addressing these issues. New mesoscale equatorial synoptic dy-namical (MESD) models and balanced MESD (BMESD) models are developed for the multitime, multi-space interaction from mesoscales to equatorial synoptic scales; new multitime versions of the intraseasonal planetary equatorial synoptic dynamics (IPESD) models are developed for multiple spatiotemporal inter-actions on equatorial <b>synoptic</b> <b>scales</b> and planetary scales. The mathematical character derived below for all these simplified models explicitly demonstrates that the main nonlinear interactions across scales are quasi-linear where eddy flux divergences of momentum and temperature from nonlinear advection from the smaller-scale spatiotemporal flows as well as mean source effects accumulate in time and drive the waves on the successively larger spatiotemporal scales. Furthermore, these processes that transfer energy to the next larger, longer, spatiotemporal scales are self-similar in a suitable sense established here. On the other hand, the larger scales set the environment for this transport through processes such as mean advection of the smaller scales. 1...|$|R

The <b>synoptic</b> time <b>scale</b> eddies exhibit maximum kinetic energy in stormtracks slightly downstream from and poleward of the Atlantic and Pacific jet maximum. An alternative approach is via the anisotropic part of the horizontal velocity correlation tensor, the axis of which gives the local orientation of the eddies and the magnitude a measure of the extension of the eddies. When the man velocity field is almost that of the plane waves, the horizontal group velocity relative to the mean field is also related to this tensor.
