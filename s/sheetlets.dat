Despite this importance, characterisation of cellular features at the organ level remains challenging, and a unifying description {{of the structure of the}} heart is still outstanding. Here, we optimised diffusion tensor imaging data to acquire high quality data in ex vivo rabbit hearts in slack and contractured states, approximating diastolic and systolic conditions. The data were analysed with a suite of methods that focused on different aspects of the myocardium. In the slack heart, we observed a similar transmural gradient in helix angle of the primary eigenvector of up to 23. 6 °/mm in the left ventricle and 24. 2 °/mm in the right ventricle. In the contractured heart, the same transmural gradient remained largely linear, but was offset by up to + 49. 9 ° in the left ventricle. In the right ventricle, there was an increase in the transmural gradient to 31. 2 °/mm and an offset of up to + 39. 0 °. The application of tractography based on each eigenvector enabled visualisation of streamlines that depict cardiomyocyte and sheetlet organisation over large distances. We observed multiple V- and N-shaped sheetlet arrangements throughout the myocardium, and insertion of <b>sheetlets</b> at the intersection of the left and right ventricle. This study integrates several complementary techniques to visualise and quantify the heart’s microstructure, projecting parameter representations across different length scales.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Left {{ventricular}} (LV) microstructure is unique, {{composed of}} a winding helical pattern of myocytes and rotating aggregations of myocytes called <b>sheetlets.</b> Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), however the link between LVH and underlying microstructural aberration is poorly understood. In vivo cardiovascular diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) is a novel cardiovascular MRI (CMR) technique, capable of characterising LV microstructural dynamics non-invasively. In vivo cDTI may therefore improve our understanding microstructural-functional relationships in health and disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The monopolar diffusion weighted stimulated echo acquisition mode (DW-STEAM) sequence was evaluated for in vivo cDTI acquisitions at 3 Tesla, in healthy volunteers (HV), patients with hypertensive LVH, and HCM patients. Results were contextualised in relation to extensively explored technical limitations. cDTI parameters demonstrated good intra-centre reproducibility in HCM, and good inter-centre reproducibility in HV. In all subjects, cDTI was able to depict the winding helical pattern of myocyte orientation known from histology, and the transmural rate of change in myocyte orientation was dependent on LV size and thickness. In HV, comparison of cDTI parameters between systole and diastole revealed an increase in transmural gradient, combined with a significant re-orientation of sheetlet angle. In contrast, in HCM, myocyte gradient increased between phases, however sheetlet angulation retained a systolic-like orientation in both phases. Combined analysis with hypertensive patients revealed a proportional decrease in sheetlet mobility with increasing LVH. CONCLUSION In vivo DW-STEAM cDTI can characterise LV microstructural dynamics non-invasively. The transmural rate of change in myocyte angulation is dependent on LV size and wall thickness, however inter phase changes in myocyte orientation are unaffected by LVH. In contrast, sheetlet dynamics demonstrate increasing dysfunction, {{in proportion to the}} degree of LVH. Resolving technical limitations is key to advancing this technique, and improving the understanding of the role of microstructural abnormalities in cardiovascular disease expression.

40|$|Background: Cardiomyocytes are {{organized}} in microstructures termed <b>sheetlets</b> that reorientate during left ventricular thickening. Diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) may enable noninvasive interrogation of in vivo cardiac microstructural dynamics. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) {{is a condition}} of abnormal myocardium with unknown sheetlet function. Objectives: This study sought to validate in vivo DT-CMR measures of cardiac microstructure against histology, characterize microstructural dynamics during left ventricular wall thickening, and apply the technique in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM. Methods: In vivo DT-CMR was acquired throughout the cardiac cycle in healthy swine, followed by in situ and ex vivo DT-CMR, then validated against histology. In vivo DT-CMR was performed in 19 control subjects, 19 DCM, and 13 HCM patients. Results: In swine, a DT-CMR index of sheetlet reorientation (E 2 A) changed substantially (E 2 A mobility ∼ 46 °). E 2 A changes correlated with wall thickness changes (in vivo r 2 = 0. 75; in situ r 2 = 0. 89), were consistently observed under all experimental conditions, and accorded closely with histological analyses in both relaxed and contracted states. The potential contribution of cyclical strain effects to in vivo E 2 A was ∼ 17 %. In healthy human control subjects, E 2 A increased from diastole (18 °) to systole (65 °; p < 0. 001; E 2 A mobility = 45 °). HCM patients showed significantly greater E 2 A in diastole than control subjects did (48 °; p < 0. 001) with impaired E 2 A mobility (23 °; p < 0. 001). In DCM, E 2 A was similar to control subjects in diastole, but systolic values were markedly lower (40 °; p < 0. 001) with impaired E 2 A mobility (20 °; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Myocardial microstructure dynamics can be characterized by in vivo DT-CMR. Sheetlet function was abnormal in DCM with altered systolic conformation and reduced mobility, contrasting with HCM, which showed reduced mobility with altered diastolic conformation. These novel insights significantly improve understanding of contractile dysfunction {{at a level of}} noninvasive interrogation not previously available in humans...|$|E
40|$|Background Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) can through the two methods 3 D FLASH and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) give complementary {{information on the}} local orientations of cardiomyocytes and their laminar arrays. Methods Eight explanted rat hearts were perfused with Gd-DTPA contrast agent and fixative and imaged in a 9. 4 T magnet by two types of acquisition: 3 D fast low angle shot (FLASH) imaging, voxels 50 [*]×[*] 50 [*]×[*] 50 μm, and 3 D spin echo DTI with monopolar diffusion gradients of 3. 6 ms duration at 11. 5 ms separation, voxels 200 [*]×[*] 200 [*]×[*] 200 μm. The sensitivity of each approach to imaging parameters was explored. Results The FLASH data showed laminar alignments of voxels with high signal, {{in keeping with the}} presumed predominance of contrast in the interstices between <b>sheetlets.</b> It was analysed, using structure-tensor (ST) analysis, to determine the most (v 1 ST), intermediate (v 2 ST) and least (v 3 ST) extended orthogonal directions of signal continuity. The DTI data was analysed to determine the most (e 1 DTI), intermediate (e 2 DTI) and least (e 3 DTI) orthogonal eigenvectors of extent of diffusion. The correspondence between the FLASH and DTI methods was measured and appraised. The most extended direction of FLASH signal (v 1 ST) agreed well with that of diffusion (e 1 DTI) throughout the left ventricle (representative discrepancy in the septum of 13. 3 [*]±[*] 6. 7 °: median[*]±[*]absolute deviation) and both were in keeping with the expected local orientations of the long-axis of cardiomyocytes. However, the orientation of the least directions of FLASH signal continuity (v 3 ST) and diffusion (e 3 ST) showed greater discrepancies of up to 27. 9 [*]±[*] 17. 4 °. Both FLASH (v 3 ST) and DTI (e 3 DTI) where compared to directly measured laminar arrays in the FLASH images. For FLASH the discrepancy between the structure-tensor calculated v 3 ST and the directly measured FLASH laminar array normal was of 9 [*]±[*] 7 ° for the lateral wall and 7 [*]±[*] 9 ° for the septum (median[*]±[*]inter quartile range), and for DTI the discrepancy between the calculated v 3 DTI and the directly measured FLASH laminar array normal was 22 [*]±[*] 14 ° and 61 [*]±[*] 53. 4 °. DTI was relatively insensitive to the number of diffusion directions and to time up to 72 hours post fixation, but was moderately affected by b-value (which was scaled by modifying diffusion gradient pulse strength with fixed gradient pulse separation). Optimal DTI parameters were b[*]=[*] 1000 mm/s 2 and 12 diffusion directions. FLASH acquisitions were relatively insensitive to the image processing parameters explored. Conclusions We show that ST analysis of FLASH is a useful and accurate tool in the measurement of cardiac microstructure. While both FLASH and the DTI approaches appear promising for mapping of the alignments of myocytes throughout myocardium, marked discrepancies between the cross myocyte anisotropies deduced from each method call for consideration of their respective limitations. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) {{is limited}} by scan time and signal-to-noise (SNR) restrictions. This invariably leads to a trade-off {{between the number of}} averages, diffusion-weighted directions (ND), and image resolution. Systematic evaluation of these parameters is therefore important for adoption of cardiac DTI in clinical routine where time is a key constraint. Methods: High quality reference DTI data were acquired in five ex-vivo rat hearts. We then retrospectively set 2 ≤ SNR ≤ 97, 7 ≤ ND ≤ 61, varied the voxel volume by up to 192 -fold and investigated the impact on the accuracy and precision of commonly derived parameters. Results: For maximal scan efficiency, the accuracy and precision of the mean diffusivity is optimised when SNR is maximised at the expense of ND. With typical parameter settings used clinically, we estimate that fractional anisotropy may be overestimated by up to 13 % with an uncertainty of ± 30 %, while the precision of the <b>sheetlet</b> angles may be as poor as ± 31 °. Although the helix angle has better precision of ± 14 °, the transmural range of helix angles may be under-estimated by up to 30 ° in apical and basal slices, due to partial volume and tapering myocardial geometry. Conclusions: These findings inform a baseline of understanding upon which further issues inherent to in-vivo cardiac DTI, such as motion, strain and perfusion, can be considered. Furthermore, the reported bias and reproducibility provides a context in which to assess cardiac DTI biomarkers...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is widely}} used to assess tissue {{microstructure}} non-invasively. Cardiac DTI enables inference of cell and <b>sheetlet</b> orientations, which are altered under pathological conditions. However, DTI is affected by many factors, therefore robust validation is critical. Existing histological validation is intrinsically flawed, since it requires further tissue processing leading to sample distortion, is routinely limited in field-of-view and requires reconstruction of three-dimensional volumes from two-dimensional images. In contrast, synchrotron radiation imaging (SRI) data enables imaging of the heart in 3 D without further preparation following DTI. The objective {{of the study was}} to validate DTI measurements based on structure tensor analysis of SRI data. METHODS: One isolated, fixed rat heart was imaged ex vivo with DTI and X-ray phase contrast SRI, and reconstructed at 100  μm and 3. 6  μm isotropic resolution respectively. Structure tensors were determined from the SRI data and registered to the DTI data. RESULTS: Excellent agreement in helix angles (HA) and transverse angles (TA) was observed between the DTI and structure tensor synchrotron radiation imaging (STSRI) data, where HADTI-STSRI[*]=[*]- 1. 4 °[*]±[*] 23. 2 ° and TADTI-STSRI[*]=[*]- 1. 4 °[*]±[*] 35. 0 ° (mean[*]±[*] 1. 96 standard deviation across all voxels in the left ventricle). STSRI confirmed that the primary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor corresponds with the cardiomyocyte long-axis across the whole myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: We have used STSRI as a novel and high-resolution gold standard for the validation of DTI, allowing like-with-like comparison of three-dimensional tissue structures in the same intact heart free of distortion. This represents a critical step forward in independently verifying the structural basis and informing the interpretation of cardiac DTI data, thereby supporting the further development and adoption of DTI in structure-based electro-mechanical modelling and routine clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion {{weighted}} imaging (DWI) is {{a powerful}} quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that can probe tissues in vivo at the microscopic level and provide insight into cellular microstructural environment. Cardiac DWI has great potential value {{in its ability to}} answer open questions regarding myocardial structure, dynamics, and remodeling. Unfortunately, several technical limitations of current DWI techniques make its application in the beating heart very challenging, which leads to erroneous or inconsistent results. Amongst the challenges are an extreme sensitivity to bulk physiological motion, low signal to noise ratios (SNR), long scan times, and geometric image distortions. In this dissertation, these limitations are addressed with novel technical developments applied to the DWI pulse sequence including convex optimized diffusion gradient waveform design and multi-parametric tissue characterization. A brief introduction to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and MRI is provided in Chapter 1. This leads into a description of the fundamental components of a DWI acquisition in Chapter 2 and an overview of the current state of cardiac DWI in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, a novel DWI strategy called Convex Optimized Diffusion Encoding (CODE) is described. CODE is a mathematical framework that formulates diffusion encoding gradient design as a convex optimization problem and automatically generates motion compensated (MOCO) waveforms that achieve the shortest possible echo times (TE) and thus improve SNR. First and second order moment nulled CODE (CODE-M 1 M 2) permits DWI that is robust to cardiac motion with higher SNR than an existing MOCO technique. First order motion compensated CODE-M 1 also improves robustness to cardiac induced motion in liver DWI with higher SNR than M 1 nulled bipolar DWI. CODE can also be used for non-motion compensated DWI and improves SNR compared with traditional monopolar DWI in the brain. In Chapter 5 we present a multi-parametric DWI strategy that simultaneously yields maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T 2 relaxation time constant in the heart (T 2 +ADC). Typically, DWI protocols include multiple acquisitions with a range of diffusion encoding strengths (b-value), but with constant TE to isolate the effect of diffusion of the signal. The joint T 2 +ADC approach varies both b-value and TE within the acquisition to facilitate estimation of both ADC and T 2 relaxation. T 2 +ADC permits joint reconstruction with no increase in scan time compared with DWI alone and no effect on ADC measurement. In Chapter 6 we use CODE-M 1 M 2 diffusion encoding to perform cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) and generate maps of myocardial microstructure in healthy volunteers. cDTI can be used to map myocardial fiber and myolaminar <b>sheetlet</b> orientations, which can contribute to our understanding of ventricular microstructure in health and disease and facilitate sophisticated mechanical models of cardiac dynamics. However, {{it is important to understand}} the uncertainty underlying these measurements to inform interpretation and define acquisition limitations. We apply a previously described bootstrap technique to measure the uncertainty in the diffusion tensors derived from CODE-M 1 M 2 cDTI and establish achievable levels of precision in clinically feasible scan times. In Chapter 7 the CODE framework is extended to compensate for the effect of eddy currents, which are a common cause of image distortions in DWI and DTI. Diffusion encoding gradients must be very strong to encode microscopic molecular displacements and these strong gradient pulses induce unwanted eddy currents in conductive MRI hardware components. If not addressed, eddy currents lead to distorted images and corrupted diffusion parameter estimates. We incorporate an eddy current model into the CODE optimization framework to develop eddy current nulled CODE (EN-CODE). EN-CODE accomplishes eddy current nulling with TEs that are comparable to traditional monopolar encoding and much shorter than the established twice refocused spin echo (TRSE) technique for eddy current nulling. The developments described in this dissertation represent an improvement in the flexibility, efficiency, and robustness of diffusion encoding. The CODE framework can also be easily modified to address additional constraints and thus may prove useful in currently unforeseen applications...|$|R

Why should it act different here from the way it does all the world over?BlLINGUALISM ON THE BALANCE <b>SHEETLet</b> me say that in Quebec specifically, over the last thirty years or so, our company has been footing the bill for French courses attended by a great many of its English-speaking executives. Ditto for English courses followed by French-speaking personnel. Again, we in Alcan believe that bilingualism in Quebec is a two-way street. Bilingualism costs money ? Why, of course. It's not itemized in detail on the balance sheet, but it's budgeted for. And we feel it's a sound investment. In the educational field we have taken other steps. To help those of our employees who had not reached the ninth grade the company went into adult education in a big way with the help of local school boards. It was agreed with these boards that the French language {{would be one of the}} main three subjects at the time of exams. Alcan went even farther and, here, it broke new ground in personnel training. That was in 1943. Some of our employees were taking courses by mail from International Correspondence School. An English-speaking Alcan executive who had been a professor asked I. C. S. permission to have its courses translated into French, plus the right, for French-speaking students, to undergo their exams in French. This — a new departure for I. C. S. — was granted. Today, the English-speaking gentleman who had blazed a new trail in personnel training is a technical adviser with the Quebec Department of Education. There's B & B for you ! Alcan is proud of such people. Believe it or not, Alcan may have gone a little too far in its effort to become part and parcel of Quebec. Before power utilities were nationalized, a few years ago, Alcan had a subsidiary in the Saguenay/Lake St John district. It was called Saguenay Electric Company. It was 100 per cent French, right down to the initials in its elevator. Two of its presidents in succession were French Canadians. When the company was nationalized, however, a good many top management people in the subsidiary wanted to remain within the Alcan group. The trouble was they were not bilingual enough, although they knew their electrical onions better than most, They rated a good position with Alcan, naturally, but phasing them in was no picnic. Because Alcan, same as all large international corporations, must speak English and not only local languages. Now, here is another minor point to stress. Since it is an Alcan policy to buy from local suppliers who can meet the company's conditions, communications are in the suppliers' language as much as circumstances make it possible. ALCAN PLANT PAPERS IN QUEBECSpeaking to industrial editors, I feel it appropriate to recall that the first Alcan plant paper put out in Canada was entirely in French. It was published in Shawinigan under the name of « La Revue de l’Aluminium ». In the Saguenay/Lake St. John district, Alcan's weekly « Le Lingot » prints only a couple of pages in English out of an average sixteen. It covers the nine works and other Alcan locations in the area. Out there, the company puts out two other French papers, one at Arvida works and the other at the Isle-Maligne works, in the town of Alma. The Alcan papers in Shawinigan and Beauharnois are also exclusively in French. Are Alcan's plant paper editors satisfied with the standard of French they print ? Being perfectionists, I don't think they ever will be. But they do keep improving. We started more than twenty-five years ago using international French aluminum terminology in our plant papers. And don't kid yourselves : French Canadian employees grasped all shades of meaning in that terminology. They use the international French words pertaining to their jobs more and more. In our training courses we try to use the proper expressions so that employees at all echelons get to know them. We keep adding to the French aluminum vocabulary year after year, building up a lexicon which is kept up to date. Incidentally this lexicon is not limited to the metallurgy of aluminum. It encompasses other fields, including accounting. In this respect, it may be noteworthy that both the French and the English versions of Alcan's annual report are official. THE LETTER AND THE SPIRITAlcan personnel at all levels acknowledge the fact that bilingualism in Quebec is company policy. This policy is not spelled out in the form of an edict. Rather, it is an all-pervading spirit, or attitude. It is in this sense that one must see bilingualism as an Alcan reality throughout Quebec. This reality has been with the Company ever since it started operating in Quebec, and it has been increasingly conspicuous over the last twenty-five years. Alcan employees know they can work exclusively in French at several Quebec locations. They know also that their labor unions negotiate agreements in French and that the French version of these agreements enjoys priority. Some agreements are not even translated into English. As a result of this and other circumstances, job description and evaluation for most employees are set out in French. In fact, Company and Labor representatives devoted ten years to this common task. More and more, at Alcan's Quebec locations, meetings are held almost exclusively in French even if unilingual Anglo-Saxons participate. In other meetings, it may be unalloyed bilingualism, each speaking — not necessarily his mother tongue — but the language he feels like improving at that particular moment, his own or the other. At all those locations, work orders and service messages are bilingual or French only, as are also safety signs and notice board material. Finally, employees at certain Alcan locations in Quebec well know that, when time is of the essence and only one language can be used, Alcan will use French. But then, you may ask whether this tendency to Frenchify everything in Alcan's Quebec operations is not detrimental to English-speaking personnel. Let's be frank. It would indeed be detrimental if the company did not put means to study French at the disposal of its English-speaking staff. It was pointedly explained a moment ago that these people are encouraged to become bilingual, since it may help them get ahead, at least in Quebec. Naturally, if an executive who holds a top position in the Alcan group in Britain is transferred to a Quebec location at age 55, for instance, he may not instinctively want to start learning a new language at his age. Bilingualism is most useful among people who are forty or younger. Still, it is interesting to see white-haired gentlemen, burdened with heavy responsibilities, begin to study French at an age when we all know such a mental exertion is strenuous, especially when bilingualism is no more a requirement for promotion, a mere ten years or so from retirement. I could name several English Canadian works managers and department heads who made it a point to study French and look for all kinds of opportunities to try it on their French-speaking colleagues. This yen to speak French never resulted in top management branding them as off-beat, because Alcan, as an organization, just doesn't think that way. And this, again, is a proof that bilingualism, with Alcan, is a way of life in Quebec. French Canadians improve their English and the latter improve their French. A good many perfectly bilingual French Canadians have held or now hold key posts with Alcan in foreign lands. For instance, for a few years, the personnel manager in Guiana was a French Canadian. Today, he is a vice-president. One of the first French Canadian engineers hired by Alcan at Arvida, in 1926, later became a works manager. Today he is retired — so to speak, as he is now the general manager of C. O. S. E., a management training organization which Alcan helped launch several years ago. In 1935, as the Depression was slowly rolling out of its deepest trough, Alcan resumed recruiting university graduates to strengthen its middle management. The company hired four engineers. But the president insisted that two of the four be French Canadians. Well, one of the two is now vice-president. The other one, after a fruitful career with Alcan, has joined the University of Montreal. THE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISHGenerally speaking, in Quebec, it is not easy to land a promising staff position in an English-language corporation if one does not speak English. Not knowing English is a handicap. So far as Alcan is concerned, the handicap is only temporary. The company has confidence in its executive trainees even if their English is poor. Its attitude is that if a young graduate is ambitious he will take the steps required to get ahead, and one of them, clearly, is to speak and write English just about as well as French. What I wish to stress here is that our company blackballs no one because of an insufficient knowledge of English. Same as many another large corporations, Alcan goes to universities and technological institutes to recruit personnel. My latest information in this area is that from forty to forty-five per cent of all Canadian university graduates Alcan has been recruiting in recent years are French Canadians. Of course, you just wouldn't believe me if I said that nobody in Alcan is lukewarm towards bilingualism. The opposite would be incredible. Whether we like it or not there will always be backward people on both sides of the linguistic fence. But there is a whole of a difference between a few individuals and a corporation which has invested about three quarters of a billion dollars in Quebec, where it employs some twelve thousand people. And in any case, as we have seen already, Alcan's policy is to adapt itself to its environments. Such factors must be considered with a cool head. In business, as we all know, it pays to be realistic. For Alcan, fostering bilingualism among its Quebec personnel is the businesslike thing to do. Our company plays no favourites. As a business organization it cannot afford to. Its policy is simply that to operate in Quebec it must be as bilingual as the North American business realities make it possible to be. Alcan had such an attitude more than twenty-five years ago, a long time before the political bickerings of recent years, and a long time before there was so much talk about introducing more French in business relationships inside Quebec. If you look at Alcan's annual report there is one valuable asset that is not expressed in figures — and that is its reputation, its reputation in Quebec and throughout the world where, thoroughly integrated to its various environments, it never becomes a harmful foreign body in the social anatomy. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL FRENCHIf you assume that Alcan worries about the quality of its French you are entirely right, because international French is the only variety it strives to master. Right here in Quebec, the company goes along with all movements aimed at improving spoken and written French. This, in fact, entails hazards. You, as newspapermen, know this. Did you ever try to find an expression that will satisfy at least two linguists ? A term that, having satisfied two linguists, will also be okayed by accountants, sociologists in personnel, economists, engineers, foremen and employees ? Frankly speaking, when you venture into the jungle of semantics, you live dangerously. There are days when our plant paper editors feel they jeopardize their life expectancy by trying to please everybody. To them, jumping aboard a satellite...|$|R
