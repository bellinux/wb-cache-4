The results were obtained in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece and flank wear under different cutting parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance evaluation {{of three different}} cutting fluids used in a minimal quantity lubrication (MQL) system. The MQL system, developed in-house at the University of Malaya, was capable of delivering high velocity cutting fluid in narrow pulsed jet forms {{at a rate of}} 2 ml/min and a pressure of 20 MPa. The three cutting fluids chosen were neat oil, <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> and semi-synthetic cutting fluids. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the fluids at various cutting velocities of 20, 40 and 60 m/min and feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 06 and 0. 07 mm/tooth. The results were measured in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece, the cutting forces and the maximum flank wear. In addition, the resultant chip formations were also observed. Analysis of the results has shown that in general, neat oil had performed the best in low cutting velocities and feed rates. On the other hand, <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> gave the lowest cutting forces and flank wears at high cutting velocities and feed rated as compared to neat oil and synthetic cutting fluid. It was observed that performance of <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> does not drastically change with variation to the cutting velocities and feed rates. Thus, the choice of <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> would be most appropriate for general machining usage. With suitable machining parameter selection, water-mixed cutting fluids (<b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> and semi synthetics) performed comparatively well to deliver low surface roughness results. Therefore, this can be an economical choice for use in industrial production processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{bacteriology}} of <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> emulsions {{has received}} only sporadic attention, {{most of it}} {{during the past three}} decades. Some of the in-vestigations were stimulated by reports of dermatitis among people in machine shops where oil emulsions are used as coolants and lubricants; others resulted from studies of the microbial spoilage of the emulsions. At present, few workers believe that the indigenous micro-flora of the emulsions contributes to dermatitis, but most investigators are of the opinion that it does cause spoilage of the emulsions. The present studies were initiated in order {{to learn more about the}} microorganisms which are concerned with decomposition of <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> emulsions. The predominant members of the microflora in <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> emulsions are pseudomonads. Lee and Chandler (1941) described and named Pseudoonas oleovorans, an organism which oc-curred in almost pure culture in the emulsions which they investigated.

A suitable power measurement setup was used to monitor the power consumption under cryogenic machining and simultaneously compared with that under dry and conventional <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> medium.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between measured levels of exposure to <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> mists in a plant manufacturing ball bearings, and both respiratory symptoms and airway responsiveness in the workforce. METHODS: 114 male workers exposed to oil mist and 55 unexposed male controls from nearby factories were studied. <b>Soluble</b> <b>oil</b> mist concentrations were measured with area samplers. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine with an abbreviated method. Subjects were labelled positive to methacholine airway challenge (MAC+) if forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) fell by > or = 20 %. The linear dose-response slope was calculated as the percentage fall in FEV 1 at the last dose divided by the total dose given. RESULTS: Geometric mean concentrations of oil mists ranged from 0. 65 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 29) to 2. 20 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 55) based on 92 measurements obtained from 1979 - 93. The prevalence of chronic cough or phlegm, bouts of bronchitis, and dyspnoea was greater among exposed workers than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 4. 64, P = 0. 002 for chronic cough and phlegm). After adjustment for smoking and age, dyspnoea {{was significantly related to}} an index of cumulative exposure to oil mist (OR 1. 44, P = 0. 006 / 10 y. mg/m 3). The proportion of MAC+ subjects was similar in the two groups. However, after adjustment for baseline FEV 1 and age, the dose-response slope was significantly steeper among exposed workers than among controls (P = 0. 01), a finding indicating airway hyperresponsiveness in the exposed workers. Furthermore, the dose-response slope was significantly related to baseline FEV 1, age, and, after adjustment for FEV 1, the index of cumulative exposure to oil (P = 0. 004). CONCLUSION: Subjects with exposure to <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> mist in the metal industry are at risk of developing both respiratory symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Metalworking fluids (MWFs) are a vital {{component}} of a vital process—the machining of metals. They cool and lubricate the metal and tools, carry away waste and swarf and sometimes provide protection against corrosion for the workpiece surface. They have been in use for {{a century and a}} half, but the 73 cases of alveolitis and asthma at a British car engine manufacturer in Longbridge, last year, illus-trate that the health risks are still with us (BBC News, 2004).
