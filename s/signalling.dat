5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate cell <b>signalling</b> events. In these cases, a serpin {{that has}} formed a complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream <b>signalling</b> by the receptor.

50|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of information science and computing technology, the theory of digital filters design and application has achieved leap-forward development. We encounter a variety of <b>signals</b> in real-life, such as broadcasting <b>signals,</b> television <b>signals,</b> radar <b>signals,</b> mobile phone <b>signals,</b> navigation <b>signals,</b> radio astronomy <b>signal,</b> biomedical <b>signals,</b> control <b>signals,</b> weather <b>signal,</b> seismic <b>signal,</b> mechanical vibration <b>signal,</b> remote sensing and telemetry <b>signals,</b> etc. Most of these <b>signals</b> are analog <b>signals</b> and just {{a small portion of}} them are digital <b>signals.</b> The analog <b>signals</b> are continuous function of the independent variables, which can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or multidimensional. In most cases, the variable of one-dimensional analog <b>signals</b> are time. After the time sampling and discretization of magnitude, such analog <b>signal</b> will become a one-dimensional digital <b>signal.</b> The resulting digital <b>signal</b> can be represented by a discrete sequence. For example, one common <b>signal</b> is voice <b>signal.</b> An example of a two-dimensional <b>signal</b> is an image. A filter is a system that can transform a <b>signal</b> into another <b>signal.</b> Examples of such transformation include smoothing the <b>signal</b> for noise removal, removing frequency components from a <b>signal</b> and amplifying frequency components for <b>signal</b> enhancement. The design and implementation of filter is an important branch in <b>signal</b> analysis and processing technology.

In common with most railways, <b>signalling</b> was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval.

5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly <b>signalling</b> could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by <b>signalling</b> their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly <b>signalling</b> theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for <b>signalling</b> behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallersâ€™ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of <b>signalling.</b> Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual <b>signalling</b> were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph.
