The nearby community of Jamestown had a population of only 779 by 1870. [...] In 1875 Lake James was described as [...] "remarkably clear and free from mineral matter" [...] with water having a [...] "pleasant taste" [...] and [...] "neutral to litmus paper". [...] By that time, the lake was well known for good fishing. [...] Cottages began appearing on Lake James during {{the end of the}} 19th century. A portion of <b>Spring</b> <b>Point,</b> located {{on the west side of}} the lake where the First and Second basins meet, was platted in 1895. [...] Settlement accelerated when an electric railway connected the city of Angola with the southernmost shore of the lake's First Basin, known as Paltytown.|$|E

50|$|The town's {{name was}} {{originally}} spelt Yuani, which {{was thought to}} correctly represent the aboriginal name, but this was soon dropped in favour of Youanmi. The name Youanmi was first recorded by a surveyour in 1887, as {{the name of a}} local <b>spring,</b> <b>pointed</b> out to him by a local aboriginal accompanying him. Following the survey of lots, the townsite was gazetted in August 1910.|$|R
50|$|The vaults of {{the choir}} and sacristy {{are part of a}} {{characteristic}} Scottish group of pointed stone barrel vaults, that flourished in Scotland all across the 15th century.

50|$|The nave {{is divided}} {{on either side}} into five arcades. They show the {{transition}} from Norman architecture to the Early English Style. The piers are Norman in character with foliated capitals from which <b>spring</b> <b>pointed</b> arches.

50|$|At a {{small number}} of {{locations}} on single track lines in Britain, interlaced loops had been provided where <b>sprung</b> catch <b>points</b> were required because of the steep gradient. The points {{at either end of the}} loop were set according to the train's direction of travel. Trains running uphill were routed via the loop incorporating the <b>sprung</b> catch <b>point.</b> Trains running downhill used the opposite loop, bypassing the catch point.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} floor is the largest chamber in the tower, nine meters high, opening on three sides. The chamber {{is covered with a}} quadripartite rib vault with <b>springing</b> <b>points</b> (on the outer walls) {{decorated}} with angels carrying Jean sans Peur's coat of arms. Its main function seems to have been simply to hold up the upper rooms on top of it, though it may also have contained a bell.|$|R

50|$|A signalbox was in {{existence}} at Eggesford until 1987, however the line {{has since been}} rationalised and the passing loop automated {{with the use of}} <b>spring</b> <b>points.</b> Token exchange is now carried out by the driver in an unmanned hut located on each platform. The conductor/guard is also required to operate the level crossing at the station as well as this is not automatic. Token release and train signalling is carried out by Crediton signalbox.|$|R
