This paper proposes a new architecture for Packet-Aware Transport Networks (PATN) which supports both packet and traditional TDM services and which leverages an assemblage of emerging technologies to provide efficient aggregation and switching of packet traffic in metro networks. The PATN has the potential to provide significant cost savings to carriers by reducing the number of network elements, reducing transport costs through statistical multiplexing, and eliminating the need for redundant <b>multiplexing</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

For the reassembly queue, the results show that LRD traffic and conventional Markov traffic yield similar queueing behavior.

However, the requirement to take maps of the magnetic field, usually by meander-shaped scans, leads to unacceptably long measurement times.
