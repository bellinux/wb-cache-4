5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. The second-floor {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams. It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick and <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took {{full advantage of the}} term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of civic}} {{redevelopment}} {{of the market}} area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along {{either side of the}} memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.|$|E
5|$|Built on {{a shallow}} slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ridge above {{the valley of}} Khoumane (Xuman). It overlooks a rolling fertile plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been {{inhabited}} {{at least since the}} Late Atlantic Neolithic, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia. By the third century BC, the Phoenicians had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language. The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Berber word Walilt, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley.|$|E

Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery.

5|$|Dirleton Castle <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rocky outcrop, at {{the heart}} of the rich {{agricultural}} lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|In Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though her temples also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|E

5|$|Other notable {{buildings}} {{include the}} Nunnery, Dunster Watermill, Dovecote and the Priory barn, which belonged to Dunster Priory. Dunster Working Watermill (also known as Castle Mill) is a restored 18th century watermill, {{situated on the}} River Avill, close to Gallox Bridge, in the grounds of Dunster Castle. It is a Grade II* listed building. The mill <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour. The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels.

5|$|The Ogle County Courthouse is a National Register of Historic Places listing in the Ogle County, Illinois, {{county seat}} of Oregon. The {{building}} <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> public {{square in the}} city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, {{one of which was}} destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tall, narrow pedestal in Portland stone that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.|$|E

5|$|The pediments are {{decorated}} with the figure of Narayana riding {{on the back of}} a garuda, this figure symbolizes kingship and the king's association with the Hindu deity. According to legend Narayana descended from heaven in human form to help mankind by alleviating them from suffering. Thus the deity represents all the ideal qualities in a king. The throne hall <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high base with convex and concave moldings. The bottom layer, according to Thai beliefs resembles a lion's foot, the lion is a symbol of the Buddha's family and alludes to the Buddha's own royal heritage.|$|E
5|$|The temple <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> terrace raised {{higher than}} the city. It is made of three {{rectangular}} galleries rising to a central tower, each level {{higher than the}} last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a gopura {{at each of the}} points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a quincunx with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
