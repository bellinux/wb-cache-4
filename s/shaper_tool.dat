40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a prism-based pulse shaping setup {{that enables the}} shaping of ultrashort pulses with octave-spanning spectra. In contrast to gratings prisms allow for a high throughput and large bandwidths. The second-order dispersion of the prism material is precompensated by a fused silica prism sequence while higher dispersion orders are compensated by the pulse <b>shaper.</b> This flexible <b>tool</b> for dispersion compensation enables us to generate the shortest pulses ever achieved directly from an oscillator. The resulting pulse is almost transform-limited and shows a clean temporal profile with very low background. We assess the performance and limitations of the setup both experimentally and by theoretical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to design and}} to determine the inertial moment of the fly wheel, according to the allowed maximum and minimum angular velocity. The advantage of this method is: {{in the same time}} of the dynamic analysis of the the mechanics we can fulfill the design of the fly wheel. With this method, the inertial moment of fly wheel is determined precisely. In the traditional method, first we have to determine the inertial moment of fly wheel, then, make static-dynamic analysis of the mechanism and find out the react force of the connect pair. For example, after work, one first goes home and then has to go shopping. But if we choose not to go home directly, while on the way home in passing do some shopping then go home. Even though it is not the shortest way, but in total we can shave time and rod. It is the same occasion with our design method too. Even though the process of calculation is more complicated than the formal method, but we can determine the reaction on the connect pair at the same time. So that in total decreased the amount of design work. 1 Introductions Flywheel {{is an important part of}} <b>shaper</b> machine <b>tool.</b> Shaping machine's flywheel takes an energy reservoir, or releases using the kinetic energy form the energy storage.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{conventional}} shaper machine {{has been converted}} into a controlled cutting test rig. A specially designed tool holder was attached to the actuating arm of the <b>shaper</b> machine. This <b>tool</b> holder constrained a small group of handsaw teeth designed to machine a groove followed by an adjustable single tooth that machined a specified depth of cut. A work-piece dynamometer was attached to the platform of the shaper machine. The three force transducers that compose the dynamometer were used to measure resultant cutting, thrust and side forces in the relative X, Y and Z axes. These are measured as the single tooth passes through the work-piece. In addition to force measurement, a high speed video camera was utilised to capture footage of the chip/surface formation where the tooth interacts with the wood work-piece. The recorded forces and captured footage of chip formation validate published findings that machining along the wood grain is a shearing process and machining across wood the grain is a bending process...|$|R
40|$|Network {{performance}} metrics such as delay variations and {{packet loss}} influence {{the performance of}} the network. As a consequence, the performance of applications on the network is also affected as most of the networked applications existing today are very much sensitive to the network performance. Therefore it is of utmost importance to test the intensity of such network level disturbances on the performance of applications. A network traffic shaper/emulator shapes the network traffic in terms of these performance metrics to test such applications in a controlled environment. Most of the traffic shapers existing today give the instantaneous step transition in delay and packet loss on network. In this work, we present time-controlled network traffic <b>shaper,</b> a <b>tool</b> that facilitates testing and experimentation of network traffic through emulation. It focuses on time variant behavior of the traffic shaper. A linear transition of delay and packet loss that is varying with respect to time may fits much better to the real network scenarios instead of an instantaneous step transition in delay and packet loss. This work illustrates the emulation capabilities of time-controlled network traffic shaper and presents its design architecture. Several approaches are analyzed to do the task {{and one of them is}} followed to develop the desired architecture of the shaper. The shaper is implemented in a small scenario and is tested to see whether the desired output is achieved or not. The shortfalls in the design of the shaper are also discussed. Results are presented that show the output from the shaper in graphical form. Although the current implementation of the shaper does not provide linear or exponential output but this can be achieved by implementing a configuration setting that is comprised of small transition values that are varying with respect to very small step sizes of time e. g. transitions on milli seconds or micro seconds. The current implementation of the shaper configuration provides the output with a transition of one milli second on every next second. kami 1219 @gmail. co...|$|R
2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a <b>shaper</b> or other <b>tool</b> for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|R
