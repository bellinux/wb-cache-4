25|$|Greenleaf married Baroness Antonia Cornelia Elbertine Scholten van Aschat et Oud-Haarlem in 1788. She was {{a member}} of a {{powerful}} Dutch banking family, and noble-born. Greenleaf said that, in 1796, he and the baroness made love soon after his arrival in Amsterdam. (He made it clear that neither had seduced the other.) When he returned to the United States, he learned she was pregnant. He claims he immediately returned to Amsterdam to marry her, and was told that she had miscarried. The van Aschat family convinced him to marry her anyway, and he did so in 1788. Greenleaf also says that his wife's maid soon revealed that there had been no pregnancy. By this time, the baroness was pregnant, and she gave birth to a son. Greenleaf <b>says</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> later tried to commit suicide, after which he separated from her. During his brief marriage, Greenleaf communicated to Noah Webster how unhappy he was with the baroness. Greenleaf returned to the United States, and a judge in Rhode Island granted him a divorce on September 3, 1796.|$|E

2500|$|Wikileaks has {{published}} individuals' Social Security numbers, medical information, {{and credit card}} numbers. An analysis by the Associated Press found that Wikileaks had {{in one of its}} mass-disclosures published [...] "the personal information of hundreds of people — including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients". Wikileaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia. Some of Wikileaks' cables [...] "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees". An analysis of Wikileaks' Saudi cables [...] "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables — including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who <b>says</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C." [...] Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following Wikileaks' reveal of their Social Security and credit card information. In its leak of DNC e-mails, Wikileaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.|$|E

Now what did that old witch-doctor Harût declare just now? He declared, {{speaking}} for his fetish, that by our help alone the White Kendah can resist the hosts of the Black Kendah and that no harm must be done to us if the White Kendah would continue to live. So it seems, Baas, that we have something to sell which the White Kendah must buy, namely our help against the Black Kendah, for if we will not fight for them, they believe that they cannot conquer their enemies and kill the devil Jana. Well now, supposing that the Baas says that our price is the white woman dressed like a bird, to be delivered over to us when we have defeated the Black Kendah and killed Jana--after which they will have no more use for her. And supposing that the Baas says that if they refuse to pay that price we will burn all our powder and cartridges so that the rifles are no use? Is there not a path to walk on here?" ...|$|E

The work transformed Scruggs, <b>says</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> who [...] "went from being a passive person to a very intense, ambitious man." [...] Although Scruggs sometimes {{fell into a deep}} depression due to the constant criticism of the memorial effort and the memorial's design, he overcame the depression by calling up the memory of his 12 dead friends and by reading letters to the foundation written by veterans and their families.|$|E

Peggy believes she is far more conventionally attractive than she is, from believing she could win a beauty contest hands down, to thinking herself on par with Bobby's girlfriend. Comically, each time she says something to this effect, Hank makes a befuddled expression.|$|E

Lassiter <b>says</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> believes that he does not want children, although this is not the case. Omundson says that, despite Lassiter's long estrangement from his wife, it would likely be very hard for him to admit that the marriage is over because [...] "that means admitting failure, and Lassiter will never admit to failure." [...] During the pilot, Lassiter is involved in a secret romance with his partner, Detective Lucinda Barry (Anne Dudek); however, soon after Shawn Spencer publicly exposes the nature of their relationship, Barry is transferred and the affair appears to have ended.
