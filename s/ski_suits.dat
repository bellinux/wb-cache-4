Among her fashions at the showing included a gray flannel <b>ski</b> <b>suit</b> with white leather suspenders and gold buckles. Borea introduced amber, mouse gray, and moss green corduroy box jackets over tweed suits or simple turtleneck wool dresses.

50|$|The first {{environmental}} suits were {{diving suits}} {{designed to protect}} a diver from the surrounding water (see timeline of underwater technology). Later developments were {{designed to protect the}} wearer from the cold (for example wetsuits and other ambient pressure suits) or from undersea high pressure and the resulting decompression sickness (for example atmospheric diving suits).

5000|$|Avalanche {{transceivers}} or avalanche beacons are a {{class of}} active radio beacon transceivers operating at 457 kHz and specialized {{for the purpose of}} finding people or equipment buried under snow. When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transceiver is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power pulsed beacon signal during the trip. [...] Following an avalanche, and if the holder of the transceiver is safe and has not themselves been caught by the avalanche, they may switch the transceiver from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a radio direction finding device to search for signals coming from other skiers' transmitter beacons who may be trapped. A 457 kHz beacon is an active device that requires batteries. A <b>ski</b> <b>suit</b> may also contain a passive RECCO transponder sewn into the clothing.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner is}} decided with a scoring {{system based on}} distance, style, inrun length, gate factor and wind conditions.

Sometimes, the suit has built-in suspenders on the inside for added support. One-piece <b>ski</b> <b>suits</b> are often just made as a shell layer, with the skier adding warm underwear of own choice adapted to the current weather situation. Other suits may be padded for warmth, but when intended for skiing they are still not as insulated as a snowmobile suit.|$|E

50|$|A ski suit {{can either}} be one-piece, {{in the form of}} a jumpsuit, or two-piece, {{in the form of a}} ski jacket and {{matching}} trousers, called salopettes or ski pants. A ski suit is made from wind- and water-resistant or waterproof fabric, and has a non-removable liner made of nylon, silk, cotton or taffeta. Its main function is to keep a person warm while participating in winter sports, especially Nordic (cross-country) or Alpine (down-hill) skiing. It is generally a unisex garment. A ski suit is meant to be worn with a base layer, which consists of long johns and a warm shirt, usually designed for skiing. <b>Ski</b> <b>suits</b> are often made of Gore-Tex or similar materials. They are often in the form of a shell suit, to which the skier adds more or less warm underwear depending on the weather. Pockets are usually made to be waterproof, so items put in them should stay dry.|$|E
5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a {{one-piece}} fabric bodysuit {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a <b>ski</b> <b>suit.</b> It is composed of five layers and is both loose-fitting and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of slack is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive bagginess and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of slack for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|R

50|$|Often {{referred}} to as race suits or speed suits, these are the suits worn by professional and junior racers to improve their speed. They are mostly made as one-piece suits. Made mostly of Polyurethane (85-90%) and Polyester (15-10%), these suits can reduce wind resistance {{by as much as}} fifty percent. Since wind resistance accounts for ninety five percent of the force stopping skiers from going faster, wearing one of these suits can potentially give you nearly double the speed. They are very tight and form hugging and can take a while to adapt to the body. Olympic athletes can reach over 160 km/h in a race suit, while even a junior racer may struggle to get past 80 km/h without one. Suit costs range from $210 for a beginners suit to $1,200 for the suits generally worn by Olympic athletes. <b>Ski</b> <b>suits</b> are not unisex garments due to the need to be skin tight and must be sized properly to be effective. Most athletes wear a base layer beneath their suit, but some may wear only the suit on race days, as the base layer will decrease the efficiency of the suit slightly.|$|E
40|$|Advancements {{of science}} and {{technology}} have progressively been introduced in speed sports especially in ski jumping. AerodYnanJics plays a pivotal role in the overall performance of ski jumping. In ski jumping, the skier body position, ski, ski jumping suit and other associated gears- all play a combined role in the flight trajectory of the ski jumper (skier). Although some studies have been conducted on the skier&# 039;s body and ski positions, scant or no study on aerodynamic behaviour of the <b>ski</b> <b>suits</b> and skier has been reported in the open literature. Therefore, a comprehensive study on aerodynamics of <b>ski</b> <b>suits</b> is required to understand the role of <b>ski</b> <b>suits</b> and skier in ski jumping. A full scale testing along with all gears is extremely important to understand the aerodynamics of skier and <b>ski</b> <b>suits.</b> The primary objectives of this study are to design and develop a full scale experimental setup and evaluate the aerodynamic performance of skier and ski jumping suits along with skies, boots, goggles, helmet and gloves. The full scale experimental setup can not only be used to measure the aerodynamic properties of the ski jumping suits and skier but also {{can be used as a}} training simulator...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of exposure to cold and warm environments on performance-related variables in cross country skiers, wearing standardized skiing clothing. We hypothesized that reducing ambient temperature, skin temperatures will gradually decrease despite increasing core temperature. In addition we hypothesized that the optimal ambient temperature for aerobe endurance performance with the existing cross country <b>skiing</b> <b>suit</b> would be at temperatures around 0 ºC. Methods: Nine highly trained male endurance athletes performed one pre-test at 20 °C (± 0. 1) and six main tests under controlled ambient temperatures at - 14 °C (± 0. 2), - 9 °C (± 0. 1), - 4 °C (± 0. 1), 1 °C (± 0. 2), 10 °C (± 0. 1) and 20 °C (± 0. 1). Tests consisted of running on a treadmill with an inclination of 10. 5 % and a wind speed at 5. 5 m·sek- 1. The exercise protocol consisted of a 10 min warm up phase (60 % of maximal oxygen consumption), a submaximal phase with four steps of 5 minutes with an intensity between 67 - 91 % of maximal oxygen consumption, and a maximal phase, running to exhaustion. Skin temperatures, rectal temperature, time to exhaustion, oxygen consumption, heart rate, blood lactate, loss of body mass, perceived strain and perceived thermal sensation were measured during the tests. Results: Mean skin temperature decreased significantly with reduced ambient temperatures, despite an increase in rectal temperature. Time to exhaustion was significantly longer at - 4 °C and 1 °C than at - 14 °C, 10 °C and 20 °C. Running speed at lactate threshold was significantly higher at - 4 °C than at - 9 °C, 10 °C and 20 °C. Submaximal oxygen consumption was significantly higher at 10 °C and 20 °C than the other ambient conditions, but no significant difference in VO 2 max between the ambient conditions were found. Conclusion: The results of the present study indicates an optimal aerobe endurance performance with the existing cross country <b>skiing</b> <b>suit</b> at - 4 ºC and 1 ºC. At higher (10 °C and 20 °C) and lower (- 14 °C and - 9 °C) ambient temperatures the aerobe endurance performance was impaired...|$|R
