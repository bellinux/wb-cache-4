50|$|Since 1992, {{weight and}} axles limits for goods {{carrying}} lorries in the United Kingdom had increased in stages from 38 t and 5 axles. , vehicles {{are limited to}} a maximum of 6 axles, and limited to an overall maximum weight of 44 t and 16.5 m in length for articulated lorries, and 44 t and 18.75 m <b>for</b> <b>drawbar</b> lorries.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{conservation}} tillage systems, belowground soil disruption should be maximized while aboveground disruption should be minimized. To assist {{in choosing the}} best <b>shank</b> <b>for</b> strip-tillage systems, comparisons among several shanks commonly used to provide in-row subsoiling prior to planting in conservation systems were made. A three-dimensional dynamometer measured draft, vertical, and side forces for the experiments, which were conducted in the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory soil bins in Auburn, Alabama. A portable tillage profiler measured both above- and belowground soil disruption. Two parameters, spoil resistance index and trench specific resistance, were developed from the data to assess draft force, aboveground soil disruption and belowground soil disruption. Based on these selection criteria, the two best <b>shanks</b> <b>for</b> {{conservation tillage}} systems were the Bigham Brothers Paratill shank and the Worksaver Terramax shank, {{both of which were}} bentleg shanks...|$|R

40|$|Gyroscopes {{have been}} {{proposed}} as sensors for ambulatory gait analysis and functional electrical stimulation systems. These applications often require detection of the initial contact (IC) of the foot with the floor and/or final contact or foot off (FO) from the floor during outdoor walking. Previous investigations have reported {{the use of a}} single gyroscope placed on the <b>shank</b> <b>for</b> detection of IC and FO on level ground and incline walking. This paper describes the evaluation of a gyroscope placed on the <b>shank</b> <b>for</b> determination of IC and FO in subjects ascending and descending a set of stairs. Performance was compared with a reference pressure measurement system. The absolute mean difference between the gyroscope and the reference was less than 45 ms for IC and better than 135 ms for FO for both activities. Detection success was over 93 %. These results provide preliminary evidence supporting the use of a gyroscope for gait event detection when walking up and down stairs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aboveground soil {{disruption}} {{prior to}} planting is not wanted in conservation tillage systems {{due to the}} need to keep plant residue in place. However, belowground disruption is necessary in many Southeastern U. S. soils to ameliorate soil compaction problems. To assist in choosing the best <b>shank</b> <b>for</b> strip-tillage systems which accomplish both objectives, comparisons were made between several <b>shanks</b> commonly used <b>for</b> conservation tillage systems to provide in-row subsoiling prior to planting. A three-dimensional dynamometer was used to measure draft, vertical, and side forces for experiments conducted in the soil bins of the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, AL. A portable tillage profiler was used to measure both above- and belowground soil disruption. For use in conservation tillage systems, belowground soil disruption should be maximized while aboveground disruption should be minimized. Two parameters, spoil resistance index and trench specific resistance, were defined in the paper to consider the effect of draft force, aboveground soil disruption and belowground soil disruption. The two best <b>shanks</b> <b>for</b> conservation tillage systems based on these selection criteria are the BBP shank and the BWT shank, which are both bentleg shanks from different manufacturers...|$|R
