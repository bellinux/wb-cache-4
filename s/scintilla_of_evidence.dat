40|$|Evolution {{pretends to}} be biology but it plays us for fools because it {{provides}} no successful experimental documentation. Let’s {{see if there is}} one <b>scintilla</b> <b>of</b> scientific <b>evidence</b> to support evolution. Most biology textbooks show a glass apparatus in which the precursors for amino acids were boiled and electrically sparked for a week, and sure enough, there were trace amounts of a few amino acids. The implication is that if similar, unthinking processes were continued, then a living cell would evolve. Such logic is like stating that automobiles evolved long ago by means of rubber sap, sand, iron ore, and coal falling into a volcano. The iron ore and the carbon in the coal made steel, the sand melted and made glass, and the sap vulcanized and made rubber. Then after billions and billions of trials and errors, the text may say, there evolved spontaneously better and better pistons, cylinders, whole engines with spark plugs and transmissions, axles on four wheels with rubber tires under bodies of steel with glass windows, windshield wipers, headlights, and tanks full of gasoline.

5000|$|And again, to {{the same}} correspondent, May 6, 1863: I have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and {{disposition}} the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school.

So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines?

40|$|Following {{the speech}} act theory, we take {{hypotheses}} and assertions as linguistic acts with different illocutionary forces. We {{assume that a}} hypothesis is justified if {{there is at least}} a <b>scintilla</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for the truth of its propositional content, while an assertion is justified when there is conclusive evidence that its propositional content is true. Here we extend the logical treatment for assertions given by Dalla Pozza and Garola (1995, Erkenntnis, 43, 81 – 109) by outlining a pragmatic logic for assertions and hypotheses. On the basis of this extension we analyse the standard logical opposition relations for assertions and hypotheses. We formulate a pragmatic square of oppositions for assertions and a hexagon of oppositions for hypotheses. Finally, we give a mixed hexagon of oppositions to point out the opposition relations for assertions and hypothese...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a "polarized" version of bi-intuitionistic logic [5, 2, 6, 4] as a logic of assertions and hypotheses {{and show that}} it supports a "rich proof theory" and an interesting categorical interpretation, unlike the standard approach of C. Rauszer's Heyting-Brouwer logic [28, 29], whose categorical models are all partial orders by Crolard's theorem [8]. We show that P. A. Melliès notion of chirality [21, 22] appears as the right mathematical representation of the mirror symmetry between the intuitionistic and co-intuitionistc sides of polarized bi-intuitionism. Philosophically, we extend Dalla Pozza and Garola's pragmatic interpretation of intuitionism as a logic of assertions [10] to bi-intuitionism as a logic of assertions and hypotheses. We focus on the logical role of illocutionary forces and justification conditions {{in order to provide}} "intended interpretations" of logical systems that classify inferential uses in natural language and remain acceptable from an intuitionistic point of view. Although Dalla Pozza and Garola originally provide a constructive interpretation of intuitionism in a classical setting, we claim that some conceptual refinements suffice to make their "pragmatic interpretation" a bona fide representation of intuitionism. We sketch a meaning-asuse interpretation of co-intuitionism that seems to fulfil the requirements of Dummett and Prawitz's justificationist approach. We extend the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation to bi-intuitionism by regarding co-intuitionistic formulas as types of the evidence for them: if conclusive evidence is needed to justify assertions, only a <b>scintilla</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> suffices to justify hypotheses...|$|E
