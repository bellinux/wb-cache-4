40|$|The {{existence}} of a mucilaginous envelope, sheath or capsule is usual in many desmids, but few data concerning its function are available. Previous studies of the transport function and permeation of molecules through the algae capsules were done using the algae Spondylosium panduriforme and Nephrocytium lunatum, the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) technique, and different <b>spin</b> <b>labels.</b> The results suggested that the capsule functions as a selective diffusion medium. In the present work charged and uncharged molecules (<b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group A) and Staurastrum iversenii var. americanum (Desmids),whose alga presents a great mucilaginous capsule, were used. Charged nitroxide molecules similar to amino acids (<b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group B) were also used allowing {{a better understanding of}} the electrostatic effect in the permeation process across the capsule. The role of the cell capsule in the solute diffusion was evaluated by determining the capsulated and decapsulated cell permeation times. The permeation times for all <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> tested in the cells lacking capsules were always shorter than those containing this physical barrier. The decay times of <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group A observed for S. iversenii were compared to other studied algae. The results regarding the diffusion of charged <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group B suggested that the interaction of cell capsule occurs more strongly with negatively charged molecules than with positively charged ones. The results obtained in this work with <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group A confirm that the capsule is an essential structure for the cell, and that due to the polar interactions with the <b>spin</b> <b>labels,</b> it plays an important role in the selection of small molecules. Several parameters, mainly those of electrostatic nature, seem to control the permeation across the algal capsules of <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> group B, showing that structures which are similar to amino acids could diffuse across the interior of the algal cell.

50|$|In {{lamellar}} lipid bilayers, polar headgroups of lipids align {{together at}} the interface of water and hydrophobic fatty-acid acyl chains align {{parallel to one another}} 'hiding away' from water.

40|$|Velocity-selective (VS) {{arterial}} <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> is {{a promising}} method for measuring perfusion {{in areas of}} slow or collateral flow by eliminating the bolus arrival delay associated with other <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> techniques. However, B 0 and B 1 inhomogeneities and eddy currents during the VS preparation hinder accurate quantification of perfusion with VS arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling.</b> In this study, it is demonstrated through simulations and experiments in healthy volunteers that eddy currents cause erroneous tagging of static tissue.

50|$|In {{biological}} membranes, gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play {{a critical}} role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds. Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, flouorescence, <b>spin</b> <b>label</b> electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures. A simple method for its determination from 13-C NMR line intensities has also been proposed.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{approaches}} {{used to measure}} the relative affinity of lipids binding to specific membrane proteins. These involve the use of lipid analogues in reconstituted phospholipid vesicles containing the protein of interest: 1) Spin-labeled phospholipids are motionally restricted when they are adjacent to membrane proteins. The result is a component in the ESR spectrum which is broadened. The experimental spectrum can be analyzed as the sum of the two components, a rapidly tumbling species in the [...] "bulk" [...] lipid phase with a sharp spectrum, and a motionally restricted component adjacent to the protein. Membrane protein denaturation causes further broadening of ESR <b>spin</b> <b>label</b> spectrum and throws more light on membrane lipid-proteins interactions 2) Spin-labeled and brominated lipid derivatives are able to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from membrane proteins. The efficiency of quenching depends on the distance between the lipid derivative and the fluorescent tryptophans.|$|E
5000|$|Site-directed spin {{labeling}} (SDSL) was pioneered in {{the laboratory}} of Dr. W.L. Hubbell. [...] In SDSL, sites for attachment of spin labels are introduced into recombinantly expressed proteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Functional groups contained within the <b>spin</b> <b>label</b> determine their specificity. At neutral pH, protein thiol groups specifically react with the functional groups methanethiosulfonate, maleimide, and iodoacetamide, creating a covalent bond with the amino acid Cys. [...] Spin labels are a unique molecular reporter, {{in that they are}} paramagnetic (contain an unpaired electron). Spin labels were first synthesized {{in the laboratory}} of H. M. McConnell in 1965. [...] Since then, a variety of nitroxide spin labels have enjoyed widespread use for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics because of their stability and simple EPR signal. The nitroxyl radical (N-O) is usually incorporated into a heterocyclic ring (e.g. pyrrolidine), and the unpaired electron is predominantly localized to the N-O bond. Once incorporated into the protein, a spin label's motions are dictated by its local environment. Because spin labels are exquisitely sensitive to motion, this has profound effects on its EPR spectrum.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{structural}} {{organization of}} the functionally relevant, hexameric oligomer of green-absorbing proteorhodopsin (G-PR) was obtained from double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy utilizing conventional nitroxide <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> and recently developed Gd 3 +-based <b>spin</b> <b>labels.</b> G-PR with nitroxide or Gd 3 + labels was prepared using cysteine mutations at residues Trp 58 and Thr 177. By combining reliable measurements of multiple interprotein distances in the G-PR hexamer with computer modeling, we obtained a structural model that agrees with the recent crystal structure of the homologous blue-absorbing PR (B-PR) hexamer. These DEER results provide specific distance information in a membrane-mimetic environment and across loop regions that are unresolved in the crystal structure. In addition, the X-band DEER measurements using nitroxide <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> suffered from multispin effects that, at times, compromised the detection of next-nearest neighbor distances. Performing measurements at high magnetic fields with Gd 3 + <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> increased the sensitivity considerably and alleviated the difficulties caused by multispin interactions...|$|R
40|$|The Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER) is an {{innovative}} technique that allows {{to measure the}} distance distribution between two <b>spin</b> <b>labels</b> within a range of 2 - 8 nm. This technique does not require crystalline samples, thus {{it is possible to}} determine the position of two different <b>spin</b> <b>labelled</b> domains of intrinsically flexible macromolecular systems. Our idea is to determinate the structural details of the intermediate conformers of human neuroserpin (hNS) by DEER. hNS is a protein that in the native state is folded in a metastable conformation. In particular conditions, hNS can either adopt a more stable conformation with the reactive centre loop (RCL) inserted into a β-sheet (latent conformer) or insert the RCL into the β-sheet of a neighbour hNS molecule thus forming dimers or polymers (polymeric conformers). This research project requires the production of <b>spin</b> <b>labelled</b> hNS with both a single and a double cysteine mutation via Site-Directed <b>Spin</b> <b>Labelling</b> (SDSL). We have already performed a first preliminary experiment on native hNS <b>spin</b> <b>labelled</b> at positions 157 and 296 (see Figure 1).

40|$|Cerebral blood flow-dependent phase {{differences}} between tagged and control arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> images are reported. A biophysical model {{is presented to}} explain the vascular origin of this difference. Arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> data indicated that the phase difference is largest when the arterial component of the signals is preserved but is greatly reduced as the arterial con-tribution is suppressed by postinversion delays or flow-crush-ing gradients. Arterial vasculature imaging by saturation data of activation and hypercapnia conditions showed increases in phase accompanying blood flow increases. An arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> functional magnetic resonance im-aging study yielded significant activation by magnitude-only, phase-only, and complex analyses when preserving the whole arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> signal. After suppression of the arterial signal by postinversion delays, magnitude-only and complex models yielded similar activation levels, but the phase-only model detected nearly no activation. When flow crushers were used for arterial suppression, magnitude-only activation was slightly lower and fluctuations in phase were dramatically higher than when postinversion delays were used. Although the complex analysis performed did not improve detection, a simulation study indicated that the complex-valued activation model exhibits combined magnitude and phase de-tection power and thus maximizes sensitivity under ideal con-ditions. This suggests that, as arterial <b>spin</b> <b>labeling</b> imaging and image correction methods develop, the complex-valued detec-tion model may become helpful in signal detection. Magn Re...|$|R
