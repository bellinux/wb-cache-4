Colletotrichum (teleomorph Glomerella) is a fungus widely cited in the literature as a producer of antimicrobial <b>substances.</b> <b>Identification</b> at the species level, however, has been a problem in this type of study. Several authors have reported the presence of endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia (espinheira-santa) in Brazil that has antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. Therefore, Colletotrichum strains were isolated from M. ilicifolia and identified based on morphology, RAPD markers, sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS- 1 and ITS- 2), the 5. 8 S gene, and species-specific PCR. The analyses suggested the presence of 2 species, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum boninense. Two morphological markers were characterized to allow C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense to be distinguished quickly and accurately.

Levels of GA 10 increased with time, and since no GA 10 was produced during the purification procedures, GA 10 was, in all probability, produced from 3 H-GA 9 within the plant tissue. The radioactive interconversion products produced by pea from 3 H-GA 9 have chromatographic properties similar to biologically active GA-like substances present in etiolated shoots of dwarf pea.

This highly sensitive optical assay operates similarly to e-noses and e-tongues which combine semi-specific sensors and multivariate data analysis for monitoring biochemical processes. The optical assay consists of a mixture of environmental-sensitive fluorescent dyes and human skin cells that generate fluorescence spectra patterns distinctive for particular physico-chemical and physiological conditions. Using chemometric techniques the optical signal is processed providing qualitative information about analytical characteristics of the samples. This integrated approach has been successfully applied (with sensitivity of 93 % and specificity of 97 %) in assessing whether particular chemical agents are irritating or not for human skin.

Decreasing the spectral resolution allows us to exclude from consideration this small-scale modulation of the signal as well as to detect the water vapor absorption frequencies. This fact is important in practice because it allows us to increase the signal processing rate. In order to increase the detection reliability, it is advisable to decrease the spectral resolution up to values of not more than 40 % of the corresponding spectral line bandwidth.

40|$|Although <b>substance</b> <b>identification</b> is a {{key factor}} in {{analytical}} toxicology, it is amazing that the subject is receiving very limited and often inappropriate attention. With regard to the latter, a "confirmation" approach is usually chosen, which does not yield unambiguous identification. Moreover, the criteria for establishing a "positive match" leave much to be desired. These observations are corroborated when comparing some recent guidelines for qualitative analysis (issued for various forensic areas by SOFT/AAFS, NCCLS, NLCP, WADA and EU). Apart from showing substantial differences between them on pivotal issues, the guidelines contain various elements that appear scientifically incorrect and/or legally untenable. Also, the guidelines focus primarily on mass spectrometry (MS) and pay little or no attention to other identification possibilities (such as chromatographic techniques, either in combination with MS or as stand-alone techniques. Moreover, they do not offer alternatives in situations where access to MS is not available. One must conclude, therefore, that <b>substance</b> <b>identification</b> is a neglected and misunderstood domain in analytical toxicology. Rapid and concerted actions are needed to: (1) improve the general knowledge; (2) to define uniform strategies in the analytical approach and in the interpretation of the results; and (3) to set up and maintain suitable banks of reference substances and computerized data bases to allow unambiguous identification.

We developed a matrix, which enables a physiological co-culture of hepatocytes (HC) and endothelial cells (EC) in long-term culture. Basis is a vascularised scaffold which admits extra cellular matrix contact to the HC and provides a blood vessel network for EC co-culture and mass transport. Methods: The matrix consists of an acellularized jejunal segment with an obtained vascular system. The vascular system is reseeded with porcine progenitor cells from bone marrow aspirate. After 7 - 14 days of culture HC in a collagengel suspension are seeded on the matrix lumen. During the cultivation period the matrix is perfused with medium in a bioreactor. The flow rate is controlled via PC to simulate in vivo blood flow. Results: Progenitor cells were successfully seeded in the vascular bed of the matrix. After 4 weeks they are vital and express EC specific markers. Vital HC could be efficiently populated {{on the surface of}} the lumen and partially migrate in the matrix.

40|$|Background Genetic {{influences}} {{contribute significantly}} to co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders. Estimating the extent of overlap can assist {{in the development of}} phenotypes for genomic analyses. Method Multivariate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted using data from 9577 individuals, including 3982 complete twin pairs and 1613 individuals whose co-twin was not interviewed (aged 24 – 37 years) from two Australian twin samples. Analyses examined the genetic correlation between alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence {{and the extent to which}} the correlations were attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder. Results Additive genetic (a 2 = 0. 48 – 0. 65) and non-shared environmental factors explained variance in substance use disorders. Familial effects on conduct disorder were due to additive genetic (a 2 = 0. 39) and shared environmental (c 2 = 0. 15) factors. All substance use disorders were influenced by shared genetic factors (rg = 0. 38 – 0. 56), with all genetic overlap between substances attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder. Genes influencing individual substance use disorders were also significant, explaining 40 – 73 % of the genetic variance per substance. Conclusions Among substance users in this sample, the well-documented clinical co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders is primarily attributable to shared genetic liability. Interventions targeted at generally reducing deviant behaviors may address the risk posed by this shared genetic liability. However, there is also evidence for genetic and environmental influences specific to each <b>substance.</b> The <b>identification</b> of these substance-specific risk factors (as well as potential protective factors) is critical to the future development of targeted treatment protocols...|$|R
