50|$|While {{it has yet}} to {{have been}} studied {{in-depth}} in the human brain, the SVZ function in the rodent brain has been, to a certain extent, examined and defined for its abilities. With such research, it has been found that the dual-functioning astrocyte is the dominant cell in the rodent SVZ; this astrocyte acts as not only a neuronal stem cell, but also as a <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> that promotes neurogenesis through interaction with other cells. This function is also induced by microglia and endothelial cells that interact cooperatively with neuronal stem cells to promote neurogenesis in vitro, as well as extracellular matrix components such as tenascin-C (helps define boundaries for interaction) and Lewis X (binds growth and signaling factors to neural precursors). The human SVZ is different, however, from the rodent SVZ in two distinct ways; the first is that the astrocytes of humans are not in close juxtaposition to the ependymal layer, rather separated by a layer lacking cell bodies; the second is that the human SVZ lacks chains of migrating neuroblasts seen in rodent SVZ, in turn providing for a lesser number of neuronal cells in the human than the rodent. For this reason, while rodent SVZ proves as a valuable source of information regarding the SVZ and its structure-to-function relationship, the human model will prove significantly different.|$|E

40|$|The {{vomeronasal organ}} (VNO) is a chemosensory {{structure}} {{involved in the}} detection of pheromones in most mammals.

40|$|AbstractStem {{cells and}} their daughters are often {{associated}} with and depend on cues from their cellular microenvironment. In Drosophila testes, each Germline Stem Cell (GSC) contacts apical hub cells and is enclosed by cytoplasmic extensions from two Cyst Stem Cells (CySCs). Each GSC daughter becomes enclosed by cytoplasmic extensions from two CySC daughters, called cyst cells. CySC fate depends on an Unpaired (Upd) signal from the hub cells, which activates the Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway in the stem cells. Germline enclosure depends on Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signals from the germline to the somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells.</b> Expression of RNA-hairpins against subunits of the COnstitutively Photomorphogenic- 9 - (COP 9 -) signalosome (CSN) in somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells</b> disrupted germline enclosure. Furthermore, CSN-depleted somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells</b> in the CySC position next to the hub had reduced levels of the Jak/STAT effectors Zinc finger homeotic- 1 (Zfh- 1) and Chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis (Chinmo). Knockdown of CSN in the somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells</b> does not disrupt EGF and Upd signal transduction as downstream signal transducers, phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT) and phosphorylated Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK), were still localized to the somatic <b>support</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei. The CSN modifies fully formed Cullin RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes to regulate selective proteolysis. Reducing cullin 2 (cul 2) from the somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells</b> disrupted germline enclosure, while reducing cullin 1 (cul 1) from the somatic <b>support</b> <b>cells</b> led to {{a low level of}} Chinmo.

Without sound trauma, there were, on average, six <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> divisions per day in the basilar papilla of Waterslager canaries. This rate of <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation corresponds well with estimates of the rate of hair cell differentiation derived from counts of immature-appearing hair cells obtained by using scanning electron microscopy of the Waterslager basilar papilla. Thus, <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> division appeared correlated with hair cell differentiation in Waterslager canaries. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling of cells in undamaged non-Waterslager canaries also indicated a very low rate of <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> division. In contrast with Waterslager canaries, this low rate of proliferation {{was not associated with}} a measurable rate of hair cell differentiation. In both normal and Waterslager canaries, exposure to traumatizing sound induced a dramatic increase in the rate of cell proliferation.

Only an increase above this low ambient rate of <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, such as that following loss of hair cells, induces the differentiation of new hair cells in birds.

Although these supporting cells {{are considered to}} develop from common bipotential precursors, recent evidence suggests that distinct <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> populations {{are present in the}} ovary, with one providing granulosa cells of the medullary follicles and the other providing granulosa cells of the cortical follicles, the latter of which support lifelong fertility. Here, we demonstrate that XX fetal gonads contain GATA 4 expressing supporting cells that either enter mitotic arrest, or remain proliferative. Blocking WNT signalling reduces XX <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, while stabilising Î²-catenin signalling promotes proliferation, indicating that the renewal of pre-granulosa cells is dependent on WNT/Î²-catenin signalling in the proliferative <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> population. In contrast, XX supporting cells express p 27 and FOXL 2 and are maintained in mitotic arrest. Although FOXL 2 is required for maintaining high levels of p 27 expression, it is dispensable for entry and maintenance of mitotic arrest in XX supporting cells. Combined our data suggest that both medullary and cortical precursors arise from a common GATA 4 expressing cell type. In addition, this work indicates that a balance between <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> self-renewal and differentiation is maintained in the developing ovary by relative WNT/Î²-catenin and p 27 /FOXL 2 activities.

40|$|Sensorineural hearing {{deficiencies}} {{result from}} the loss of auditory hair cells. This hearing loss is permanent in humans and mammals because hair cells are not spontaneously replaced. In other animals such as birds, this is not the case. Damage to the avian cochlea evokes proliferation of supporting cells and the generation of functionally competent replacement hair cells. Signal transduction pathways are clinically useful as potential therapeutic targets, so there is significant interest in identifying the key signal transduction pathways that regulate the formation of replacement hair cells. In a previous study from our lab, we showed that forskolin (FSK) treatment induces auditory <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and formation of replacement hair cells in the absence of sound or aminoglycoside treatment. Here, we show that FSK-induced <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation is mediated by cell-specific accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in avian supporting cells and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. By a combination of immunostaining and pharmacological analyses, we show that FSK treatment increases cAMP levels in avian auditory supporting cells and that several ERK MAP inhibitors effectively block FSK-induced <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. Next, we demonstrate by Western blotting and immunostaining analyses the expression of several ERK MAPK signaling molecules in the avian auditory epithelium and the cell-specific expression of B-Raf in avian auditory supporting cells.

Chick utricles were cultured in media supplemented with the ototoxic antibiotic neomycin and selected pharmacological agents that influence signaling molecules in cell death pathways. Hair cells that were treated with neomycin exhibited classically defined apoptotic morphologies such as condensed nuclei and fragmented DNA. Inhibition of protein synthesis (via treatment with cycloheximide) increased hair cell survival after treatment with neomycin, suggesting that hair cell death requires de novo protein synthesis. Finally, the inhibition of caspases promoted hair cell survival after neomycin treatment.

After losing their bundles, sublethally damaged hair cells remain in the sensory epithelium for prolonged periods, acquiring supporting cell-like morphology and immunoreactivity. These modes of damage appear to be mutually exclusive, implying that sublethally damaged hair cells repair their bundles. Transitional cells, coexpressing hair cell and <b>supporting</b> <b>cell</b> markers, are seen near scar formations created by the expansion of neighboring supporting cells. Most of these cells have morphology and immunoreactivity similar to that of sublethally damaged hair cells. Ultrastructural analysis also reveals that most immature hair cells had autophagic vacuoles, implying that they originated from damaged hair cells rather than supporting cells. Some transitional cells are supporting cells participating in scar formations. Supporting cells also decrease in number during hair cell recovery, supporting the conclusion that some supporting cells undergo phenotypic conversion into hair cells without an intervening mitotic event...|$|E
40|$|Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} is most {{commonly}} {{caused by the}} death of hair cells in the organ of Corti, and once lost, mammalian hair cells do not regenerate. In contrast, other vertebrates such as birds can regenerate hair cells by stimulating division and differentiation of neighboring <b>supporting</b> <b>cells.</b> We currently know little of the genetic networks which become active in <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> when hair cells die and that are activated in experimental models of hair cell regeneration [...] Several studies have shown that neonatal mammalian cochlear <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> are able to trans-differentiate into hair cells when cultured in conditions in which the Notch signaling pathway is blocked. We now show that the ability of cochlear <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> to trans-differentiate declines precipitously after birth, such that <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> from six-day-old mouse cochlea are entirely unresponsive to a blockade of the Notch pathway. We show that this trend is seen regardless of whether the Notch pathway is blocked with gamma secretase inhibitors, or by antibodies against the Notch 1 receptor, suggesting that the action of gamma secretase inhibitors on neonatal <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> is likely to be by inhibiting Notch receptor cleavage. The loss of responsiveness to inhibition of the Notch pathway in the first postnatal week {{is due in part to}} a down-regulation of Notch receptors and ligands, and we show that this down-regulation persists in the adult animal, even under conditions of noise damage. Our data suggest that the Notch pathway is used to establish the repeating pattern of hair <b>cells</b> and <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> in the organ of Corti, but is not required to maintain this cellular mosaic once the production of hair <b>cells</b> and <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> is completed. Our results have implications for the proposed used of Notch pathway inhibitors in hearing restoration therapies...|$|R

40|$|The {{auditory}} epithelium {{in birds}} and mammals consists of a postmitotic population of hair <b>cells</b> and <b>supporting</b> <b>cells.</b> Unlike mammals, birds can regenerate their auditory epithelia after trauma. Recent evidence indicates that <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> undergo mitosis after acoustic trauma, suggesting that <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> may transdifferentiate into hair cells. The goals {{of this study were}} to (1) characterize the responses of hair <b>cells</b> and <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> to acoustic trauma, and (2) determine whether hair cell loss is a prerequisite for generation of new hair cells. Chicks were exposed to an octave-band noise and their inner ears assayed with fluorescence or scanning electron microscopy. In one area of the basilar papilla, defined as the center of the lesion, extensive hair cell degeneration occurred. Expanded <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> obliterated degenerating hair cells and invaded spaces normally occupied by hair cells. Aggregates of DNA were found within the basilar papilla, suggesting that hair cell death and disintegration may occur within the epithelium. The epithelial sheet appeared structurally confluent at all times examined. <b>Supporting</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited altered apical contour in distal regions of the basilar papilla, where hair cell damage was mild or inconspicuous. Four days after noise exposure, newly generated hair cells were found {{in the center of the}} lesion and in the distal areas, where no hair cell loss could be detected. The results suggest that <b>supporting</b> <b>cells</b> may play an important role in maintenance and repair of the traumatized basilar papilla and raise the possibility that production of new hair cells is not dependent on hair cell loss in the immediate vicinity...|$|R
