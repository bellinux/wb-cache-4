We examined chemical tracers of diet and habitat (δ 15 N and δ 13 C, respectively) and total mercury (Hg) concentrations in muscle tissue of seven pelagic sharks: blue shark (Prionace glauca), <b>short-fin</b> <b>mako</b> shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus), crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) and silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from the data poor south-western tropical Indian Ocean. Minimal interspecific variation in mean δ 15 N values and a large degree of isotopic niche overlap - driven by high intraspecific variation in δ 15 N values - was observed among pelagic sharks. Similarly, δ 13 C values of sharks overlapped considerably for all species with the exception of P. glauca, which had more 13 C-depleted values indicating possibly longer residence times in purely pelagic waters. Geographic variation in δ 13 C, δ 15 N and Hg were observed for P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. Mean Hg levels were similar among species with the exception of P. kamoharai which had significantly higher Hg concentrations likely related to mesopelagic feeding. Hg concentrations increased with body size in I. oxyrinchus, P. glauca and C. longimanus. Values of δ 15 N and δ 13 C varied with size only in P. glauca, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in diets or habitats. Together, isotopic data indicate that – with few exceptions - variance within species in trophic interactions or foraging habitats is greater than differentiation among pelagic sharks in the south-western Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is possible that this group exhibits some level of trophic redundancy, but further studies of diets and fine-scale habitat use are needed to fully test this hypothesis...|$|E

Shark take, driven by vast demand for meat and fins, is increasing. We set out to gain {{insights}} into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16, 610 sharks were observed caught, with 11, 166 identified to species level. Of these, 70. 6 % were blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 28. 4 % <b>short-fin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus), and 1 % were other species (including thresher (Alopias vulpinus), hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), porbeagle (Lamnus nasus), and other Carcharhinidae species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Galeorhinus galeus). Mean ± SD catch per unit effort of 33. 6 ± 10. 9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1. 9 ± 3. 1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83. 7 % of sharks caught (74. 7 % blue sharks; 93. 3 % mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods. We would like to thank the members of the fishing communities who participated in this study, in particular the fishers who were willing to have an observer onboard. We acknowledge Pro Delphinus staff: Bernedo, Cuentas, Lopez, and Mamani, for their help in data collection. We are thankful also to Pro Delphinus staff Natalia Ortiz and Nadia Balducci for support in data entry. This study was conducted in conjunction with and funded by the Darwin Initiative Sustainable Artisanal Fisheries Initiative in Peru and an initial grant from the Oak Foundation through Duke University.
