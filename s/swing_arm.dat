25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor laser housed within the CD player, through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> within the disc tray of any CD player. This <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> allows the laser to read information from the centre {{to the edge of a}} disc, without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, billet caster mold {{oscillation}} {{have been}} found that the mold have sinked and swing have became deformed in the operated process, in order to solve the problem, firstly,the billet caster mold oscillation is simulated on dynamics by using Adams; the force of every joining on <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is obtained. Then, the finite element analysis is worked on <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> by using Solid Works COSMOS Works; the stress on everywhere is obtained. The place of maximum stress value is found, then reconstruct <b>swinging</b> <b>arm,</b> at last, the maximum stress value of <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is declined and the factor of safety of <b>swinging</b> <b>arm</b> is increased. So the problem of mold sunk is solved...|$|R

2500|$|The OA vz. 27's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} {{purpose-built}} ladder frame chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it could be}} driven in both directions as it had both forward and rear drivers. Both axles could be driven and steered, but not {{at the same time as}} the reverser lever controlled the direction of travel and which axle was being used so it was not a true four-wheel drive design[...] The forward driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had his own vision port. The rear driver sat on the vehicle's left side. A heavy Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 water-cooled machine gun was mounted in the center of the rear hull with 72° of traverse. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from doors in both sides of the vehicle and a hatch in the turret. The gunner sat in a small, conical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front, vision slits on both sides and an armored searchlight on a <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> in the rear. The turret had a Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 machine gun in a forward-facing ball mount and two other ball mounts were fitted on the sides of the turret. A ZB vz. 26 light machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 5750 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The body had an internal frame of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams to which [...] armor plates were riveted.|$|E

50|$|Large-scale {{changes were}} made in 2001, with a {{complete}} restyling of the bodywork by designer Gareth Davies, a newly designed engine raising the horsepower to 149 with internal performance upgrades included Forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, and forged aluminium pistons. Focussed on reducing weight and better handling, the 2001 955i used a more common double-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (DSSA) {{as opposed to the}} single-sided <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> (SSSA) of the previous Daytonas. The DSSA version weighs 7.5 lb less than the SSSA due to the lighter weight <b>swing</b> <b>arm,</b> and it is argued that the DSSA version handles better than the SSSA as it has less flex in the <b>swing</b> <b>arm.</b> The 2001+ 955i version had a more compact and advanced Sagem MC1000 electronic engine management system (2-plug) instead of the original Sagem MC2000 controller (1-plug).|$|E

50|$|The mount/demount {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} the duckhead, <b>swing</b> <b>arm,</b> and vertical slide. The duckhead {{is at the bottom}} end of the vertical slide. The duckhead is uniquely shaped, like a tapered bill, to fit next and surround the rim of a wheel. It can either be made of metal or plastic. The duckhead mounts and demounts the tire from the wheel. The <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> moves left and right. The purpose of the <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> is to move the duck head near or away from the rim. The last component of the mount/demount mechanism is the vertical slide. The vertical slide moves up and down so that the duck head can fit onto the rims of different size wheel widths. The vertical slide has a spring and locking handle above the <b>swing</b> <b>arm</b> to set the duckhead and maintain a stable position around the rim.|$|E
