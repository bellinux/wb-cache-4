5|$|The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of flora and fauna. Some common plants native to the park include aspen, Ponderosa pine, sagebrush, desert mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), Utah juniper, gambel oak (scrub oak) and <b>single-leaf</b> ash. The Black Canyon gilia (Aliciella penstemonoides) is a species of wildflower native to the park.|$|E
25|$|Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge, {{commonly}} referred to as the 'Diver' Derrick Bridge, is an opening, <b>single-leaf</b> bascule bridge over the Port River. It was built {{at the same time as}} an adjacent rail crossing, the Mary MacKillop Bridge.|$|E
25|$|A leaf is {{as thick}} as the width of one brick, but a wall {{is said to be}} one brick thick if it as wide as the length of a brick. Accordingly, a <b>single-leaf</b> wall is a half brick thickness; a wall with the {{simplest}} possible masonry transverse bond is said to be one brick thick, and so on.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} kinds of doors, with {{different}} purposes. The most common type is the <b>single-leaf</b> door, which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the double-leaf door or double door and French windows, which have two adjacent independent panels hinged {{on each side of}} the doorway.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, woodcut is {{the oldest}} {{technique}} used for old master prints, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts {{in the middle of}} the century led to a fall in standards, and many popular prints were very crude. The development of hatching followed on rather later than in engraving. Michael Wolgemut was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or etching). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century Albrecht Dürer brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the <b>single-leaf</b> (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.|$|E
25|$|When the Jubilee {{line was}} opened, it was {{operated}} by 1972 stock. In 1984 this was partially {{replaced by the}} new 1983 stock: the displaced 1972 stock {{was transferred to the}} Bakerloo line. The 1983 stock proved to be unreliable and troublesome in service, with <b>single-leaf</b> doors making passenger loading and unloading a slower process than on other stock with wider door openings. With the construction of the Jubilee line Extension, the opportunity was taken to introduce new trains, and today the line is worked by 1996 stock, which has an exterior similar to the 1995 stock in use on the Northern line but (in spite of the confusing naming) is technically less advanced. The new stock has internal displays and automated announcements to provide passengers with information on the train's route. At first the displayed text was static and showed only the destination of the train, but later showed also the name of the next station and interchanges there. Subsequent modifications introduced scrolling text. The 1996 stock uses a different motor from the 1995 stock and has a motor design similar to Class 465 and Class 466 Networker trains.|$|E
500|$|The second {{bridge is}} the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge in Cheboygan. This bascule bridge {{was built in}} 1940 over the Cheboygan River {{as the last of}} its kind before World War II. It was built as a [...] "two-leaf bridge in a place where a <b>single-leaf</b> bridge {{probably}} would have sufficed." [...] The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. [...] It was the second moveable bridge on the site, replacing an iron swing bridge built in 1877. The structure is [...] long, composed of two [...] spans {{on either side of the}} central [...] span; the roadway is [...] wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic. There are also pedestrian sidewalks on either side of the roadway. When the bridge is opened to allow river traffic to pass, boats have a [...] channel for navigation. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 1, 2000, and reconstructed in 2003.|$|E

They each have two <b>single-leaf</b> doors on each side and a full-width operator's cab, {{eliminating}} the so-called [...] "railfan" [...] windows at the front and rear of each train and restricting passengers' ability to walk between car pairs.|$|E
2500|$|The Barn is {{the only}} {{historic}} building {{that is not in}} the Cascadian Rustic architectural style. [...] It is a one and a half-story rectangular peeled-log structure built on a concrete pier foundation. [...] The barn has high bell-cast gambrel roof covered with wood shingles. [...] The log walls interlock at notched corners. [...] On each side, the logs project out approximately [...] beyond the wall corners. [...] The windows on ground floor are single sash of four or six panes. [...] The main door is offset from center at west end of the structure. [...] The door is wood with a six-pane window inset window. [...] There is also a <b>single-leaf</b> horizontal sliding door on east end to allow stock access. [...] On the second floor, there is a two-leaf hay door {{in the center of the}} west gable, providing access to the hayloft.|$|E
2500|$|Block books, {{also called}} xylographica, are short books {{of up to}} 50 leaves, block printed in Europe {{in the second half}} of the 15th century as woodcuts with blocks carved to include both text and illustrations. [...] The content of the books was nearly always religious, aimed at a popular audience, and a few titles were often reprinted in several editions using new woodcuts. [...] Although many had {{believed}} that block books preceded Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the first part of the 1450s, it now is accepted that most of the surviving block books were printed in the 1460s or later, and that the earliest surviving examples may date to about 1451. [...] They seem to have functioned as a cheap popular alternative to the typeset book, which was still very expensive at this stage. <b>Single-leaf</b> woodcuts from the preceding decades often included passages of text with prayers, indulgences and other material; the block book was an extension of this form. [...] Block books are very rare, some editions surviving only in fragments, and many probably not surviving at all.|$|E
2500|$|Motor Trend {{called the}} new Chevy II [...] "a most {{straightforward}} car – simple, honest and conventional." [...] Editor Jerry Titus was fascinated with the new rear <b>single-leaf</b> suspension: [...] "How it actually works seems almost contradictory. There {{is a great deal}} of body roll, but the car does not feel unstable. The ride is soft and pleasing, but not seasick-soft with the constant pitching and rolling that some cars have." [...] Interior room, steering, and brakes were commended. Performance was rated as [...] "moderate" [...] for a six-cylinder Nova convertible with Powerglide: 0-60 came up [...] "a shade under 16 seconds," [...] and the top speed was reported to be 98mph, but Titus felt that [...] "the car seems at its best below 75, where it did not feel as though it was working hard." [...] The four, meanwhile, took 20 seconds to make it from 0 to 60mph. In comparison, a 1960 90bhp Falcon with stick shift took 21 seconds 0 to 60, also according to Motor Trend, while the 101bhp six introduced for 1961 required 14.3 seconds with stick and 15.2 with the two-speed Fordomatic.|$|E
