Conformal transformation transforms the infinite boundary boundary-value problem with the unscreened <b>slab</b> <b>line</b> into a finite boundary {{one that can be}} solved by the BEM, then the capacitance of the unscreened <b>slab</b> <b>line</b> is obtained by the BEM. Three representative computational examples, unscreened cylindrical single-bar <b>slab</b> <b>line,</b> unscreened rectangular single-bar <b>slab</b> <b>line</b> and unscreened cylindrical-bar coupled <b>slab</b> <b>line,</b> are given to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the CT-BEM hybrid method. 1...|$|E

On an experimental basis, magma can be dipped by hand or with a backhoe, through a skylight, to fill molds or forming machinery. On a more permanent basis, where there is a drop in the lava tube, the magma can be diverted without lifting machinery. Really heavy production will occur when the magma is delivered by a barge supported, delivery tube from the cliff face to an endless parade of mold barges. Stationary barges will support the plate and <b>slab</b> <b>line</b> machinery, as well as the machinery to make many of the other products. My patent also envisions the harvesting of the magma from the new island rising towards sea level south of the big island, but that will come later. It is unbelievable that no one has produced building materials from the flowing volcanic magma before. It has been flowing for millions of years, building up the islands ofHawaii from the ocean floor. It will be flowing from here to eternity. "From patent: "A method of manufacturing a building material includes the steps of directing molten volcanic magma from an underwater volcanic magma vent to a level above sea level via a tube formed from the magma; directing the molten volcanic magma into a mold on a floating barge; cooling the magma in the mold to form a building material; and removing the building material from the mold.

25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete <b>slab</b> <b>lined</b> with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|R

5000|$|The first routes {{put up on}} new cliffs {{almost always}} follow cracks, due to the ease of placing protection, or pieces of {{equipment}} which arrest a fall, while on lead. Slab climbs rarely have cracks or other features that can be protected. Therefore, slab climbs are usually discovered well after the cracks are all climbed, since easier routes to the summit exist. Slab climbs can be dangerous to lead climb using traditional protection, or removable gear that fits into rock features, since the scarcity of natural features where protection can be placed results in long sections where the climber is exposed to long falls - over 150 ft on some routes. As a result, {{it was not until}} the introduction of bolting routes that hard <b>slab</b> <b>lines</b> could be climbed. In 1927, Laurent Grivel designed the first rock drill and expansion bolt, which paved the way for protecting climbs such as slab. The next advancement for slab climbing did not come until 1980 when Boreal marketed the first [...] "sticky rubber" [...] shoe, allowing friction climbing to be more feasible. Before this, most climbing was done in boots or thick soled shoes, which prevents the climber from making the balance dependent moves required on slab walls. Slab climbing saw a dramatic increase in the number of new routes with the introduction of lightweight, electric drills in the 1980s, but slowed down as criticism of permanent bolting grew, and electric drills became illegal in many National Parks and Wilderness Areas. A new generation of climbers has begun to revive slab climbing, putting up some of the hardest routes in the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} RusHydro {{assessment was}} deemed overly optimistic by the opposition. The dam, {{which has no}} major flood control structures upstream, must {{bear the brunt of}} spring freshets, and due to a snowy winter and late thaw, {{in the first week of}} June 2010 the amount of spring flood water influx was about twice the normal (peaking at 9,700 m3/s on 5 June and expected to stay around 7,000 m3/s throughout the second and third weeks of June). Due to the August 2009 accident, only 2 out of 10 turbines were operable and capable of routing only 690 m3/s of water. Consequently, most of the water influx into the reservoir must be drained through a poorly designed spillway, which previously had already suffered extensive damage as a result of spring floods in 1985 and 1988. As of 8 June, drainage through the spillway was roughly 5,000 m3/s. While it would be possible to increase the spillway drain to 7,000—7,500 m3/s, such an operation was previously deemed unsafe to the structure, and could result in further erosion of the dam's already weakened foundation even as the reservoir continues to fill. The damage would occur by direct impact of the falling water to the spill well (which, once its concrete <b>slab</b> <b>lining</b> were destroyed, would expose and erode the dam's bedrock support) as well as by intense vibrations created by the waterfall, which the concrete dam, lacking steel reinforcement, is not designed to withstand for prolonged periods. To date, only one section of the bypass spillway had been completed, and was capable of routing only 2,000 m3/s of water, meaning that the main spillway, probably already worn and torn from the 2009 winter's heavy ice deposition on the dam, must continue to be operated for some time before repairs will be possible.|$|R

40|$|The yield line {{analysis}} method is used extensively throughout the blast design and analysis community {{to determine the}} strength of reinforced concrete structural elements to resist blast overpressures. Technical literature has long been available that describes the yield line method of analysis and explains how to derive the necessary analysis equations for a structural element such as a wall or a roof. Most presentations of the yield {{line analysis}} method deal with common slab configurations, such as one-way spans of varying support conditions or two-way spans that usually consist of a rectangular slab supported along two or more edges. Very little discussion is available on how to analyze slabs with openings, and even less information is available on how to analyze slabs with covered openings. Yet slabs with covered openings, such as blast-resistant doors or windows, are very common structural elements in the explosive safety design community. This paper presents a method by which the yield line analysis method {{can be used to}} analyze and design slabs and plates with open-ings. EFFECT OF OPENINGS ON STRENGTH OF SLABS In blast resistant applications, the size of openings in slabs can become very significant when determining ultimate resistance to pressure. Openings tend to attract yield lines, but they don't automatically weaken a slab. Openings result in less surface area to collect load, and under some conditions, the ultimate strength of a slab can actually increase. When a slab has openings that are covered there is no reduction in surface area collecting load and the designer has to add into the analysis the effects of the additional blast load collected by the cover. These cover loads are passed into the <b>slab</b> via <b>line</b> loads around the supported edges of the cover. These line loads, if the cover is large enough or strong enough, can dramatically reduce the strength or ultimate resistance of the <b>slab.</b> Yield <b>line</b> analysis methods that include the effects of line loads can more accurately determine the strength of a uniform slab and often eliminate the need for pilasters and headers around the openings...|$|R
