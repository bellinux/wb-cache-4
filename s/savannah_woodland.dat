25|$|The {{centre of}} the {{township}} is on the northern side of the railway. Parts of this are now destroyed by the Gulf Developmental Road and farm tracks. The central tailings dump associated with the mines along the Golden Gate reef, also now covers much of the former Golden Gate Township. Evidence of township habitation {{is located at the}} southern end of the Golden Gate Consols mine site. No extant structures survive but the remains of dwellings are found throughout the re-growth <b>savannah</b> <b>woodland.</b> These include earth floors, some stone footings, vertical sections of corrugated iron walls (possibly 'rat walls') set into the ground, and associated scatters of broken bottle glass, bricks, stove remains, sheet iron, tins and domestic ceramics. There are also some minor surface workings in and around the township site. There are further signs of habitation on the southern side of railway, connecting with the Golden Gate Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Once {{common on}} the east coast of Australia, emus are now {{uncommon}} there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions. Emus live in various habitats across Australia both inland and near the coast. They are most common in areas of <b>savannah</b> <b>woodland</b> and sclerophyll forest, and least common in heavily populated districts and arid areas with annual precipitation of less than [...] Emus predominately travel in pairs, and while they can form large flocks, this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source. Emus have been shown to travel long distances to reach abundant feeding areas. In Western Australia, emu movements follow a distinct seasonal pattern – north in summer and south in winter. On the east coast their wanderings seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern.|$|E

500|$|The {{habitat of}} the green-head ant varies, ranging from desert, heath, open forests, urban areas and woodland. These ants mainly live in {{moderate}} wooded or open areas, {{but they are}} abundant in lawns and gardens in cities. Nests {{have been found in}} dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, mallee, <b>savannah</b> <b>woodland,</b> on roadsides, and in native vegetation. Green-head ants are mostly found at altitudes of between [...] above sea level. The workers construct small and loosely integrated nests underground or in decaying wooden stumps. They may also nest in the termite mounds of Amitermes laurensis. These nests are commonly found beneath grass roots or under logs, stones, twigs, or at the base of shrubs. Green-head ants can nest in disturbed areas, and, as a result, colonies of these ants are rather common in urban areas. They are among the first insects to be seen foraging for food in areas where bushfires have occurred, and in some cases they return right after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain also presents no threat to green-head ants {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine.|$|E
500|$|Meat ants {{thrive in}} varied habitats, {{especially}} {{where it is}} open and warm. These ants are adapted to and thrive in warm climates and areas with constant high temperatures. The meat ant shares its distribution with many other animals and insects, {{some of which may}} cause harm to the ant or rival it, such as the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Nests are seen in box-pine scrubs, Callitris forests, dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, eucalypt open woodland, in farm pastures, flat <b>savannah</b> <b>woodland,</b> mallee woodland, heath, mulga, riparian woodland, around roads and cracks in sidewalks, and urban areas such as urban gardens and parkland. Nests are also common in lateritic ridges, granite outcrops and clay formations. Meat ants are able to survive in dry areas if there is a rich supply of water and food resources (such as honeydew and arthropod prey), especially along river banks, station properties and irrigated areas. Meat ants typically occur at altitudes of [...] above sea level, though at times they can be found at heights of [...] Those that are found at these altitudes are always associated with Eucalyptus rubida, and colonies situated in eastern New South Wales tend to nest near E. melliodora and E. blakelyi. In the south coast of New South Wales, meat ants are mainly found in heath shrubland, but are absent from heavily timbered slopes and cannot build nests in quartz. Other areas where the ants do not occur include dense pastures, dense bushes, tropical rainforests and treeless areas. For example, the Canberra suburb of Turner was constructed on subterranean clover pasture, which meat ants do not nest around. Their populations would later flourish and nests became numerous around houses after shrubs and trees were planted.|$|E

2500|$|Described as an {{arboreal}} nesting species, O.glaber {{lives in}} open or <b>savannah</b> <b>woodland</b> areas, nesting under stones, old dry logs, in hollow trees and plant stems, and rotten wood. Nests {{can also be}} constructed in buildings and structures, specifically in pavings, ceilings and walls. It is both diurnal and nocturnal, forming long trails from trees {{in search of food}} such as honeydew and insects. It has developed some associations with certain flowers and also tends to associate with some insects, such as mealybugs and aphids. During the nuptial flight, queens mate with either one or multiple males; males only mate with a single queen. Sometimes, a subset of a colony may leave the main colony for an alternative nest site as an act of dispersal. O.glaber often invades human homes to feed on household foods, and is considered a household pest. It has been intercepted numerous times in the United States, where {{it has the potential to}} disrupt the biological control of certain pests and cause long-term ecological impacts in areas where it is not native.|$|E
