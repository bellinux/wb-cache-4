50|$|The Guillemin {{symmetrical}} clutch, {{also called}} Guillemin coupling, {{is widely used}} in France and in Belgium to couple hoses and resembles a DSP coupling, which is used in firefighting. It can be fastened by hand, {{but it is also}} possible to use a tricoise wrench. It has quarter-turn closing and is sexless (symmetrical). It may be fabricated from aluminum, stainless steel, brass or polypropylene. The standard for this kind of coupling is EN14420-8/NF E 29-572, and {{there is a kind of}} special standard DIN14420-8 for unique assemblies with ferrule and <b>safety</b> <b>clamp.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A laser guide {{provides}} a precise visual indication {{of where the}} cut will be positioned on the workpiece in the current configuration. Some models provide a single reference line for {{one side of the}} kerf, while others provide two lines to reflect the total kerf width. A blade guard is a cover for the teeth of the cutting blade. Most modern miter saws have self-retracting blade guards, which automatically retract when the saw is lowered onto a workpiece and re-cover the blade when the saw is raised. It is very dangerous to use the saw if these guards are removed or damaged. A dust bag connects directly to the saw, and helps to collect sawdust away from the workpiece during cutting. Optionally, many manufacturers sell adapters to connect an industrial vacuum cleaner in lieu of a bag to capture more of the dust and simplify disposal. Dust removal with these saws is notoriously poor. A <b>safety</b> <b>clamp</b> helps to lock a workpiece into position prior to making a cut. This is an especially important feature when cutting smaller workpieces (eight inches or smaller). The miter table [...] is typically less than 24" [...] in diameter. Typically, the work will need to be supported on the far end to stabilize the piece while cutting.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of tools that have been left behind during a surgery. Common instruments are needles, knife blades, <b>safety</b> pins, scalpels, <b>clamps,</b> scissors, sponges, towels, and electrosurgical adapters. Also retained are tweezers, forceps, suction tips and tubes, scopes, ultrasound tissue disruptors, asepto bulbs, cryotomes and cutting laser guides, and measuring devices. The single most common left behind object is a sponge.|$|R
40|$|Background: Venoveno bypass (VVB) {{has been}} used to achieve hemodynamic {{stability}} and decrease the incidence of renal dysfunction. However, VVB has many complications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the <b>safety</b> of total <b>clamping</b> of the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) without VVB during orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) in terms of anesthetic management. Methods: Twenty-five patients without preoperative renal dysfunction who underwent primary OLT were enrolled in this study. Hemodynamic data and blood gas measurements were collected 1 hour after incision, 30 minutes after IVC total clamping and 30 minutes after reperfusion. Postoperative laboratory data, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), were assessed at postoperative day (POD) 0 - 7, 30, 90, 180 and 1 year. Results: Mean blood pressure was well maintained during IVC total clamping with infusion of inotropics. There was no case of severe acidosis (pH < 7. 2) during the anhepatic period. The immediate postoperative Cr and GFR were not significantly different from those of the preoperative values. BUN increased from POD 1 and decreased after POD 6, while Cr increased at POD 90 only. Conclusions: In patients without preoperative renal dysfunction, when IVC was totally clamped, VVB does not need to be routinely performed to maintain hemodynamics during the anhepatic phase and renal function after OLT...|$|R
