Another case variation was also executed in which a sunshade tent was installed at work area A. The result shows as the work area B is in the shade because of trees the temperature there is lower than in work area A, so the core body temperature increased only about 0.5 °C in the morning. As for the <b>sunshade</b> <b>case,</b> the core body temperature increased about 0.7 °C in the morning. Both modifications are considered to be effective for mitigating heatstroke risk. However, changing the work areas is more effective in this case because work area B is surrounded by trees and the ground is covered with grass.|$|E
