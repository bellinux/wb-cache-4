I hate to sew, and I can't marry a man who {{wants me to do}} the way other women do. I must be {{intended}} for something else than a housewife, because I never do a bit of cooking or sewing without groaning.

6000|$|The girl became {{thoughtful}} for a time. [...] "I can't understand," [...] <b>she</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "why Gran'pa Jim acts {{the way he}} does. Often he {{has told}} me, when I deserved censure, to 'face the music' and have it over with. Once he said that those who sin must suffer the penalty, {{because it is the}} law of both God and man, and he who seeks to escape a just penalty is a coward. Gran'pa knows he is innocent, but the government thinks he is guilty; so why doesn't he face the music and prove his innocence, instead of running away as a coward might do and so allow his good name to suffer reproach?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{commercialization of}} the American holiday began very early, and only nine {{years after the}} first {{official}} Mother's Day it had become so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a major opponent of what the holiday had become, spending all her inheritance and {{the rest of her life}} fighting what she saw as an abuse of the celebration. She decried the practice of purchasing greeting cards, which she saw as a sign of being too lazy to write a personal letter.
