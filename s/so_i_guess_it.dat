There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period.

500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968. It is designed to make the festival a less than totally establishment affair and it offers Third World, independent and frequently angry films on social themes." [...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they laughed in all the right places, and they applauded at the end, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> went alright." [...] He also said, [...] "Americana swept the festival and I came very close to making a distribution deal with Warner Brothers."

I'm sure by now most of you assume the band isn't happening anymore {{since there are no}} shows, no work on a new album, etc. well. I {{wanted to let you know}} that your assumptions are correct. We decided to stop doing the band... Actually we decided that almost a year ago. We finished off our scheduled tour dates because there were good people working for us who relied on us to make a living and buy Christmas presents and pay rent etc. We couldn't just cancel everything and leave them out to dry... Plus I think we wanted to see if we would reconsider after being out on the road. Our label was really hoping that we would change our minds, so they asked us to keep quiet about the decision for at first. Well, it's been quite a while now and we are still very sure the band won't happen again, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> time to say something.On MuchMusic's television program The New Music, Keeler further explained why the band split.

[...] George Starostin {{retrospectively}} reviewed the album for his website, where he highlighted the song {{as the best}} track on the album. He said: [...] "Harley's newly-found love for funky rhythms is amply demonstrated on [...] "White White Dove", Harley's weird ode to Rosicrucians, of all people, with a very nice transition from the harsh funky verses to the pompous brass-filled poppy chorus and, again, an excellent processed guitar solo from Cregan at the end. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it's</b> the only number on the entire record that shows some ambition where melody and complexity are concerned, and, predictably, becomes my favourite song." [...] Dave Thompson of AllMusic spoke of the song {{in a review of}} the 2008 compilation The Best of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel. He wrote: [...] "The real meat, however, lies among the excerpted album cuts, as the compilers treat all seven original Harley/Cockney Rebel LPs with more or less equal respect - many fans would have drawn a line after the first three.

Commenting on the change in direction, Parker stated that [...] "our earlier stuff was quite tied into that math rock and looping stuff but we’re all suckers for 4/4 and pop songs and we {{grew up listening to}} that sort of music <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> was a natural progression".

He elaborated more on the fact in another interview with The Sun: [...] "Just in case anybody gets frightened that we have a 16-minute song, it's a song in three parts, that we really wanted to be married together in a strange ceremony. I don't have the concentration span to write a 16-minute song. I get bored easily.
