5|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{spends the}} summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, {{probably}} close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E

5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there was}} an {{instance}} of a <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> being fatally struck by a ferry in August 2014. This whale was a calf, and her mother was also seriously injured by the accident and her fate is still unknown. Another <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> possibly with a calf was also hit few days prior to the incident with a sighting of possibly the same whales near Victoria Point. These ship-strikes and entanglements in fishing gear may contribute severely to preventing the future re-establishment of the species in the former habitats.|$|E
25|$|Signature {{marine fauna}} include the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), the orca and {{elephant}} seals.

25|$|Various {{species of}} whales and {{dolphins}} {{can be seen}} around Tristan {{from time to time}} with increasing sighting rate although recovery of baleen whales especially the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> were severely hindered by illegal whaling by the Soviet Union. The subantarctic fur seal Arctocephalus tropicalis can also be found in the Tristan archipelago, mostly on Gough Island.|$|E
25|$|Many other oceanic {{species such}} as Sperm whales, pilot whales, and several species of beaked whales {{including}} the first sightings of Shepherd's beaked whales within the nation and dolphins such as <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphins can be found further offshore around the rich, deep sea canyon about 20km off the peninsula coast which maybe as significant as Kaikoura and rarely strand.|$|E

Under Australia's EPBC Act the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is listed as endangered and the humpback whale is listed as vulnerable. Commercial tour operators offer whale watching cruises between June and September each year. Most of larger cetaceans observed in the bay are humpbacks, and several smaller dolphins live or regularly visit the bay.|$|E

25|$|E. japonica {{is a very}} large, thickset baleen whale. It {{very closely}} resembles the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis) the <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an {{individual}} came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.|$|E
500|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{is listed}} as [...] "endangered" [...] under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, as [...] "nationally endangered" [...] under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, as a [...] "natural monument" [...] by the Argentine National Congress, and as a [...] "State Natural Monument" [...] under the Brazilian National Endangered Species List.|$|E
500|$|The <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{has made}} Hermanus, South Africa {{one of the}} world centers for whale watching. During the winter months (July–October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline, visitors can watch whales from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a [...] "whale crier" [...] (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. Southern right whales can also be watched at other winter breeding grounds.|$|E
50|$|From June to November, <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> can be {{seen from}} the coastline, where they come to mate and calf.|$|R

50|$|Between July and November, <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> {{visit the}} state's coast. And during the winter, flocks of {{penguins}} migrate from Antarctica.|$|R
500|$|Larger {{whales are}} also thought, to some degree, {{to engage in}} play. The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> for example, elevates their tail fluke above the water, {{remaining}} {{in the same position}} for a considerable amount of time. This is known as [...] "sailing". It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of Argentina and South Africa. Humpback whales, among others, are also known to display this behaviour.|$|E
500|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> {{listed as}} [...] "endangered" [...] by CITES and [...] "lower risk - {{conservation}} dependent" [...] by the IUCN, is protected in the jurisdictional waters of all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some [...] and [...] of coastline in Santa Catarina State {{was established in}} 2000 to protect the species' main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote whale watching.|$|E
500|$|Right {{whales are}} three species of large baleen whales {{of the genus}} Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (E. australis). They are {{classified}} in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice. Right whales can grow {{up to more than}} [...] long with the maximum record of [...] and weigh up to [...] or more; [...] with [...] or [...] with uncertainty, being significantly larger than other coastal species such as humpbacks, grays, or eden's and omura's, but smaller than blues. One (apocryphal) explanation for their name is that right whales were named by whalers who identified them as the [...] "right" [...] whale to kill on a hunt due to the plentiful oil and baleen they could provide.|$|E

50|$|You {{can watch}} the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale {{watching}} tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from June till Mid December. Port Elizabeth runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde's whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of Algoa Bay), and <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction {{in a number of}} other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to conservation and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer marine conservation organisations. Plettenberg Bay is visited by <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the winter months and humpback whales in the summer months. Bryde's whales are resident throughout the year. The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon's Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include <b>southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> humpback whales and Bryde's whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Haveside dolphins. The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon's Town.|$|R

2500|$|A {{threshold}} {{problem for}} conserving this species is locating them. [...] Other right whale species can reliably {{be found on}} their feeding grounds (North Atlantic right whale), or on their wintering grounds (both North Atlantic and <b>Southern</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale).</b> In contrast, there are no reliable places where researchers can find North Pacific right whales. [...] In the eastern portion of their range, {{there are so few}} whales that researchers have described it looking for a needle in a haystack. In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal.|$|E
