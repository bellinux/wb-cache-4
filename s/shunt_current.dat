P 6 provides electrical power to channels 2 B and 4 B to operate ISS power loads. A P 6 {{is shown in}} the preceding photograph. This article highlights the work done at the NASA Glenn Research Center to calculate the on-orbit degradation of the P 6 solar array wings (SAWs) using on-orbit data from December 2000 to February 2003. During early ISS operations, the 82 strings of photovoltaic cells that make up a SAW can provide much more power than is necessary to meet the demand. To deal with excess power, a sequential shunt unit successively shunts the current from the strings. This <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> was the parameter chosen for the SAW performance degradation study for the following reasons: (1) it is based on a direct <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> measurement in the sequential shunt unit, (2) the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> has a low temperature dependence that reduces the data correction error from using a computationally derived array temperature, and (3) the SSU <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> is essentially the same as the SAW short-circuit current on a per-string basis...|$|E

All three device types exhibit a significant shunt leakage current at low forward bias (V 3 ̆c similar to 0. 4) and reverse bias, which cannot {{be explained by the}} classical solar cell diode model. This parasitic <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> exhibits non-Ohmic behavior, as opposed to the traditional constant shunt resistance model for photovoltaics. We show here that this shunt leakage (I-sh), across all three solar cell types considered, is characterized by the following common phenomenological features: (a) voltage symmetry about V = 0, (b) nonlinear (power law) voltage dependence, and (c) extremely weak temperature dependence. Based on this analysis, we provide a simple method of subtracting this <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> component from the measured data and discuss its implications on dark IV parameter extraction. We propose a space charge limited (SCL) current model for capturing all these features of the shunt leakage in a consistent framework and discuss possible physical origin of the parasitic paths responsible for this <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> mechanism.

40|$|The {{main body}} of work in this thesis is a proof of concept study for the first {{quantitative}} analysis of local shunts and recombinationactive defects in silicon solar cells, using photoluminescence (PL) imaging. A small study for a practical application of the fast shunt detection capabilities of PL imaging is demonstrated. PL images and an improved shunt isolation process are used to identify and isolate shunted regions in twenty multicrystalline commercial solar cells rejected due to a low shunt resistance. The performance of eight of these cells was recovered to acceptable industry standards. The method developed in this thesis, for quantitative analysis of the shunt resistance, is based on interpretation of the luminescence intensity around a local shunt or recombination-active defect {{in terms of the}} extracted current. The theoretical relationship between the photoluminescence signal and the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> is derived. Experimental results on specifically prepared test structures show good agreement with known values. The best results show that if a PL image of the sample is available before and after shunting, the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> can be calculated to within ± 6. 8 %. If only a shunted PL image is available, the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> can be calculated to within ± 13. 4 %, provided that the shunt is located in a region of uniform PL signal. These results are based on the specific sample set in this thesis; for a more widely applicable error, a much larger and varied sample set would need to be analysed. The method is applied to wafers at various processing stages. PL imaging is found to be a more convenient method for quantitative characterisation of wafers than ILIT. A method for contactlessly distinguishing between ohmic and non-ohmic shunts is proposed and investigated. The effect of the front metallisation on the interpretation of shunts in PL images is found to introduce an error of at least 50 % in the calculated <b>shunt</b> <b>current.</b> It is concluded that the work in this thesis has successfully extended the characterisation capabilities of PL imaging to include quantitative evaluation of local shunt currents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Partial shading in {{thin film}} solar panels {{can result in}} reverse bias stress across shaded cells. Therefore, it is {{important}} to understand the effect of such reverse stress in commercially competitive PV technologies such as CIGS. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of moderate reverse bias on solution-processed CIGS solar cells. We subject the solar cells to varying degrees of reverse biases and continuously monitor the impact of the stress on dark current. We also explore the relaxation behavior of dark current following passive storage and the long term effect of the shadow stress on power output of the cell. We find that the reverse stress affects only the localized <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> paths, without affecting the bulk device characteristics. The <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> exhibits a metastable change with reverse stress, and can increase or decrease on application of reverse stress.

40|$|Under {{partially}} shaded conditions, {{the current}} through a photovoltaic (PV) string {{is limited to}} the current produced by its most shaded module, reducing the overall PV array output power. A current compensation-based distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) scheme may typically be used to maximize power output under these conditions. However, because of nonuniform irradiation during partial shading, different modules across a given string, as well as across the various strings, experience different conditions. Yet, the module voltages in all the strings should add up to the same voltage because all strings are connected in parallel. This causes the individual modules in a string to readjust their voltages and operate away from their actual MPP. In other words, the DMPPT scheme using <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> compensation alone is not effective. This paper describes a novel method comprising <b>shunt</b> (<b>current)</b> and series (voltage) compensation of modules and strings, respectively. Per this technique, a current-compensating converter is connected in shunt with each module, and a voltage-compensating converter is connected in series with each string. This facilitates each PV module to operate at its exact MPP and deliver maximum power. All the analytical, simulation, and experimental results of this study are included...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} need for large energy storage in renewable energy applications, the all-vanadium redox flow battery {{has received the}} most attention to date as the energy storage technology most likely to meet the required energy efficiency, cycle life and cost structure. The widespread commercialization of the vanadium redox flow battery will only be realized however, if battery operation can be optimised to achieve the necessary cycle life and cost reduction of key components are properly addressed. This thesis aims to explore first-principle dynamic models that can be subsequently utilized in model-based control system development for the safe and efficient operation of the VFB under a range of temperatures and cycling conditions. The work begins with modelling {{of the effects of}} vanadium ion diffusion across the membrane and gassing side reactions on the basis of mass balance and Fick's law, followed by employing energy balance to investigate the variation in electrolyte temperature as a function of time under different operating conditions and battery structure design. The energy balance is subsequently coupled with the mass balance by means of considering the temperature dependence of vanadium ion diffusion and the thermal effect of self-discharge reactions, providing a more accurate prediction of electrolyte temperatures during both continuous charge-discharge cycling and standby periods. n addition to self-discharge, the <b>shunt</b> <b>currents</b> arising from the potential gradient across the stack are also modelled in an electric resistance circuit that is combined into the mass and energy balances. The upgrade in the model not only accounts for the heat generation from <b>shunt</b> <b>currents</b> during battery cycling and standby, but contributes to a more accurate prediction of stack round-trip efficiency {{in the presence of the}} parasitic loss of energy as a result of <b>shunt</b> <b>currents.</b> Last but not the least, the pressure drop in the flow frame along with the pressure losses in the porous electrode and the pipes is calculated and incorporated into the model.
