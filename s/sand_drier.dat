50|$|There was a {{locomotive}} depot at Llantrisant. The original EVR depot {{was close to}} the station, but in 1900 this was replaced by a new depot on {{the eastern side of the}} line between the station and Mwyndy Junction; this was built to the specifications of William Dean, the GWR Locomotive Superintendent. The stone-built locomotive shed measured 50 × 125 ft; it had a northlight roof, and contained three tracks for the stabling of locomotives. Alongside this were the depot offices, measuring 15 × 45 ft, and the stores, measuring 15 × 80 ft. The coal stage measured 30 × 16 ft and also carried a water tank with a capacity of 22500 imp gal. There was also a turntable, a <b>sand</b> <b>drier</b> and some sidings. Access to the depot complex was provided at both ends, although locomotives could not run direct from the station to Mwyndy Junction via the depot without a double reversal.|$|E

50|$|The sand may be {{delivered}} by gravity, by a steam-blast (steam locomotives) or by compressed air. Gravity sanding {{requires that the}} <b>sand</b> be <b>dry</b> so that it runs freely. Locomotives used multiple sandboxes, so that their delivery pipes could be short and near-vertical. Engine sheds in the UK were equipped with <b>sand</b> <b>drying</b> stoves, so that sandboxes could be refilled each morning with <b>dry</b> <b>sand.</b> Steam locomotives in the USA had a single sandbox, called a sand dome {{on top of the}} boiler where the rising heat helped to <b>dry</b> the <b>sand.</b> Even with this arrangement, sand pipes tended to clog, and by the 1880s, pneumatic sanding systems were being proposed.|$|R

40|$|Drying of ferric {{chloride}} {{water treatment plant}} residuals have been studied in two experimental <b>sand</b> <b>drying</b> beds. One bed was open {{and the other was}} covered with glass to study respectively the open bed drying of residuals under normal weather conditions and passive solar energy drying. The covered bed was fabricated, with a view, to simulate the solar distillation stills. A weather station was used to monitor the dynamic weather conditions in order to study their effect on the drying process. Solids content, drainage water volumes and distillate from the covered bed were measured on a daily basis. The aim {{of the study was to}} accelerate the drying process of residuals using passive solar energy drying technique. The study showed that the residuals dry faster in the open bed. The passive solar bed design was altered several times during the study in order to improve the bed performance. However no significant improvements were found in the performance. A reduction of 33 % in drying time was achieved when the solar drying bed was provided with a fan heater.

Thirty-six water samples each of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> and seawater were collected monthly over a period of one year and analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB: thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci), presumptive Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and dermatophytes.

This evaluation showed also that the environment had a significant influence on P. aeruginosa but not on presumptive S. aureus concentrations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{barriers}} of dry soil {{on the ability}} of Formosan subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), to construct tunnels and find food was evaluated. Termite movement and wood consumption in a three–chambered apparatus were compared between treatments with dry soil in the center container and treatments where the soil in the center container was moist. When a wood block was located in the release container, termites fed significantly more on that block, regardless of treatment or soil type. In the treatment with dry clay, none of the termites tunneled through the dry clay barrier to reach the distal container. When termites had to tunnel through a barrier of <b>dry</b> <b>sand,</b> topsoil, or clay to reach the sole wood block, there was no effect on wood consumption for the sand treatment, but there was significantly less feeding on wood in the treatments with dry topsoil or clay. When foraging arenas had a section of <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> in the center, the <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> significantly reduced tunneling in the distal section after 3 days, but not after 10 days.

If the MCL is lowered, it is speculated that there will be stricter limits imposed on the disposal and handling of arsenic-containing residuals. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the properties of drinking water residuals, including the chemical characteristics, the amount of arsenic that leaches in common residual handling and dewatering processes, and the hazardous potential of the residuals. Residual samples were collected from seven utilities with high arsenic concentrations in their raw water. Included in the study were four plants that coagulate with ferric chloride, two with aluminum hydroxide, and one softening plant. The residuals from each facility were acid digested and chemically characterized using ICPAES to determine the total arsenic, aluminum and iron present. TCLP and California WET were performed to verify if the residuals were hazardous. Simulated lagoons were set up and monitored over a six-month period to determine the amount of arsenic that was leached to the liquid portion over time. Toxicity testing was performed on the residuals at 20 % and 100 % after two months and six months of storage. Bench-scale <b>sand</b> <b>drying</b> beds were used to dewater residuals, and the leachates were analyzed to determine if arsenic leached from residuals. The residuals were found to contain high levels of arsenic during the chemical characterization. However, all of the facilities passed the current TCLP limit of 5 mg/L. For all residuals, the California WET values were much higher than the TCLP values. In the lagoon study, redox potentials decreased and the arsenic and iron concentrations in the liquid portions increased. In the <b>sand</b> <b>drying</b> beds [...] ...|$|R
