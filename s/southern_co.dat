This report contains results from the portion of this program established as Phase I (of three phases) that entails baseline fracture toughness, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and tensile testing of selected materials for comparison to similar tests conducted at GE Global Research. The intent of this Phase I research program is to determine baseline properties for the materials of interest prior to irradiation, and to ensure comparability between laboratories using similar testing techniques, prior to applying these techniques to the same materials after having been irradiated at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR).

With high spatial resolution (FWHM ∼ 0. ′ ′ 3 – 0. ′ ′ 35) and deep imaging (K ∼ 21 mag, 5 σ) with the IRCS imager at the Subaru telescope, we detected cluster members with a mass detection limit of < 0. 1 M⊙, which is well into the substellar regime. These high quality data enables a comparison of EOG to those in the solar neighborhood on the same basis for the first time. Before interpreting the photometric result, we have first constructed the NIR color-color diagram (dwarf star track, classical T Tauri star (CTTS) locus, reddening law) in the Mauna Kea Observatory filter system and also for the low metallicity environment since the metallicity in EOG is much lower than those in the solar neighborhood.

40|$|The {{spectral}} signature of water ice was observed on Martian south polar cap in 2004 by the Observatoire pour l'Mineralogie, l'Eau les Glaces et l'Activite (OMEGA) (Bibring et al., 2004). Three years later, the OMEGA instrument {{was used to}} discover water ice deposited during southern summer on the polar cap (Langevin et al., 2007). However, temporal and spatial variations of these water ice signatures have remained unexplored, and the origins of these water deposits remains an important scientific question. To investigate this question, we have used observations from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft of the southern cap during austral summer over four Martian years to search for variations {{in the amount of}} water ice. We report below that for each year we have observed the cap, the magnitude of the H 2 O ice signature on the southern cap has risen steadily throughout summer, particularly on the west end of the cap. The spatial extent of deposition is in disagreement with the current best simulations of deposition of water ice on the south polar cap (Montmessin et al., 2007). This increase in water ice signatures is most likely caused by deposition of atmospheric H 2 O ice and a set of unusual conditions makes the quantification of this transport flux using CRISM close to ideal. We calculate a 'minimum apparent' amount of deposition corresponding to a thin H 2 O ice layer of 0. 2 mm (with 70 percent porosity). This amount of H 2 O ice deposition is 0. 6 - 6 percent of the total Martian atmospheric water budget. We compare our 'minimal apparent' quantification with previous estimates. This deposition process may also have implications for the formation and stability of the <b>southern</b> <b>CO</b> 2 ice cap, and therefore {{play a significant role in}} the climate budget of modern day Mars.

The UGA Board of Visitors aims to build relationships between the state 2 ̆ 7 s largest and most comprehensive research university and its elected officials, business leaders and community organizations. Members serve a two-year term in which {{they will have the}} opportunity to hear from some of the university 2 ̆ 7 s most celebrated faculty members, its top researchers and most promising students. 2 ̆ 2 The University of Georgia has a great story to tell, and I 2 ̆ 7 m delighted that so many of our state 2 ̆ 7 s leaders have accepted this opportunity to hear it first-hand, 2 ̆ 2 Adams said. Board of Visitors events are funded by the Arch Foundation for the University of Georgia, which supports the university through volunteer leadership and assistance in development and fundraising activities. Arch Foundation Trustee Abby Irby of Atlanta said she hopes that Board of Visitors members will gain a fuller understanding of how the university 2 ̆ 7 s teaching, research and service is helping to create a more prosperous future for Georgia. 2 ̆ 2 By bringing some of the state 2 ̆ 7 s most distinguished citizens and leaders together with the stars of the university, the Board of Visitors will help UGA build and reinforce partnerships with the state it serves, 2 ̆ 2 said Irby, who chairs the foundation 2 ̆ 7 s Board of Visitors subcommittee. 2 ̆ 2 The university has programs in fields ranging from the arts to public health, and board members come from equally diverse fields. 2 ̆ 2 The members of the 2010 - 2012 class of the UGA Board of Visitors, in alphabetical order by last name, are: • Rev.
