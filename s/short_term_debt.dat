In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality {{than most other}} borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).|$|E

40|$|Debt {{maturity}} influences debt overhang, {{the reduced}} incentive for highly levered borrowers to make real investments because some value accrues to debt. Reducing maturity can {{increase or decrease}} overhang even when <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>debt’s</b> value depends less on firm value. Future overhang is more volatile for <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>debt,</b> making future investment incentives volatile and influencing immediate investment incentives. With immediate investment, <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>debt</b> typically imposes lower overhang; longer <b>term</b> <b>debt</b> can impose less if asset volatility is higher in bad times. For future investments, reduced correlation between assets-in-place and investment opportunities increases the <b>shorter</b> <b>term</b> <b>debt</b> overhang. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE effects of debt maturity on the current and future real investment decisions of an equity owner (or a manager who is compensated by equity). Our analysis is based on debt overhang first analyzed by Myers (1977), who points out that outstanding debt may distort the firm’s investment incentives downward. Reduced incentives to undertake profitable investment...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{markets in}} the last decade {{increased}} the stock of foreign reserves and simultaneously managed to raise GDP growth while leaving <b>short</b> <b>term</b> foreign <b>debt</b> and investment in net fixed capital nearly unchanged. This work builds a model able to derive these facts as the result of greater openness to global goods and financial markets. Emerging countries generate the observed high ratios of reserves to <b>short</b> <b>term</b> foreign <b>debt</b> to hedge against volatility of foreign capital inflow with the purpose of stabilising not the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> but the long term finance available to domestic firms. Numerical simulations of the model derive the rising level of reserves to <b>short</b> <b>term</b> foreign <b>debt</b> ratio and about half of the observed rise in GDP growth {{as a result of a}} falling cost of long term finance and the increasing competitiveness of domestic industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies a probit {{estimation}} {{to assess}} the relationship between economic takeoffs during 1950 - 2000 and inflows of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI, controlling for country’s stock of short-term external <b>debt</b> and commodity <b>terms</b> of trade. Average level of FDI inflows {{is associated with a}} 23 percent higher takeoff probability relative to a zero FDI inflow benchmark, and this effect is highest for the Latin America subsample, with a 65 rise in takeoff probability. Higher stock of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> external <b>debt</b> has been associated with a substantial negative effect on the probability of a takeoff, and the effect of the <b>short</b> <b>terms</b> <b>debt</b> overhang is largest for Latin American countries. Yet, virtually all the takeoffs were associated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. At the sample mean, inflow of portfolio debt is associated with approximately 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff. In contrast, a one standard deviation increase in equity outflows (inflows) is associated with a 47 percent (17 percent) decline in the probability of a takeoff. A one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with 28 percent higher takeoff probability. ...|$|R

This ratio is much more useful when comparing it to other companies being valued.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{structural}} model to price credit risk of firms with short-term and long -term debts.

In order to avoid the problem, we build a new model without path dependency by assuming the future face values of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>debts</b> to be fixed. Furthermore, by the improvement of the model, we show that the model can apply to the pricing of credit derivatives, and present the example of the pricing of a convertible bond. ...|$|R

This study used panel secondary data, where the financial statements of 12 manufacturing companies were selected from (2005 - 2012).

50|$|Due to the {{inherent}} {{structure of the}} banking system, banks transform maturity from liquid deposits to illiquid assets, which creates vulnerability to bank runs. Even in situations where banks might be solvent, {{in the short run}} bank runs create an illiquidity problem, where banks would need to borrow funds to meet the temporary deposit withdrawals. However, under this situation, it might be harder to obtain foreign funds, as foreign creditors may also panic depending on the degree of commitment to repay international debts. Moreover, the higher the level of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>debt</b> the higher the exposure to illiquidity problems. This models is particularly related to the situation in emerging markets, because of the larger role of banks compared to other financial institutions in these economies and because it is more difficult for them to get emergency funds from world markets during crisis periods.|$|E

40|$|The {{interconnectedness}} between {{capital structure}} and firm performance {{is a topic}} of high interest among scholars and management alike. The scholars tend to unveil the why segment of the relationship, while the management looks into the how side to promote capital structure policy which can optimise the firm performance. While many studies have looked into this relationship across multiple industries and spanning across decades of data, the current study trains its lens on Malaysian public listed company companies which operate in the construction sector, and with data window between 2010 to 2014. This specific sector was chosen for their high gearing which renders firms to relatively high insolvency exposure emanating from interest rate fluctuations. The five-year timeframe was selected to isolate potential data contaminations streaming from global financial crisis which winds down in 2009. Financial data of the company were extracted from Bloomberg Terminal based on a pre-prepared list of Bloomberg tickers. A total of 225 observations were recorded in this study.

The vertical financial analysis was performed to determine the liquidity structure at current assets and <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>debts.</b> Then convenient indicators of current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio were applied and interpreted in relation to cyclical deviations and agriculture specifics. From the viewpoint of liquidity measured using the current ratio, agriculture in the Czech Republic is stable and the current ratio values bear witness to solid liquidity, whereby the short-term assets exceed the short-term external funds. Research is to show whether the agriculture sector is liquid and whether the liquidity indicators provide the basis for solvency in the given field...|$|R
