5|$|In 1990, a {{bas-relief}} {{of influential}} <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> was sculpted over {{the facade of}} 235 Pine Street, a 26-story skyscraper. Timothy L. Pflueger was the only architect among those memorialized. In 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to {{change the name of}} Chelsea Place, a small alley leading to the garage of the 450 Sutter Street building, to Timothy Pflueger Place.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} demands of the arrivals, ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well. Ships' captains found that their crews deserted to go to the goldfields. The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts, as {{hundreds}} of ships were abandoned. Enterprising <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more buildable land in the boomtown.|$|E
5|$|With condo prices {{set from}} US$500,000 to US$2,000,000, many critics {{have noted that}} the One Rincon Hill complex is too {{expensive}} for most <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans.</b> With the total initial development cost of US$290 million, the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately US$409,000. However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of US$38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund {{in order to address}} this concern.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E

25|$|The {{circulation}} grew as displaced <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> {{moved to}} Oakland and Alameda County. The Tribunes editorial direction was then under Managing Editor John Conners. After 35 years as publisher, William E. Dargie died on February 10, 1911. Former Oakland Mayor Melvin C. Chapman served as acting {{president of the}} Tribune Publishing Company. Bruno Albert Forsterer (1869–1957), was publisher and general manager. He was executor of Dargie's estate. Bruno and his son, Harold B. Forsterer, also served the Knowlands and the Tribune.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on that stretch of Pacific Street were destroyed by the earthquake and fire of 1906. However the city's financial boosters then saw an opportunity {{to clean up the}} tone of the Barbary Coast, and transform it into an entertainment area which would be acceptable for every-day <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans.</b> Possessing a new sense of civic pride, the boosters invested heavily in reconstruction and within three months over a dozen dance halls and a dozen bars were rebuilt and operating. This new reincarnation of Pacific Street would be gentrified and tame compared to the lawless pre-earthquake version of the Barbary Coast.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s, <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> {{began to}} feel {{the need for a}} spacious public park similar to Central Park, which was then taking shape in New York City. Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the Outside Lands, in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco’s then-current borders. Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the {{underlying}} purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. The tireless field engineer William Hammond Hall prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California's first state engineer and developed an integrated flood control system for the Sacramento Valley. The park drew its name from nearby Golden Gate Strait.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatory kit {{was bought}} by James Lick, an {{eccentric}} businessman, piano maker, and successful real estate investor who was a patron of the sciences. It was intended for the City of San Jose, where Lick had built a mansion surrounded by exotic plants imported from South America and around the world. Lick died in 1876 before constructing the conservatory on his estate, and it was put up for sale by his trustees. The kit was then purchased {{by a group of}} prominent <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans,</b> including Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, who offered it as a gift to the City of San Francisco for use in Golden Gate Park. The Parks Commission accepted the gift and hired Lord & Burnham, a greenhouse manufacturing company from New York, to supervise the erection of the structure. Once open, it contained a large variety of rare and tropical plants, including a giant water lily, Victoria regia, which at the time was the only known specimen in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, {{more than}} two thirds of <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> {{approved}} of Brown's job performance. As mayor, Brown made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, Brown proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a US$100 million surplus. He helped to oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco’s budget increased to US$5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried {{to develop a plan}} for universal health care, but there wasn’t enough in the budget to do so. Brown put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened City Hall on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city’s spirit and pride.|$|E
25|$|Following the Mexican Cession of California {{at the end}} of the Mexican–American War {{the owners}} of Rancho Laguna de La Merced tried to claim land between San Bruno Mountain and Lake Merced. An 1853 US {{government}} survey declared that the contested area was in fact government property and could be acquired by private citizens. There was a brief land rush as settlers, mainly Irish established ranches and farms in parts of what is now the neighborhoods of Westlake, Serramonte, and the cities of Colma and Pacifica. A decade later, several families left as increase in the fog density killed grain and potato crops. The few remaining families switched to dairy and cattle farming as a more profitable enterprise. In the late 19th century as San Francisco grew and San Mateo County was established, Daly City also gradually grew including homes and schools along the lines for the Southern Pacific railroad. Daly City served as a location where <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> would cross over county lines to gamble and fight. As tensions built in approach to the American Civil War, California was divided between pro-slavery, and Free Soil advocates. Two of the main figures in the debate were US Senator David C. Broderick, a Free Soil advocate and David S. Terry who was in favor of extension of slavery into California. Quarreling and political fighting between the two eventually led to a duel in the Lake Merced area at which Terry mortally wounded Broderick, who would die three days later. The site of the duel is marked with two granite shafts were the men stood, and designated is California Historical Landmark number 19.|$|E

[...] Campbell and the <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> had different thoughts on the origin (etiology) of AIDS from Callen and the New Yorkers — Campbell described as [...] "crazy" [...] the idea that AIDS was caused by promiscuity, a perspective espoused by Callen and Berkowitz (and their physician Joseph Sonnabend) at the time — and the Denver Principles represent a [...] "careful synthesis" [...] of these two positions: ...|$|E

He {{was the first to}} come out publicly as a person with what {{came to be known as}} AIDS, writing a regular column in the San Francisco Sentinel, syndicated nationwide, describing his experiences and posting photos of his KS lesions to help other <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> know what to look for, as well as helping write the first San Francisco safer sex manual.|$|E
500|$|The Wattis Brothers, {{heads of}} the Utah Construction Company, were {{interested}} in bidding on the project, but lacked {{the money for the}} performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, Morrison-Knudsen, which employed the nation's leading dam builder, Frank Crowe. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon; Henry J. Kaiser & W. A. Bechtel Company of San Francisco; MacDonald & Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon. The joint venture was called Six Companies, Inc. as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of 6 in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> in the bid, where [...] "Six Companies" [...] was also a Chinese benevolent association in the city. There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.|$|E
500|$|The seated jury for White's trial {{consisted}} of white middle-class <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused {{from the jury}} pool. Some {{of the members of}} the jury cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that he was not responsible for his actions, using the legal defense known as diminished capacity: [...] "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood." [...] Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's [...] mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. White was acquitted of the first degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He cried when he heard the verdict.|$|E

2500|$|Lazarus {{was killed}} in October 1863. In the San Francisco Kaleidoscope, Dickson claimed he was kicked by the horse {{of one of the}} city's fire engines, but {{contemporary}} accounts say he was poisoned by being given meat laced with [...] "ratbane" [...] after biting a boy. <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> put up a $50 reward for the capture of the poisoner. A wit suggested that he be buried in a place of honor alongside other great men of the city. Jump produced a cartoon of his [...] "Funeral" [...] with Norton as the Pope performing the ceremony and Freddy Coombs—another San Francisco eccentric who claimed to be the reincarnation of George Washington—digging the grave. Notable <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> formed the cortège and Bummer looked on mournfully. This may have led to the rumor that large numbers of <b>San</b> <b>Franciscans</b> turned out for Lazarus' funeral. The dog was not buried though, but stuffed by a taxidermist and displayed behind the bar in Martin's saloon. (According to Dickson, Martin paid the taxidermist $50 to turn the dog over—even though its remains had already been claimed by the city council.) The Daily Evening Bulletin featured a long obituary entitled [...] "Lament for Lazarus" [...] in which they praised the virtues of both dogs and recounted their various adventures together.|$|E
