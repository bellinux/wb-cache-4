40|$|Juvenile hormone analogues {{have been}} tested as insect growth {{regulators}} in silkworm (Bombyx mori), seeking an increment of <b>silk</b> <b>production.</b> These chemical products, when applied in small or moderate rates, promote {{the extension of the}} last larval instar. To understand the physiologic consequences on <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> by the silkworm strain C 115 x N 108, the application of methoprene, a juvenile hormone analogue, was performed to evaluate its effects on larval development and <b>silk</b> <b>production.</b> Methoprene was topically applied 48 h after the fourth larval ecdysis, on the dorsal integument of the 2 nd thoracic segment of the insects, at seven rates between 0 and 20 ng a. i. Methoprene influenced positively the duration of the fifth instar and the weight gain of the insects. The application of 1 ng methoprene resulted in the heaviest silkglands, cocoons, shell cocoons and pupae weights. Comparatively to the control, the increment on <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> (approximately 24 %) by the use of 1 ng methoprene was more accentuated than the corresponding negative effects on the cocooning rate (approximately 12 %) ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>production</b> was {{considered}} the most valuable of the region during the 20th century. The vilayet had schools devoted to <b>silk</b> <b>production.</b> The region had obtained silkworm seed from France. Bursa was the heart of <b>silk</b> <b>production.</b> The <b>silk</b> is mainly exported, sometimes as thread or cocoons. In the mid 19th-century, a disease spread through the silkworm, causing a decline in production. As of 1920, the disease was eradicated and business was steady. Cotton production remained steady, and towels and robes were common items produced from cotton. Velvet and felt were also produced. Felt was used for saddles and other equestrian related goods. The area also made tanned leather and carpet. The city of Kütahya created tiling and pottery. Soap and flour was also produced in the vilayet.|$|R

40|$|Amasya {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cities in the chain of Ottoman silk manufacture. From the standpoint of Ottoman <b>silk</b> <b>production,</b> the early role of the city was in the way of being the entrepot of Iranian silk. In later periods, it is reflected in documents that silkworm-breeding and branches of work and <b>production</b> depending on <b>silk</b> reached very important dimensions. It is observed that from the last quarter of the 18 th century onward, tax records regarding <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> are mentioned more than the records concerning the tax of mizan-ı harir. It is also observed that at an accelerating rate within the 18 th century, records about mulberry fields and wormhouses are intensely mentioned. In line with what has been stated, it is thought that the dependency on Iranian silk decreased in time. Negative effects of the silkworm disease that was effective in the second half of the 19 th century were felt in Amasya too. To the degree that it is reflected in the archival material, it is understood that government officials attended perhaps most sensitively to the Amasya silk- production. When examined under the light of the documents and the information, it is thought that there was an Amasya <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> comparable to that of Bursa. Although the city of Bursa played a dominant role in Ottoman <b>silk</b> <b>production,</b> the total production of a few cities such as Amasya was able to nearly balance the Bursa <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> or perhaps provide a production level above that of Bursa...|$|R
40|$|The {{silkworm}} Bombyx mori L is {{an insect}} {{of great importance}} {{not only to the}} sericicultural economy but also to biological studies, and has become the most studied model system in lepidopteran genetic research. Silkworms have been reared for over 5000 years in China (Nagaraju & Goldsmith 2002) for <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> purposes, and an estimated 4310 silkworm germplasm strains, comprising geographical strains, inbred lines, and mutants are thought to be available worldwide (Goldsmith et al 2005). <b>Silk</b> <b>production</b> has increased steadily over the years, with a production of 125, 000 metric tons of silk in 2006 - 2007 (Deccan Herald 2007). The <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> in Brazil only accounts for 2. 4 % of the world <b>silk</b> <b>production,</b> with 89 % of the <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> in the state of Paraná. These values have been increasing every year, making this an economically viable option for Brazilian producers (SEAB 2009). The genetic diversity of B. mori is derived from hybridization of different geographical origins, mainly the Japanese, Chinese, European and Indian strains, which have distinct traits. Among these four geographical strains, silkworm of temperate origin produces a higher quantity of good, fi ner, stronger silk fi ber, whereas the tropical strains are hardy, tolerant to pathogen load and resistant to diseases. However, the tropical strains produce low amounts of silk, which is coarser and weaker. Hence, these geographical strains are very valuable genetic stocks for further improvement of silkworm strains (Goldsmith 2005). Several studies have been conducted to determine the best strain for silkworm breeding programs (Raju &...|$|R

50|$|Dating {{back to the}} Middle Ages, brocade fabric {{was one of the}} few luxury fabrics worn by nobility {{throughout}} China, India, Greece, Japan, Korea and Byzantium. Woven by the Byzantines, brocades were {{an especially}} desirable fabric. From the 4th to the 6th centuries, <b>production</b> of <b>silk</b> was seemingly non-existent, as linen and wool were the predominant fabrics. During this period, there was no public knowledge of <b>silk</b> fabric <b>production</b> except for that which was kept secret by the Chinese. Over the years, knowledge of <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> became known among other cultures and spread westward. As <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> became known to Western cultures, trade from the east began to decrease. It was discovered by Byzantine historians that in the 6th century a pair of monks brought the secret of sericulture - <b>silk</b> <b>production</b> - to the Byzantine emperor. As a result, western cultures were able to learn how to breed, raise, and feed silkworms. From this point until the 9th century, Byzantium became the biggest and most central producer for all of the Western world in the production of all types of silk motifs, including brocades, damasks, brocatelles and tapestry-like fabrics.|$|R
