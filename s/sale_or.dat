5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the BPI {{started a}} process of {{automatic}} certification regardless of original release dates, and since July 2014 audio streaming {{is included in the}} calculation of units at 100 streams equivalent to 1 <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> shipment. Hence, many of the singles released in the 2000s have been awarded certification in the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E

Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for <b>sale,</b> <b>or</b> relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E

Members of the Force could, however, not be punished for any absence relating to voting in a Parliamentary election.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, {{mephedrone}} is {{not specifically}} listed as illegal, but is controlled under legislation that makes compounds illegal {{if they are}} analogs of drugs already listed. In Australia during 2010, it was not specifically listed as prohibited, but the Australian Federal Police stated it is an analogue to methcathinone and therefore illegal. It is now listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. In February 2010, 22 men were arrested in connection with importing mephedrone. By January 2011, every state in Australia, other than Victoria, had listed it as a controlled drug.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{has owned}} Taito Corporation, which {{continues}} to publish its own video games, since September 2005, and acquired game publisher Eidos Interactive in April 2009, which has been merged with Square Enix's European publishing wing and renamed as Square Enix Europe. This list includes games developed or published by Square Enix after its formation and released for mobile platforms such as non-smartphone mobile phones, mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android, or the GREE service, rather than as retail games. This list does not include games published by Taito, but does include games published by Square Enix Europe. As not all games have been made available by Square Enix for <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> download worldwide, this list denotes if a game has been released in Japan, North America, and the PAL region.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} closed in 1978 and leased {{to a private}} company; however, the venture failed, and it closed to bathers in 1984. It was {{for a short time}} used as a trout farm, but was {{threatened}} with demolition, as an alternative to repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> long lease, and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from dilapidation. In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest.|$|E

5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, whether at a gun show or other venue. They also are {{not required}} to record the <b>sale,</b> <b>or</b> ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E
5|$|Under the Internal Security Act, the Minister for Communications and Information is {{empowered}} to prohibit the printing, publication, sale, issue, circulation or possession of any document or publication on the ground, among others, {{that it is}} prejudicial to the national interest, public order or security of Singapore. Doing {{any of the above}} acts in relation to a banned publication is a criminal offence. Among the publications that have been interdicted under this Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, and the Russian political newspaper Pravda. A similar power to prohibit the importation, <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> circulation of publications that are considered to be contrary to the public interest exists under the Undesirable Publications Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E

5|$|The {{disposal}} of military {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E
