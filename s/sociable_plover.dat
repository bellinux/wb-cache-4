50|$|The film {{is set in}} {{and around}} a bird-hide on the Suffolk marshes owned by Roy Tunt (MacQueen). Roy is a middle-aged, obsessive bird watcher, who needs just one more {{sighting}} (of the <b>sociable</b> <b>plover)</b> to complete the entire British list of birds. He is unexpectedly joined by a dishevelled and tattooed stranger, who introduces himself as Dave John (Campbell). After an awkward start, the pair build up a rapport, share lunch, have a drink and discuss {{a wide variety of}} subjects. Roy tells David that he used to work in a poultry factory and that his wife left him for another man.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village of}} Aral Nani also {{includes}} a 3-star luxurious hotel [...] "Infinity Rann Of Kutch" [...] located in Khatau Wadi region of this village. Aral Nani {{is located in a}} small band of land, just inland from the coast, where four distinct ecosystems (desert, coastal, grassland and upland) exists within a span of 100 km. Huge wetlands are created in a good monsoon year providing excellent habitat for resident and migratory birds, including the Flamingo City, which is the largest and the only known breeding ground of greater and lesser flamingos in India. The area together with the Banni grasslands and other smaller wetlands like Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve {{is one of the best}} areas to see rare bird species like the grey hypocolius, Eurasian eagle-owl, common crane, Dalmatian pelican, houbara bustard, curlew sandpiper, <b>sociable</b> <b>plover,</b> cream-coloured courser and Indian skimmer.|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} {{plains of}} Saudi Arabia are {{an area of}} approximately 231, 000 km 2, or roughly equivalent {{to the size of}} the whole of the United Kingdom. During previous ABBA Surveys in this area in late winter and spring significant numbers of wintering species such as Dotterel Charadrius morinellus, sandgrouse Pterocles sps and eagles and vultures have been recorded, as well as the threatened <b>Sociable</b> <b>Plover</b> Vanellus gregarius. The main objective of ABBA Survey 40 (30 January - 28 February 2009) was to assess wintering populations of these birds in northern Arabia through sampling methods. In all 21 timed walked censuses in the early morning and 25 driven transect counts (over a total distance of 1511 km) were carried out. Unfortunately most of the region had suffered a severe drought over an extended period, perhaps the previous ten years or longer, and in most of the survey area there had been no rain at all during the winter/spring period of 2008 / 2009. This lack of rain had resulted in a complete lack of green vegetation in most of the western part of the area studied. Consequently the census results showed low species diversity and small populations...|$|E
40|$|Kazakstan is an {{important}} country for migratory birds passing from Siberia {{to the north and}} east to their wintering grounds in Africa, the Middle East and India. Kazakstan also has globally important breeding populations of White-headed Duck and <b>Sociable</b> <b>Plover.</b> A survey of wetlands in northern and eastern Kazakstan was carried out july-September 1998. Important sites for migratory birds, White-headed Duck and Sociable P lover were identified. With the exception of huge wetland areas such as Lake Tengiz many of the wetlands used by migratory birds are relatively small, and a network of small sites rather than single large sites are probably most important. White-headed Ducks were found breeding near Lake Tengiz at Yesei, Sultankeldy and Kokai lakes of the Kurgaldjin lake system and the area is probably important for the species. White-headed Ducks were also found at Lake Alakol. Sociable Plovers were only found in small numbers at Naurzum and another small reserve in the same region. Human pressure on wetlands in the north of Kazakstan appears to be declining because of depopulation since the break up of the Soviet Union. Much of the habitat appears pristine and there is probably little need for conservation concern for the network of wetlands that cover the north of Kazakstan...|$|E
