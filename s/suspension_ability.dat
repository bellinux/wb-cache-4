30|$|Since {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to apply {{particle}} agglomeration in water or brines of similar carrying power, it was important to first test the fluid’s <b>suspension</b> <b>ability</b> at the required shear rates. Initial visual tests showed Baracarb- 2 and - 5 to be maintained in suspension even at the lowest shear rates. Baracarb- 25 settled out at shear rates below 275  s− 1 —a critical value for characterising behaviour—see below. As a result these large particles were excluded from further investigation in this study as we only deal here with aqueous carrying power as outlined above. The <b>suspension</b> <b>ability</b> of the fluid is governed by factors that include viscosity, particle size, and fluid velocity. There is therefore potential for applications of larger particles at higher shear rates or viscosified aqueous media. This is the focus of future research and is not germane to the study described here which focuses on small particle shear-induced agglomeration potential in water-like media, i.e. aqueous viscosities.|$|E

There are some difficulties in drilling “U-type” well, such as well-bore stability, cutting carrying problem, large torque and friction at the horizontal section, and formation damage to coal-bed. The objective of this paper was to show some applications of fuzzy ball {{drilling fluids}} on U-type wells of the Ordos Basin and prove the superiority of fuzzy ball drilling fluid in CBM drilling. To the three mentioned cases, the density of fuzzy ball drilling fluid was 0. 90 ~ 1. 18 g/cm 3, the funnel viscosity was 45 ~ 72 s, the dynamic shear force was 12 ~ 19 Pa, the PV was 13 ~ 19 mPa·s and the pH was ranged from 7 to 9.

40|$|Abstract. Density and {{viscosity}} are {{two major}} rheological properties that determine the performance of an isopropyl laurate (IPL) ester based drilling fluid. In this study, the effect of barite particle size on the IPL drilling fluid system settling behavior was investigated using five particle sizes namely- 32, 32 - 45, 45 - 75, + 75 µm and the unsieved barite. Stokes ’ law of separation theory was employed in the analysis. It was found that smaller barite particle sizes (< 75 µm) enhances the settling resistance. An ideal barite particle size of- 32 µm was chosen and used in the subsequent formulations to obtain optimum rheological properties by varying the amount of viscosifier used at 4. 0, 10. 0 and 20. 0 g marked as sample (a), (b) and (c). These samples were analysed for their rheology by using the conventional Fann viscometer calibrated using Bingham model. The results showed that sample (b) exhibited the most promising performance based on the plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (YP) and gel strength (GS) rheological analyses. Moreover, IPL drilling fluid sample (b) showed improve particle <b>suspension</b> <b>ability</b> for more than 78 hours when compared to IPL drilling fluid system prepared using unsieved barite particles.

Using cell <b>suspension</b> <b>ability</b> as an indicator, we studied the inhibitory effect of five Chinese traditional medicines/Chinese herbs on the {{activity of}} the red tide causing alga, Alexandrium tamarense, strain DH 01. The results showed that among the five herbs, golden thread (Rhizoma coptidis Huang Lian) and areca seed (Semen arecae Bing Lang) had the best inhibitory effect, followed by indigowoad (Isatis tinctoria L.), and the least effect was found in lightyellow sophora (Sophoraflavescens Ait.) and chameleon plant (Houttuynia cordata Thunb.). The lhLC(50) of golden thread and areca seed was 0. 054 % (w/v) and 0. 074 % (w/v), respectively. Moreover, the higher the concentration of the herbs, the higher the inhibitory rate (IR), and the shorter reaction time needed. Combination of two herbs improved, to some extent, the inhibitory effect on the algae. A mixture of golden thread and areca seed was the most effective treatment against cell mobility of this red tide alga, and the 1 h inhibitory rate was 70. 7 %. Next most effective was the combination of indigowoad root and lightyellow sophora. The best inhibition results in the experiments using absorbents were golden thread and indigowoad with aloe (Aloe vera L. var. chinensis (Haw.) Berg.); followed by areca seed with aloe, and golden thread and areca seed with kelp (Laminaria japonica). In general, the zeolite based algal inhibitors were less effective. The inhibitory rates of the algal inhibitors LA, LI, KG, KA and KG were all above 90 %, and remained high for 72 h. Our research results showed that the red tide inhibitors made with Chinese herbs, such as golden thread and areca seed, had the merits of low concentration, fast reaction time, and demonstrated a promising future for use in the control of red tides.

In addition, whether or not the ingredients of garlic solution had a possible algicidal effect was studied by comparing inhibition of A. tamarense by garlic solution and man-made diallyl trisulfide. The results showed that 1) inhibition by garlic solution was significant on A. tamarense, A. satoanum, A. catenella and S. trochoidea, and the least effective was a concentration of 0. 04 % on A. tamarense and S. trochoidea. Moreover, the higher the concentration, the stronger was the inhibition, and a high inhibitory rate (IR) could be maintained for at least three days when the garlic concentration was above 0. 04 %. For A. tamarense, it was also found that the longer the inhibitory time and the higher the concentration, the lower was the rate of resumed cell activity. On the contrary, garlic solution could not inhibit A. minutum or Chaetoceros sp.; 2) The IR to A. tamarense was reduced slightly as the heating time of the garlic solution was lengthened, but the average IR was still above 80 %. There {{was no significant difference between}} the IR of the supernatant and sediment of the garlic solution. Furthermore, no change of algal inhibition was found when the garlic solution was preserved at 20 degrees C for several days; 3) As with garlic solution, diallyl trisulfide inhibited A. tamarense strongly; the IR was above 93 % and was maintained for at least three days, as long as the concentration was 3. 2 - 10. 0 mg L- 1. Thus, diallyl trisulfide may have been the major ingredient in garlic solution which inhibited the algae but, in addition, more than one ingredient may have been inhibiting the algae. In conclusion, garlic was a good algal inhibitor with many advantages, such as being common, cheap, non toxic and with high efficiency, and diallyl trisulfide, one of the components of garlic, was similarly effective in algal inhibition. It would be useful, therefore, to further study garlic as an environmentally friendly algal inhibitor...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] development of methods to increase sintered density and improve dimensional tolerances is a crucial issue in powder metallurgy and ceramic processing. Increasing the packing density of starting powders is one effective route to achieve high sintered density and dimensional precision. The current paper presents an in-depth study on the effect of nanoparticle addition on the powder content of SiC and AlN powder-polymer mixtures. In particular, bimodal mixtures of nanoscale and sub-micrometer particles were found to have significantly increased powder volume fraction (solids loading) in the mixtures for injection molding. This observation to increasing packing density by using nanoparticles is surprising and novel since nanoparticles are known to inherently exhibit poor packing behavior. Additionally, for a given volume fraction of powder, the bimodal μ-n suspensions had a lower viscosity at any shear rate compared to the monomodal μ- <b>suspensions.</b> The <b>ability</b> to lower the suspension viscosity by adding nanoparticles to micron-sized particles has important implications for processing of particulate suspensions by powder injection molding (PIM), extrusion, slip casting and tape casting.

Three independently isolated mutant cell lines were characterized in detail. Analysis of {{the expression of}} the TEC- 1 epitope in somatic cell hybrids constructed between wild-type and mutant cells and between two mutant cell types revealed that the mutant phenotypes are recessive and that the mutants belong to, at least, two complementation groups.

Particle size, shape, morphology and surface topography were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compared with a standard triamcinolone suspension. The efficacy of these microparticles to enhance visualisation of vitreous against the triamcinolone suspension was assessed using an in vitro set-up exploiting porcine vitreous.

Using a novel approach for aggregation-free solvent exchange in CNC suspensions, here we show that protic solvents with a high dielectric permittivity εr significantly speed up self-assembly (from days to hours) at high CNC mass fraction and reduce the concentration dependence of the helix period (variation reducing from more than 30 μm to less than 1 μm). Moreover, our computer simulations indicate that the degree of order at constant CNC content increases with increasing εr, leading to a shorter pitch and a reduced threshold for liquid crystallinity. In low-εr solvents, the onset of long-range orientational order is coupled to kinetic arrest, preventing the formation of a helical superstructure.

At its core, multi-layer grids establish electric fields that charge and accelerate the particles.

One method of transport delivers the particles suspended in liquid through microfluidic channels. Another method transports the particles through micro-sieves as a dry powder. Advantages over current technologies include {{the ability to}} tune its operational parameters over a large range, elimination of life-limiting characteristics, and increased design flexibility. Note that other applications such as materials processing and nano-printing may also benefit from emitted high-energy particles. This thesis investigates several limiting obstacles, which are associated with charging particles, extracting particles from liquids, and overcoming adhesion/cohesion of particles. The results provide new direction towards the final thruster design concept. Here, the obstacles under discussion include: The ability to accurately charge the particles and to maximize their charge-to-mass ratios is investigated. Theoretical analyses and simulations suggest that restricting the maximum electric field at the particles’ surfaces is a necessary condition to avoid breakdown or field emission. With this constraint, spheres obtain greater charge-to-mass ratios than cylinders because they more uniformly distribute charge over their surfaces. Experimental {{results suggest that the}} charging models are reasonable under appropriate conditions. When transporting particles in a liquid <b>suspension,</b> the <b>ability</b> to extract them with an electric force while preventing the liquid from becoming unstable is critical. Theoretical modeling and experimentation prove that both spherical and cylindrical particles can be extracted successfully. But, it may not be possible to extract particles smaller than the micron range without inducing an instability, which leads to the formation of Taylor cones and limits thruster performance. When transporting and emitting dry particles, preventing particle adhesion/cohesion is important. Theoretical models developed here, which are supported by experimental results, suggest that an electric force can be use to overcome the adhesion of particles in the nanometer range.

40|$|International audienceAims: To {{demonstrate}} {{in vitro}} the potential use of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles to aid visualisation of vitreous during anterior vitrectomy following posterior capsule rupture and {{to compare with}} the use of triamcinolone suspension. Methods: PLGA microparticles (diameter 10 - 60 µm) were fabricated using single and/or double emulsion technique(s) and used as untreated or following the surface adsorption of a protein (transglutaminase). Particle size, shape, morphology and surface topography were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and calibrated against a standard triamcinolone suspension. Furthermore, the efficacy of these microparticles to enhance visualisation of vitreous against the triamcinolone suspension was assessed using an in vitro set-up exploiting porcine vitreous. Results: Unmodified PLGA microparticles displayed a degree of hydrophobic behaviour when in contact with porcine vitreous and also a high rate of dispersion following repeated wash cycles. In contrast, surface modified transglutaminase- PLGA microparticles demonstrated a significant improvement in its vitreophilic properties and were comparable to a triamcinolone <b>suspension</b> in its <b>ability</b> to enhance the visualisation of vitreous. Furthermore, this adhesive behaviour also demonstrated selectivity by not binding to the corneal endothelium. Conclusion: The use of transglutaminase-modified biodegradable PLGA microparticles may represent a novel method of visualising vitreous and aiding anterior vitrectomy. This method may provide a distinct alternative for the visualisation of vitreous whilst eliminating the pharmacological effects of triamcinolone acetonide suspension. Furthermore, the incorporation of drugs, growth factors and/or antibiotics within these microparticles may also be considered and exploited in many surgical applications...|$|R

5000|$|In October 2014, O'Neill {{was given}} another 45-day {{suspension}} {{as a result}} of a June 2013 violation at Belmont Park. By this time, O'Neill had accumulated 19 drug violations. The New York Racing Association also fined him $10,000. However, as happened in 2012, they agreed that he would not have to serve his suspension until after a major race, this time the 2014 Breeders' Cup. He was also given an additional 45-day suspended sentence, which would [...] "be served if he incurs another medication violation before December 18, 2015, at any US track." [...] Following his New York suspension, he was given a separate 45 day suspension in California, based on his violation of the CHRB restrictions from 2012 due to the 2013 New York violation. This <b>suspension</b> foreclosed his <b>ability</b> to train horses for the 2014 Breeders' Cup. In addition, California gave him an 18-month probation period on top of the 45 day ban, during which time he cannot have any further Class I, II, or III drug violations in any part of the USA or internationally. While his previous penalties were based upon the dates that assorted complaints were filed or adjudicated, this time the ruling was that the [...] "deciding event" [...] for any violation would be the date when the offense actually occurred. His assistant trainer was put in charge of conditioning horses for his stable, and one horse was transferred to a different trainer.|$|R
40|$|The target {{tracking}} system of an IR (InfraRed) guided missile is constantly subjected to disturbances {{due to the}} linear and angular motion of the missile. To diminish these LOS (Line Of Sight) disturbances the seeker of the missile can be built from a free gyroscope mounted in a very low friction <b>suspension.</b> The <b>ability</b> of the spinning gyroscope to maintain its direction relative to an inertial frame is used to stabilize the seeker LOS while tracking a target. The tracking velocity of the seeker, i. e. its angular velocity, is controlled by a feedback control unit where the signal from the IR detector is used as input. The electrical driven actuator consists {{of a set of}} coils and a magnet on the gyroscope. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a real-time model of the seeker gyroscope in an existing IR MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) missile. The aim is a model that is able to simulate the real system with consideration to the tracking velocity. The model should also be integrated into a hybrid simulator environment. With relatively good knowledge of the system and its subsystems an initial physical modelling approach was used where elementary equations and accepted relations were assembled to describe the mechanism of the subsystems. This formed the framework of the model and gave a good foundation for further modelling. By using experimentation and more detailed system knowledge the initial approach could be developed and modified. Necessary approximations were made and unknown parameters were determined through system identification methods. The model was implemented in MATLAB Simulink. To make it suitable for real-time operation Real-Time Workshop was used. The model design was evaluated in simulations where the tracking performance could be tested for different positions of the gyroscope. The results where satisfying and showed that the model was able to reproduce the output of the system well considering the speed of the model and the approximations made. One important reason that good results can be achieved with a relatively simple model is that the seeker is limited to small rotations. The model can be tuned to operate in a smaller range and the complexity can be kept low. A weakness of the model is that the output error increases for wide angles...|$|R
