50|$|In Overture, {{input of}} note {{data can be}} done by any of several methods: QWERTY {{keyboard}}, mouse, <b>step</b> <b>entry</b> MIDI keyboard recording, or real-time MIDI keyboard recording. Most notational symbols can be repositioned simply by dragging them with the mouse. Most other editing of notational symbols is performed by selecting the symbols using the mouse, and selecting the appropriate editing command from a menu or by clicking on a palette. MIDI data is edited in a special graphical view, where each note appears as a bar on a piano roll. Editing is done simply by adjusting the bars by dragging with the mouse.|$|E

50|$|DHFR catalyzes the {{transfer}} of a hydride from NADPH to dihydrofolate with an accompanying protonation to produce tetrahydrofolate. In the end, dihydrofolate is reduced to tetrahydrofolate and NADPH is oxidized to NADP+. The high flexibility of Met20 and other loops near the active site {{play a role in}} promoting the release of the product, tetrahydrofolate. In particular the Met20 loop helps stabilize the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH to promote {{the transfer}} of the hydride from NADPH to dihydrofolate.The mechanism of this enzyme is stepwise and steady-state random. Specifically, the catalytic reaction begins with the NADPH and the substrate attaching to the binding site of the enzyme, followed by the protonation and the hydride transfer from the cofactor NADPH to the substrate. However, two latter steps do not take place simultaneously in a same transition state. In a study using computational and experimental approaches, Liu et al conclude that the protonation step precedes the hydride transfer.DHFR's enzymatic mechanism is shown to be pH dependent, particularly the hydride transfer step, since pH changes are shown to have remarkable influence on the electrostatics of the active site and the ionization state of its residues. The acidity of the targeted nitrogen on the substrate is important in the binding of the substrate to the enzyme's binding site which is proved to be hydrophobic even though it has direct contact to water. Asp27 is the only charged hydrophilic residue in the binding site, and neutralization of the charge on Asp27 may alter the pKa of the enzyme. Asp27 plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism by helping with protonation of the substrate and restraining the substrate in the conformation favorable for the hydride transfer. The protonation step is shown to be associated with enol tautomerization even though this conversion is not considered favorable for the proton donation. A water molecule is proved {{to be involved in the}} protonation <b>step.</b> <b>Entry</b> of the water molecule to the active site of the enzyme is facilitated by the Met20 loop.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{cellular}} automata have visual {{characteristics that}} make interactive computer music performance possible. An application {{has been written}} using the Cocoa object-oriented language with Objective-C that allows the performer or composer to control which columns of cells are enabled for mapping to pitches and durations as the program is running. Other parameters that can be changed interactively include tempo, enable/disable for sixteen MIDI channels, and pitch transposition to any degree for each MIDI channel. Changes made to control parameters during runs can be saved to file and used to play back a performance. A <b>step</b> <b>entry</b> mode permits detailed control of all interactive parameters which saved to file {{can be used in}} the play mode to achieve a controlled rather than improvised performance of a composition. ...|$|E

40|$|Interferons (IFNs) are key {{mediators}} of {{the host}} innate antiviral immune response. To identify IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that instigate an antiviral state against two medically important flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), we tested 36 ISGs that are commonly induced by IFN-α for antiviral activity against the two viruses. We discovered that five ISGs efficiently suppressed WNV and/or DENV infection when they were individually expressed in HEK 293 cells. Mechanistic analyses revealed that two structurally related cell plasma membrane proteins, IFITM 2 and IFITM 3, disrupted early <b>steps</b> (<b>entry</b> and/or uncoating) of the viral infection. In contrast, three IFN-induced cellular enzymes, viperin, ISG 20, and double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase, inhibited steps in viral proteins and/or RNA biosynthesis. Our results thus imply that the antiviral activity of IFN-α is collectively mediated {{by a panel of}} ISGs that disrupt multiple steps of the DENV and WNV life cycles...|$|R

40|$|To study non-enveloped virus cell entry, a {{versatile}} in vitro model system {{was developed in}} which liposomes containing nickel-chelating lipids were decorated with His-tagged poliovirus receptors and bound to virus. This system provides an exciting opportunity for structural characterization of the early <b>steps</b> in cell <b>entry</b> {{in the context of}} a membrane. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a poliovirus-receptor-membrane complex solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at a resolution of 32 A. Methods were developed to establish the symmetry of the complex objectively. This reconstruction demonstrates that receptor binding brings a viral five-fold axis close to the membrane. Density is clearly defined for the icosahedral virus, for receptors (including known glycosylation sites) and for the membrane bilayer. Apparent perturbations of the bilayer close to the viral five-fold axis may function in subsequent <b>steps</b> of cell <b>entry...</b>|$|R

40|$|Simian virus 40 (SV 40) is a nonenveloped {{virus that}} {{has been shown to}} pass from surface caveolae to the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum in an apparently novel infectious entry pathway.

Subsequent to the <b>entry</b> <b>step,</b> the virus reaches a domain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum by an unknown pathway. This intracellular trafficking pathway is also brefeldin A sensitive. Infection is strongly inhibited by expression of GTP-restricted ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf 1) and Sar 1 mutants and by microinjection of antibodies to �COP. In addition, we demonstrate a potent inhibition of SV 40 infection by the dipeptide N-benzoyl-oxycarbonyl-Gly-Phe-amide, which also inhibits late events in cholera toxin action. Our results identify novel inhibitors of SV 40 infection and show that SV 40 requires COPI- and COPII-dependent transport steps for successful infection...|$|R
