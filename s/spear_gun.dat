2500|$|BioShock 2 is {{presented}} as a first-person shooter, with the player taking on the role of Subject Delta, a prototype for the Big Daddies 8 years after the events of the first game. As in BioShock, the player explores Rapture and fights off splicers, the remaining psychotic human population of the undersea city, using a combination of the environment, weapons, plasmids, and tonics. Plasmids and tonics are special genetic-reencoding liquids that grant the user active or passive abilities, respectively, and include many of those introduced in BioShock as well as new ones. For example, plasmids can give the player the ability to use telekinesis or to invoke fire, while tonics can improve the player's movement speed, attack damage, or damage resistance. Several of the weapons in BioShock 2 were previously seen carried by Big Daddies in the first game, including a powerful drill and a rivet gun. The player can use each weapon in a close-range melee attack, unlike in the first game, and is able to equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time, which they can use in quick succession to destroy enemies. For example, the player might freeze a foe using a plasmid then shatter it using a <b>spear</b> <b>gun.</b> If the player is killed, they are revived in the nearest [...] "vita-chamber." ...|$|E

40|$|We present {{fisheries}} landing {{data from}} two poor tropical countries, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Kenya, {{and show that}} each gear type has a unique and consistent partitioning of the species and functional groups it targets. Partitioning by gear {{can be used to}} influence ecological processes and biodiversity on coral reefs and to respond to disturbances such as coral bleaching. Hook and line capture a higher proportion of top carnivores and piscivores and target species with low susceptibility to coral bleaching. Traps, drag nets, and <b>spear</b> <b>guns</b> capture mostly herbivores and omnivores and target the highest proportion and number of fish species that are moderately susceptible to the impacts of coral bleaching. The use of specific gears can be actively managed to encourage the recovery of select functional groups and adaptively managed under conditions such as high erect algae cover, sea urchin dominance, low coral cover, and coral bleaching. We present a simulation and conceptual model that examine projected effects of the gear and effort on the yields in the coral reef ecosystem and suggest a mechanism for how this model might be practically implemented. <b>Spear</b> <b>guns</b> are predicted to have the highest diversity and yields of catch, but can also result in decline in herbivorous fishes, which has serious consequences for recovery and resilience of the system. Further understanding of fishing gear effects on specific fish functional groups at a broader selection of reef locations will be valuable in developing adaptive gear-based management in a changing climate...|$|R
5000|$|Her bow {{section is}} still {{relatively}} intact, {{and although the}} wooden decks have rotted away, she still provides an excellent swim-through for divers. Her entire iron hull is encrusted with coral and overrun by fishes (and the local barracuda named Fang), and the cracks and crevices of her wreckage provide excellent habitats for lobsters, eels, and octopi. Her wreckage was also featured in the 1977 filming of The Deep, including a scene of Jacqueline Bisset diving in a T-shirt.The wreck has been well treated over the years. There {{used to be a}} full set of wrenches (spanners), still visible on the deep part (each wrench being about 4 ft long and weighing over [...] ). In recent decades the largest of these were stolen by a collector, leaving only the smaller wrenches. Also remaining are a few brass portholes and even a silver teaspoon. The remaining wrenches are under 55 ft of water. Similarly the wreck features the [...] "lucky porthole", a brass porthole in the stern section which survived the storm intact and remains shiny by divers rubbing it for good luck. This porthole is considered [...] "lucky" [...] because the glass still survives.

40|$|Prey flight {{decisions}} {{in response to}} predation risk are increasingly being considered in conservation and management {{decisions in}} the terrestrial realm, but are rarely considered in marine systems. This field-based study investigated how the behavioral response of coral reef fish families varied along a gradient of subsistence fishing pressure in Papua New Guinea. Specifically, we examined how fishing pressure was related to pre-flight behavior and flight initiation distance (FID), and whether FID was influenced by body size (centimeters total length), group size (including both con- and hetero-specific individuals), or life-history phase. Fishing pressure was positively associated with higher FID, but only in families that were primarily targeted by <b>spear</b> <b>guns.</b> Among these families, there were variable responses in FID; some families showed increased FID monotonically with fishing pressure, while others showed increased FID only {{at the highest levels}} of fishing pressure. Body size was more significant in varying FID at higher levels of fishing pressure. Although family level differences in pre-flight behavior were reported, such behavior showed low concordance with fishing pressure. FID shows promise as a tool by which compliance and effectiveness of management of reef fisheries can be assessed...|$|R
