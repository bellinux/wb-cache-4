40|$|General Description: Perennial {{which stands}} about 10 inches tall. Each bulb has one {{flowering}} stem and 2 slender, flattened to channeled, leaves which are about 4 inches long. The inflorescence is a many-flowered, densely clustered raceme {{that has the}} appearance of an umbel. At {{the base of the}} flower cluster are 2 slender-tipped bracts that are broader but shorter than the leaves. The perianth segments are lanceolate, attenuate, finely serrulatedenticulate, bright pink in color, sometimes with the base being somewhat paler or even whitish. Identification Tips: This species can be distinguished from A. acuminatum by its more numerously flowered inflorescence and perianth segments that are nearly equal in length and serrulatedenticulate with involute margins. Phenology: There is significant variation in the flowering time of A. dictuon from year to year, undoubtedly related to the amount of snowpack and the time of snowmelt. It is generally identifiable in June and July. Range: Local endemic; restricted to a small area in the WA portion of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness Area, Blue Mountains, in extreme southeastern WA. It occurs in the Blue Mountain physiographic province. Habitat: Occurs at middle to upper elevations (4200 - 5200 feet), generally on rather steep slopes (0 - 55 degrees) with an unstable substrate. Soil substrates are derived from surface basalts and interflow material. The surface is dominated by loose gravel. Currently known from an area described as bluebunch wheatgrass grassland within the Grand Fir Zone (Franklin and Dyrness 1973). Known occurrences have the following associated species: bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), wormleaf stonecrop (Sedum stenopetalum), Grayâ€™s desertparsley (Lomatium grayi), whiteleaf <b>scorpionweed</b> (Phacelia hastata), hotrock beardtongue (Penstemon deustus var. deustus) and sulfur wild buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum) ...|$|E
