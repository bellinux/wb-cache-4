Although the magnetic field has a strong stabilizing effect, this flow, similarly to its hydrodynamic counterpart - plane Poiseuille flow - is known to become turbulent significantly below the threshold predicted by linear stability theory. We investigate the effect of the magnetic field on two-dimensional nonlinear travelling-wave states which are found at substantially subcritical Reynolds numbers starting from Ren= 2939 without the magnetic field and from Ren? 6. 50 × 103 Ha in a sufficiently strong magnetic field defined by the Hartmann number Ha. Although the latter value is a factor of seven lower than the linear stability threshold Rel? 4. 83 × 104 Ha, it is still more than an order of magnitude higher than the experimentally observed value for the onset of turbulence in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flow.

We endeavour to determine the rate at which the cross-sectional weighted average of a set of variables appropriately demeaned, tends to zero. One parameterisation sets this to be 0 (N 2 α- 2), for 1 / 2 <α≤ 1. Given the fashion in which it arises, we refer to α as the exponent of cross-sectional dependence. We derive an estimator of α from the estimated variance of the cross-sectional average of the variables under consideration. We propose bias corrected estimators, derive their asymptotic properties and consider a number of extensions. We include a detailed Monte Carlo study supporting the theoretical results.

40|$|CORRECTION. One of {{the main}} results in this paper {{contains}} a fatal error. We cannot conclude the existence of nontrivial vector bundles on X from the nontriviality of its K-group. The K-group that is computed here is the Grothendieck group of perfect complexes and not vector bundles. Since the varieties are not quasi-projective, existence of nontrivial perfect complexes says nothing {{about the existence of}} nontrivial vector bundles. We thank Sam Payne for drawing our attention to the error and Christian Haesemeyer for explanations about the K-theory. Abstract: Following Sam Payne's work, we study the existence problem of nontrivial vector bundles on toric varieties. The first result we prove is that every complete fan admits a nontrivial conewise linear multivalued function. Such functions could potentially be the Chern classes of toric vector bundles. Then we use the results of Cortiñas, Haesemeyer, Walker and Weibel to show that the (non-equivariant) Grothendieck group of the toric 3 -fold studied by Payne is large, so the variety has a nontrivial vector bundle. Using the same computation, we show that every toric 3 -fold X either has a nontrivial line bundle, or there is a finite surjective toric morphism from Y to X, such that Y has a large Grothendieck group.

This paper considers testing the hypothesis that errors in a panel data model are weakly cross sectionally dependent, using the exponent of cross-sectional dependence, introduced recently in Bailey, Kapetanios and Pesaran (2012). It is shown that the implicit null of the CD test depends on the relative expansion rates of N and T. When T = O (Nsuperscript 6), for some 0 < ε ≤ 1, then the implicit null of the CD test is given by 0 ≤ α < (2 – ε) / 4, which gives 0 ≤ α < ¼, when N and T tend to infinity {{at the same rate}} such that T/N 0 ≤ α < ¼, with κ being a finite positive constant. It is argued {{that in the case of}} large N panels, the null of weak dependence is more appropriate than the null of independence which could be quite restrictive for large panels. Using Monte Carlo experiments, it is shown that the CD test has the correct size for values of α in the range [0, 1 / 4], for all combinations of N and T, and irrespective of whether the panel contains lagged values of the dependent variables, so long as there are no major asymmetries in the error distribution...|$|E
40|$|As graphs {{continue}} to grow in size, we seek ways to effectively process such data at scale. The model of streaming graph processing, in which a compact summary is maintained as each edge insertion/deletion is observed, is an attractive one. However, few results are known for optimization problems over such dynamic graph streams. In this paper, we introduce {{a new approach to}} handling graph streams, by instead seeking solutions for the parameterized versions of these problems where we are given a parameter k and the objective is to decide whether there is a solution bounded by k. By combining kernelization techniques with randomized sketch structures, we obtain the first streaming algorithms for the parameterized versions of the Vertex Cover problem. We consider the following three models for a graph stream on n nodes: 1. The insertion-only model where the edges can only be added. 2. The dynamic model where edges can be both inserted and deleted. 3. The promised dynamic model where we are guaranteed that at each timestamp there is a solution of size at most k. In each of these three models we are able to design parameterized streaming algorithms for the Vertex Cover problem. We are also able to show matching lower bound for the space complexity of our algorithms.
