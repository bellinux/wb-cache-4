40|$|As {{with any}} rapid {{technological}} development, the biotechnology revolution is putting great strains {{on the ability}} of law to adapt to new challenges and threats. Although there is general agreement on the need to regulate biotechnology in many different fields of human activity (agriculture, life sciences, forensic science) domestic law remains deeply divided over the best approach to take. This book is the first attempt at covering the most pressing legal issues raised by the impact of biotechnologies on different categories of international norms. Through the contribution of a selected group of international scholars and experts from international organizations, the book addresses 1) the international status of genetic resources, both in areas of national jurisdiction and in common spaces such as the international <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> <b>area</b> and Antarctica; 2) the relevance of environmental principles in the governance of modern biotechnologies; 3) the impact of biotechnologies on trade rules, including intellectual property law; 4) the human rights implications, especially in the field of human genetics; and 5) the intersection between general international law and regional systems, especially those developed in Europe and Latin America. The overall objective of the book is to provide an up-to-date picture of international law as it stands today and to stimulate critical reflection and further research on the solutions that will be required in years to comePart I.

30|$|Given that plastic is {{persistent}} (see below) it can {{be transported}} over long distances, depending on local winds, ocean currents and geography of the coastline [11, 71]. Floating plastic debris accumulates on beaches and in oceanic gyres, benthic debris on the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in <b>areas</b> with low circulation [9, 11, 71]. The transport of microplastics in surface waters may differ from that of macroplastics, because smaller particles at the water surface are less exposed to wind. Distribution of microplastics may also be affected by particle aggregation and activity of animals [113, 114]. On beaches and in subtidal sediments, microplastics can be covered by sediment [11] and, hence be found at considerable depth [115].|$|R
40|$|Turbulence in shelf seas {{strongly}} {{affects the}} spread of pollution (such as oil spills) {{as well as the}} distribution of sediment and phytoplankton blooms. Turbulence is known to be generated intermittently close to the <b>sea</b> <b>bed,</b> but little is known of its evolution through the water column, or to what extent it affects the surface. Here we present observations of the surface effects of bottom-generated turbulence in a tidally influenced and well mixed region of the North Sea, as derived from acoustic and visual images. Although the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in the <b>area</b> is flat, we find that at any one time, 20 – 30 % of the water surface is affected by boils—circular regions of local upwelling—of diameter 0. 90. 2 times the water depth. The signature of individual boils persists for at least 7 minutes and, in accordance with laboratory and numerical studies, shows the appearance of eddies. The boils contribute to the replacement of surface waters from depth in unstratified waters, and may therefore enhance the fluxes of gases between atmosphere and ocean...|$|R
40|$|The {{demographic}} {{structure of}} a population of Paracentrotus lividus living in a coastal Mediterranean lagoon was studied in 1990. Analysis of this structure revealed that the population examined {{was made up of}} four distinct cohorts which represented individuals 2, 3, 4 and over of age. The variability in demographic structure as a function of biotope revealed that sea urchin migration occurred from the pebble area (recruitment area. high sea urchin density and overgrazing facies) towards areas made up of Cymodocea nodosa <b>sea</b> grass <b>beds</b> (growth <b>areas,</b> low density and abundant prefered food). These migrations seem to have been caused by food limitation in the former biotope coupled with a shift in diet in young individuals...|$|R
500|$|A second {{expedition}} {{to map the}} wreck of Scorpion was mounted in 1985. Only twelve days of search time would be left {{at the end of}} the {{expedition to}} look for Titanic. As Harris/Grimm's unsuccessful efforts had taken more than forty days, Ballard decided that extra help would be needed. He approached the French national oceanographic agency, IFREMER, with which Woods Hole had previously collaborated. The agency had recently developed a high-resolution side-scan sonar called SAR and agreed to send a research vessel, Le Suroît, to survey the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in the <b>area</b> where Titanic was believed to lie. The idea was for the French to use the sonar to find likely targets, and then for the Americans to use Argo to check out the targets and hopefully confirm whether they were in fact the wreck. The French team spent five weeks, from 5 July to 12 August 1985, [...] "mowing the lawn"– sailing back and forth across the [...] target area to scan the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in a series of stripes. However, they found nothing, though it turned out that they had passed within a few hundred yards of Titanic in their first run.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{have been}} made in shallow, small-diameter boreholes in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas off the Alaskan coasts since 1975. Methods for making access holes with light-weight equipment are described. These included augering, water jet drilling, rotary water jet drill-ing, and driving. Pipe or tubing was placed in the access holes and logged at discrete, closely-spaced depth intervals, usually one metre, t o obtain the temperature profiles. Temperature profiles in the Norton Sound area of the Bering Sea show that permafrost is absent except possibly very near shore in areas of rapid shore-line retreat. Subzero temperatures were found in all holes drilled in Kotzebue Sound, and in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Holes drilled in the Chukchi Sea near Barrow suggest that the shore-line is stable, or nearly so, and that ice-bearing per-mafrost is probably thin or absent a kilometre or more off-shore. In the Beaufort Sea (Elson Lagoon) near Barrow, the shore-line is retreating rapidly (i. e., a few metres per year) whereas. temperature pro-files near Prudhoe Bay suggest a retreat rate of a metre per year or less. The depth to ice-bonded per-mafrost, as determined by temperature measurements, increases with distance off-shore when the soil conditions are constant. However, ice-bonded permafrost may be found near the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in <b>areas</b> of very fine-grained compact soils even when these occur far off-shore. The thermal data has been use...|$|R

40|$|The {{precarious}} {{status of}} flat oyster Ostrea edulis stocks in Europe is widely acknowledged. To build a scientific basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above <b>sea</b> <b>bed)</b> and compared with oysters {{held on the}} <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> close to each reef module {{to test the hypothesis}} that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the first 15 months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> and at a height of 80 cm from the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were significantly higher at the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> than at 80 cm above the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> was significantly higher than 80 cm above the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18 °C and 15 °C, respectively. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of ‘reef oysters’ (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than ‘sea bed oysters’ (oysters held on the <b>sea</b> <b>bed).</b> Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> oysters. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe...|$|R

Althought geographical variation in filtration rate was also observed, this study suggested that the improved physiology of reef oysters in summer was still notable when comparing between different populations. An increase in filtration rate for reef oysters may, however, increase the likelihood of uptake of the protozoan parasite, Bonamia sp [...] However, haemocyte and haemolymph protein data suggested that there was no differential impact on physiology between reef and <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> oysters as a result of Bonamia sp. infection. Fifty-four epifaunal species including oyster spat were found on oyster valves in reef boxes whilst only 23 species with no oyster spat were found on oyster valves in oyster cages laid on <b>sea</b> <b>bed.</b> The epifaunal community on oyster valves on reefs was significantly different from those <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> valves but also had some species in common. Sixty-five mobile species were observed in reef boxes, whilst 47 species were recorded in oyster cages. These differences in faunal communities observed on the elevated reefs and <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> implied that the presence of elevated reef habitats created by O. edulis valves can enhance or accelerate local diversity in Poole Bay.

40|$|Abstract. The {{turbulent}} fluctuations of velocity {{have been}} measured, using an electromag-netic flowmeter, at heights up to 1. 75 meters above the <b>sea</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>area</b> of observations was off Anglesey, North Wales, in depths of 12 to 22 meters, on a firm, sandy bottom and during neutrally stable conditions. A {{number of records}} of the longitudinal (u) and vertical (w) com-ponents of velocity were obtained, and a few records included the lateral (v) component. From these the intensities, autocorrelations, and cross correlations for various time lags were com-puted and the corresponding u, v, w, and uw spectra were determined. Sufficient numbers of records have been obtained to enable mean values to be derived for a given set of physical conditions. METHOD OF OBSERVATION In the series of observations described below, the turbulent fluctuations in the velocity {{of the flow of}} water were recorded with an elec-tromagnetic flowmeter. A brief description of this instrument has been given by Bowden and Fairbairn [1956]. The measuring unit has an over-all diameter of 10 cm, and the magnetic field is produced by a circular coil through which an alternating current at 50 cps is passed. Two pairs of electrodes mounted on this unit enable the potential gradients due to two components of the flow of water past the unit to be meas-ured. With the plane of the coil vertical, the longitudinal component u and the vertical component w of the flow may be recorded. By mounting the unit with the plane of the coil horizontal, it is possible to record the transverse component v with the longitudinal component u. Using two units, the corresponding compo-nent, u for example, at two points may be re-corded simultaneously. The over-all response of the equipment was fiat for periods greater than I sec, falling to 50 per cent at a period of 0. 25 sec. When the flowmeter was used at sea, the measuring units were mounted on a tripod lai...|$|R
