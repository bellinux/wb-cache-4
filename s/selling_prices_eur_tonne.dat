40|$|A {{firm that}} {{accounts}} for consumer behavior sets the <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of a product considering the reference price of consumers. In the literature, a reference price is usually modeled as depending on past <b>selling</b> <b>prices.</b> That is, past <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> implicitly constrain the current <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of a product. In this article, the author explicitly measures this constraint with an optimal control framework. He works on the structural properties of a general demand function, which depends on both <b>selling</b> and reference <b>prices.</b> Analytical results prove the following claims. Adjusting reference prices effects increase the price elasticity of demand, the demand function becoming flatter. Thus, the reference price effect weakens the market power of the firm. Also, the reference price effect constitutes a main driver {{of the dynamics of}} the <b>selling</b> <b>price.</b> But contrary to intuition, <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> dynamics does not systematically imitate reference price dynamics...|$|R

The fur quality differed between groups with the poorest quality in the group of four animals housed in an enriched cage. No general difference between males and females was found. No difference between groups was found in the distribution of the pelts into the size categories. The size category and the quality of the fur were the main factors determining the <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of the pelt.
