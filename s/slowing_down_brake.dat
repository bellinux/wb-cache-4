5000|$|Brake fade {{typically}} {{occurs during}} heavy or sustained braking. Many high-speed vehicles use disc brakes, and many European heavy vehicles use disc brakes. Many U.S. and third-world heavy vehicles use drum brakes {{due to their}} lower purchase price. On heavy vehicles, air drag is often small compared to the weight, so the brakes dissipate proportionally more energy than on a typical car or motorcycle. Thus, heavy vehicles often need to use engine compression <b>braking,</b> and <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> so <b>braking</b> energy is dissipated over a longer interval. Recent studies have been performed in the United States to test the stopping distances of both drum brakes and disc brakes using a North American Standard called FMVSS-121. The results showed that when newer compounding of friction materials typically used in disc brakes is applied to drum brakes that {{there is virtually no}} difference in stopping distance or brake fade. As the United States changed its FMVSS-121 rules for Class Eight trucks built in 2012 to reduce stopping distances by about 1/3rd there was no recommendation to use either drum or disc brakes in the current law.|$|R

This study explored the nature of the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon intraoperatively and its link to surgical judgment. METHODS: Twenty-eight surgeons across different surgical specialties were interviewed from four hospitals affiliated with a large urban university. In grounded theory tradition, data were collected and analyzed in an iterative design, using a constant comparative approach. Emergent themes were identified and a conceptual framework was developed. RESULTS: Surgeons recognized the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon acknowledging its link to judgment and described two main initiators. Proactively planned 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 moments were anticipated preoperatively from operation-specific (tying superior thyroid vessels) or patient-specific (imaging abnormality) factors.

In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories of dark energy equation of state w(z) and deceleration parameter q(z), we present a comprehensive investigation on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA from both the theoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the impact of different w(z) by using six parametrization models, and then discuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we investigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive to the specific form of w(z); in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS 3 SNe Ia datasets favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA at 1 σ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an eternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible.
