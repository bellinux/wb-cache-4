5|$|In the {{autonomous}} northwestern Somaliland region, the Somaliland <b>Shilling</b> {{was used as}} currency. It was not recognized as legal tender by the international community, and had no official exchange rate. It was regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the enclave's central bank. Although the separatist authorities in Somaliland attempted to bar usage of the Somali <b>shilling,</b> Somalia's official currency remained the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.|$|E
5000|$|... 5 <b>shillings</b> {{notes were}} {{replaced}} by coins in 1985, with the same happening to 10 and 20 <b>shillings</b> in 1994 and 1998. In 1986, 200 <b>shillings</b> notes were introduced, followed by 500 <b>shillings</b> in 1988 and 1000 <b>shillings</b> in 1994.|$|R
50|$|In early 1816, {{a quarter}} (28 pounds) of wheat cost 52 <b>shillings</b> (£), rising through 76 <b>shillings</b> (£) in May to 103 <b>shillings</b> (£) in December.

5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali <b>shilling.</b> Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali <b>shilling</b> has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, artist Margaret Preston {{produced}} a hand-coloured woodcut depicting waratahs. The species also appeared on an Australian 3 <b>shilling</b> stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Another {{area covered}} by the work is royal finance, with the Leges setting out the rate of Danegeld, {{at a rate of}} one <b>shilling</b> per hide. It also covers {{judicial}} fines, setting forth a fine of 46 marks as the penalty for committing murder. The author of the work criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy. It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, <b>Shilling</b> Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.|$|E

5|$|Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly {{adapted to}} {{the taste of the}} English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a <b>shilling</b> is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and {{drinking}} for those who choose to purchase that regale.|$|E
5|$|A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains {{left from}} both termini at 04:55 and {{returned}} at 18:15. The LCDR {{was compelled to}} operate this service by Parliament {{to compensate for the}} large number of working-class homes destroyed in Camberwell during the construction of the City Branch. Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one <b>shilling,</b> ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.|$|E
5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one <b>shilling</b> a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
500|$|John Roby Leifchild wrote {{a report}} in 1842 for the Children's Employment Commission {{entitled}} [...] "Employment of Children and Young Persons in the Collieries, Lead Mines, and Iron Works of Northumberland and the North of Durham; and on the Condition, Treatment, and Education of such Children and Young Persons". Leifchild found that Losh, Wilson & Bell paid its workers 30 to 36 <b>shillings</b> per week for a scrap-puddler; £2 5 <b>shillings</b> per week for a pudler; 18 <b>shillings</b> per week for a plate mill-furnace man; and 25 <b>shillings</b> per week for an engineman. [...] The boiler engineer's family of wife and four children spent 18 <b>shillings</b> per week on provisions and 3 <b>shillings</b> per week on rent, leaving only 4 <b>shillings</b> for all other expenditure.|$|R
50|$|Bracton gives several {{examples}} of escheat occurring by a mesne lord (middle lord in the feudal structure): A enfeoffs B at a rent of 10 <b>shillings.</b> B enfeoffs C at a rent of 5 <b>shillings.</b> B dies without an heir. Is A entitled to 5, 10 or 15 <b>shillings</b> a year? While {{it can be}} argued that A is entitled to 15 <b>shillings,</b> it was Bracton's opinion that A should only be awarded 10 <b>shillings.</b> A enfeoffs B at a rent of 5 <b>shillings.</b> B enfoeffs C at a rent of 10 <b>shillings.</b> B dies without an heir. Bracton thinks A is entitled to 10 <b>shillings.</b> Bracton held this problem to be without solution: Is A entitled to the wardship of C's heir, if C held of B in socage, and B, whose rights have escheated to A, and held of A by knight's service.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} issues. The first [...] "large" [...] issue {{consisted}} of sixpences, <b>shillings</b> and half crowns (2½ <b>shillings).</b> The second, [...] "small" [...] issue consisted of <b>shillings,</b> halfcrowns and crowns (5 <b>shillings).</b> Some {{of the second}} issue were overstruck on large issue pieces, with <b>shillings</b> struck over sixpences, half crowns on <b>shillings</b> and crowns on half crowns. The most notable feature of the coins is the date, because the month of striking was also included. This was so that after the war (in the event of James' victory), soldiers {{would be able to}} claim interest on their wages, which had been withheld from proper payment for so long.|$|R
5|$|His first {{encounter}} with photography came after he took {{a position in the}} household of Lady Vivian, widow of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian; Lady Vivian's twin daughters each had a camera, and Brooks was entrusted with developing the films. Paying by weekly <b>shilling</b> installments, he bought a camera himself which he used to take pictures of prominent people for publication; his first portrait was sold to several newspapers through an agency, earning him seven guineas.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a <b>shilling</b> each to inspect her. She operated on the England–Australia route for almost 30 years, interrupted only by two relatively brief sojourns as a troopship during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. Gradually, {{she earned a}} reputation as the most reliable of the emigrant ships to Australia and carried the first English cricket team to tour Australia in 1861.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two <b>shilling</b> piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, at {{the time}} this budget was compiled, there was in that parish another family, not of four, but eleven persons, who had to live on an income, not of {{thirteen}} <b>shillings,</b> but of twelve <b>shillings</b> per week (eleven <b>shillings</b> in winter), and which had, not a rent-free cottage, but a cottage for which it paid three <b>shillings</b> per week.|$|R

5|$|Newman's {{determination}} {{to make the}} promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available {{in all parts of}} the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were about one fifth of those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one <b>shilling,</b> the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.|$|E
5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na <b>shilling,</b> which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one <b>shilling,</b> remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E
