40|$|Using {{data for}} the period 1972 – 2010, we relate the {{variations}} in the Barents Sea capelin distribution to <b>stock</b> <b>size,</b> ocean temperatures and the area available for dispersal during summer. We find a strong relation between distribution area and <b>stock</b> <b>size,</b> which is most likely caused by a large stock extending the feeding area to meet the higher food demand. However, {{during the last decade}} there has been a general expansion of the distribution area and a northward shift of the high-concentration areas, which we relate to the high temperatures and low ice cover observed in the northern Barents Sea during the period.

40|$|Abstract only. The herring {{stocks in}} the Northeast Atlantic were nearly fished to {{extinction}} in the 1970 s. This collapse is usually attributed to advances in fishing technology. The impact of productivity shocks depends critically on how sensitive the fish catch is to the <b>size</b> of the <b>stock.</b> If the catch per unit of fishing effort is proportional to <b>stock</b> <b>size,</b> catches will fall proportionally with <b>stock</b> <b>size.</b> However, for herring the opposite effect seems to dominate, a low sensitivity of the catch per unit of effort to <b>stock</b> <b>size.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine whether we can measure a statistical causal relationship between technological change and stock decline, and to determine if technological change was the cause of the low sensitivity of catch per unit of effort to <b>stock</b> <b>size.</b> To investigate the former, we define an ARMAX model by augmenting a ARIMA(1, 1, 2) using the price of herring and technology dummies. The price of herring is a proxy to capture changes in stock caused by fishing effort. We find that the stock was in fact resilient to all technological advances except the power block, which caused the collapse in the herring stock. To investigate the latter, we use an error-correction equation based on an expected revenue model to measure both the long- and short-run elasticity of harvest to <b>stock</b> <b>size.</b> Our results suggest that the low sensitivity of catch per unit of effort to the <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> was not long standing and can be statistically linked to technological change in the fishery...|$|R

40|$|The {{abundance}} of the Barents Sea capelin stock has been monitored using acoustic methods since 1972. Today, 25 years later, {{it is one}} of the few stocks within the ICES area for which an annual acoustic <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> estimate serves as the only basis for stock assessment and management. The methods have changed and a large development has taken place in the technical equipment since the early 1970 s. The time series of acoustic estimates from the annual autumn surveys, as well as the development of methods in the period 1972 - 1984 were reviewed in previous reports. Since then, another 13 years have been added to the time series and the development of methods has continued. Some amendments and corrections have been made to the software used for calculation of stock abundance, and in the present review all <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> estimates have been recalculated. Therefore, the estimates presented here may deviate somewhat from those presented earlier. An assessment of the goodness of the acoustic <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> estimates is attempted, but the lack of independent estimates makes this difficult. The accomplishment of a fishery regulation based on these <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> estimates in the past, where recruitment overfishing has been avoided, is put forward as an argument that no large, systematic, overestimation is probably taking place. On the other hand, when a small <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> has been estimated by acoustic methods, the situation has been confirmed by low availability of capelin to the fishing fleet, indicating that a gross underestimation is probably not taking place either. Results from studies on cod consumption confirms that the availability of capelin has varied in time with the acoustic estimates. However, the absolute consumption estimates on capelin by cod seem to be high compared to the acoustic estimates, and indicates that the acoustic method is underestimating the <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> to a certain degree...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} {{of a stock}} after severe exploitation is of major interest to fish ecologists and managers alike. Understanding the dynamics of recruitment at low <b>stock</b> <b>sizes</b> {{is crucial to the}} simulation of stocks as they recover. Compensation in recruitment has occurred in North Sea herring, and it was stronger {{after the collapse of the}} stock. The compensation appears to be a product of both increased production of larvae per spawner and increased survival to the juvenile stage. There is only slight evidence for depensation and the point at which North Sea herring has zero recruitment appears close to the origin. There is more variability in recruits per unit spawning stock size when the stock is smaller, this is probably as a result of the potential larger diversity in contributions from spawning components in an unexploited stock compared to an overexploited stock. Mimicking this dynamic in population models will increase the uncertainties in a projection of stock recovery. The lack of observations at higher <b>stock</b> <b>sizes</b> hinders our ability to compare the dynamics of recruit to SSB across the full range of <b>stock</b> <b>sizes,</b> however, recent apparent over-compensation at higher spawning biomass has resulted in less than one recruit per mature adult being produced per year...|$|E

40|$|Stochastic {{variability}} of biological processes and uncertainty of stock properties compel fisheries managers {{to look for}} tools to improve control over the stock. Inspired by animals exploiting hidden prey, we have taken a biomimetic approach combining catch and effort in a concept of Bayesian regulation (BR). The BR provides a real-time Bayesian stock estimate, and can operate without separate stock assessment. We compared the performance of BR with catch-only regulation (CR), alternatively operating with N-target (the <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> giving maximum sustainable yield, MSY) and F-target (the fishing mortality giving MSY) on a stock model of Baltic Sea herring. N-targeted BR gave 3 % higher yields than F-targeted BR and CR, and 7 % higher yields than N-targeted CR. The BRs reduced coefficient of variance (CV) in fishing mortality compared to CR by 99. 6 % (from 25. 2 to 0. 1) when operated with F-target, and by about 80 % (from 158. 4 to 68. 4 / 70. 1 {{depending on how the}} prior is set) in <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> when operated with N-target. Even though F-targeted fishery reduced CV in pre-harvest <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> by 19 - 22 %, it increased the dominant period length of population fluctuations from 20 to 60 - 80 years.

40|$|Models for {{fluctuations}} in size of fish stocks must include parameters that describe expected dynamics, {{as well as}} stochastic influences. In addition, reliable population projections also require assessments about the uncertainties in estimates of vital parameters. Here we develop an age-structured model of population dynamics based on catch-at-age data and indices of abundance in which the natural and fishing mortality are separated in a Bayesian state-space model. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to fit the model to the data. The model is fitted to a data set of 19 years for Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua). By simulations of the fitted model we show that the model captures the dynamical pattern of natural mortality adequately, whereas the absolute size of natural mortality is difficult to estimate. Access to long time series of high-quality data are necessary for obtaining precise estimates of all the parameters in the model, but some parameters cannot be estimated without including some prior information. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that temporal variability in natural mortality strongly affects perceived variability in <b>stock</b> <b>sizes.</b> Thus, using estimation procedures that neglect temporal {{fluctuations in}} natural mortality may therefore give biased estimates of fluctuations in fish <b>stock</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|E

There is only a small short-term economic impact on the fisheries but the long-term consequences are quite pronounced. In some cases, a higher fishing activity in the first few years after the change in population dynamics causes harvest sizes to remain stable despite diminishing <b>stock</b> <b>sizes.</b> This stabilizes the returns from fishing in the short run but veils the apparent negative long-term impact on the fisheries resulting from adversely affected stock dynamics.
