Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It {{has been suggested that}} [...] "creag" [...] was an early form of cricket. However, creag could have been <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different.</b> Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word craic here taken as an Irish word meaning fun, entertainment, or enjoyable conversation. This sense of the word crack is found in Irish English, Scottish English, and Geordie in North East England. In Ireland the spelling craic is now more common than crack.|$|E

500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E

When Galileo, having seized what the moon and stars could quickly offer, had turned his telescope on the next brightest object in the evening sky, Jupiter, early in January, Venus was visible in the predawn sky.

50|$|Some biographers, notably Ivor Brown and Anthony Burgess, {{followed}} Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown {{argued that}} she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,It is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold kidskin cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. <b>Something,</b> perhaps, <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.|$|R
40|$|It is time {{to rethink}} the {{domination}} of environmental law by a canon of major federal environmental statutes enacted in the 1970 s. Environmental law is in a malaise. Despite widespread agreement that existing laws are inadequate to address current environmental problems, Congress has not passed a major environmental statute in more than twenty years. If it is to succeed, the environmental law of this new century may need to evolve into <b>something</b> that looks <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> than the extant environmental law canon. The next generation of environmental laws must be viable for creation and implementation even in an antagonistic political climate; amenable to integration with other, non-environmental law; and able to make inroads against the monumental peril of global climate change. Environmental laws embedded in larger non-environmental programs and dispersed throughout government offer an alternative model to the environmental law canon — an alternative model that seems well suited to help environmental law address these daunting challenges...|$|R

But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much ‘language’ has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers.
