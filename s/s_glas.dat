5000|$|John <b>S.</b> <b>Glas</b> Fieldhouse is a 2,399-seat hockey {{arena in}} Bemidji, Minnesota, United States. It {{was home to}} the Bemidji State University Beavers men's and women's ice hockey teams until October 2010. (The men's and women's teams play in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.) The building, {{a part of a}} larger fieldhouse which {{contains}} the BSU Gymnasium and other athletic facilities. It was opened on November 17, 1967, and was dedicated on February 10, 1968. On October 1, 1975, the building was renamed in honor of John <b>S.</b> <b>Glas,</b> the acting president of the university {{at the time of the}} building of the arena. The Beaver ice hockey teams moved into the Sanford Center in October 2010. The Fieldhouse is now the practice facility for many Bemidji State athletic programs including Baseball, Softball, and golf. Bemidji Area Wiffle Ball began playing their games in The Fieldhouse beginning in 2014.|$|E

No electron, ion, or photon signqls were detected until crack velocities reached approximately K l 02 m/s. These observations {{suggest that the}} more intense fractoemissions r observed during fast fracture are due to dissipation of the excess energy associated with unstable crack growth, but more significantly that fractoemissions are not fundamental to crack propagation in <b>glas</b> <b>S</b> ELECT...|$|R
50|$|Duda {{was known}} as one of the {{greatest}} biblical translators and promoters of the spirit of the Second Vatican Council. He, together with franciscan Zorislav Lajos, started publication of religious newspapers <b>Glas</b> <b>s</b> Koncila that in 1963 become Glas Koncila. Duda and Jure Kaštelan were founders and chief editors of the translation of the Bible into the Croatian language that was published by Stvarnost in 1968. He and Jerko Fućak translated the New Testament into Croatian language and prepared new Lectionary in 1969. Duda participated in the founding of the publishing house Kršćanska sadašnjost and Teološko društvo Kršćanska sadašnjost in 1968.|$|R
50|$|The Bemidji State Beavers men's {{ice hockey}} team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that {{represents}} Bemidji State University. The Beavers are {{a member of}} the Western Collegiate Hockey Association and play at Sanford Center in Bemidji, Minnesota, as of the 2010 season, after previously playing at the John <b>S.</b> <b>Glas</b> Field House.|$|E
50|$|The Bemidji State Beavers women's {{ice hockey}} team {{represented}} Bemidji State University {{and participated in}} the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. This was the Beavers final season in the John <b>S.</b> <b>Glas</b> Field House. For the 2010-11 season, the Beavers will move into the Bemidji Regional Events Center. Goaltender Zuzana Tomcikova represented her homeland of Slovakia in Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Bemidji State doubled their win production compared to the 2008-09 season, when the Beavers claimed only six triumphs.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the on-ice success, in 2008 Bemidji began exploring options to strengthen the program. The CHA had lost many of the original member to programs at Findlay and Wayne State folding and other teams transferring to other college hockey conferences. Travel expenses to remaining members in Huntsville, Alabama, and Western New York and Pennsylvania was also a concern. BSU began looking at the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) as a solution. In a first step the university signed a scheduling agreement against WCHA schools, many {{within a few hours}} drive to Bemidji, Minnesota. Other than the WCHA BSU's only option was to end the historic program. In 2009 it was announced the university and city of Bemidji would build a 4,000-5,000 seat state-of-the-art arena to meet WCHA requirements, that the 2,400-seat John <b>S.</b> <b>Glas</b> Field House did not meet. With the news of the Bemidji Regional Events Center BSU applied to join the Western Collegiate Hockey Association in early 2009. Bemidji State along with University of Nebraska-Omaha (transferring from the CCHA) was accepted into the WCHA as the 11th and 12th members. BSU officially became a member on July 1, 2010.|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic {{definition}} of strong shape for compact metric spaces. (English summary) Topology Proc. 39 (2012), 27 – 39. The author gives an intrinsic {{approach to the}} strong shape theory by using the concept of continuity up to open coverings and the corresponding homotopies of the second order. This combines ideas from [J. E. Felt, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 46 (1974), 426 – 430; MR 0362206 (50 # 14648) ] and [Yu. T. Lisitsa and <b>S.</b> Mardeˇsić, <b>Glas.</b> Mat. Ser. III 20 (40) (1985), no. 1, 159 – 186; MR 0818622 (87 g: 55018 a) ]. A sequence of pairs (fn, fn,n+ 1) of functions fn: X → Y and fn,n+ 1 : [0, 1] × X → Y is called a strong proximate sequence from X to Y if there exists a cofinal sequence of finite coverings V 1 ≻ V 2 ≻ · · · of Y, such that for each n, fn is (Vn) -continuous and fn,n+ 1 is a homotopy between fn and fn+ 1. The appropriate notion of homotopy between strong proximate sequences is defined, and the paper concludes by proving that compact metric spaces and homotopy classes o...|$|R
40|$|A DNA {{fragment}} was cloned as cosmid purd 8, which encodes a polyketide synthase {{involved in}} the produc-tion of the angucycline antibiotic urdamycin from Streptomyces fradiae Tü 2717. Deletion of the polyketide synthase genes from the chromosome abolished urdamycin production. In addition, purd 8 conferred urdamy-cin resistance on introduction into Streptomyces lividans TK 24. Sequence analysis of 5. 7 kb of purd 8 revealed six open reading frames transcribed in the same direction. The deduced amino acid sequences of the six open reading frames strongly resemble proteins from known type II polyketide synthase gene clusters: a ketoacyl synthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein, a ketoreductase, a cyclase, and an oxygenase. Heter-ologous expression of the urdamycin genes encoding a ketoacyl synthase and a chain length factor in Strep-tomyces glaucescens tetracenomycin C-nonproducing mutants impaired in either the TcmK ketoacyl synthase or TcmL chain length factor resulted {{in the production of}} tetracenomycin C. Heterologous expression of a putative oxygenase gene from the urdamycin gene cluster in <b>S.</b> glaucescens <b>GLA.</b> O caused production of the hybrid antibiotic 6 -hydroxy tetracenomycin C. Polyketides form a large group of natural products synthe-sized especially by bacteria, fungi, and plants. The urdamycins (Fig. 1 A) are aromatic polyketides produced by Streptomyce...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{naturally}} occurring phospholipid, lecithin, in terms of its effects on athletes, apart from its link with choline. Although branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation was discussed in an earlier article in this series, it is appropriate to discuss leucine separately, since many athletes, both young and old, use it routinely these days. It is rare for individuals to be deficient in linoleic acid, since it is widely available in the diet, and consequently it {{does not appear to be}} taken often by athletes. In the late 1960 <b>s,</b> ?-linolenic acid (<b>GLA)</b> supplementation was first given as a therapeutic agent using mixed triglycerides with/without GLA in claudicants undertaking leg exercise. The majority of studies on GLA since then have been clinical but there is some interest in GLA as a supplement in athletes...|$|R
40|$|Bioactive glasses {{have been}} used in {{periodontal}} applications such as grafting infrabony periodontal lesions. We studied a bioactive glass S 53 P 4 for its possible antibacterial effects on the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotelfa intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans using agar plate tests. Also the colonis-ation of the bioactive glass with these microorganisms was studied by incubating bacterial suspensions with glass granules. Two precorrosion procedures were used to create chemically differing surfaces on the bioactive glass. The bioactive glass did not alter the growth properties of any of the tested microorganisms. P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans showed adherence both to the untreated and precorroded bioactive glasses. However, P. gingivalis adhered only to the precorroded glasses and was agglutinated {{in the presence of the}} untreated glass. Coating the untreated glass with serum or Actinomyces viscosus cells did not eliminate the agglutination. Thus, even though the bioactive <b>glas</b> <b>S</b> 53 P 4 did not alter the growth properties of the studied microorganisms it may in vivo beneficially modify the microbiota of periodontal lesions by agglutinating P. gingivalis.

40|$|The ω- 3 and ω- 6 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) {{are two major}} families of PUFAs present as essential cellular components which possess diverse bioactivities. The ω- 3 s, mainly found in seafood, are associated with many beneficial effects on human health, while the ω- 6 s are more abundant in our daily diet and could be implicated in many pathological processes including cancer development. Increasing {{evidence suggests that the}} adverse effects of ω- 6 s may be largely attributed to arachidonic acid (AA, a downstream ω- 6) and the metabolite prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) that stems from its cyclooxygenase (COX) -catalyzed lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, two of AA's upstream ω- 6 <b>s,</b> γ-linolenic acid (<b>GLA)</b> and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), are shown to possess certain anti-cancer activities, including inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. In this paper, we review the documented anti-cancer activities of ω- 6 PUFAs, including the recent findings regarding the anti-cancer effects of free radical-mediated DGLA peroxidation. The possible mechanisms and applications of DGLA (and other ω- 6 s) in inducing anti-cancer activity are also discussed. Considering the wide availability of ω- 6 s in our daily diet, the study of the potential beneficial effect of ω- 6 PUFAs may guide us to develop an ω- 6 -based diet care strategy for cancer prevention and treatment...|$|R
