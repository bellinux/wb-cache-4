500|$|In {{southern}} Sedgwick County, the Kansas Turnpike {{enters the}} Wichita metropolitan area. Exit 39 (Haysville) serves two of Wichita's southern suburbs. This exit is a diamond interchange with a connector road to Grand Avenue, which runs west to U.S. Route 81 and Haysville and east to Derby. It was built [...] Now in Wichita proper, the highway reaches exit 42 (South Wichita), {{which is the}} south end of Interstate 135. I-135 heads north through Wichita, the largest city in Kansas, toward Salina; US-81 joins at the first interchange and I-235 begins at the second. The interchange is a <b>simple</b> <b>trumpet</b> with I-135, and opened in 1956 with the turnpike, but the connector ended at 47th Street (now US-81) until [...]|$|E
5000|$|A trumpeter clock can {{be found}} in several {{different}} variations. The most common examples are known to collectors as a [...] "blowers" [...] or [...] "German buglers". These examples use a modified cuckoo type movement that produces a <b>simple</b> <b>trumpet</b> like call. Instead of using a wooden cuckoo pipe, these examples have small reed/horn assemblies. This varies from the large trumpeter clocks that use a large bellows system that feeds air into a wind chest. A pinned music wheel controls a series of valves to reproduce a complex musical tune.|$|E

5000|$|The Greek keras ("horn") and the Etrusco-Roman cornu (Latin for [...] "horn") were {{originally}} <b>simple</b> animal-horn <b>trumpets,</b> though both were superseded by more advanced instruments {{to which they}} lent their names.|$|R
50|$|The musical {{instruments}} of the Yimchungers include <b>simple</b> log drums, <b>trumpets</b> and flutes, {{similar to that}} of the Angamis.|$|R
60|$|And just as {{beautiful}} Christian maidens played a wonderful {{part in the}} last days of Pompeii, in winning proud Roman hearts to a hated and despised faith, so Mr. Parchester's naturally graceful gestures, and his <b>simple,</b> melodious, <b>trumpet</b> voice won back scores of our half-pagan rich women to church attendance and the social work of which his church was the centre....|$|R
5000|$|After {{reasonable}} {{success with}} Khod Balak Alaya last year, Walid Saad {{is back with}} five songs, including the title song, a catchy ballad reminiscent of both Jannat's Ana Donyetou and the solo violin from Elissa's own Ayami Beek. Ma Aash Wala Kan adds a fun air of nostalgia with the 1980s pop influence coupled with some strings, even though Nader Abdallah too seems to be reworking his lyrics from Ayami Beek here. Men Gheir Monasba delves into a darker theme, that of an abusive partner, but the quintessential ballad music and beats are slower and less interesting. Eisha Wel Salam is a more jazzy Latin number, and Elissa excels with the genre. Tamim's choice of <b>simple</b> <b>trumpets,</b> strings, and solos is perfect too. Masdouma is like much of the [...] "Egyptian chillout" [...] Tamim excels at with Tamer Ali, except it's composed by Walid Saad. The song is sweet and pleasant but nothing groundbreaking.|$|R
50|$|The title Trumpet refers {{literally}} to {{the main}} character, Joss Moody's, instrument. Moody was an amazing trumpet player and became famous in the jazz world. Figuratively, it could be argued, the trumpet embodies more than Moody's fame. Moody's trumpet serves as an equalizer of identity. The character Joss Moody {{is not a man}} or a woman, or a husband or a father. He is a trumpet player. The title of the novel gives his identity the opportunity to be that <b>simple.</b> Additionally, Joss's <b>trumpet</b> functions as a phallic symbol that allows him to navigate being black and Scottish by inhabiting certain forms of black masculinity.|$|R
50|$|Sweden has a rich musical tradition, {{ranging from}} mediaeval folk ballads to hip hop music. The {{music of the}} pre-Christian Norse has been lost to history, {{although}} historical re-creations have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the lur (a sort of <b>trumpet),</b> <b>simple</b> string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. It {{is possible that the}} Viking musical legacy lives on in some of the old Swedish folk music. Sweden has a significant folk-music scene, both in the traditional style as well as more modern interpretations which often mix in elements of rock and jazz. There is also Sami music, called the joik, which is actually a type of chant {{which is part of the}} traditional Saami animistic spirituality but has gained recognition in the international world of folk music. Sweden's most classic and notable composers includes Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald.|$|R
