50|$|After {{travelling}} {{back and}} forth from Guangzhou to Hong Kong every week for two years, Ho decided to open a wrestling gym of his own in his homeland of Hong Kong. He founded Hong Kong Pro-Wrestling Federation and launched its gym in Shatin, Hong Kong, where he and other Hong Kong wrestlers had been training. Notable wrestlers from the gym include Jason Lee, Ladybeard, and Bit Man.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adaptive}} admission control in cellular wireless networks ensures {{quality of service}} by reserving bandwidth for handoff calls. It is equally important in current second generation wireless systems {{as well as in}} the future IMT- 2000 and UMTS systems. In order to ensure bounded call level QoS we propose to track the changes of the handoff call arrival rate and integrate this information in the admission algorithm. However, the handoff call arrival rate can vary when the new call arrival rate and/or user mobility vary. In our previous work we have analysed bandwidth reservation techniques needed to maintain a <b>stable</b> <b>call</b> level QoS when new call arrival rate is changing in a group, or groups, of wireless cells. This paper analyses bandwidth reservation techniques that are adaptive to the user mobility as well as to the changing new call arrival rate, and which can ensure <b>stable</b> <b>call</b> level QoS over a range of user mobilities. We also propose the technique to derive bandwidth reservation policy when the QoS characteristics over a range of user mobilities are given...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the amount variation in four spectral and six temporal properties of advertisement calls between and within-male Japanese quail and to establish the effect of age of sexual maturation to these properties. The first, second, third syllables and damping parts were 68. 2, 74. 3, 501. 1 and 95. 9 ms long, on average, and had peak frequencies of 1719. 9, 1989. 9, 2203. 2 and 2352. 7 Hz, respectively. There was high between individual variations in all call traits. In relation to within-male variation, there were high medians and low ranges for spectral properties while low medians and high ranges for temporal properties. Moderate positive correlations between syllable lengths and age of sexual maturation, low negative correlations between interval lengths and age of sexual maturation were observed. Repeatability of the advertisement call characteristics were high, but estimates for spectral properties were slightly lower (0. 66 - 0. 82) than that for temporal properties (0. 89 - 0. 96). These results suggest that temporal call parameters have the potential to be used in individual identity and these traits might carry information used by females in mate choice. Spectral properties could be recognized as <b>stable</b> <b>call</b> properties that may be used in efficient transmission or species recognition...|$|E

40|$|Asteroids {{located in}} the 2 : 1 mean-motion {{resonance}} with Jupiter are classified as <b>stable</b> (<b>called</b> Zhongguos), marginally <b>stable</b> (<b>called</b> Griquas) and unstable (called Zulus) according to their dynamical lifetime. The stable asteroids reside in two separate stable islands in the pseudo-proper element space. In this thesis, we update the resonant population {{on the basis of}} up-to-date observational data and we determine orbital and physical properties of the resonant population. Using collisional models, we demonstrate that the observed Zhongguos and Griquas might be up to 4 Gyr old, thus their origin might be related to the planetary migration. Performing dynamical N-body simulations, we test two hypotheses of the origin of the long-lived population: the primordial population scenario, and the asteroidal capture scenario. Our results imply that the resonant population is not primordial but it was rather formed by the asteroids captured from an asteroidal family located in outer main belt...|$|R
