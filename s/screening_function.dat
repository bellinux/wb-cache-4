The Green Beret ODAs were deployed under the command and control of ODBs (Operational Detachment Bravo) which operated as roving AOBs (Advanced Operating Bases), these AOBs provided a mobile resupply function using their modified M1078 Light Medium Transport Vehicles which meant that the ODA patrols could operate for extended periods in enemy territory before linking up with a fighting patrol that would be escorting the AOBs for combat resupply. The 5th SFG was assigned responsibility for two sectors of western Iraq-the western and southern JSOAs (Joint Special Operations Areas-also known as Ops Boxes), one element termed FOB 51 (Operating Base 51) and commanded by AOB 520 and AOB 530, was composed of ODAs from 1st Battalion 5th SFG, they were stationed out of H-5 Air Base and were responsible for western Iraq. 2nd and 3rd Battalions deployed from Ali Al Salem Air Base as FOB 52 and 53 and were assigned to southern Iraq; attached to all teams were Special Tactics airmen from the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron to guide in close air support and manage the airspace above the ODA teams. A company element from the 19th SFG was attached to TF Dagger as were several regular and National Guard infantry companies to provide FOB security and {{to act as a}} QRF. As the prospect of war grew A company, 1st Battalion, 19th SFG, were tasked with liaison roles supporting conventional forces: ODA 911 and ODA 913 were to support the I MEF; ODA 914 was divided into two elements, one supporting the 3rd Infantry Division with ODA 916 and the other supporting British Forces; ODA 915 was attached to the 101st Airborne Division; and ODA 912 was tasked with providing PSD for General Harrell, the commander of CFSOCC (Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command). Responsibility for special operations in northern Iraq was assigned to CJSOTF-North (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-North/Task Force Viking) was formed around the 10th SFG, working alongside them would 3rd Battalion 3rd SFG. They were supported by the 123rd Special Tactics Squadron, 173rd Airborne Brigade and several companies of 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division. The original plan called for TF Viking to support the 4th Infantry Division advance from Turkey towards Baghdad but the mission was cancelled when Turkey denied staging rights to the US. Viking was assigned the task of keeping 13 Iraqi armoured and infantry divisions in the north from reinforcing Baghdad, the 10th SFG was to organise the Kurdish Peshmerga to support them.|$|E

30|$|Electrons scatter on charged impurities, heavy {{holes and}} polar optical phonons by the {{electrostatic}} potential. Consequently, this potential is screened simultaneously by the electron and hole subsystems. Such a screening drastically reduces {{the effectiveness of}} scattering {{and it should be}} taken into account in the mobility calculations. To our knowledge, however, the explicit form of the <b>screening</b> <b>function</b> for this problem has not been established. In our calculations, we have used the two-dimensional <b>screening</b> <b>function</b> for graphene, obtained in Ref. Hwang and Das Sarma (2007). One can argue that since the energy dispersion near the Fermi level is almost linear due to k–p band mixing and strong electron gas degeneration in doped semi-metallic HgCdTe quantum wells, such a <b>screening</b> <b>function</b> should be a good approximation. Recent experiments (Brüne et al. 2014) confirm the applicability of graphene-type screening for HgTe two-dimensional systems. For charged impurities scattering and heavy-hole scattering one should use the static <b>screening</b> <b>function,</b> while for the optical phonon scattering one should use the dynamic <b>screening</b> <b>function</b> at the phonon frequency. Our modeling incorporates screening for all three considered scattering mechanisms.|$|E

The spin and spin-isospin coefficients, with corrections to the usual Landau Migdal parameters, indicate the possibility of occurring instabilities with common features depending on the nuclear density and n-p asymmetry. Possible relevance for high energy heavy ions collisions and astrophysical objects is discussed. Comment: 16 pages (latex) plus twelve figures in four eps files, {{to be published in}} I. J. M.
