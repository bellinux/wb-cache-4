Principal findings are: (a) an historical simulation of the model without deficiency payments and import quotas indicates that these measures have reduced the variation in milk prices that would have otherwise occurred under this model, and price supports through these measures have resulted in greater milk production than would have accrued without price supports; and (b) a reduction in deficiency payments beginning in 1998 results in a decrease in milk prices and manufacturing milk supply {{and an increase in}} fluid milk supply and dairy imports, but fluid milk prices soon <b>stop</b> <b>declining.</b> The policy implications of such a decline in deficiency payments are discussed.

40|$|Fecundity {{seems to}} <b>stop</b> <b>declining</b> and {{plateaus}} at low levels very late in Drosophila melanogaster populations. Here we test whether this apparent cessation of reproductive aging by a population, herein {{referred to as}} fecundity plateaus, is robust under various environmental influences: namely, male age and nutrition. The effect of male age on late age fecundity patterns was tested by supplying older females with young males before average population fecundity declined to plateau levels. The second possible environmental influence we tested was nutrition and whether late-life fecundity plateaus arise from {{a decline in the}} calories available for reproduction. This hypothesis was tested by comparing average daily female fecundity with both low- and high-lifetime nutrition. Both hypotheses were tested by measuring mid- and late-life fecundity for each cohort under the various environmental influences, and statistically testing whether fecundity stops declining and plateaus at late ages. These experiments demonstrate that mid- and late-life population fecundity patterns are significantly affected by the age of males and nutrition level. However, male age and nutrition level did not affect the existence of late-life fecundity plateaus, which demonstrates the robustness of our earlier findings. These results do not address any issue pertaining to the possible role, if any, of lifelong inter-individual heterogeneity in Drosophila fecundity...|$|E

Key words: deficiency payments, price supports, dairy supply, milk pricing. The objective of this report is to quantitatively analyze two problems. The first is to determine the role that deficiency payments to producers of milk for manufacturing into dairy products played in developing the Japanese dairy in-dustry, analyzing the effect of payments over the period 1966 - 87. The second is to assess the effects of reducing the guaranteed milk price on the Japanese dairy industry and milk mar-ket. A nonlinear simultaneous equations mod-el of the Japanese milk market was developed to analyze these policies. The "temporary " law of deficiency pay-ments to producers of milk for manufacturing came into being in 1966. 1 This system was designed to compensate farmers for the differ-Nobuhiro Suzuki is a researcher at the National Research Institut...|$|E
40|$|Loss {{of habitat}} to {{urbanization}} {{is a primary}} cause of population declines as human-dominated landscapes expand at increasing rates. Understanding how the relative effects of different conservation strategies is important to slow population declines for species in urban landscapes. We studied the wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina, a declining forest-breeding Neotropical migratory species, and umbrella species for forest-breeding songbirds, within the urbanized mid-Atlantic United States. We integrated 40 years of demographic data with contemporary metapopulation model simulations of breeding wood thrushes to predict population responses to differing conservation scenarios. We compared four conservation scenarios over a 30 -year time period (2014 – 2044) representing A) current observed state (Null), B) replacing impervious surface with forest (Reforest), C) reducing brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater parasitism pressure (Cowbird removal), and D) simultaneous reforesting and cowbird removal. Compared to the Null scenario, the Reforest scenario increased mean annual population trends by 54 %, the Remove cowbirds scenario increased mean annual population trends by 38 %, and the scenario combining reforestation and cowbird removal increased mean annual population trends by 98 %. Mean annual growth rates (λ) per site were greater in the Reforest (λ = 0. 94) and Remove cowbirds (λ = 0. 92) compared to the Null (λ = 0. 88) model scenarios. However, only by combining {{the positive effects of}} reforestation and cowbird removal did wood thrush populations <b>stop</b> <b>declining</b> (λ = 1. 00). Our results suggest that independently replacing impervious surface with forest habitat around forest patches and removing cowbirds may slow current negative population trends. Furthermore, conservation efforts that combine reforestation and cowbird removal may potentially benefit populations of wood thrushes and other similarly forest-breeding songbird species within urbanized fragmented landscapes that typify the mid-Atlantic United States...|$|E
40|$|Low {{long-chain}} PUFA (LC-PUFA, or LCP) consumption {{relates to}} suboptimal neurodevelopment, coronary artery disease, and [postpartum (PP) ] depression. Maternal-to-infant LCP transport during {{pregnancy and lactation}} is {{at the expense of}} maternal status, a process known as biomagnification. Despite biomagnification, maternal and infant LCP status generally declines during lactation. To assess the 1) turning point of biomagnification [level from which maternal (m) LCP status exceeds infant (i) LCP status]; 2) LCP equilibrium (steady-state-level from which mRBC-LCP <b>stop</b> <b>declining</b> during lactation); 3) corresponding iLCP-status; and 4) the relationship between RBC-DHA and RBC-arachidonic acid (AA), we measured RBC-fatty acids in 193 Tanzanian mother-infant pairs with no, intermediate (2 - 3 times/wk), and high (4 - 5 times/wk) freshwater fish consumption at delivery and after 3 mo of exclusive breast-feeding. At 3 mo, mRBC-DHA was lower than the corresponding iRBC-DHA up to a mRBC-DHA of 7. 9 g%. mRBC-DHA equilibrium, with equivalent mRBC-DHA at both delivery and at 3 mo PP, occurred at 8. 1 g%. This mRBC-DHA equilibrium of 8. 1 g% corresponded with an iRBC-DHA of 7. 1 - 7. 2 g% at delivery that increased to 8. 0 g% at 3 mo. We found between-group differences in mRBC-AA; however, no differences in iRBC-AA were observed at delivery or 3 mo. Relations between RBC-DHA and RBC-AA were bell-shaped. We conclude that, at steady-state LOP intakes during lactation: 1) biomagnification occurs up to 8 g% mRBC-DHA; 2) mRBC-DHA equilibrium is reached at 8 g%; 3) mRBC-DHA equilibrium corresponds with an iRBC-DHA of 7 g% at delivery and 8 g% after 3 mo; 4) unlike RBC-DHA, mRBC-AA and iRBC-AA are independently regulated in these populations; and 5) bell-shaped RBC-DHA vs. RBC-AA-relations might support uniform iRBC-AA. A (maternal) RBC-DHA of 8 g% might be optimal for infant neurodevelopment and adult cardiovascular disease incidence. J. Nutr. 141 : 418 - 427, 2011...|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a new model of the effect of the California tobacco control program on smoking behavior and healthcare expenditure, and forecasts four alternative funding scenarios for the California tobacco control program. We use time series regression analysis of aggregate data on tobacco control program funding, smoking behavior and health care expenditures in California compared to control states. The estimates measure the difference in smoking behavior and health care expenditures between California and the control states that can be attributed to differences in tobacco control funding. We use two different estimation methods to check the analysis and find that both produce almost identical results. If the current funding levels are continued at 5 cents per pack (established by 1988 ’s Proposition 99), the baseline scenario, then California smoking prevalence will <b>stop</b> <b>declining</b> increase from 12. 9 % to 13. 3 % between 2012 and 2016 and cigarette consumption per smoker will increase from 233 to 253 packs per year from 2012 to 2016. By 2016, prevalence and consumption per smoker would increase by 9 % and 14 % from the level in 2011, respectively.  The contribution of smoking to healthcare costs in California will also begin to increase. Cutting the funding level by half would to 2. 5 cents per pack initially result in $ 39 million less in cumulative tobacco control spending per year. This reduction in spending will result in an increase in both prevalence and cigarettes consumed per smoker. Prevalence rises from about 13 % to 13. 5 % from 2012 to 2016 and cigarette consumption per smoker increases from 235 to 261 packs per year. By 2016, prevalence and consumption per smoker would increase by 10 % and 17 % from the level in 2011, respectively. Compared to the baseline scenario, there would be 134 million more packs of cigarettes sold (worth $ 508 million the tobacco industry in pre-tax sales) and a cumulative increase in total California healthcare costs between 2012 and 2016 would be $ 2. 2 billion. An increase in funding by $ 0. 20 per pack (to a total of $ 0. 25 per pack) from the $ 1. 00 tobacco tax increase (i. e., the proposed California Cancer Research Act initiative) would restore the decline in current smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker. Prevalence would decrease from about 11. 2 % to 10. 9 % between 2012 and 2016 and cigarette consumption per smoker would decrease from 199 to 189 cigarettes per year. By 2016, prevalence and consumption per smoker would decrease by 11 % and 15 % from the level in 2011, respectively. Compared to the baseline scenario, a total of 1. 6 billion fewer packs of cigarettes would be smoked (worth $ 7. 2 billion in pre-tax sales to the tobacco industry) and total healthcare costs would be reduced by $ 28. 2 billion. An increase in per capita funding to the level recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Best Practicesfor California ($ 12. 12 per capita, or 56 cents per pack), would initiate a rapid decline in smoking prevalence and a drop in consumption.  Doing so would require increasing annual funding for the California Tobacco Control Program from $ 77. 8 million in 2009 to a about $ 481 million per year.  Smoking prevalence would decrease from about 12 % to 11. 1 % between 2012 and 2016 and cigarette consumption per smoker would decrease from 210 to 139 packs per year. By 2016, prevalence and consumption per smoker would decrease by 10 % and 38 % from the level in 2011, respectively.  Compared to the baseline scenario, total cigarette consumption would fall by 1. 7 billion packs (worth $ 6. 5 billion in pre-tax sales to the tobacco industry) and reduce cumulative total healthcare costs by $ 31. 6 billion.   Table. Changes in current smoking prevalence and consumption per smoker, California healthcare costs and tobacco industry revenues between 2011 and 2016 under four scenarios Scenario Percent change between 2011 and 2016 Change in California Health Care Costs Change in Tobacco Industry Sales Prevalence Consumption per Smoker 1. Status quo (baseline) : $ 0. 05 per pack + 9 % + 14 % Baseline Baseline 2. Cut program in half: $ 0. 025 per pack + 10 % + 17 % + $ 2. 2 billion +$ 0. 5 billion 3. Enact Calif Cancer Res Act: $ 0. 25 per pack and $ 1 tax increase - 11 % - 15 % -$ 28. 2 billion -$ 7. 2 billion 4. CDC recommended funding: $ 12. 12 per capita ($ 0. 056 per pack) - 10 % - 38 % -$ 31. 6 billion -$ 6. 5 billion   NOTE:  See Addendum {{at the end of this}} report for updated values for these estimates.              The forecast results indicate that if the current level of California tobacco control funding continues at the current 5 cents per pack, then smoking prevalence and consumption per smoker will slowly start to increase over time and estimated healthcare savings due to the reduction in smoking in California will be gradually eroded.  In order to continue progress in reducing harmful smoking behaviors in California, per capita funding for tobacco control programs should be substantially increased. Increasing per capita funding with a $ 1 excise tax increase as proposed in the California Cancer Research Act that devotes an additional $ 0. 20 per pack sold or increasing per capita funding to the level recommended for California by the CDC would reduce smoking behavior at rates similar to those seen in earlier years of the California program, together with the attendant large reductions in healthcare costs that the California Tobacco Control Program created...|$|E
