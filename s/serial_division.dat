40|$|AbstractAnnelida, {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} Polychaeta and Clitellata, {{are characterized by}} <b>serial</b> <b>division</b> of their body into numerous similar structures, the segments. In addition, there is a non-segmental part at the front end, the prostomium, and one at the back, the pygidium. New segments develop in a prepygidial proliferation zone. Each segment contains four groups of chaetae made up of β-chitin, a pair of coelomic cavities separated by mesenteries, and septa. The nervous system is a rope-ladder-like ventral nerve cord with a dorsal brain in the prostomium. For the last stem species a trochophore larva and a benthic adult are commonly postulated. There are two conflicting hypotheses describing the systematization of Annelida: the first postulates a sister-group relationship of Polychaeta and Clitellata, the second sees Clitellata as a highly derived taxon forming a subordinate taxon within the polychaetes which, consequently, are regarded as paraphyletic. Depending on the hypothesis, different characters have to be postulated for the stem species of Annelida. Besides segmentation other characters such as nuchal organs, palps and antennae, body wall musculature, cuticle, parapodia as well as structure of {{the central nervous system}} and the foregut {{play an important role in}} this discussion. Here, the different characters and character states are critically reviewed and analyzed with respect to morphology and function. The consequences for systematization of their phylogenetic interpretation as autapomorphies, synapomorphies or plesiomorphies are outlined. The resulting hypotheses are compared with those relying on molecular data sets...|$|E
40|$|Deconvolution is a {{technique}} used in many fields. In spectroscopy, deconvolution is used to unfold the broaden effect caused by the measuring instruments. Consequently, {{the resolution of the}} spectra will enhance. In electron impact (EI) ionization, deconvolution is used to totally or partially remove the Boltzmann type thermal electron energy spreading of the EI data. In this study five deconvolution methods were investigated. They were <b>serial</b> <b>division</b> method, inverse convolver method, electron energy distribution difference method, iterative deconvolution method, and Fourier transform deconvolution method. An EAI QUAD 250 mass spectrometer was used to collect the EI data of calibrant gases and the high temperature copper fluorides. A PDP 8 /e minicomputer was interfaced to the mass spectrometer for data acquisition and signal averaging. The signal averaging data was then deconvoluted using a Sigma- 9 computer. Prior to the application of deconvolution to an experimental data, a synthetic data was used to study the iterative deconvolution method and the Fourier transform method. The effect of several parameters on the deconvolution result was identified. In the study of experimental data, Fourier transform deconvolution and iterative method of data smoothing were used. The electron energy spreading, called the instrument function (IF), was obtained from the second derivative of helium ionization efficiency (IE) data. Th IF obtained from this mass spectrometer was different from the Boltzmann type of energy distribution. The unfolded spectra were obtained by deconvoluting the signal averaging EI data with the instrument function. From the unfolded spectra, the high temperature ionization potential and appearance potential of copper monofluoride were determined...|$|E

The proportion of cultures, prepared {{from a single}} blood sample, capable of yielding cell lines varied from 0 - 100 %.

40|$|SummarySustained {{blood cell}} {{production}} depends on divisions by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that yield both differentiating progeny {{as well as}} new HSCs via self-renewal. Differentiating progeny remain capable of self-renewal, but only HSCs sustain self-renewal through successive divisions securely enough to maintain clones that persist life-long. Until recently, the first identified next stage consisted of “short-term” reconstituting cells able to sustain clones of differentiating cells for only 4 – 6 weeks. Here we expand evidence for a numerically dominant “intermediate-term” multipotent HSC stage in mice whose clones persist for 6 – 8 months before becoming extinct and that are separable from both short-term as well as permanently reconstituting “long-term” HSCs. The findings suggest that the first step in stem cell differentiation consists not in loss of initial capacity for <b>serial</b> self-renewal <b>divisions,</b> but rather in loss of mechanisms that stabilize self-renewing behavior throughout successive future stem cell divisions...|$|R

40|$|We {{constructed}} Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains {{that carry}} phenylalanine, instead of arginine, as residue 116 of calmodulin by site-directed mutagenesis of the cam 1 gene. Whereas haploid strains carrying the mutant allele, designated cam 1 -F 116, exhibit no defects in growth and mating, diploid strains homozygous for cam 1 -F 116 are deficient in sporulation. The four nuclei {{generated by the}} two <b>serial</b> meiotic <b>divisions</b> are not encapsulated in these diploids. The mutation is recessive. Semiquantitative analysis using polyclonal antibodies showed that vegetatively growing cam 1 -F 116 cells have a smaller amount of calmodulin than wild-type cells.

In addition to this in vivo observation, we showed in vitro that the mutant protein is susceptible to a proteolytic activity induced by nitrogen starvation that hardly affects the wild-type calmodulin. Thus, the sporulation deficiency of the cam 1 -F 116 mutant may be ascribed to shortage of calmodulin due to proteolysis of the mutant molecules under nitrogen starvation.

40|$|Coordination of cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation {{is crucial for}} tissue formation, repair and regeneration. Some tissues, such as skin and blood, depend on differentiation of a pluripotent stem cell population, whereas others depend on the division of differentiated cells. In development and in the hair follicle, pigmented melanocytes are derived from undifferentiated precursor cells or stem cells. However, differentiated melanocytes may also have proliferative capacity in animals, {{and the potential for}} differentiated melanocyte cell division in development and regeneration remains largely unexplored. Here, we use time-lapse imaging of the developing zebrafish to show that while most melanocytes arise from undifferentiated precursor cells, an unexpected subpopulation of differentiated melanocytes arises by cell division. Depletion of the overall melanocyte population triggers a regeneration phase in which differentiated melanocyte division is significantly enhanced, particularly in young differentiated melanocytes. Additionally, we find reduced levels of Mitf activity using an mitfa temperature-sensitive line results in a dramatic increase in differentiated melanocyte cell division. This supports models that in addition to promoting differentiation, Mitf also promotes withdrawal from the cell cycle. We suggest differentiated cell division is relevant to melanoma progression because the human melanoma mutation MITF 4 TΔ 2 B promotes increased and <b>serial</b> differentiated melanocyte <b>division</b> in zebrafish. These results reveal a novel pathway of differentiated melanocyte division in vivo, and that Mitf activity is essential for maintaining cell cycle arrest in differentiated melanocytes...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCaenorhabditis elegans embryos rapidly diversify cell fate using a {{modified}} Wnt/β-catenin signaling strategy {{to carry out}} <b>serial</b> asymmetric cell <b>divisions</b> (ACDs). Wnt-dependent ACDs rely on nuclear asymmetry of the transcriptional coactivator SYS- 1 /β-catenin between daughter cells to differentially activate Wnt-responsive target genes. Here, we investigate how dynamic localization of SYS- 1 to mitotic centrosomes influences SYS- 1 inheritance in daughter cells and cell-fate outcomes after ACD. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identify the centrosomal protein RSA- 2 as a SYS- 1 binding partner and show that localization of SYS- 1 to mitotic centrosomes is dependent on RSA- 2. Uncoupling SYS- 1 from the centrosome by RSA- 2 depletion increases SYS- 1 inheritance after ACD and promotes Wnt-dependent cell fate. Photobleaching experiments reveal that centrosome-bound SYS- 1 turns over rapidly. Interestingly, disruption of the proteasome leads to an increased accumulation of SYS- 1 at the centrosome but disrupts its dynamic turnover. We conclude that centrosomal targeting of SYS- 1 promotes its degradation during asymmetric cell division. We propose a model whereby centrosome-associated SYS- 1 degradation couples negative regulation with cell-division timing to facilitate SYS- 1 clearance from the mother cell {{at the time of}} asymmetric division. Based on our observations of centrosomal SYS- 1 dynamics, we discuss the possibility that the centrosome may coordinate various cell-cycle-dependent processes by synchronizing mitosis and protein regulation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Radiographic {{evaluation}} {{for patients}} with scoliosis using Cobb method is the current gold standard, but radiography has radiation hazards. Several groups have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using 3 D ultrasound {{for the evaluation of}} scoliosis. Ultrasound imaging is radiation-free, comparatively more accessible, and inexpensive. However, a reliable and valid 3 D ultrasound system ready for clinical scoliosis assessment has not yet been reported. Scolioscan is a newly developed system targeted for scoliosis assessment in clinics by using coronal images of spine generated by a 3 D ultrasound volume projection imaging method. The aim {{of this study is to}} test the reliability of spine deformity measurement of Scolioscan and its validity compared to the gold standard Cobb angle measurements from radiography in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. Methods: Prospective study divided into two stages: 1) Investigation of intra-and inter-reliability between two operators for acquiring images using Scolioscan and among three raters for measuring spinal curves from those images; 2) Correlation between the Cobb angle obtained from radiography by a medical doctor and the spine curve angle obtained using Scolioscan (Scolioscan angle). The raters for ultrasound images and the doctors for evaluating radiographic images were mutually blinded. The two stages of tests involved 20 (80 % females, total of 26 angles, age of 16. 4 +/- 2. 7 years, and Cobb angle of 27. 6 +/- 11. 8 degrees) and 49 (69 % female, 73 angles, 15. 8 +/- 2. 7 years and 24. 8 +/- 9. 7 degrees) AIS patients, respectively. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots and root-mean-square differences (RMS) were employed to determine correlations, which interpreted based on defined criteria. Results: We demonstrated a very good intra-rater and intra-operator reliability for Scolioscan angle measurement with ICC larger than 0. 94 and 0. 88, respectively. Very good inter-rater and inter-operator reliability was also demonstrated, with both ICC larger than 0. 87. For the thoracic deformity measurement, the RMS were 2. 5 and 3. 3 degrees in the intra-and inter-operator tests, and 1. 5 and 3. 6 degrees in the intra-and inter-rater tests, respectively. The RMS differences were 3. 1, 3. 1, 1. 6, 3. 7 degrees in the intra-and inter-operator and intra-and inter-rater tests, respectively, for the lumbar angle measurement. Moderate to strong correlations (R- 2 > 0. 72) were observed between the Scolioscan angles and Cobb angles for both the thoracic and lumbar regions. It was noted that the Scolioscan angle slightly underestimated the spinal deformity in comparison with Cobb angle, and an overall regression equation y = 1. 1797 x (R- 2 = 0. 76) could be used to translate the Scolioscan angle (x) to Cobb angle (y) for this group of patients. The RMS difference between Scolioscan angle and Cobb angle was 4. 7 and 6. 2 degrees, with and without the correlation using the overall regression equation. Conclusions: We showed that Scolioscan is reliable for measuring coronal deformity {{for patients with}} AIS and appears promising in screening large numbers of patients, for progress monitoring, and evaluation of treatment outcomes. Due to it being radiation-free and relatively low-cost, Scolioscan has potential to be widely implemented and may contribute to reducing radiation dose during <b>serial</b> monitoring.

40|$|Introduction There {{are many}} kind of {{libraries}} for different purpose. Unlike the {{other types of}} libraries that are meant for specific group of users, public libraries are not restricted to any group of users. They {{are more or less}} a universal library; as some perceive them as the 2 ̆ 2 poor people 2 ̆ 7 s university 2 ̆ 2; expected to serve all kinds of people including young children, the physically challenged and those who, for one reason or the other, are incapacitated, such as the hospital patients and the prisoners. Public libraries serve the general needs of cities, towns, villages and some larger areas and are saddled with the responsibilities of serving the entire group of users of a community where they are located, regardless of age, sex, religion, complexion and profession. When the librarian accepts holdings into his repository, it implies taking the responsibility for their custody. All this may be jeopardized, if the library is damaged or lost {{as a result of a}} disaster. Viewed from the point of view of the library, a disaster can be anything or event which directly or indirectly affects the normal administration of the library i. e. the disruption of services to readers on either a short-time or a long-time basis. This is different from the normal nature of events that are termed or described as disasters. Natural events like earthquakes, flood, and volcanic eruption are termed disaster because of the effects they have on human beings as well as their normal way of occurrence. Also, man-made events like fire, acts of war and terrorism, structural (building) deficiencies and chemical spills are termed disaster; because of their effects on materials and properties of the library. However, criminal acts, like book theft and mutilation are also termed as physical disasters. It can be argued that the classification of disasters into natural and man-made has very little importance for the identification of what actually is a disaster. Thus, an event becomes a disaster, only when man and the environment he has created or lived in, are affected; whereby the environment can be a nation, community, business organization, office, museum, or library. The moment these settings are disturbed and normal services are disrupted, the situation can be termed as a disaster. Hence, a disaster as an unexpected consequences to the holdings or materials in the custody of the librarians stressing that it can be a small-scale incident or a full-blown emergency; even though in both cases, the event or situation requires prompt action to limit damages. Alegbeleye (1993) defined disaster as an event that 2 ̆ 2 results in the sudden removal of records and documents from accessibility and use 2 ̆ 2; stating further that the disaster can be regarded as an occurrence that temporarily or permanently render information contained in document inaccessible. A disaster can be seen as an overwhelming ecological disruption occurring on scale sufficient to require outside assistance. Indeed, disasters are exceptional events which suddenly kill or injure large number of people and damage properties. Looking at disaster in a generic information management context, it can be viewed as any incident which threatens human safety; and/or damages or threatens to damage a library 2 ̆ 7 s buildings collection (or items therein), equipment and system. There are varied causes and for that matter classification of disaster. Alegbeleye (1993) agreed that the simplest and most common are the grouping into natural and man-made categories. They stated further that natural disasters are happenings, over which man has very little or no control and are generally initiated by such events as floods, earthquakes, storms, cyclones and hurricanes; among others. Man- induced disasters include war-time destruction, bombings, rioting, malicious vandalism, arson, negligence, power surges and failures. Irrespective of sources of disasters, the destruction and devastation they cause or threaten to cause to library resources and the provision of library services remain a critical factor in the management of libraries. Alegbeleye (1993) also mentioned two commonly recurring causes of library disasters to include floods and fires. Anderson and McIntyre (1985) however added vandalism, theft, earthquake, insect infection and the effect of light and temperature to the list of causes of disasters in libraries. Ngulube (2005) noted that although humankind tend to associate the term 2 ̆ 7 disaster 2 ̆ 7 with devastating floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, risks and hazards to documentary materials, which include insects and rodents, mould and humidity, tornadoes, forest fire, volcanic eruption etc. can occur anytime without notice. Meanwhile, a disaster plan, according to Lyall (1993), is a document which describes the procedures devised to prevent and prepare for disasters, and those proposed to respond to and recover from disasters when they occur. The responsibility for performing these tasks is allocated to various staff members who comprise 2 ̆ 7 the disaster team 2 ̆ 7. The plan should be comprehensive enough to consist several independent yet interrelated smaller plans, recognizing that every disaster has three phases; before, during and after. A number of plans is required to cope with each of the phases namely: 2 ̆ 7 before phase 2 ̆ 7, should encompass two types of plan viz: preventive and preparedness; implying everyday routine operations. Whereas preventive plans recommend actions to prevent most disasters; such as the repair of leaking roofs, the improvement of maintenance and the upgrading of security, preparedness plans aimed at ensuring that identified disasters can be managed recommending actions such as the identification of important items in the collection, the purchase of plastic sheeting, the provision of freezing facilities and the training of staff to enable them to respond to different disasters. The 2 ̆ 7 during phase 2 ̆ 7 requires a response to the disaster; the effectiveness of which is hinged on the thoroughness of the preparedness plan. The 2 ̆ 7 after phase 2 ̆ 7 is where the recovery plans are implemented; though not in details; given the unique nature of every disaster. In each of the preventive, preparedness, response and recovery plans, priority attention should be given to possible areas to be affected by the disaster. These areas are: personnel including staff, users and visitors collections and records including all categories of archival records, serials, monographs, manuscripts, maps, sound recordings, computer discs, optical and video discs, pictorial materials, and their related catalogues. It is also important to consider the protection of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s vital records. These are usually considered to be those records without which the institution could not operate. All legal documents, essential files and financial records are included in this category building and equipment including equipment, vehicles, air conditioning plant, plumbing, electrical services and computers (Lyall, 1993). The desired that the plan be prepared by a team and not an individual is due to the fact that such a plan must naturally apply to the building and all its contents, including people, collections, records and equipment. Thus, preparing the plan involves five main steps viz: conducting a risk analysis identification of existing preventive and preparedness procedures making recommendations to implement additional preventive and preparedness procedures allocating responsibilities devising procedures to respond to and recover from disasters (Lyall, 1993). On their part, Newey, Lepschi 2 ̆ 6 Croft (2008) identified the objectives of the disaster plan as including to: minimise damage to the collections; recover and repair any damaged collection materials; and return the library and archival services to normal. These objectives are facilitated by the plan through provision of a framework and guidelines for the following: rapid and effective response to an emergency; good communication; ensuring staff are well trained; ensuring appropriate equipment and materials are available; and enabling assistance from outside organisations. Historical Background of Kwara State Public Library, Ilorin After the creation of Kwara State along with others in 1967, the need for a public library service in it became pressing. The Northern regional library, Kaduna was decentralized for the new States to establish their own. The area court building was chosen as a suitable place that could accommodate the new library, before it moved to its location in October 1967. Apart from the inherited library materials from the defunct northern region, a total sum of 300 pounds was released to the Interim Administrative Council to purchase more books for the library. On 1 st April 1968, the Kwara State Library commenced services to the public after which it was realized that the borrowed building was quite unsuitable due to its closeness to the central market. The problem of accommodation persisted for two decades during which the library moved from one building to the other. The lack of a befitting infrastructure was a setback to the library and frantic efforts were made by many to secure a suitable and permanent building for the library. In November 1987, the then military Governor, Lt. Col. Ahmed Abdullahi laid the foundation of a purposefully-built library where it presently occupies. The completed building was commissioned by the then military president, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida on 21 st November 1990. Between 1990 and 2001, the teeming reading population in the State made use of the library. Within a decade and half, the building got dilapidated, its stock became out-dated and irrelevant to the information needs of users. On assumption of duty as Governor, Dr. Bukola Saraki visited the dilapidated library and promised it a face-lift. Renovation started on 23 rd November, 2005. The transformed library building was commissioned and put back to use 1 st July 2006 (Kwara State Library Handbook, 2006). Like other libraries, it comprises the Administrative, Technical Services and Reader Services, Acquisitions, Cataloguing/Classification, Circulation, Reference, Automation, Children and <b>Serials</b> <b>divisions</b> as well as an Internet café. Electronic resources are available through dedicated websites for the library while it uses ALICE for windows for its automation and an electronic device system for the security of its collection. The library was established primarily to serve as local center of information that will make all kinds of knowledge and information readily available to its numerous users irrespective of their age, sex, race, religion, nationality, language or social status. However, there is no total claim to it that the library has fulfilled these service provision obligations to its numerous patrons...|$|R
