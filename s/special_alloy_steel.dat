40|$|Purpose: AISI H 11 is a <b>special</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel,</b> {{categorized}} as chromium tool steel. Because {{of its high}} toughness and hardness, it is well suited for hot work applications involving very high loads. Typical applications are hot-work forging and extrusion dies, helicopter rotor blades, etc. For longer life and higher design accuracy, properties {{of this type of}} tool steel can be improved by various types of heat treatment. Current work reports and analyzes results of mechanical testing performed on variously heat treated H 11 steel samples, to arrive at an optimum heat treatment strategy for hot work applications. Design/methodology/approach: Tensile and impact test specimens were fabricated using precision milling and EDM. These samples were subjected to various heat treatment sequences, consisting of annealing, hardening, air and oil quenching, and tempering at different temperatures. Heat treated samples were then mechanically tested for hardness (Rockwell), impact toughness (Charpy), and tensile properties (yield strength, ultimate strength, ductility). Findings: Mechanical testing of H 11 samples revealed that with increasing temper temperatures: (a) hardness first increases to a maximum and then gradually decreases; (b) impact toughness first decreases to a minimum and then increases; (c) yield strength first decreases, then increases, and then increases again; (d) ultimate strength first increases to a maximum and then steadily decreases; and (e) ductility (% elongation) gradually decreases till 600 ºC, and then increases rather sharply. Practical implications: Though a very promising candidate for hot-work applications, H 11 steel is not commonly used for die and tool making. Results of this study can provide die designers and users in the metalworking industry with good guidelines to select proper heat treatment strategies to use H 11 steel for various applications. Originality/value: Very little information is available in published literature about mechanical properties of H 11 steel, especially after different types of heat treatment. Results from this study can fill some of this gap...|$|E

40|$|Multi-pollutant control {{technologies}} {{will become more}} important in the future. This new membrane wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) system is ideally suited to, and very cost effective for, removing PM 2. 5, SO 3 and Hg+ 2 after limestone wet flue gas desulphurization (WFGD) scrubbers in the utility industry. Several coal-fired utilities have been experiencing increased SO 3 emissions from their existing WFGD scrubbers, especially after installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx Control. Achieving co-benefits of Hg removal by installing SCR's and WFGD systems is already becoming a key strategy for reducing mercury levels after coal fired power plants. WESP can readily collect acid aerosol and fine particulate due to greater corona power and virtually no re-entrainment. The WESP can also enhance collection of Hg (Hg ash & Hg+ 2). The main historical limitation associated with wet precipitators has been the higher cost of <b>special</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless <b>steel</b> material used in their manufacture. This new technology WESP, based on fabric membrane for the collecting electrodes, dramatically reduces weight and cost, compared to conventional, metallic WESPs...|$|R
