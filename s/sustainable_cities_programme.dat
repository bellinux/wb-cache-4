40|$|Cities {{have become}} {{a focal point for}} efforts to {{transition}} towards a more sustainable, low-carbon society, with many municipal agencies championing ‘eco city’ initiatives of one kind or another. And yet, national policy initiatives frequently play an important – if sometimes overlooked – role, too. This chapters provides comparative perspectives on four recent national <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> <b>programmes</b> from France, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The analysis reveals two key insights: first, national policy is found to exercise a strong shaping role in what sustainable development for future cities is understood to be, which helps explain the considerable differences in priorities and approaches across countries. Second, beyond articulating strategic priorities, national policy may exercise a ‘soft’ governance function by incentivising and facilitating wider, voluntary governance networks in the effort to implement <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> projects locally. This innovative role, however, depends on the ability of national policy to produce resonance among societal actors and on its effective interaction with formal planning processes...|$|R

40|$|Among many {{mainstream}} development agencies, it {{is generally}} believed and accepted that planning for more socially equitable and environmentally sound development requires broad consultative processes and citizen involvement in decision making. The <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Programme</b> in Tanzania started as a demonstration project {{in the city of}} Dar es Salaam—the Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project (SDP) —and is one of the Sustainable Cities Programmes (SCP) worldwide advocating the Environmental Planning and Management (EPM) approach. Despite the SCP’s expressed emphasis on broad-based stakeholder involvement rather than master planning, and bottom-up problem solving rather than top-down decision making, in attempting to localize and implement Agenda 21, there has been a mixed experience in the participatory aspects of the SDP. Political and institutional/administrative practices explain many of the reasons for this mixed experience, as discussed in this chapter.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research examines the sustainability of private sector participation in urban service delivery in developing countries. The solid waste collection service in Dar es Salaam – Tanzania {{was used as a}} case study. Municipalities in Tanzania {{have not been able to}} cope with the rapid generation rate of solid waste coupled by the rapid urbanization. This resulted in a relatively large quantity of solid waste remaining poorly managed and uncollected, which left an obvious gap for other stakeholders to participate in service provision. The private sector took the opportunity, in the early 1990 s, to fill the gap left by the public sector in service provision. The private sector in Dar es Salaam (DSM) was initiated under the Global <b>Sustainable</b> <b>City</b> Development <b>Programme</b> (GSCDP). Several <b>cities,</b> including DSM, are part of this <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> network in which the GSCDP is promoting demonstration projects world-wide. Privatizing the solid waste collection service in DSM is a partnership arrangement between the public and private sectors. The private sector provides service and charges the service recipients the amount set by the public sector. But this approach of privatization has raised a question mark; will such an approach be sustainable over a long period of time or will it fail? Particularly, if such an approach is going on without proper and appropriate appraisal of the existing solid waste collection practices in Dar es Salaam. The purpose of this research is to develop workable guidelines for urban areas in developing countries with similar characteristics to DSM- Tanzania. Primary data for the research were collected from public sector officials responsible for solid waste management, private sector organizations involved in solid waste collection and households that represented service recipients, through individual discussions, interviews, focus group discussions, survey questionnaires and observation. The research found that there are factors affecting the sustainability of the private sector, which include: support from the public sector; capacity from the private sector in terms of collection vehicles and equipment; households’ attitudes and behaviour regarding the privatization of the service; the awareness and participation of households in the service; and involvement of households in decision-making. The research also identified that there is a missing-link between the households, public sector administration and the private sector. The research concludes that, taking into consideration the above factors, the proposed guidelines formulated in this study illustrate ways in which private sector involvement in solid waste collection in urban developing countries will be sustainable...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Programme</b> – First Stage (SCP- 1 S) {{has been}} {{continuously}} developed since November 1998 {{when there was}} a need to reconstruct the cities in NW Peru severely affected by El Niño 1997 - 98. The key tool for developing safe, sound urban areas, is the hazard map, developed with a multi-hazard approach. The low and medium hazard sectors are designated for urban development and to locate essential facilities such as hospitals and school buildings in cases of disaster. To reduce the risk of disasters, instead of merely reducing construction vulnerability (the most usual strategy), a new emphasis is applied: hazard maps are used for city expansion and densification, and also for the planning and construction of safe urban lifelines. Up to May 2007, hazard maps have been prepared for 110 Peruvian cities. Seventy cities have hazard maps, land-use plans and disaster mitigation project profiles unanimously approved by municipal ordinances. However, their implementation is not being carried out as well as expected, so INDECI and UNDP, the Programme executing institutions, are doing their best to tackle this problem.

40|$|Urban land {{resources}} are facing immense pressure due to rapid economic growth. Unscientific processes of land development {{have resulted in}} increased vulnerability to both ecosystems and communities. The cities in developing world are still short of scientific tools and techniques to address this concern. The simultaneous operation of various socioecological processes results in imbalances in the urban landscapes and contributes to ecological stress. A study to {{understand the concept of}} ecological stress and causative socio-ecological factors can contribute to incorporation of sustainability principles in the management of urban landscapes.

The aim of this research is to prepare a framework for ecological stress model using land-use and behaviour for selected communities in Chennai metropolitan area. The study is about the rapid transformations in the urban landscape of south Chennai and resultant changes in the quality of life in selected communities. Ecological stress is a result of conflicting socio-ecological processes, is research has used both physical data (surveys/satellite imageries) and conducted behavioural surveys in the community. Household behavioural survey was done for 600 households in south Chennai. Emotions, social intelligence and social practices have been assessed to understand the community's response to vulnerable situations and coping-up mechanisms. Key research questions were the following: • What are the ecological functions of land in a tropical coastal city? • What are the ecological conflicts within Chennai metropolitan area that have resulted from suppression of ecological functions of land? • How to use ecological stress to assess social vulnerability?EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges to urban planning in the 21 st century. Current patterns of urban development, called byspecially sprawl, and human activity have led to environmental degradation and created a serious threat to continued human existence and sustainability of life on earth. The United States, concerns over consequences of urban sprawl have led to increased advocacy for more compact and traditional urban development. The compact city is now widely accepted as the most effective solution to sustainable urban form. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between sustainability and urban form. In order to achieve the aims of this study, 50 cities in the United States are analyzed and compared with the 2008 <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> rankings from the organization SustainLane, using four categories of urban form indicators: densities, mode of commute to work, mean travel time to work & traffic congestion cost, and planning & land use. This research is based on the hypothesis that a <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> has a compact city form. According to the SustainLane 2008 US <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> ranking high ranked cities were considered more <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> and low ranked cities were regarded as less <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities.</b> Using SPSS?s correlation analysis tool, I studied the relationship between overall city ranking and four categories of urban form the indicators. The overall finding of the analysis of the relationship between each indicator and urban form yields mixed results. The result of this research found that that <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> and urban form has several correlations; densities, mode of commute to work, and planning and land use have a strong positive correlation with sustainable city; however, mean travel time to work and traffic congestion cost have a negative correlation with SustainLane?s <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> ranking. These results mean that <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> which were high ranked cities in the SustainLane 2008 US <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> ranking have a high density, sustainable mode of commute to work, and strong planning and land use. Particularly, when a mixed land use, centeredness, and street connectivity were combined, the planning and land use category of indicators shows stronger correlation with sustainability. According to this result, these findings suggest that when the planning and land use indicators are combined synergistically compact urban form can be an indicator of a more <b>sustainable</b> <b>city...</b>|$|R
