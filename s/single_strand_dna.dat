5|$|The BRCA OB1 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB1 has a shallow groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for weak <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding. The domain also binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
50|$|During mitosis, tiny {{fragments}} of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> naturally occur inside the cell. Enzymes find {{and destroy the}} “scrap” DNA. The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this single strand “scrap” DNA. A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> {{to be less than}} completely effective. The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> to build up in the cell. The buildup of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal.|$|E
50|$|This method generates {{libraries}} {{of hybrid}} genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides {{in the presence}} of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments. This process is repeated until full length <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> is obtained.|$|R

50|$|DNA repair {{mechanisms}} are quite efficient, and during a cell's lifetime {{many thousands of}} <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks will be repaired.

50|$|Chk1 is {{regulated}} by ATR through phosphorylation, forming the ATR-Chk1 pathway. This pathway recognizes <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA) {{which can be}} a result of UV-induced damage, replication stress and inter-strand cross linking. Often ssDNA can be a result of abnormal replication during S phase through the uncoupling of replication enzymes helicase and DNA polymerase. These ssDNA structures attract ATR and eventually activates the checkpoint pathway.|$|E
50|$|The {{ligation}} step adds DNA adaptors to {{both ends}} of the small RNAs, which act as primer binding sites during reverse transcription and PCR amplification. An adenylated <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> 3’adaptor followed by a 5’adaptor is ligated to the small RNAs using a ligating enzyme such as T4 RNA ligase2. The adaptors are also designed to capture small RNAs with a 5’ phosphate group, characteristic microRNAs, rather than RNA degradation products with a 5’ hydroxyl group.|$|E

50|$|Genome {{replication}} is initiated when a viral endonuclease (gp2) nicks {{the double}} stranded intermediate. This nicking site is specific and the sequence around the site highly symmetrical. The activity of gp2 is regulated by two other viral proteins: gp5 (single strand binding protein) and gp10. New viral genomes are produced via the rolling circle mechanism. These new <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences become templates for further DNA and RNA synthesis. When sufficient gp5 has accumulated within the cell, further DNA synthesis is halted and virion assembly begins.|$|E

50|$|The {{abnormality}} of {{the cells}} with the high concentration of “scrap” DNA triggers a T-cell response and the abnormal cells are destroyed. Because the TREX1 gene is identical in all {{of the cells}} in the body the ineffective enzyme allows the accumulation of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> {{in all of the}} cells in the body. Eventually, the immune system has destroyed enough of the cells in the walls of the blood vessels that the capillaries burst open.

50|$|Talazoparib {{acts as an}} {{inhibitor}} of poly ADP ribose polymerase(PARP) which aids in <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> repair. Cells {{that have}} BRCA1/2 mutations are susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors because of an accumulation of DNA damage. Talazoparib is theorized {{to have a higher}} potency than olaparib due to the additional mechanism of action called PARP trapping. PARP trapping is the mechanism of action where the PARP molecule is trapped on the DNA, which interferes with the cells ability to replicate. Talazoparib is found to be ~100 fold more efficient in PARP trapping than olaparib. However, this increased potency may not translate directly to clinical effectiveness as many other factors must be considered.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that computations using DNA molecules as computing units may sometimes be simpler to carry out and less error prone if double <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules are used rather than the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> molecules currently being used.

5000|$|Enzyme based DNA {{computers}} are usually {{of the form}} of a simple Turing machine; there is analogous hardware, in {{the form of a}}n enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA. Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the FokI enzyme and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to prostate cancer: under expression of the genes PPAP2B and GSTP1 and an over expression of PIM1 and HPN. Their automata evaluated the expression of each gene, one gene at a time, and on positive diagnosis then released a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule (ssDNA) that is an antisense for MDM2. MDM2 is a repressor of protein 53, which itself is a tumor suppressor. On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application in vivo, at least for use in [...] "cells of higher organisms". It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.|$|E
