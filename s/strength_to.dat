The character was originally conceived to become a pirate captain, and Christianson's early art included Brood's lightsaber tonfas. Wilkinson brought <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> her performance, leading to {{an expansion of the}} role with more dialogue.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

5|$|After Parise's {{penalty was}} served, it was Canada's turn {{to go on}} the power play, and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series to tie it at 1–1. The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Welensky found {{employment}} with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of Iron Man 3, Mike Peterson is out with his son, Ace, when {{the top floor of}} a nearby {{building}} explodes. Peterson uses enhanced <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> save a trapped woman from the building, and is filmed doing so by Skye, a member of the hacktivist group the Rising Tide. S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director Maria Hill interviews Grant Ward for a new team under Agent Phil Coulson, who is officially dead. Coulson assigns Ward level 7 security clearance, and reveals the team's first mission is to investigate the Rising Tide. Coulson also recruits the reluctant Agent Melinda May, who had previously retired from field duty.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
5|$|Although Edna Diefenbaker {{had been}} devoted to {{advancing}} her husband's career, in the mid-1940s she began to suffer mental illness, and {{was placed in a}} private mental hospital for a time. She later fell ill from leukemia, and died in 1951. In 1953, Diefenbaker married Olive Palmer (formerly Olive Freeman), whom he had courted while living in Wakaw. Olive Diefenbaker became a great source of <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> her husband. There were no children born of either marriage.|$|E
30|$|Embedding tests {{parallel}} and {{perpendicular to}} the grain were conducted to produce a database of embedding strength of wood for the design of dowel-type joints. Dowel diameters were 8, 12, 16, and 20 mm. Embedding strength was evaluated by the 5 % off-set method and a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383. The embedding <b>strength</b> parallel <b>to</b> the grain evaluated by the former method showed values close to those obtained with the latter method, but they showed a significant difference in tests conducted {{perpendicular to the}} grain. The embedding <b>strength</b> parallel <b>to</b> the grain was 0.9 times as large as the compressive <b>strength</b> parallel <b>to</b> the grain regardless of the evaluation method. The embedding <b>strength</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the grain evaluated by the 5 % off-set method was four times as large as the compressive <b>strength</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the grain. When the embedding <b>strength</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the grain was evaluated by a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383, the ratio of embedding <b>strength</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the grain <b>to</b> the compressive <b>strength</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the grain decreased as the dowel diameter increased.|$|R

5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E

5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, {{it is only the}} tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> enter the state as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{train for}} each level on a {{seasonal}} schedule {{designed for the}} targeted events: marathon or mid-distance. Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exercise—especially for endurance—and <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> improve joint flexibility and {{to minimize the risk}} of injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.|$|E
5|$|Beyond these controversies, Jones {{significantly}} {{influenced the}} Air Force's development {{during and after}} the war. He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940–42 and has received credit as CAS for building up the RAAF's <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> 70squadrons by 1945. After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of RAAF College, along similar lines to Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Royal Australian Naval College, as well as the RAAF Staff College. One of his last directions as CAS was the formation of RAAF Museum at Point Cook, where it is still based.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially played on the half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.|$|E
