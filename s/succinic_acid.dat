The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid,</b> hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.

25|$|Cells produce GHB by {{reduction}} of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as forskolin and vinpocetine, may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> semialdehyde to GHB. It is important to note, however, that direct administration of GHB or endogenous GHB already present in the body will not be affected by valproic acid. People with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of GHB in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E

His findings had a lasting influence on the science of French winemaking. Pasteur was asked to help identify wine quality control issues that caused spoilage and other faults. During the 3 to 4 years that Pasteur spent studying wine he observed and explained the process of fermentation—noted that it was living organisms (yeast) that convert sugar in the grape must into alcohol in some form of chemical reaction. He also noted the presence of glycerol and <b>succinic</b> <b>acid</b> in wine as well as the beneficial process of adding tartaric acid during winemaking.

25|$|FDCA {{has a large}} {{potential}} {{as a replacement for}} terephthalic acid, a widely used component in various polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran. Both of these latter materials can serve as alcohol components in the production of new polyester, and their combination with FDCA would lead to a new family of completely biomass-derived products. Extension of these concepts to the production of new nylons, either through reaction of FDCA with diamines, or through the conversion of FDCA to 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)tetrahydrofuran. FDCA can also serve as a starting material for the production of <b>succinic</b> <b>acid,</b> whose utility is elsewhere.|$|E

This distinction was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic tests. Two novel species are therefore proposed: Prevotella marshii sp. nov. (group E 2) and Prevotella baroniae (group E 4).
