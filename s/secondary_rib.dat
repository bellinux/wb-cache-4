40|$|In {{the forest}} area of Tlemcen, green oak on its large expanse is abundantly {{represented}} in two forms: simple coppice and trees on stump. This study, try {{to verify the}} effect of the silvicultural treatments and exposure on leaf morphology. To this end, we tested this hypothesis on 240 mature leaves of these two populations collected from the four cardinal directions. The results show that the length of midrib is 4. 85 cm in the case of high trees, 4. 80 cm in the coppices. The surface of leaf-blade is 8. 87 cm 2 in the high trees and 8. 35 cm 2 in coppices. Angle of insertion of the <b>secondary</b> <b>rib</b> with the main rib is 122. 86 ° in the case of high trees, 121. 22 ° in the coppices. Variance analysis indicates that there is no effect of the silvicultural treatments and exposure on leaves morphological parameters...|$|E

50|$|First whorls {{of shell}} are depressed, {{but then they}} became rounded and more compressed. Primary ribs are strong and they are usually bifurcating. <b>Secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> are more delicate. Tubercules are present on ventrolateral {{positions}} in younger whorls, but they are diminishing on outer whorls. Similar genus is Reynesocoeloceras, but that one is lacking ribs bifurcations.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell is}} evolute, {{strongly}} ribbed and miderately umbilicate. Primary ribs, {{on the order}} of 32 -36 per whorl, are sharp and widely spaced, originate at the unbilical shoulder. <b>Secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> form about mid flank, generally by trifurcation, but sometimes quadrafurcation (splitting into threes or sometimes fours) of the primaries. The umbilicus is about 0.4 the shell diameter.|$|R
50|$|Normannites has shells {{reaching}} {{a diameter of}} 52 - 55 mm. These shells have large lappets, curved plate-like structures that project forward {{on either side of}} the aperture. Primary ribs on the inner side of each whorl are large and close spaced, bifurcate about mid flank before continuing over the venter. <b>Secondary</b> <b>ribs,</b> when present, appear about mid flank between primary pairs.|$|R
50|$|The whorl {{section of}} Subcollina is subquadrate, {{slightly}} depressed {{in the inner}} whorls, slightly compressed at the mature aperture. The inner whorls are covered with fine, dense, primary ribs that become widespread and thicker on the outer whorls, terminating in ventrolateral tubercles from which two or sometimes three <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> extend that cross the venter in a regular zig-zag pattern.|$|R
50|$|Haplopleuroceras shares its simple {{undivided}} ribbing {{with the}} contemporary Sonniniidae {{in which it}} probably belongs (e.g. Treatise L, 1957) although others since then (e.g. Donovan et al. 1981) have removed it to the Hammitoceratidae. The Hammitoceratidae, the oldest of which predate the Sonniniidae {{so as to be}} their most likely predecessors, are however characterized by primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> which bifurcate on the flanks and cross the venter, often transversely.|$|R
50|$|Phaulostephanus {{is a small}} serptenticone with a {{generally}} subcircular to subquadrate whorl section, slightly sinuous ribbing, and tubercles that if present are weakly developed. Primary ribs are sharp, divide about mid flank into prominent and moderately sharp <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs.</b> The aperture of the macroconch has a broad ventral collar preceded by a constriction. That of the microconch is flanked by lappets and has no constriction.The suture is ammonitic.|$|R
50|$|Parapuzosia is an extinct genus of desmoceratid ammonites {{from the}} Cenomanian to the Campanian of Africa, Europe, and North America. They are {{typically}} very large ammonites, reaching diameters of 60 cm or more, {{with the largest}} species measuring upwards of more than 3 m.

50|$|Tragodesmoceras {{is a large}} {{moderately}} involute ammonite with deeply embracing whorls {{that are}} higher than wide, a steep sided umbilicus and a narrowly rounded venter. Ornament consists of primary ribs that begin at the umbilical shoulder and smaller <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> that begin mid flank. Ribs are sigmodal, periodically thickened and bent forward on the outer flank to cross the venter as chevrons. The suture has a broad trifid lateral lobe.|$|R
50|$|Coeloceratidae is {{a family}} of ammonites {{belonging}} to the Eoderoceratoidea that lived during the Early Jurassic. Shells are evolute, tending to be broadly discoidal with depressed whorls bearing primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> that branch from outer lateral tubercles. Most of the included species have coronate inner whorls and outer tubercles only. In general, Coeloceratids resemble the Middle Jurassic Stephanoceras. Once regarded as the subfamily Coeloceratinae in the Eoderoceratidae, these ammonites are now given familial rank.|$|R
50|$|Parastrenoceras {{is found}} {{immediately}} above Subcollina in Oaxaca, Mexico {{and may be}} descended directly from it. The two agree in the coiling, {{cross section of the}} inner whorls, and zigzag pattern of the <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs.</b> Parastrenoceras differs in having two rows of tubercles per side, rather than one, and that the primary ribs on the outer whorls may slope dorso-ventrally forward. Parastrenoceras is also closely related to Spiroceras which, except for its uncoiling, shares many of the same features.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in Cobban, Hook & Kenneday, 1989, Neocardioceras {{is a fairly}} small, moderately evolute, generally compressed ammonite that has prominent and very numerous rectoradiate to prorsiradate ribs and umbilical, inner and outer, and siphonal (mid ventral) tubercles. Primary ribs begin in the umbilicus or rise from umbilical tubercles and <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> arise further out on the flank. The ribs bend forward at {{the position of the}} inner ventrolateral tubercles and cross the venter as chevrons, where they support the outer ventrolateral and siphonal tubercles.|$|R

50|$|Psiloceratoidea is {{probably}} {{derived from the}} family Ussuritidae, which were Triassic members of Phylloceratoidea. Similar to their ancestors, Psiloceratidae kept smooth, rounded venter for whole of their life. Schlotheimiidae were different, as they had ventral chevrons. Rest of the families had angular venter, or keel for {{at least part of}} their ontogeny. Most of the members of this superfamily had only simple ribs, but few of them have evolved also <b>secondary</b> <b>ribbing.</b> While some members are involute and some Oxynoticeratidae were oxycone, most of the species were evolute.|$|R
5000|$|Stephanoceras has an evolute shell, as {{characteristic}} of the family, with well-developed ribbing and tubercles. The shell is coiled so whorls barely touch in most, but some have notable overlap. Primary ribs emerge from the umbilical seam, the line marking the inner edge of the particular exposed whorl, and divide on the flanks, usually in two, occasionally in three, forming <b>secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> that cross the outer rim of the shell, known as the venter, uninterrupted. Turbercles, elevated projections, form {{at the ends of}} the primary ribs where they bifurcate or sometimes trifurcate.|$|R

50|$|Duashnoceras is a stephanoceratid of {{variable}} size; evolute {{with a very}} slight uncoiling of the last whorls. Juvenile whorls are depressed subtrapizoidal to subrectangular in section, with slightly convex flanks, arched venter, and well defined ventrolateral shoulders. With further growth the whorl section becomes more elliptical to subcircular with flanks more convex and without ventrolateral shoulders. Primary ribs, which form on the umbilical and dorso-lateral part of the whorls, appear almost immediately. At first the primary ribs are dense but become wide spread on the intermediary whorls, then dense again on the last whorls. Tubercles are conical, usually raised as spines on the intermediary whorls, and are independent of ribs which curve around them. <b>Secondary</b> <b>ribs</b> become thicker on the body chambers of microconchs but thinner of body chambers of macroconchs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Cape endemic genus Capnophyllum Gaertn. is revised.
