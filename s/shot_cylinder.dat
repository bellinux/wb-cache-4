5000|$|Currently (2011) {{there is}} only one factory {{chambered}} firearm in [...]224-32 FA, the Freedom Arms Model 97 revolver. It has a six <b>shot</b> <b>cylinder,</b> adjustable rear sights, and barrel lengths available in 4¼", 5½", 7½", and 10".|$|E
5000|$|The Model 1855, {{which was}} the most widely {{produced}} revolving rifle, was available in [...]36, [...]44 and [...]56 caliber. Four barrel lengths were available: 15, 18, 21 and 24 inches. A six <b>shot</b> <b>cylinder</b> was used if the caliber was [...]36 or the [...]44. If the caliber was [...]56, a five-shot cylinder was used.|$|E
50|$|Propane {{is used as}} a propellant, {{relying on}} the {{expansion}} of the gas to fire the projectile. It does not ignite the gas. The use of a liquefied gas gives more <b>shots</b> per <b>cylinder,</b> compared to a compressed gas.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} aircraft designs, the large frontal {{area of the}} engine acted as an extra layer of armor for the pilot. Also air-cooled engines, without vulnerable radiators, are slightly less prone to battle damage, and on occasion would continue running even {{with one or more}} <b>cylinders</b> <b>shot</b> away. However, the large frontal area also resulted in an aircraft with an aerodynamically inefficient increased frontal area.|$|R
50|$|In {{civilian}} use, the Webley-Fosbery {{was popular}} with target-shooters. Because the trigger mechanism did not rotate the <b>cylinder,</b> <b>shots</b> were smooth and consistent, permitting rapid and accurate shooting. Walter Winans, a famous contemporary target shooter, preferred the Webley-Fosbery, and in 1902 {{he used it}} to place six shots in a two-inch bull's-eye at 12 paces in seven seconds. Using a Prideaux speedloader {{he was able to}} fire twelve shots into a three-inch bull's-eye in approximately 15 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the novel}} the {{fighting}} machines crash-land to Earth in massive <b>cylinders,</b> <b>shot</b> from {{a sort of}} gun from Mars (in the PC game adaptation {{as well as the}} live musical version, the Martians refer to this device as a [...] "large-scale hydrogen accelerator"). Once they arrive on Earth, the fighting machines are quickly assembled. A London newspaper article cites unnamed authorities who believed, based on the outside dimensions of the cylinders, they carried no more than five tripods per cylinder.|$|R
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{ammunition}} were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and canister <b>shot</b> (wooden <b>cylinders</b> filled with metal balls or fragments), {{which had a}} devastating effect on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebössa was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.|$|R
5000|$|To {{fire the}} Paterson, the shooter thumbed the hammer {{back and the}} action rotated a chamber {{in line with the}} barrel and locked the {{cylinder}} in place. This also caused the folding trigger to drop down from the frame into firing position. The sight picture consists of a front blade and a notch in the tip of the hammer. This sequence is repeated for each of the five <b>shots</b> in the <b>cylinder</b> (although the safety-conscious shooter will load only four, leaving the hammer down on an empty chamber for routine handling and carry.) ...|$|R
40|$|Velocimetry {{is useful}} in {{diagnosing}} many properties of high-explosive (HE) systems. The shock pressure of the detonation wave in HE is often measured by noting the velocity of an interface between the HE and a known material. Properties of the equation of state (EOS) of an explosive {{can be measured in}} a cylinder event using a combination of velocimetry and other diagnostics. Point-initiated explosions driving large plates give additional information regarding HE EOS. Hemispherical booster shots give quantitative data pertaining to booster performance. Velocimetry is used routinely to measure the performance of detonators. Velocimetry will be a particularly effective tool in <b>cylinder</b> <b>shots,</b> flat plate, and booster shots {{to determine the effects of}} aging on the EOS of explosive components in stockpile devices...|$|R
40|$|Installation {{of the new}} Altec-Lansing M- 30 {{microphone}} {{system in}} the impact machine was completed during the quarter. Eighteen series of impact hammer tests were completed. Of these, eight were made with the new 2. 5 kg hammer. Routine tests conducted with the 5 kg hammer included EL- 511 {beta}, Tacot-T, TNT, PBX 9404, LX- 04 - 1 and PBX 9010; tests made with the 2. 5 kg hammer included PBX 9404, LX- 04 - 1, PBX 9010 and PETN. Half-inch gap sensitivity testing continued with a group test on four RX- 04 -AB materials and four LX- 04 - 1 materials. Differences in shock sensitivity due to particle size and recrystallization were observed. Equation of State work during the fourth quarter consisted of three <b>cylinder</b> <b>shots</b> of LX- 04 - 1, two small spherical shots (mockup of the large sphere shot) fired as technique checks, and a full scale sphere shot...|$|R
40|$|To {{prepare for}} the planned Contained Firing Facility at the LLNL Site 300, we {{investigated}} various multilayered shrapnel protection schemes to minimize the amount of material used in shielding. As a result of testing, we found that two pieces of 1 -in. -thick mild steel plate provide adequate general-purpose protection from shrapnel generated by normal hydrodynamic and <b>cylinder</b> <b>shots</b> at Bunker 801. 47 1 Report Documentation Page Form ApprovedOMB No. 0704 - 0188 Public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

40|$|JWL`s and 1 -D Look-up {{tables are}} shown {{to work for}} ``one-track`` {{experiments}} like <b>cylinder</b> <b>shots</b> and the expanding sphere. They fail for ``many-track`` experiments like the compressed sphere. As long as the one-track experiment has dimensions larger than the explosive`s reaction zone and the explosive is near-ideal, a general JWL with R{sub 1 } = 4. 5 and R{sub 2 } = 1. 5 can be constructed, with both {omega} and E{sub o} being calculated from thermochemical codes. These general JWL`s allow comparison between various explosives plus recalculation of the JWL for different densities. The Bigplate experiment complements the cylinder test by providing continuous oblique angles of shock incidence from 0 {degrees} to 70 {degrees}. Explosive reaction zone lengths are determined from metal plate thicknesses, extrapolated run-to-detonation distances, radius size effects and detonation front curvature. Simple theories of the cylinder test, Bigplate, the cylinder size effect and detonation front curvature are given. The detonation front lag at the cylinder edge is shown to be proportional to the half-power of the reaction zone length. By calibrating for wall blow-out, {{a full set of}} reaction zone lengths from PETN to ANFO are obtained. The 1800 [...] 2100 K freezing effect is shown to be caused by rapid cooling of the product gases. Compiled comparative data for about 80 explosives is listed. Ten Chapters plus an Appendix...|$|R
40|$|The {{project would}} (1) compare new FK- 800 with old Kel-F 800 and KF- 800 lots {{currently}} available at LLNL, (2) compare and characterize new TATB with old TATB, (3) formulate new FK- 800 with wet-aminated TATB and new TATBs {{in according to}} HAAP slurry coating procedure into LX- 17 - 2, and (4) evaluate the mechanical and detonation performance characteristics of this insensitive high explosive (IHE). Priorities will be to prove that these new materials can be formulated, pressed to density and machined; and that they contain no impurities which might cause compatibility issues. Since 3 M [1, 2], LANL [7], Pantex [8] and AWE [9, 10] are currently evaluating the new FK- 800, we plan to share data rather than repeating their work. Our effort is briefly described: Task 1 [...] Evaluation of newer characterization methods to identify structural variations between old and new Kel-F 800 including: Rheological and mechanical properties, copolymer content, degree of crystallinity, and interfacial interactions with TATB. Task 2 [...] Evaluate TATBs using scattering techniques to replace sieving operations called out in the specification [12] for particle size distribution measurements. Use SEM and OM for morphological differences between {{the old and new}} explosives. Evaluate the compaction characteristics of new TATB. Task 3 [...] Formulation of new LX- 17 - 2 (with new FK- 800 and/or new TATB) Task 4 [...] Evaluate mechanical and performance properties of LX- 17 - 2. At a minimum, compressive strength, dynamic mechanical behavior and a 2 -inch <b>cylinder</b> <b>shot</b> should be performed and compared with existing data for LX- 17 - 1...|$|R
