5|$|In the British Isles, the {{hooded crow}} breeds {{regularly}} in Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the <b>Scottish</b> <b>Islands.</b> It also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn, some migratory birds {{arrive on the}} east coast of Britain. In the past, this was a more common visitor.|$|E
5|$|Rognvald {{agreed to}} provide Einarr with a ship and crew {{in the hope that}} he would sail away and never return. Despite his father's misgivings, on arrival in the <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> Einarr fought and {{defeated}} two Danish warlords, Þórir Tréskegg (Thorir Treebeard) and Kálf Skurfa (Kalf the Scurvy), who had taken residence there. Einarr then established himself as earl of a territory that comprised the two archipelagoes of Orkney and Shetland.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many small <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> Papa Stour's {{population}} peaked in the 19th century and {{has experienced a}} significant decline since then (see e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen 'fairly elderly' residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011-11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} range is temperate and Arctic Europe on western and Baltic Sea coasts, {{with a very}} small number sometimes nesting in Iceland. The nominate race is largely resident, with only limited movement. A. p. kleinschmidti, which nests on the Faroe Islands and the <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> may move to sandy beaches or inland to rivers and lakes in winter. A. p. littoralis is largely migratory, wintering on coasts from southern Scandinavia to southwest Europe, with a few reaching Morocco. Wanderers have reached Spitsbergen and the Canary Islands, but records in Europe away from the coast are rare. For example, a male shot at Dresden in 1894, now {{in the collection of the}} local State Museum of Zoology, is the sole specimen for Saxony.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> but this seems to be rare.|$|E

25|$|In many {{situations}} the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and data {{will have to}} be weighted to correctly represent the population. Thus for example, a simple random sample of individuals in the United Kingdom might include some in remote <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands</b> who would be inordinately expensive to sample. A cheaper method would be to use a stratified sample with urban and rural strata. The rural sample could be under-represented in the sample, but weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate.|$|E
25|$|Ulva {{is known}} for its wildlife, which is usual for many <b>Scottish</b> <b>islands,</b> {{includes}} many varieties of seabirds. A number of raptors breed on the island including buzzards, golden eagles and sea eagles. Game birds include snipe, grouse, pheasant, and woodcock. White-tailed eagles, which were reintroduced in the nearby Island of Rùm have migrated to Mull, where they now have a stronghold - they can occasionally be seen on Ulva, but are not known to nest there. Ravens also breed here. Puffin, black-legged kittiwakes, shag, common and Arctic tern, gannets, eider ducks, oystercatchers, curlews, redshanks, red-breasted mergansers and gulls nest on the island and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds. Occasional visitors (usually not breeding) include - house martins, Leach's storm petrel, corncrakes (which are rare in the British Isles), peregrine falcons and spotted flycatchers.|$|E
