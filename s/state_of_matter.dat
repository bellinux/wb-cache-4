5|$|Plasma is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{in which}} an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive {{to the point that}} long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E
5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

25|$|Manykin et al. have {{suggested}} atmospheric Rydberg matter {{as an explanation}} of ball lightning phenomena. Rydberg matter is a condensed form of highly excited atoms in many aspects similar to electron-hole droplets in semiconductors. However, in contrast to electron-hole droplets, Rydberg matter has an extended life-time—as long as hours. This condensed excited <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is supported by experiments, mainly of a group led by Holmlid. It {{is similar to a}} liquid or solid <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> with extremely low (gas-like) density. Lumps of atmospheric Rydberg matter can result from condensation of highly excited atoms that form by atmospheric electrical phenomena, mainly due to linear lightning. Stimulated decay of Rydberg matter clouds can, however, take the form of an avalanche, and so appear as an explosion.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase {{changes are}} {{important}} topics {{in the teaching}} and learning of physical science. It is a common fact that learners find it difficult to understand the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes. One of the main reasons is that learners do not abandon their own naive perceptions when the scientific concepts are taught. They do not connect their experiences outside the laboratory / classroom with their experience in science lessons. Learners consequently hold their own views even after instruction. According to the constructivist view on teaching and learning educators need to take learners' perceptions into account in the teaching of these topics. The first aim with {{this study was to determine}} learners' alterative conceptions about the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes from a literature study. The second was to determine by means of an empirical study the alterative conceptions Grade 11 learners still hold after instruction of the topics. The empirical survey was conducted amongst a group of 110 Grade 11 learners studying physical science. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on this group of learners' knowledge on the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> phase changes after instruction of these topics. From the results of the questionnaire alternative conceptions could be identified. The results of the empirical study indicate that learners still have alternative conceptions about the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes after instruction. Alternative conceptions were identified and recommendations on how to teach the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes more effectively were made. Master...|$|R
25|$|The {{strength}} of the color force makes the properties of quark matter unlike gas or plasma, instead leading to a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> more reminiscent of a liquid.

25|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons {{confined in}} an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero.

5000|$|Plasma (from Ancient Greek , meaning [...] "moldable substance" [...] or [...] "jelly") {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{fundamental}} <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> while the others are solid, liquid, and gas.

25|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures {{very close}} to absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air, to ultra-low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{was first}} {{predicted}} by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta (now called photons). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the Zeitschrift für Physik, which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) {{in two other}} papers.|$|E
25|$|In {{physics and}} thermodynamics, an {{equation}} of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describes the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> under a given set of physical conditions. It is a constitutive equation which provides a mathematical relationship between two or more state functions associated with the matter, such as its pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.|$|E

40|$|For a long time, {{people believe}} that all {{possible}} <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> are described by Landau symmetry-breaking theory. Recently we find that string-net condensation provide a mechanism to produce <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> beyond the symmetry-breaking description. The collective excitations of the string-net condensed states {{turn out to be}} our old friends, photons and electrons (and other gauge bosons and fermions). This suggests that our vacuum is a string-net condensed state. Light and electrons in our vacuum have a unified origin – string-net condensation. ...|$|R

25|$|The gaseous <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{is found}} between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which {{provides}} the upper temperature boundary for gases. Bounding {{the lower end of}} the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention. High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas. For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{density of}} a liquid is usually {{close to that}} of a solid, and much higher than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed {{condensed}} matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars.|$|E
25|$|When a {{substance}} undergoes a phase transition (changes from one <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, {{the increase in}} kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See Enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the enthalpy of fusion and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the enthalpy of sublimation.|$|E
