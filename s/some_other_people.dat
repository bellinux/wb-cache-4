Some people will say when {{the first wave of}} large Han People {{immigration}} decided to leave from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th-century, then they must have had some concept to maintain some independence from the control of ruling class in their original hometown. And <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> will say not until the Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital at Tainan, had been built by Zheng Family in 1662, this kind of concept hasn't appeared.|$|E

2500|$|Nea Salamis {{was founded}} {{at the time}} of the Greek Civil War. The {{situation}} in Greece affected Cyprus, influencing politics and sport; most athletes were also involved in politics. At that time, Famagusta had two sports clubs: the Evagoras Gymnastics Association, or GSE, (...) and the Anorthosis Famagusta FC. GSE had many leftist athletes (some of the best in Cyprus) on its roster, and [...] many of Anorthosis' players were also leftists. In the right-wing political climate of the time, both clubs began restricting the admission of leftist players or denying them promotion. Additionally, Anorthosis was hosting at their clubhouse the right-wing Cypriot National Party. In early 1947 a group of leftists, members and of GSE and Anorthosis and <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> from Famagusta agreed on the need for another sport club which would appeal to all, regardless of political affiliation.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who actually put my name to it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E
