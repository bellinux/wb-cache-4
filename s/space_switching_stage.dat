40|$|Optical <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> are {{important}} subsystems in optical crossconnects (OXCs) and reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (R-OADMs), while also having applications in more long-term communications scenarios, such as optical packet switching. This chapter develops {{the theory of}} operation of planar optical <b>space</b> <b>switches,</b> and illustrates the interrelationship that exists between device characteristics, choice of architecture and <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance. The chapter also describes how switching elements {{from a variety of}} technologies can be combined into larger switch fabrics in different ways. Recent technological developments such as 3 D MEMS, covered elsewhere in this book, have radically changed the performance tradeoff landscape for very large, slow optical crossconnects typically having a reconfiguration time in the order of milliseconds. However, the original vision of interconnected waveguide-based switches still has relevance, especially for sub-nanosecond multiplexing and switching, including the emerging field of fast optical packet switching. Appropriate design can yield fabric performance significantly better than the individual switching elements can separately achieve. An optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> has multiple inputs and outputs, and can establish an optical connection between any idle input and any idle output, without involving conversion of the signal into electronic form. Similar systems, intended for purely electronic implementation, have been studied for over 50 years, and much of that work is amenable to optical implementation. Furthermore, the particular characteristics of optical switches (such as loss, crosstalk and problems of integration) have suggested a number of new architectures which are also discussed here. Besides describing the optical <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> and their implementation, the theory of their blocking performance is developed. (For further reading on theoretical results in switching, including additional topics such as Banyan networks and Baseline networks, see Reference [1]). Also, formulae are developed for optical loss, crosstalk and noise, which {{are important}} aspects of optical <b>space</b> <b>switch</b> performance. This survey is limited to architectures that have actually been built or fabricated, or are strong candidates for implementation in the future...|$|R

We review contention resolution {{methods used to}} avoid external blocking, and choose a solution based on ring reservation, resulting in an elegant and efficient mechanism requiring only nearest-neighbor communications. In addition to external blocking, <b>space</b> <b>switches</b> suffer from head-of-line (HOL) blocking, and our technique alleviates HOL blocking without arbitration time overhead.

High multicast throughput is achieved by employing call-splitting. Multiple latency priorities can also be supported.

The oscillator mixer {{consists of a}} conventional nMOS differential coupled oscillator, a <b>switch</b> <b>stage,</b> and a pMOS cross-coupled pair {{which is used to}} release the design constraint between the conversion gain and the start-up condition. Since the <b>switch</b> <b>stage</b> and the pMOS cross-coupled pair are stacked on the nMOS differential oscillator, the bias currents of the <b>switch</b> <b>stage</b> and the pMOS cross-coupled pair can be entirely reused, so as to reduce the power dissipation.
