25|$|During 1937, {{probably}} on Sadoveanu-Evan's request, Adevărul began publishing a special second-page column titled Femeile între ele ("Women amongst Themselves"), which included contributions from {{herself and her}} colleagues in the feminist movement, Papadat-Bengescu (who may have inspired the column's title) and Nădejde. They were joined by several consecrated or aspiring women writers, among them: Ticu Archip, Lucia Demetrius, Claudia Millian, Sanda Movilă, Profira Sadoveanu (Izabela's niece), Valeria Mitru (future wife of Mihail Sadoveanu), Coca Farago (daughter of poet Elena Farago) and Sorana Țopa (the actress wife of philosopher Mircea Eliade). Izabela Sadoveanu's own pieces for Femeile între ele included {{an overview of the}} suffragette movement and a positive report about the <b>Soroptimist</b> <b>International,</b> whose self-help ideas she tried to popularize in Romania, and a sarcastic reply to Archip's strong-voiced antifeminist stance. Also in 1937, Adevărul published her homage to French socialist and pacifist Jean Jaurès, who had fallen victim to nationalists shortly after the outbreak of World War I. A year later, she withdrew from teaching with a state pension, and dedicated her energy to editorial work for Adevărul Literar și Artistic, before the entire Adevărul family of papers were banned by King Carol II's authoritarian regime. In 1939, the Transylvanian left-wing magazine Societatea de Mâine published her short history of Romanian feminist organizations.|$|E
