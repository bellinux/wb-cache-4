5|$|And to Think That I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With And to Think That I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E

In the elections, the House and the Senate shifted to Democratic control. After the elections, on November 8, Bush announced Rumsfeld would resign his position as Secretary of Defense. Many Republicans were unhappy with the delay, believing they would have won more votes if voters had known Rumsfeld was resigning.|$|E

25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And to Think That I <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a map of the country.|$|E

25|$|Jean Ribault founded his colony at Port Royal in 1562, having {{previously}} {{come upon}} the St. Johns, {{which he called}} la Rivière de Mai (the River of May), because he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the first of that month. Two years later, in 1564, Laudonnière landed at the Indian town of Seloy, the site of present-day St. Augustine, Florida, and named the river la Rivière des Dauphins (the River of Dolphins) after its plentiful dolphins; moving north, he established a settlement at Fort Caroline {{on the south side}} of the St. Johns, six miles from its mouth. Philip II of Spain, who regarded the possession of Florida as necessary for the safety of Spanish commerce, hearing that Ribault, who had returned to France, was organizing another expedition for the relief of his colony of Huguenots across the Atlantic, determined to assert his claim to the possession of Florida on the ground of prior discovery, and root out the French at all costs. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés had already been authorized to settle there, and his force was increased to enable him first to expel the French.|$|E
25|$|During the 1660s, Shrew {{was adapted}} by John Lacy as Sauny the Scot, {{to make it}} better match with Fletcher's sequel. Originally {{performed}} under the Taming of the Shrew title, the play was published in 1698 as Sauny the Scot: or, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comedy. This version inconsistently anglicised the character names and recast the play in prose. Lacy also expanded the part of Grumio into the title role Sauny (who speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue), which he played himself. Sauny is an irreverent, cynical companion to Petruchio, and is comically terrified of his master's new bride. Lucentio was renamed Winlove, Baptista became Lord Beaufoy and Katherina was renamed Meg. In Sauny, Petruchio is much more vicious, threatening to whip Meg if she doesn't marry him, then telling everyone she is dead, and tying her to a bier. The play ends with her thoroughly tamed. Lacy's work premiered at Drury Lane in 1667, starring Susanna Verbruggen and George Powell. Samuel Pepys <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> 9 April and again on 1 November, enjoying it on both occasions. The play was popular enough that it was still being performed as late as 1732, when it was staged at Goodman's Fields Theatre, and it seems to have supplanted Shrews place on the English stage {{for the rest of the}} seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.|$|E

However, they were reluctant to cut material once they <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego.

Typecasting is the lazy man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain."

500|$|Wright {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists exhibition in 1768 {{and it was}} re-exhibited before Christian VII of Denmark in September the same year.

It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by Valentine Green which was published by John Boydell on 24 June 1769, and initially sold for 15 shillings. This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, in increasingly weak impressions. Ellis Waterhouse called it [...] "one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art".|$|E
