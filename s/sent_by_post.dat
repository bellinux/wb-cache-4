500|$|During the {{occupation}} an underground press flourished in Belgium from {{soon after the}} Belgian defeat, with eight newspapers appearing by October 1940 alone. Much of the resistance's press focused around producing newspapers in both French and Dutch language as alternatives to collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir. At its peak, the clandestine newspaper La Libre Belgique was relaying news within five to six days; faster than the BBC's French-language radio broadcasts, whose coverage lagged several months behind events. Copies of the underground newspapers were distributed anonymously, with some pushed into letterboxes or <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> <b>post.</b> Since they were usually free, the costs of printing were financed by donations from sympathisers. The papers achieved considerable circulation, with [...] reaching a regular circulation of 40,000 by January 1942 and peaking at 70,000, while the Communist paper, , reached 30,000. Dozens of different newspapers existed, often affiliated with different resistance groups or differentiated by political stance, ranging from nationalist, Communist, Liberal or even Feminist. The number of Belgians involved in the underground press is estimated at anywhere up to 40,000 people. In total, 567 separate titles are known from the period of occupation.|$|E

2500|$|When British author Ian Watson read Bishop's A Little Knowledge (1977), {{he was so}} {{fascinated with}} the alien Cygnusians that he wrote to inquire whether Bishop had plans {{to write a story}} about the aliens' home planet. [...] Thus began what Bishop calls [...] "the first ever [...] science fiction collaboration", with all {{correspondence}} <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> <b>post.</b> [...] Although often labeled as the third book in the series, it is not truly part of the main UrNu sequence. In this novel, published in the UK by Gollancz (1981) and in the US by Ace Books (1982), a Japanese linguist, crewmember of the research starship Heavensbridge, arrives on the home planet of the Kybers (so-called because they're seemingly made of flesh and metal.) [...] She soon learns that the planet's sun will shortly go nova. [...] Brian Stableford writes that the novel when compared with other recent sf collaborations [...] "is a very solid and rewarding piece of work. [...] Its basic premise is original and intelligently worked-out, and the storyline sustains the fascination of the reader throughout. [...] Nevertheless, it seems to me to fall slightly behind the standard set by recent solo works by either of the two authors." [...] He concludes that the [...] "book is worth reading, but it is not an outstanding work in either author's canon." [...] This is Michael Bishop's last novel-length work of other worlds fiction.|$|E

What the latter involved may be partly gathered from lists of the articles <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> <b>post</b> at that time.

Taper grew pale at the thought. What could they possibly get up to countervail it? Even Church and Corn-laws together would not do; and then Church was sulky, for the Conservative Cause had just made it a present of a commission, and all that the country gentlemen knew of Conservatism was, {{that it would not}} repeal the Malt Tax, and had made them repeal their pledges. Yet a cry must be found. A dissolution without a cry, in the Taper philosophy, would be a world without a sun. A rise might be got by 'Independence of the House of Lords;' and Lord Lyndhurst's summaries might be well circulated at one penny per hundred, large discount allowed to Conservative Associations, and endless credit. Tadpole, however, was never very fond of the House of Lords; besides, it was too limited. Tadpole wanted the young Queen brought in; the rogue!

6000|$|There {{still remains}} the small {{episode of the}} six letters {{unconnected}} with the P. T. volume, which were declared by Pope to be spurious in his preface to the quarto. Four of them purported to be from Pope to Miss Blount, and two to be letters of Atterbury to Pope. Those to Miss Blount were forwarded to Curll by a correspondent who signed himself S. E. The bookseller published them in the third volume of [...] "Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence," [...] and {{announced that he had}} discovered them to be translations from Voiture. S. E. only professed to send copies, which are now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Mr. Carruthers states correctly that the size and quality of the paper is precisely the same as in the genuine letters of the poet, and that the handwriting appears to be his [...] "a little disguised." [...] The letters bear on their face the marks of their origin, and Pope acted according to usage in endeavouring to delude Curll that he might afterwards build a charge upon his own deceptions. There is, however, a second claimant for the honour of having devised the cheat. In an edition of Pope's works, which belonged to Douce the antiquary, some one has copied an extract from a letter of Mr. J. Plumptre, dated May 1, 1744, in which he informs his wife that their son Charles, who was afterwards Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth, London, and Archdeacon of Ely, was the author of the trick.[126] The incident was nine years old when Mr. Plumptre proudly acquainted Mrs. Plumptre with the secret. He mentioned that the letters were sent to Curll by the penny post, and the original cover in the Bodleian Library shows that they were not <b>sent</b> <b>by</b> <b>post</b> at all. He said that his son translated them, and Pope had proclaimed that they were borrowed from a published translation. The account is false, and the pretended extract from the letter may be itself apocryphal, for its authenticity is guaranteed by no external testimony. The similarity of paper and handwriting, coupled with the pressing necessity Pope was under to supply himself with examples of fabrication, strongly indicate that the person who profited by the imposition contrived it.|$|E
