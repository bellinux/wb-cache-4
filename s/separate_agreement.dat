Kawasaki also began licensed production of the RTM322 engines in 2005. In a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> between Marubeni and AgustaWestland, a supply depot was established in Japan to support the MCH-101 and CH-101 fleets. The first MCH-101 was delivered to the JMSDF on 3 March 2006.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit and the King County Council {{signed a}} new joint-operations {{agreement}} in June 2002, leaving King County Metro as {{owners of the}} tunnel and Sound Transit responsible for paying part of the tunnel's debt service at an estimated cost of $65 million. The agreement would allow for buses and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of the Bowl Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were allowed to participate in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Rose Bowl, were not included in the Bowl Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the {{alliance}} lost another two affiliate members as British Airways continued {{the strategy of}} reducing its UK franchises. The first franchisee, GBAirways, exited {{the alliance}} on 30 March 2008, following its purchase by EasyJet. British Airways intended to start services from London Heathrow to Faro, Portugal, and Málaga, Spain, and from London Gatwick to Faro, Gibraltar, Ibiza, Málaga, Palma, and Tunis, which were operated under the franchise. The alliance bid farewell to one of its affiliate member Japan Asia Airways on 31 March 2008, following the airline's consolidation into its parent, Japan Airlines. The second British Airways franchisee, Loganair, left the alliance on 25 October 2008, following the ending of its franchise agreement with the airline. A <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> for codesharing on some Loganair services replaced the previous franchise, for British Airways passengers connecting through Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|Iraq, whose forces took {{an active}} part in the war (although it has no common border with Israel), withdrew its forces from the region in March 1949.

25|$|USIA {{operations}} declined since 1951. Between 1951 and 1955, over {{a hundred}} of its enterprises were shut down or merged. In 1955 Austria became an independent state and the Soviet Union withdrew its troops. The assets of USIA were sold to the Austrian government for 150 million US dollars, paid with goods over six years. The oil fields were subject to a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement,</b> which cost the Austrians around 200 million dollars. All written documentation of USIA disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In September 1974, the British and Egyptian governments {{initiated}} {{talks to}} establish a new Egyptian helicopter manufacturer. Out of these talks, the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) was established during the 1970s; this new organisation was accompanied by an initial arrangement to manufacture under license the Lynx AH.1 in Helwan, Egypt. A <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> was formalised with Rolls-Royce to licence manufacture the Lynx's Gem engines at the Helwan facility. However, this plan was ultimately aborted {{due to a lack of}} funds that had resulted from the collapse of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI).|$|E
25|$|When possible, the AFL forced {{industrial}} {{unions to}} break up into craft unions, dividing their memberships into exclusive groups with individual contracts. One example was the Amalgamated Association of Street Car Employees (AASCE) in 1912 which, {{with the aid of}} Cyrus S. Ching as company negotiator for Boston's public transit system, reached a system-wide agreement for all transit workers. But the AFL and its building trades affiliates were not happy with such an arrangement. Ching, AFL President Samuel Gompers, and International President William D. Mahon of the AASCE, held conferences in which the AASCE ceded jurisdiction over carpenters, painters, electricians, and other skilled trades. The union's membership was divided into 34 distinct labor units, each with a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} project {{started on}} 15 March 1995 when an inaugural {{memorandum of understanding}} between the governments of Turkmenistan and Pakistan for a pipeline project was signed. This project was promoted by Argentinian company Bridas Corporation. The U.S. company Unocal, {{in conjunction with the}} Saudi oil company Delta, promoted an alternative project without Bridas' involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> with Turkmenistan's president Saparmurat Niyazov. In August 1996, the Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas) consortium for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed. On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the Government of Turkmenistan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Telos Publishing {{produced}} {{a series of}} original Doctor Who novellas, published individually in hardcover; the first, Time and Relative by Kim Newman, was released on November 23, 2001. Although the series was reasonably successful (in spite of the odd publication format, which resulted from the BBC having reserved for its own use the rights to publish Doctor Who story collections and Doctor Who books in paperback), the BBC chose not to renew Telos's licence, and the series ended in March 2004, having completed 15 novellas featuring the Doctor. Prior to losing the license, {{a small number of}} Telos releases were re-issued in paperback form (albeit in a larger format than the BBC Books releases) following a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> with the BBC.|$|E
25|$|The Geneva Conference was {{attended}} by representatives of Cambodia, North Vietnam, the Associated State of Vietnam (the predecessor of the Republic of Vietnam, or South Vietnam), Laos, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States. One goal of the conference was to restore a lasting peace in Indochina. The discussions on Indochina began on May 8, 1954. The North Vietnamese attempted to get representation for the resistance government that had been established in the south, but failed. On July 21, 1954, the conference reached an agreement calling for a cessation of hostilities in Indochina. With respect to Cambodia, the agreement stipulated that all Viet Minh military forces be withdrawn within ninety days and that Cambodian resistance forces be demobilized within thirty days. In a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> signed by the Cambodian representative, the French and the Viet Minh agreed to withdraw all forces from Cambodian soil by October 1954.|$|E

25|$|On 12 February 1971 {{testimony}} was completed and a verdict expected. However, in March the court advised a settlement, explaining appeals were extremely time consuming. Negotiations began on 22 March and concluded on 24 December, {{three and a}} half years after the case had begun. Nikkatsu paid Suzuki ¥1000000, a fraction of his original claim, and Hori was forced to apologize for comments he made while serving as president. In a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> Nikkatsu donated Fighting Elegy and Branded to Kill to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. At the time of settlement Suzuki expressed fears that if he had continued to fight he might not even be able to get an apology from the failing company. During the course of the litigation Nikkatsu was being slowly dismantled. Hori's plans to restructure the company were unsuccessful and Nikkatsu was forced to liquidate studios and headquarter buildings. It released two final films in August 1971 and by November began producing roman poruno, softcore romantic pornography. Despite Suzuki's victory with wide support from the public and film world he was blacklisted by all major production companies and unable to make another film for 10 years.|$|E
500|$|That September, NuScale {{obtained}} a loan to re-hire 60 employees.

500|$|Article I: on the {{demarcation}} line; besides {{setting it}} out, it {{also stated that}} the line [...] "in no way prejudices the territorial claims of the two Contracting Parties." [...] The demarcation line would start in the west following the Curzon Line until it reached the Neman River. It would follow the Neman and Merkys Rivers, leaving the town of Varėna to the Lithuanians, but its train station on the Polish side. From Varėna the line would follow Barteliai–Kinčai–Naujadvaris–Eišiškės–Bastuny (Bastūnai, Бастынь). The train station in Bastuny also remained in Polish hands. The demarcation line east of Bastuny was {{to be determined by}} a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the United States of America, a legal {{separation}} may address {{the division of}} assets, division of debts, child custody, child support, and alimony.

50|$|The {{airfield}} {{closed on}} December 31, 1945 and the War Department handed over {{control to the}} City of Scottsbluff in 1947.

500|$|In 1948 the US government, {{through the}} War Claims Act, {{authorised}} a payment of US$60 for every month an adult spent in an internment camp, and US$25 {{per month for}} child internees. Some also received US$1 per day for [...] "missed meals". In the UK, from 1952 to 1956, about 8,800 British internees, specifically those who normally resided in the UK when the war began, received a sum of ₤48.50 as reparation. Payments for American and British internees were made from the proceeds of Japanese assets seized per the Treaty of San Francisco. Dutch internees each received a sum of US$100, with the payments funded by a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> signed between the Dutch and the Japanese in 1957.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... Once {{we were out of}} Vietnam the only way we could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
500|$|A student {{film society}} run by Kazuko Kawakita, the Cineclub Study Group, was {{planning}} to include Branded to Kill in a retrospective honouring Suzuki's works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation. With support from the Cineclub, similar student groups, fellow filmmakers and the general public—which included the picketing of the company's Hibiya offices {{and the formation of}} the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee—Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal. During the three-and-a-half year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light. He had been made into a scapegoat for the company's dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company-wide restructuring. A settlement was reached on December 24, 1971, in the amount of one million yen, a fraction of his original claim, as well as a public apology from Hori. In a <b>separate</b> <b>agreement</b> Branded to Kill and his previous film, Fighting Elegy, were donated to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art's Film Centre. The events turned Suzuki into a legend and shook the film world. Branded to Kill, along with other of his films, played to [...] "packed audiences who wildly applauded" [...] at all-night revivals in and around Tokyo. However, Suzuki was blacklisted by the major studios and did not make another feature film until A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness (1977) ten years after Branded to Kill. In the meantime, he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new architecture for Byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication that <b>separates</b> <b>agreement</b> that orders requests from execution that processes requests. This separation yields two fundamental and practically significant advantages over previous architectures. First, it reduces replication costs {{because the new}} architecture can tolerate faults in {{up to half of}} the state machine replicas that execute requests. Previous systems can tolerate faults in at most a third of the combined agreement/state machine replicas. Second, <b>separating</b> <b>agreement</b> from execution allows a general privacy firewall architecture to protect confidentiality through replication. In contrast, replication in previous systems hurts confidentiality because exploiting the weakest replica can be su#cient to compromise the system. We have constructed a prototype and evaluated it running both microbenchmarks and an NFS server. Overall, we find that the architecture adds modest latencies to unreplicated systems and that its performance is competitive with existing Byzantine fault tolerant systems...|$|R
