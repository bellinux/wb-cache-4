Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> {{in the war}} against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|In 681, Constantine IV {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Bulgar khan Asparukh, and the new Bulgarian state assumed {{sovereignty}} {{over a number of}} Slavic tribes that had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule. In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made <b>significant</b> <b>gains,</b> although {{the fact that he had}} to fight his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E
5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of {{similarities between the}} innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in experimental throughput.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{finished}} third in the gold and overall medal count, behind host nation China and Great Britain. The finish was an improvement from the 2004 Paralympics, where the U.S. finished fourth in the gold and overall medal count. The U.S. saw <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in Paralympic swimming, winning 17 gold medals and 44 total medals, 9 more than they took home from Athens. U.S. swimmers set a total of 16 world records, 23 Paralympic records, 48 Pan American records and 99 American records. U.S. coverage of the Games was provided by the Universal Sports Television Network and the official website of the U.S. Paralympic Team.|$|E

5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, {{more than in}} previous elections that the party had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, {{but there was no}} significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better in the south of England.|$|E
5|$|Although the Red Army was {{preparing}} for strategic counter-offensives before the war, Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By the middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad. The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).|$|E
5|$|By 1August 1944, the British {{had made}} <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had {{achieved}} a complete {{breakthrough in the}} west. On 4August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to prepare an advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen–Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise. However, strong resistance by the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division halted the advance. Although 12km (7.5mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.|$|E

5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian {{front was}} a {{separate}} theater of operations, which {{was involved in}} the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds. In addition, and again unlike Crete, the Venetians enjoyed the support of much of the local population, particularly the Morlacchi. The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some <b>significant</b> <b>gains,</b> including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres, and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment. The Ottomans were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split. In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of Šibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area. As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.|$|E
5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in cutting off a vital road that {{connected}} Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most {{probably not going to}} easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of the}} offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E

This property was evaluated in Section 5 and the {{conclusion is that}} already for small numbers of subcarriers per block a <b>significant</b> robustness <b>gain</b> against carrier CFOs as well as against Doppler spreads is provided compared to IFDMA. This property could provide a <b>significant</b> <b>gain</b> in certain scenarios, like for deployment in frequency bands using a several GHz {{carrier frequency}}.

5|$|Russian {{forces were}} making <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> into Ottoman {{territory}} during the Caucasus Campaign. In {{an attempt to}} prevent further advances by the Russian army, Yavuz rushed 429 officers and men, a mountain artillery battery, machine gun and aviation units, 1,000 rifles, and 300 cases of munitions to Trebizond on 4 February. On 4 March, the Russian navy landed a detachment of some 2,100 men, along with mountain guns and horses, {{on either side of}} the port of Atina. The Turks were caught by surprise and forced to evacuate. Another landing took place at Kavata Bay, some 5miles east of Trebizond, in June. In late June, the Turks counterattacked and penetrated around 20miles into the Russian lines. Yavuz and Midilli conducted a series of coastal operations to support the Turkish attacks. On 4 July, Yavuz shelled the port of Tuapse, where she sank a steamer and a motor schooner. The Turkish ships sailed northward to circle back behind the Russians before the two Russian dreadnoughts left Sevastopol to try to attack them. They then returned to the Bosphorus, where Yavuz was docked for repairs to her propeller shafts until September.|$|E
5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
5|$|With his {{predecessors}} {{unable to make}} <b>significant</b> <b>gains</b> in Rajputana, after ascending the throne, Shah made plans to annexe cities of the region to the Mughal empire. On 10 November Shah began his march to Amber (in Rajputana, present day Rajasthan state of India), visiting the tomb of Salim Chishti in Fatehpur Sikri on 21 November. In the meantime, Shah's aid Mihrab Khan was ordered to take possession of Jodhpur. Shah reached Amber on 20 January 1708. Though the monarch of the kingdom was Jai Singh, his brother Bijai Singh resented his rule. Shah ruled {{that because of the}} dispute, the region would become part of the Mughal empire and the city was renamed as Islamabad. Jai Singh's goods and properties were confiscated on the pretext that he supported Shah's brother Azam Shah during the war of Shah's succession and Bijai Singh was made the governor of Amber on 30 April 1708. Shah gave him the title of Mirza Rajah, and he received gifts valued at 100,000 rupees. Amber passed into Mughal hands without a war.|$|E

30|$|We see a <b>significant</b> <b>gain,</b> in the {{received}} SNR (blue dots) of the jth network client I 4 after applying our design, {{relative to}} the SNR under the HT scenario (green dots). This improvement in SNR comes from the successive jth network AP 1 transmission to its jth network client I 4. The gain in SNR is significant because, in the HT scenario, the signal transmission is marred by interference from the ith network AP 2. However, after implementing our design, the interference is mitigated and yields a <b>significant</b> SNR <b>gain.</b>|$|R
