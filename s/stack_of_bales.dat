60|$|Lenore dodged and ran. She was fleet, and {{eluded him}} down the lane, across the cut field, to a huge square <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> alfalfa. But he caught her just as she got behind its welcome covert. Lenore was far less afraid of him than of {{laughing}} eyes. Breathless, she backed up against the stack.|$|R
50|$|The neat <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>bales</b> in {{the loft}} is often sacrificed for the speed of just letting them fall and roll down the growing pile {{in the loft}}, and {{changing}} the elevator gates to fill in open areas around the loose pile. But if desired, the loose bale pile dropped by the elevator could be rearranged into orderly rows between wagon loads.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Large {{rectangular}} bales in a field, Charente, France. Sizes <b>of</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay need to {{be carefully}} managed, as the curing process is exothermic and the built up heat around internal bales can reach ignition temperatures in the right weather history and atmospheric conditions. Building a deep stack either too wide, or too high {{increases the risk of}} spontaneous ignition.|$|R

5000|$|Early in his career, he was nicknamed [...] "Comet" [...] {{because he}} was faster than several of his more {{successful}} opponents. His first major event was the Mille Miglia in 1956 with Eugenio Martins. The race ended the next year {{after the death of}} Alfonso de Portago. In 1958, Heins survived a crash during the Sports Car version of the Belgian Grand Prix. His car hit a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> hay <b>bales,</b> became airborne, flipped and slid with his upper body exposed. He suffered only minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|The term hay {{elevator}} also includes machinery {{involved in the}} <b>stacking</b> and storage <b>of</b> <b>bales.</b> A typical {{hay elevator}} includes an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull 3-inch spikes every few feet along the chain to grab bales and drag them along. Prior to rural electrification, barns were equipped with a vertical pulley and a horizontal track along which a <b>bale</b> <b>of</b> hay was guided manually.|$|R

Large <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> hay <b>bales</b> can be seen under the high roof at center, while a large opening at right allows hay wagons {{to pass through the}} structure. Two large flatbed wagons can be seen at center, each pulled by a team of eight mules and loaded with <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> hay. A smaller wagon is visible in the foreground at center, while an empty flatbed is at right. The words "Crown Flour Depot" appear {{on the roof of the}} building at left...|$|R
50|$|This {{incident}} was partially {{offset by the}} capture of the Mexican schooner Alma on the 19th and the seizure and destruction of the sloop Rosina on the 20th. Virginias last captures off San Luis Pass included the schooner Experiment, which she took on 3 May and subsequently destroyed and 94 <b>stacked</b> <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> cotton picked up ashore on the 7th and 8th.|$|R
60|$|While we looked, {{the waters}} {{increased}} so fast {{in this place}} {{that in a few}} minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river, for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals. We waded knee-deep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it was discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out, breast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.|$|R
5000|$|Straw bale {{building}} typically consists <b>of</b> <b>stacking</b> rows <b>of</b> <b>bales</b> (often in running-bond) on {{a raised}} footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform. There {{are two types}} of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three. The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions. Bale walls can be tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building ("load-bearing" [...] or [...] "Nebraska-style" [...] technique), {{as was the case in}} the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide lateral and shear support for wind and seismic loads.|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{engaged in}} farming have higher risks of injury and death from trauma {{than many other}} workers. Fatalities most often involve tractor-related {{incident}} such as roll-overs. Although it is also recognized that farm machinery may result in serious injuries and death, little has been reported on problems associated with hay baling, transport and storage. Case 1 : A 43 -year-old man trying to dislodge jammed hay in a hay baler had either been pulled, or had fallen, into the baler, {{where he had been}} crushed, rotated and then cocooned within a hay bale. The body showed extensive blunt trauma to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and limbs, with burning from a fire that subsequently started within the overheated machine. Case 2 : A 58 -year-old man was crushed between the moving arms of a hay shuttle and a safety fence. Death was attributed to blunt chest and abdominal trauma with crush asphyxia. Case 3 : A 56 -year-old man fell some distance from the top <b>of</b> <b>stacked</b> hay <b>bales</b> fracturing his neck and causing virtual transection of his cervical spinal cord. These cases demonstrate rare forms of farm deaths that may be associated with the creation (baling), moving (shuttling) and storage <b>of</b> hay <b>bales.</b> All forms <b>of</b> farm machinery should be treated circumspectly, given the possibility that serious injury or death may result from inattention or inappropriate handling. Temporary <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> hay <b>bales</b> may create high work platforms that risk falls with lethal consequences. Cheryl Charlwood, Roger W. Byar...|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, a {{group of}} Congregationalists in Arthur began {{planning}} a church. The building, constructed in the following year, was constructed <b>of</b> <b>stacked</b> and <b>baled</b> hay with walls 2 feet (60 cm) thick. [...] The building is now stuccoed {{on the outside and}} plastered on the inside, but in the course of renovations in 1976, it was determined that it had originally been plastered on both sides with locally obtained [...] "gumbo mud".|$|R
5000|$|The van {{eventually}} {{arrives at}} a dead end, and Frank drives the van up a hill before it eventually breaks down. Greg discovers that Meemaw's house is just down the hill, and they agree to push the car down it {{to get to the}} party and so their car could be towed. They manage to get the car rolling down the hill, and Frank, Susan, Rodrick and Manny (in his car seat), manage to jump into the car as it's rolling down the hill. Greg, however, lags behind and is forced to jump into the boat. The hill is bumpy, however, and the hitch comes undone, allowing the boat to diverge from the car and travel freely. Greg attempts to control it using the boat's wheel, but hits a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> hay <b>bales</b> and is launched into the air. The boat flies over Meemaw's fence and lands into her pool.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of this}} research was to compare the four harvesting systems listed in the Introduction by (a) evaluating hay losses during harvest and (b) calculating costs for a specific size of haying operation. The portion of the experiment pertaining to harvesting losses was modified to a comparison <b>of</b> <b>stacking</b> and <b>baling</b> after the grower-cooperator indicated it was impractical for him to handle a randomized layout for four treatments in a single experiment.

5000|$|William Henry Krell (1868-1933) {{composed}} what {{is regarded}} as the first rag or ragtime composition in 1897 called Mississippi Rag, published in New York by S. Brainard's Sons and copyrighted on January 27, 1897. The sheet music stated that it was the first rag-time two step ever written and was first played by Krell's Orchestra in Chicago although the structure {{is in the form of}} a patrol march. The cover shows a group of all ages dancing to a banjo player before onlookers sitting on a pile <b>of</b> <b>stacked</b> cotton <b>bales</b> on a dock on the Mississippi River. Krell also composed the rag Shake Yo' Dusters! or Piccaninny Rag in 1898. The popularity of [...] "Mississippi Rag" [...] resulted in the emergence of the genre known as ragtime.|$|R

50|$|None of the {{original}} historic wood-frame commercial buildings still remain. Compared to most small towns in Georgia, Comer is also unique because, with several small exceptions, Comer as a cohesive town remains largely intact from the 1890s. Development in Comer {{took place during the}} twin heights of the railroad and cotton in Georgia. There are only a few buildings remaining in town built in the years prior to 1890, and there are precious few {{in the center of town}} built after 1920. Of the buildings built before the 1890s, there are none left that pre-date the Civil War. During the height of cotton in the area from 1890-1911, Comer thrived and prospered. Comer was cotton, for a lack of a better description. Jere Ayers, a life-long resident of Comer, and editor of the Comer News recalls as a child being able to walk the length of a city block in Comer, entirely on the tops <b>of</b> <b>stacked</b> cotton <b>bales,</b> without once touching the ground. Mr. Ayers' father, C.B. Ayers, founded the local newspaper, the Comer News, in 1913.|$|R
50|$|Bank mynas feed on grain, {{insects and}} fruits. Like the common myna, they {{sometimes}} follow grazing animals picking up disturbed insects or even ticks on the animals. They feed on ripening {{crops such as}} those of sorghum, grape and pearl millet. They feed on a variety of insects, including some that are crop pests such as Achaea janata whose caterpillars feed on castor.Bank mynas have a nesting season from April to July or August, most birds breeding in May and June. The nest is always built in earth walls, on the banks of rivers, embankments or the sides of open wells. They will sometimes make use of holes in brick walls. Nests have also been recorded between <b>stacked</b> <b>bales</b> <b>of</b> sugarcane stalks. They excavate the nest hole, the egg chamber sometimes 4 to 7 feet from the entrance. The nest is lined with grass, feathers and sometimes snake sloughs. About four of five pale sky blue or greenish-blue eggs is the usual clutch. Two broods may be raised in the same season. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 14 days. Nestlings open their eyes after about 5 days and fledge in about 21 days. About 38% of the eggs hatched into young that fledged in one study.|$|R

40|$|Hay {{that has}} been baled with {{incorrect}} moisture content or {{that has been}} {{under the influence of}} moisture has potential to generate heat and create a fire hazard. Traditional means <b>of</b> monitoring <b>baled</b> hay temperature in storage, by inserting a pipe probe with thermometer, are time consuming. A ZigBee wireless sensor network could be used to remotely monitor internal hay bale temperatures. Tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of hay through which a 2. 4 GHz ZigBee module could transmit data and the resulting signal strength (RSSI). Based on analysis of the data, a ZigBee transmitter with 2 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 9 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay and a ZigBee transmitter with 50 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 18 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay. In general, RSSI decreased significantly with each additional 3 ft <b>of</b> <b>baled</b> hay...|$|R
