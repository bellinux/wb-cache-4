50|$|The {{characteristic}} constituents are biogenic amines (mostly tyramine in {{the young}} shoots), flavonoids (spiraeoside and scoparoside), isoflavones and their glycosides (genistin), as well as allelopathic quinolizidine alkaloids (mostly sparteine, lupanine, <b>scoparin</b> and hydroxy-derivatives), which defend the plant against insect infestation and herbivory (with {{the exception of the}} resistant Aphis cytisorum).|$|E
50|$|A {{powdered}} {{preparation of}} freeze-dried açaí fruit pulp and skin {{was shown to}} contain cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside as major anthocyanins; (3.19 mg/g) however, anthocyanins accounted for only about 10% of the overall antioxidant capacity in vitro. The powdered preparation was also reported to contain twelve flavonoid-like compounds, including homoorientin, orientin, taxifolin deoxyhexose, isovitexin, <b>scoparin,</b> as well as proanthocyanidins (12.89 mg/g), {{and low levels of}} resveratrol (1.1 μg/g).|$|E
40|$|Antibacterial and {{antifungal}} {{properties of}} wax and hexane extracts of Citrus spp. peels were tested using bioautographic and microdilution techniques against three plant pathogenic fungi (Penicillium digitatum, Curvularia sp., and Colletotrichum sp.), two human pathogens (Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum canis), and two opportunistic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). Two polymethoxylated flavonoids and a coumarin derivative, were isolated and identified from peel extracts, which presented antimicrobial activity especially against M. canis and T. mentagrophytes: 4 ', 5, 6, 7, 8 -pentamethoxyflavone (tangeritin) and 3 ', 4 ', 5, 6, 7, 8 -hexamethoxyflavone (nobiletin) from C. reticulata; and 6, 7 -dimethoxycoumarin (also known as escoparone, scoparone or <b>scoparin)</b> from C. limon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMauritia flexuosa L. f. is {{a native}} palm tree from the South American Amazon {{rainforest}} commercialized in food, cosmetics and medicine. This paper reported the antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and characterization of phenolics from buriti leafs, trunk and fruit extracts. The total phenolics of the buriti extracts ranged from 378. 07 ± 3. 12 to 86. 89 ± 3. 15 mg GAEq/ 100 g and flavonoid content ranged from 567. 16 ± 1. 15 to 246. 84 ± 1. 11 mg QUEREq/ 100 g. The antioxidant activity assays with EC 50 of 12. 28 ± 0. 022 to 19. 58 ± 0. 064 mg/mL revealed the antioxidant capacity of M. flexuosa extracts. Results of the antimicrobial tests against some pathogenic bacteria revealed its strong ability to inhibit the growth of pathogen with low MIC values, where the best results were found with the leaf extract against the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 50 μg/mL). The characterization of the phenolic compounds using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC–ESI-MS/MS) was based on CID experiments of the observed precursors, thus 13 compounds were tentatively identified ((+) -catechin, caffeic acid hexoside, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, narigenin, myricetin, vitexin, <b>scoparin,</b> rutin, cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside, cyanidin- 3 -glucoside, (−) -epicatechin and kaempferol). These results indicate that antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in buriti phenolic extracts are quite potent and implicate the presence of compounds with potent free-radical-scavenging activity...|$|E
