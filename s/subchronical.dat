40|$|Pork meat-derived {{products}} {{can contribute to}} the overall ochratoxin A intake, either by carry-over effect, or by environmental mould population cross-contamination. In order to assess the role of these different contamination routes, a study was carried out with pigs challenged orally with OTA contaminated feed at <b>subchronical</b> level. After slaughtering, thighs and minced meat from control and treated groups were transformed into dry-cured hams and salami, respectively, which were analysed for OTA determination after ripening. From collected data, the carry-over in muscle was generally low, whereas a significant contribution to the OTA contamination in dry-cured hams was due to toxinogenic mould population growing on their surface during ripening. Finally, a survey of different types of dry-cured ham (n = 110), from the Italian market, was performed, showing the occurrence of OTA on the surface portion in 84 out of 110 samples with a median value of 0. 53 µg/kg and in the inner core in 32 out of 110 samples with a median value lower than 0. 1 µg/kg.

40|$|Prometryne is a methylthio-s-triazine {{herbicide}} used {{to control}} annual broadleaf and grass weeds in many cultivated plants. Significant traces are documented in environment, mainly water, soil and plants used for human and domestic animal nutrition. Data on the toxic effects of prometryne and other methylthios-triazine have scorcely been published. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate if prometryne, applied orally, could induce DNA damage in mouse leukocytes, in <b>subchronical</b> in vivo experimental design. Three different doses of prometryne were applied per os repeatedly every 48 hours. After the 7 th dose (day 14) and the 14 th dose (day 28) blood leucocytes were analyzed by alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The results of three different comet parameters showed general increase in Olive tail moment, tail length and tail intensity values in treated groups of animals. The increase in measured values was almost proportional to the dose received and the time of exposure. We conclude that prometryne or its metabolic residues have the potential to induce processes that cause genotoxic effects on leukocytes on mice in in vivo repeated exposure...|$|E
40|$|Nitroxoline is an {{effective}} antibacterial agent that is industrially produced by chemical and pharmaceutical enterprises in Ukraine. Parameters of its toxicity are determined under conditions of acute and subchronic toxicological experiments on 3 kinds of laboratory animals, by administering the drug orally and by application onto the skin and mucous membranes. The duration of acute experiment was 14 days, <b>subchronical</b> - 24 days. It was found that median lethal dose (DL 50) for white female rats is 980 (852 : 1127) mg/kg, of white male rats – 835 mg/kg, white male mice– 660 mg/kg, by this parameter the drug {{can be attributed to}} 3 class of hazard – moderately hazardous substance. Average effective time of death (ET 50) for albino rats is 28 hours. Species sensitivity of laboratory animals to nitroxoline is slightly expressed. The death of the animals starts on the first day after the injection and is recorded during three days of the experiment. In application on intact skin, locally-irritant and skin-resorptive effects are absent. After contact with the mucous membrane of the eye the drug causes weak irritant effect. Nitroxoline has a moderate cumulative activity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the postero-lateral {{hypothalamus}} {{are located}} two neuronal systems that utilize the neuropeptides melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretins (also called orexins) as neuromodulators. These systems have reciprocal connections between them, and project throughout {{the central nervous}} system. MCH {{has been involved in}} the generation of sleep, mainly REM sleep, while hypocretins have a critical role in the generation of wakefulness. MCHergic activity is also involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MD). In this regards, intracerebral administration of MCH promotes pro-depressive behaviors (i. e., immobility in the forced swimming test) and REM sleep hypersomnia, which is an important trait of depression. Furthermore, the antagonism of the MCHR- 1 receptor has a reliable antidepressant effect, suggesting that MCH is a pro-depressive factor. Hypocretins have been also involved in mood regulation; however, their role in depression is still on debate. Taking these data into account, we explored whether systemic <b>subchronical</b> treatment with Fluoxetine (FLX), a serotonergic antidepressant, modifies the concentration of MCH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the preproMCH mRNA expression. We also evaluated the hypocretinergic system by quantifying the hypocretin-levels in the CSF and the preprohypocretin mRNA expression. Compared to control, FLX increased the levels of preprohypocretin mRNA without affecting the hypocretin- 1 CSF levels. On the contrary, FLX significantly decreased the MCH CSF concentration without affecting the preproMCH gene expression. This result is in agreement with the fact that MCH serum level diminishes during the antidepressant treatment in MD, and supports the hypothesis that an increase in the MCHergic activity could have pro-depressive consequences...|$|E
