5|$|General {{aviation}} {{activities at the}} airport gradually increased. In the early 1960s, <b>sailplanes</b> became popular at the airport. The aerodrome is located with good wind and air pressure conditions for sailplane flying, and Oslo Flyklubb stationed two of its <b>sailplanes</b> at Tuven. Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|Gliding is a {{recreational}} activity and competitive air sport in which pilots fly unpowered aircraft known as gliders or <b>sailplanes</b> using naturally occurring currents of rising {{air in the}} atmosphere to remain airborne. The word soaring is also used for the sport. which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers {{in the rest of}} the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aeronautical sports is <b>sailplane</b> flying- flying aircraft with no engine, either for pleasure or at competitions. Soaring is a the most challenging sport for all aviators. If for any reason (severe turbulence, pilot's error, etc.) the speed of <b>sailplane</b> drops below the stalling speed, at such high angle of bank the <b>sailplane</b> will most probably fall into a spin. Spin is a very dangerous and unpleasant maneuver, and in the history of aviation, very large number of both aircraft and <b>sailplane</b> accidents was caused by spin. So, good spin recovery characteristics are imperative for any modern <b>sailplane.</b> Vuk-T <b>sailplane</b> is modern single seat, all composite <b>sailplane</b> for advanced pilot training and competitions, designed at the Belgrade Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Major assumptions that were a starting point in this subject are the adopted aerodynamic concepts of the <b>sailplane</b> and the full system of equations for the aircraft motion in the case of spin...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} an array of sensors that could {{be attached to the}} wings of a <b>sailplane</b> to measure the exterior wind forces.
