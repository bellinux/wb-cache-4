Geochemical, isotopic and petrographic data show that Carrara, Thasian and Docimium/Afyon marbles were used in manufacturing the mosaic constituting the floor <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Villa...|$|R
50|$|The {{boundaries}} <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> shows embayment {{by other}} materials of other units. By this cross-cutting relationship, it provides evidence <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> being the oldest unit within the strata.|$|R
40|$|Mapping of {{dominant}} trends of deformation and topographic analysis <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> reveal that (1) consistant patterns of deformation exist between individual tesserae; (2) regional deformation associated with coronae and rifts commonly overprints tesserae fabrics; (3) normalized area frequency plots <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> display a strongly bimodal distribution between - 70 to 70 degrees latitude; and (4) the relief at tessera margins is relatively constant and independent <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> elevation. We {{are continuing to}} expand these observations and test their implications for the formation <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> and for global models of deformation on Venus...|$|R
40|$|Tessera {{terrain is}} {{characterized}} by relatively high elevations and complex tectonic patterns; analysis of Venera 15 / 16 data showed that large (up to thousands of km across) and small (up to hundreds of km across) occurrences <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> are widespread and non-randomly distributed and make up about 10 - 15 percent of the surface of Venus north of approximately 30 deg N. In a previous analysis, we used the Magellan Cycle 1 and 2 data to map the global distribution <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> {{on the basis of}} the following: (1) complex deformational patterns (two or more trends); (2) relatively high radar backscatter; and (3) relatively high elevation. Here we report on the quantitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> areal, size, and shape distribution and on the characteristics and distribution <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> boundaries. Experiments on volcanic flooding <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> and implications for tessera presence beneath the plains and analysis of the distribution of impact craters on tesserae and the plains are reported elsewhere...|$|R

50|$|In the {{downwelling}} model, mantle downwelling, possibly due to mantle convection, causes {{compression and}} thickening of the crust, creating the compressional elements <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain. Isostatic rebound occurs {{due to the}} crustal thickening. After downwelling ends, a delamination event within the mantle produces extensional elements <b>of</b> <b>tessera.</b> This model does not currently explain tessera's location within crustal plateaus, and instead predicts a domical shape.|$|R
40|$|Mapping <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain using Magellan global {{high-resolution}} {{data has}} shown that it comprises about 10 percent of the surface area of Venus, is not randomly distributed, is extremely highly deformed relative to intervening plains, lies at {{a wide range of}} elevations, is embayed by and largely predates adjacent volcanic plains, is generally negatively correlated with broad lowlands and volcanic rises, may underlie a considerable percentage of the superposed volcanic plains, and has linear/tectonic margins for about 27 percent of its boundaries. In this paper, we investigate further the distribution and origin <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> through analysis <b>of</b> the changing nature <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> occurrences during sequential flooding, and assessment of the nature and distribution of Type 2 (linear/tectonic) tessera boundaries...|$|R

50|$|In the {{pulsating}} continents model, differentiated, low density crust survives early global subduction events forming continental regions. These regions undergo compression due to heating {{from the}} surrounding mantle, forming the compressional features <b>of</b> <b>tessera,</b> such as fold and thrust belts, and basin dome terrain. After sufficient crustal thickening has occurred, new lithosphere is generated causing gravitational collapse, producing the extensional features <b>of</b> <b>tessera,</b> such as extensive grabens. During this collapse, decompression causes partial melting, producing the intratessera volcanism seen within the larger regions <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain. This model requires that the material comprising tessera terrain is continental in nature. Future missions to venus to sample surface compositions are necessary to support this model. This model does not currently explain how a global subduction event could cause the delamination of the entire mantle lithosphere, leaving only low density crust behind.|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces <b>of</b> <b>tesserae.</b> The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces <b>of</b> <b>tesserae,</b> on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the archaeometric {{characterisation}} <b>of</b> 38 glass <b>tesserae</b> <b>of</b> various colours from an in situ mosaic in Aquileia, Italy, dated to {{the second half of}} the fourth century AD. The examination of the textural, mineralogical and chemical features, conducted by means of a multi-methodological approach (optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), electron probe micro analysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fibre Optic Reflectance Spectrophotometer (FORS)), has provided valuable insights into the changes in the production technology during the transition between the Roman and the Late Antique periods. The assemblage is heterogeneous, and each chromatic group is composed <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> produced with different base glasses and colouring/opacifying techniques, suggesting diverse supplies. A small group <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> shows strict links to the Roman tradition in terms of both base glass and colouring/ opacifying techniques and was probably obtained by re-using tesserae from older mosaics. Conversely, a larger group <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> shows textural and chemical evidence of recycling and indicates the prompt use of Bnew^ opacifying technologies (such as the use of tin compounds) or uncommon technological solutions (such as the use of quartz and bubbles as opacifiers or the addition of metallurgical slags in red tesserae), suggesting a specific production in the fourth century AD...|$|R
40|$|Geological {{mapping of}} the V- 56 {{quadrangle}} (Fig. 1) reveals various tectonic and volcanic features and processes in Lada Terra that consist <b>of</b> <b>tesserae,</b> regional extensional belts, coronae, volcanic plains and impact craters. This study aims {{to map the}} spatial distribution of different material units, deformational features or lineament patterns and impact crater materials. In addition, we also establish the relative age relationships (e. g., overlapping or cross-cutting relationship) between them, in order to reconstruct the geologic history. Basically, this quadrangle addresses how coronae evolved in association with regional extensional belts, in addition to evolution <b>of</b> <b>tesserae,</b> regional plains and impact craters, which are also significant geological units of Lada Terra...|$|R
40|$|The tesserate {{pattern of}} endoskeletal {{calcification}} {{has been investigated}} in jaws, gill arches, vertebral arches and fins of the sharks Carcharhinus menisorrah, Triaenodon obesus and Negaprion brevirostris by techniques of light and electron microscopy. Individual tesserae develop peripherally at the boundary between cartilage and perichondrium. An inner zone, the body, is composed of calcified cartilage containing viable chondrocytes separated by basophilic contour lines which have been called Liesegang waves or rings. The outer zone <b>of</b> <b>tesserae,</b> the cap, is composed of calcified tissue {{which appears to be}} produced by perichondrial fibroblasts more directly, i. e., without first differentiating as chondroblasts. Furthermore, the cap zone is penetrated by acidophilic Sharpey fibers of collagen. It is suggested that scleroblasts of the cap zone could be classified as osteoblasts. If so, the cap could be considered a thin veneer of bone atop the calcified cartilage of the body <b>of</b> a <b>tessera.</b> By scanning electron microscopy it was observed that outer and inner surfaces <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> differ in appearance. Calcospherites and hydroxyapatite crystals similar to those commonly seen on the surface of bone are present on the outer surface <b>of</b> the <b>tessera</b> adjacent to the perichondrium. On the inner surface adjoining hyaline cartilage, however, calcospherites of variable size are the predominant surface feature. Transmission electron microscopy shows calcification in close association with coarse collagen fibrils on the outer side <b>of</b> a <b>tessera,</b> but such fibrils are absent from the cartilaginous matrix along the under side <b>of</b> <b>tesserae.</b> Calcified cartilage as a tissue type in the endoskeleton of sharks is a primitive vertebrate characteristic. Calcification in the tesserate pattern occurring in modern Chondrichthyes may be derived from an ancestral pattern of a continuous bed of calcified cartilage underlying a layer of perichondral bone, as theorized by Ørvig (1951); or the tesserate pattern in these fish may itself be primitive...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before an in situ elemental characterization {{was performed by}} means of HH-EDXRF to study possible similarities/differences on the elemental composition of the colored mosaics. For that, four to nine measurements in different <b>tesserae</b> <b>of</b> the same color were performed {{to have a big}} enough replicate measurements from each type <b>of</b> <b>tesserae.</b> Thanks to that, representative analysis and further chemometric data treatment were performed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tesserae</b> are regions <b>of</b> heavily {{deformed}} terrain on Venus, {{characterized by}} two or more intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, and subsequent high radar backscatter. Tesserae often represent the oldest material at any given location and {{are among the most}} tectonically deformed terrains on Venus's surface. Diverse types <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain exist. It is not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions of Venus's mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation and fall. Multiple models <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> formation exist and further extensive studies of Venus's surface are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain.|$|R
5000|$|Tesserae are {{recognized}} as covering 7.3% of Venus's surface, approximately 33.2×106 km, and occur mostly within a few extensive provinces. They are heavily concentrated between 0°E and 150°E. These longitudes represent a large area between a crustal extension center in the Aphrodite Terra and a crustal convergence center in Ishtar Terra. Tesserae are exposed almost entirely within Venus's crustal plateaus. <b>Tessera</b> inliers, regions <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> not found within current crustal plateaus are thought to represent regions of collapsed crustal plateaus. Large regions <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain are labelled based on their latitude. Regions in the equatorial and southern latitudes are labelled as [...] "Regio" [...] while regions in the northern latitudes are labelled as [...] "Tesserae" [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{intersecting}} {{of material}} and tectonic structures are the defined characteristic <b>of</b> <b>tessera,</b> but the sets are not always seen in the images.

40|$|The present paper aims at {{investigating}} Late Ro- man mosaic tesserae excavated in 2008 at {{the sanctuary}} of Isis and Sarapis, an archaeological site of ancient Messene situated in the south-western Peloponnese region of Greece. In order to further understand the production <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> during Roman times, both archaeological and scientific aspects will be considered, however, emphasis will {{be placed on the}} scientific analysis <b>of</b> the <b>tesserae</b> this in turn, leading to concrete findings which can further contribute to existing studies...|$|R

Comparisons {{with the results}} of the Magellan radar survey and the model NIR images show that the night-time VMC images provide reliable information on spatial variations of the NIR surface emission. Here we consider if tessera terrain has the different NIR emissivity (and thus mineralogical composition) in com- parison to the surrounding basaltic plains. This is done through the study of an area SW of Beta Regio where there is a massif <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain, Chimon-mana Tessera, surrounded by supposedly basaltic plains.

50|$|Basin and Dome Terrain, {{also known}} as {{honeycomb}} terrain, consists of curved ridges and troughs that form a pattern analogous to an egg carton.

50|$|According to the French {{archaeologist}} François Chamoux, the mosaics of Delos in the Cyclades {{represent the}} zenith of Hellenistic-period mosaic art employing the use <b>of</b> <b>tesserae</b> to form complex, colorful scenes.

5000|$|... #Caption: The {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> {{as older}} continental-style cratons {{is supported by}} geological analysis of Ashtar Terra and its surroundings. Compression forces, coupled with {{the inability of the}} thin basaltic crust to subduct, resulted in fold mountains around the edges of Ishtar. Further compression led to underthrusting of material that subsequently was able to partially melt and feed volcanism in the central plateau.|$|R
40|$|Tessera {{terrain is}} the {{dominant}} tectonic landform in the northern high latitudes of Venus mapped by the Venera 15 and 16 orbiters and is concentrated in the region between the mountain ranges of western Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra. Tesserae are characterized by regionally high topography, a high-degree of small scale surface roughness, and sets of intersecting tectonic features. Available Pioneer Venus line of sight gravity data suggest that tessera terain is compensated at shallow depths relative to many topographic highs on Venus and may be supported by crustal thickness variations. Three types <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain can be defined {{on the basis of}} structural patterns: subparallel ridged terrain (Tsr), trough and ridge terrain (Ttr), and disrupted terrain (Tds). Observed characteristics <b>of</b> <b>tessera</b> terrain are compared to predictions of formational and modificational models in order to begin to address the question of its origin and evolution. It is found that horizontal convergence and late stage gravitational relaxation are basic observations for subparallel ridged terrain and disrupted terrain...|$|R
