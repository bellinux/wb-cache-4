5|$|Five males {{collected}} from an M. vindex nest are {{presumed to be}} M. inquilina, but {{the similarities between the}} two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are darker, and two specimens show a reddish-brown colour {{at the base of the}} first gastric <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The genitalia is similar, but a more detailed study can distinguish these features among the two ants.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes show a {{diversity}} of mating styles and structures. In the basal order Polyxenida (bristle millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other millipede groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located {{at the rear of}} the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body <b>segment.</b> <b>A</b> few species are parthenogenetic, having few, if any, males.|$|E
5|$|One of Orton's first {{official}} WWF appearances was March 16, 2002 at WrestleMania X8's Fan Axxess, {{where he was}} defeated by Tommy Dreamer. Orton's first televised WWF match was a victory against Hardcore Holly on SmackDown! on April 25, 2002. Soon after, Orton became a fan favorite and {{was placed in a}} series of matches with Holly. In September 2002, Orton was drafted to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show. Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury, leaving him sidelined for months. While recovering, Orton still appeared on Raw in his own Randy News Network <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> weekly vignette featuring him talking about his condition. The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered villain.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY590 {{date back to}} the start of the 1950s when work first began on the Sea Breeze Expressway, a part-divided highway, part limited-access highway that {{extended}} from Rochester north to the Lake Ontario shoreline at Sea Breeze. The highway was built in stages from north to south, with the first section—a divided highway connecting Culver Road to East Ridge Road in Irondequoit—opening to traffic in the early 1950s as a realignment of NY18. The northern end of the roadway was situated just west of the Irondequoit Bay outlet, where Irondequoit Bay meets Lake Ontario. Construction on the next <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> limited-access extension south to Empire Boulevard (U.S. Route104 or US104), began in the mid-1950s. The new roadway was completed in the late 1950s, at which time it became part of a rerouted US104.|$|E

25|$|Navajo is {{difficult}} to classify in terms of broad morphological typology: it relies heavily on affixes—mainly prefixes—like agglutinative languages, but these affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult to <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> trait of fusional languages. In general, Navajo verbs contain more morphemes than do nouns (on average, 11 for verbs compared to 4–5 for nouns), but noun morphology is less transparent. Navajo is sometimes classified as a fusional language and sometimes as agglutinative or even polysynthetic.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the reforms of the power sector, new capital was attracted, both in terms of {{privatization}} and greenfield projects. Some of the state-owned generation capacity was acquired by foreign investors such as Tractebel, AES, Prisma Energy, El Paso and Duke, which became significant producers. In addition, local investors such as industrial groups, large customers, utilities and pension funds also invested heavily in the national generation sector. Other companies such as EdF (Électricité de France), Endesa and Chilectra focused on the distribution <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> segment in which privatization brought improved quality of service and a reduction of theft, non-payments and technical losses.|$|E

25|$|It {{had been}} known for over 30 years that a major {{earthquake}} on either of two nearby faults (the San Andreas and the Hayward) could destroy the major cantilever span. Little was done {{to address this problem}} until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and while the epicenter was distant from the bridge, a 50-foot (15m) section of the upper deck of the eastern truss viaduct portion of the bridge collapsed onto the deck below, indirectly causing one death at the point of collapse. The bridge was closed for a month as construction crews removed and reconstructed the fallen section. It reopened on November 18, 1989, with a new stronger retrofit in place. The failure was at the transition between the easternmost through-truss and the westernmost double-deck causeway <b>segment,</b> <b>a</b> location where the inertial response character of the structure makes an abrupt change. Analysis of the event completed by internal staff has shown that the bridge was close to a far more catastrophic failure in which either the through-truss or the causeway segment would have dropped from their common support structure.|$|E
