50|$|In the 1870s the {{building}} of Parkeston Quay had started and land {{to the east of}} that site was allocated for the new engine <b>shed</b> which opened in March 1883. The <b>shed</b> was a four-road brick-built straight-shed with an outdoor turntable located between the <b>shed</b> and running lines. Access to the <b>shed</b> was from the Harwich direction and the <b>shed</b> was provided with coaling and watering facilities. In the 1890s the <b>shed</b> was equipped to deal with some repairs although these were generally undertaken at Ipswich engine <b>shed</b> further down-line.|$|R

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it <b>sheds</b> all its feathers; in the spring, it <b>sheds</b> all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and {{at the edges of the}} short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevated}} {{stations are}} built in glass, concrete and steel to minimize their visual impact. Outside, there is parking for bicycles, cars, buses and taxis. The platforms are open, but have <b>sheds</b> {{as well as}} automatic sensors that halt trains if obstacles are detected on the tracks.|$|E
25|$|The GER {{became part}} of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. This was the death knell for the <b>shed,</b> as the LNER had a former GNR <b>shed</b> in Lincoln, and {{although}} the GER <b>shed</b> was more conveniently located for the sidings, Pyewipe Junction <b>shed</b> closed on 2 October 1924, with the men transferring to Lincoln ex-GNR <b>shed.</b>|$|R

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria <b>sheds</b> {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after Nelson's death, the state traded land for Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site {{is now known as}} the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool <b>sheds</b> was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shedding.</b> Reptiles <b>shed</b> {{their skin}} {{through a process}} called ecdysis which occurs {{continuously}} throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to <b>shed</b> once every 5–6 weeks while adults <b>shed</b> 3-4 times a year. O Younger reptiles <b>shed</b> more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of <b>shedding</b> drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between {{the old and new}} layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing for <b>shedding</b> to occur. Snakes will <b>shed</b> from the head to the tail while lizards <b>shed</b> in a “patchy pattern”. Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards will occur when ecdysis, or <b>shedding,</b> fails. There are numerous reasons why <b>shedding</b> fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries. Nutritional deficiencies decreases proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on the other hand, forms scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of ecdysis.|$|R
40|$|The hair growth {{cycle is}} {{generally}} recognized to comprise phases of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen). Whereas, heretofore, the hair <b>shedding</b> function has been {{assumed to be}} part of the telogen phase, using a laboratory mouse model and newly developed techniques for quantitative collection and spectroscopic determination of <b>shed</b> hair, we found that <b>shedding</b> actually occurs as a distinct phase. Although some <b>shedding</b> occurs throughout the growth cycle, the largest peak is coupled to anagen. Using hair dye and rhodamine labeling we established that the shafts that <b>shed</b> arise during the previous hair cycle. We found that over the cycle the ratio of <b>shed</b> overfur to <b>shed</b> underfur hair shafts varies with the cycle phase and that the <b>shed</b> shaft base is unique morphologically, having a cylindrical shape with scalloped or “nibbled” edges. By electron microscopy the mooring cells of the exogen root show intercellular separation suggesting a proteolytic process in the final <b>shedding</b> step. This is the first report describing a distinct <b>shedding,</b> or exogen, phase of the hair cycle. This study supports the notion that this phase is uniquely controlled and that the final step in the <b>shedding</b> process involves a specific proteolytic step...|$|R
5|$|Analysts {{see in the}} {{character}} of Lady Macbeth the conflict between femininity and masculinity as they are impressed in cultural norms. Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion, motherhood, and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition, ruthlessness, and the singleminded pursuit of power.

5|$|As a {{precursor}} low-pressure area, Sam brought widespread rainfall throughout a wide swath of northern Australia. Due to {{its proximity to}} the coast throughout its existence, associated rainfall continued to affect the region throughout Sam's existence. As Sam approached the coast, numerous warnings were issued, with storm warnings posted for Cape Leveque to Pardoo Station on 8December. Meteorologists indicated that the storm would {{be a threat to}} shipping in the immediate regions. Due to its impending threat to the northwestern coast of Australia, most of the residents of Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station were evacuated via helicopter. Upon landfall, though severe damage was wrought, damage was localized. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was a measurement of 973mbar (hPa; 28.74inHg). Some buildings were severely damaged, and trees, power lines, <b>sheds,</b> and fences were downed by the strong winds. Staff quarters and <b>sheds</b> in the Anna Plains Station were demolished. The cattle station also lost electrical power during the storm.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling <b>sheds</b> its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 (HSV- 1) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) {{infection}} leads to a life-long latent infection of ganglia innervating the oral mucosa. HSV- 1 and VZV reactivation {{is more common in}} immunocompromised individuals and may result in viral <b>shedding</b> in saliva. We determined the kinetics and quantity of oral HSV- 1 and VZV <b>shedding</b> in HSV- 1 and VZV seropositive individuals infected with HIV and to assess whether HSV- 1 <b>shedding</b> involves reactivation of the same strain intra-individually. HSV- 1 and VZV <b>shedding</b> was determined by real-time PCR of sequential daily oral swabs (n= 715) collected for a median period of 31 days from 22 individuals infected with HIV. HSV- 1 was genotyped by sequencing the viral thymidine kinase gene. Herpesvirus <b>shedding</b> was detected in 18 of 22 participants. <b>Shedding</b> of HSV- 1 occurred frequently, on 14. 3 % of days, whereas solely VZV <b>shedding</b> was very rare. Two participants <b>shed</b> VZV. The median HSV- 1 load was higher compared to VZV. HSV- 1 DNA positive swabs clustered into 34 <b>shedding</b> episodes with a median duration of 2 days. The prevalence, duration and viral load of herpesvirus <b>shedding</b> did not correlate with CD 4 counts and HIV load. The genotypes of the HSV- 1 viruses <b>shed</b> were identical between and within <b>shedding</b> episodes of the same person, but were different between individuals. One-third of the individuals <b>shed</b> an HSV- 1 strain potentially refractory to acyclovir therapy. Compared to HSV- 1, oral VZV <b>shedding</b> is rare in individuals infected with HIV. Recurrent oral HSV- 1 <b>shedding</b> is likely due to reactivation of the same latent HSV- 1 strain...|$|R
