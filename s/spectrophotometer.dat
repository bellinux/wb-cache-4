5|$|A {{publication}} in the scholarly literature compared the optical {{quality of the}} DU to the Cary 14 <b>Spectrophotometer,</b> another leading UV-Vis <b>spectrophotometer</b> of the time.|$|E
5|$|From 1941 until 1976, {{when it was}} discontinued, the Model DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> {{was built}} upon what was {{essentially}} the same design. It was a single beam instrument.|$|E
5|$|The DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> {{was also}} an {{important}} tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin.|$|E
50|$|Absorption <b>spectrophotometers</b> often {{contain a}} {{monochromator}} to supply {{light to the}} sample. Some absorption <b>spectrophotometers</b> have automatic spectral analysis capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Methods {{have also}} been invented to measure and {{compensate}} for stray light in <b>spectrophotometers.</b> ASTM standard E387 describes methods of estimating stray light in <b>spectrophotometers.</b> The terms they use for this are stray radiant power (SRP) and stray radiant power ratio (SRPR).|$|R
50|$|Spectrophotometry uses photometers, {{known as}} <b>spectrophotometers,</b> that can measure a light beam's {{intensity}} {{as a function}} of its color (wavelength). Important features of <b>spectrophotometers</b> are spectral bandwidth (the range of colors it can transmit through the test sample), the percentage of sample-transmission, the logarithmic range of sample-absorption, and sometimes a percentage of reflectance measurement.|$|R
5|$|For the Beckman company, the DU was one {{of three}} {{foundational}} inventions - the pH meter, the DU <b>spectrophotometer,</b> and the helipot potentiometer - that established the company on a secure financial basis and enabled it to expand.|$|E
5|$|Gemological {{laboratories}} {{make use}} of <b>spectrophotometer</b> machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-enhanced diamonds. The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled with liquid nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally discernible.|$|E
5|$|The DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> or Beckman DU, {{introduced}} in 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of <b>spectrophotometer</b> enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E

40|$|In {{the textile}} industries, quality {{control is a}} very {{important}} procedure to determine whether the finished goods are pass or fail. In this procedure, colour quality {{is one of the most}} important parameters in evaluating the quality of the finished goods. In our previous study, we found that the many different factors will affect the accurate colour measurement. For instance, the repeatability and reproducibility of the <b>spectrophotometers,</b> the measurement taking by different <b>spectrophotometers,</b> the inter-instrument agreement among the <b>spectrophotometers,</b> etc. In view of these factors, a comprehensive study (include the factors mention above) is conducted.

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a <b>spectrophotometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Small {{strips of}} PMMA {{are used as}} {{dosimeter}} devices during the Gamma Irradiation process. The optical properties of PMMA change as the gamma dose increases, and can be measured with a <b>spectrophotometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The enzymatic method {{allows for}} a {{quantitative}} measurement of both malic and lactic acids, but requires the expense of reagent kits and a <b>spectrophotometer</b> that can measure absorbance values at 334, 340, or 365 nm.|$|E

In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} by o-phthaldialdehyde assay (NOPA) {{is used to}} measured available primary {{amino acids}} in grape juice using a <b>spectrophotometer</b> that can measure at 335nm wavelengths. Since the assay only measures primary amino acids, the results produces won't include proline or ammonia concentrations. Proline can be separately measured with an assay that uses ninhydrin to react with the amino acid {{in the presence of}} formic acid, yielding a compound that can be absorbed at 517nm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of <b>spectrophotometer,</b> which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E

25|$|In 1949 Djerassi became {{associate}} {{director of research at}} Syntex in Mexico City and remained there through 1951. He has said that one factor influencing him to choose Syntex was that they had a DU <b>spectrophotometer.</b> He worked on a new synthesis of cortisone based on diosgenin, a steroid sapogenin derived from a Mexican wild yam. His team later synthesized norethisterone (norethindrone), the first highly active progestin analogue that was effective when taken by mouth. This became part of one of the first successful combined oral contraceptive pills, known colloquially as the birth-control pill, or simply, the Pill. From 1952–1959 he was professor of chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|The Spectronic 20 was {{replaced}} by the Spectronic 200 in the Thermo Scientific <b>spectrophotometer</b> product line in 2011. The Spectronic 200 utilizes an array detector and digital control of the measured wavelength, while retaining the characteristic λ knob of the Spec 20 for setting the wavelength. In addition to replicating the user modes of the Spec 20D+ (which it can emulate on a color LCD screen) the Spec 200 accommodates both test-tubes and square cuvettes without needing to install an adapter. Software modes described in the Spectronic 200's specifications include scanning, four wavelength simultaneous measurement, and quantitative analysis with up to four standards, in contrast to the SPEC 20D+ which offered only single point calibration.|$|E
500|$|The 1954 DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> differs in that {{it claims}} to be useful from 200 to 1000 millimicrons, [...] and does not mention the {{ultraviolet}} phototube. The wavelength selector, however, still ranged from 200 to 2000 millimicrons. and an [...] "Ultraviolet accessory set" [...] was available. This shift away from using the DU for infrared measurement is understandable, since by 1954 Beckman Instruments was marketing a separate infrared <b>spectrophotometer.</b> Beckman developed the IR-1 infrared <b>spectrophotometer</b> during World War II, and redesigned it as the IR-4 between 1953 and 1956.|$|E

500|$|The last DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> was {{produced}} on July 6, 1976. By the 1980s, computers were being incorporated into scientific instruments such as Bausch & Lomb's Spectronic 2000 UV-Vis <b>spectrophotometer,</b> to improve data acquisition and provide instrument control. [...] Specialized spectrophotometers designed for specific tasks now {{tend to be}} used rather than general [...] "all-purpose machines" [...] like the DU.|$|E
500|$|Development of the <b>spectrophotometer</b> had direct {{relevance}} to World War II and the American war effort. The role of vitamins in health was of significant concern, as scientists wanted to identify Vitamin A-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous [...] methods of assessing Vitamin A levels involved feeding rats a food {{for several weeks}} and then performing a biopsy to estimate ingested Vitamin A levels. [...] In contrast, examining a food sample with a DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> yielded better results {{in a matter of}} minutes. The DU <b>spectrophotometer</b> could be used to study both vitamin A and its precursor carotenoids, and rapidly became the preferred method of spectrophotometric analysis.|$|E
500|$|The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to {{separate}} {{light from a}} lamp into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized [...] "fingerprint" [...] characteristic of a compound. [...] All modern UV-Vis <b>spectrophotometer</b> are built on the same basic principles as the DU <b>spectrophotometer.</b>|$|E
