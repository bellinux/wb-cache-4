5000|$|In physics, any {{electric}} charge {{comes with a}} sign, either positive or negative.

5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and {{only a small amount}} of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E

5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus {{in the same way that}} helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration {{and are able to}} regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes {{it much easier to}} strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Winter Olympics – officially {{known by}} the International Olympic Committee as the XIV Olympic Winter Games – were a winter multi-sport event held between 8 and 19 February 1984 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (currently Bosnia and Herzegovina). A total of 1,272 athletes, {{representing}} a record 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), competed in 39 events across 10 disciplines of 6 sports. The official program was the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the 1980 Winter Olympics, {{with the addition of}} a 20-kilometer event in women's cross-country skiing. Disabled skiing was featured for the first time as an Olympic demonstration sport.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Massachusetts was {{activated}} for a {{third time}} in response to this call. Men began to be mustered in on July 16, 1864 at Camp Meigs just outside Boston. Colonel George H. Peirson again commanded the regiment. The roster of officers was fundamentally the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the 9-months term of service as was that of the rank and file. Recruitment was rushed, new enlistments were given only most minimal training, and the regiment departed Boston on July 28, 1864 for Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The German graves {{were grouped}} {{according}} to military unit. Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone, {{but not necessarily}} the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> in other groupings. There {{were a number of}} organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E
5|$|The Rivington Street {{building}} was constructed as a Protestant church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church, which served the area's large German immigrant community. In November 1864 the {{building was}} sold to the Orthodox German-Jewish Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim ("Gates of the Heavens"), which had been founded in 1841. Though its Hebrew name was essentially the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> used by the First Roumanian-American congregation—Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim—which later purchased the building in 1902, the two congregations were unrelated.|$|E

5|$|The {{abundance}} of {{silver in the}} Earth's crust is 0.08parts per million, almost exactly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales. Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary period vulcanism.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> used in biology {{for the female}} sex: a circle with a small cross beneath.

5|$|The plumage of most seabirds is less {{colourful}} {{than that}} of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), {{but most of the}} colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Antarctic prions, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below).|$|E
