40|$|This work aims at {{discussing}} {{the possibilities of}} high resolution neutron tomography, in comparison to conventional cone beam X ray CT, {{based on the results}} on a set of polymeric foamed materials. The experiments have been carried out at the BER II V 7 CONRAD instrument and compared to the images obtained in a CT system based on a microfocus tube and a high resolution flat panel detector. This type of materials has not been previously examined with neutron imaging. The enhanced neutron attenuation relative to the X ray attenuation encouraged this investigation. Nevertheless the results point to a better spatial resolution of X rays in comparison with current neutron tomography resolution although pixel size was in the same order. Reasons behind these results point to a low signal to noise <b>S</b> <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> in neutron tomography due to the rather low neutron flux and the beam collimating L D ratio causing a reduction in the spatial resolution.

40|$|We perform a formal {{attribution}} {{study of}} upper- and lower-stratospheric ozone changes using observations together with simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. Historical model simulations {{were used to}} estimate the zonal-mean response patterns (fingerprints) to combined forcing by ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs), {{as well as to}} the individual forcing by each factor. Trends in the similarity between the searched-for fingerprints and homogenized observations of stratospheric ozone were compared to trends in pattern similarity between the fingerprints and the internally and naturally generated variability inferred from long control runs. This yields estimated signal-to-noise (<b>S</b> ∕ <b>N)</b> <b>ratios</b> for each of the three fingerprints (ODS, GHG, and ODS + GHG). In both the upper stratosphere (defined in this paper as 1 to 10  hPa) and lower stratosphere (40 to 100  hPa), the spatial fingerprints of the ODS + GHG and ODS-only patterns were consistently detectable not only during the era of maximum ozone depletion but also throughout the observational record (1984 – 2016). We also develop a fingerprint attribution method to account for forcings whose time evolutions are markedly nonlinear over the observational record. When the nonlinearity of the time evolution of the ODS and ODS + GHG signals is accounted for, we find that the <b>S</b> ∕ <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> obtained with the stratospheric ODS and ODS + GHG fingerprints are enhanced relative to standard linear trend analysis. Use of the nonlinear signal detection method also reduces the detection time – the estimate of the date at which ODS and GHG impacts on ozone can be formally identified. Furthermore, by explicitly considering nonlinear signal evolution, the complete observational record can be used in the <b>S</b> ∕ <b>N</b> analysis, without applying piecewise linear regression and introducing arbitrary break points. The GHG-driven fingerprint of ozone changes was not statistically identifiable in either the upper- or lower-stratospheric SWOOSH data, irrespective of the signal detection method used. In the WACCM simulations of future climate change, the GHG signal is statistically identifiable between 2020 and 2030. Our findings demonstrate the importance of continued stratospheric ozone monitoring to improve estimates of the contributions of ODS and GHG forcing to global changes in stratospheric ozone...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Functional trait {{differences}} and trait adjustment {{in response to}} influences of the biotic environment could reflect niche partitioning among species. In this study, we tested how variation in above-ground plant traits, chosen as indicators for light and nitrogen acquisition and use, differs among taxonomically closely related species (Poaceae) to assess their potential for niche segregation at increasing plant diversity. Methods: Traits of 12 grass species were measured in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) of varying species richness (from 1 to 60) and presence of particular functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall herbs and small herbs). Key Results: Grass species increased shoot and leaf length, investment into supporting tissue (stem mass fraction) and specific leaf area as well as reduced foliar d 13 C values with increasing species richness, indicating higher efforts for light acquisition. These species-richness effects could in part be explained by a higher probability of legume presence in more diverse communities. Leaf nitrogen concentrations increased and biomas <b>s</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> in shoots decreased when grasses grew with legumes, indicating an improved nitrogen nutrition. Foliar d 15 N values of grasses decreased when growing with legumes suggesting the use of depleted legume-derived N, while decreasing d 15 N values with increasing species richness indicated {{a shift in the}} uptake of different N sources. However, efforts to optimize light and nitrogen acquisition by plastic adjustment of traits in response to species richness and legume presence, varied significantly among grass species. It was possible to show further that trait adjustment of grass species increased niche segregation in more diverse plant communities but that complementarity through niche separation may differ between light and nutrient acquisition. Conclusions: The results suggest that even among closely related species such as grasses different strategies are used to cope with neighbours. This lack in redundancy in turn may facilitate complementary resource use and coexistence...|$|R

40|$|Stenamma is a cryptic “leaf-litter” ant genus {{that occurs}} in mesic forest {{habitats}} throughout the Holarctic region, Central America, and part of northwestern South America (Colombia and Ecuador). The genus {{was thought to be}} restricted primarily to the temperate zone, but recent collecting efforts have uncovered a large radiation of Neotropical forms, which rival the Holarctic species in terms of morphological and behavioral diversity. By inferring a broad-scale molecular phylogeny of Stenamma, Branstetter (2012) showed that all Neotropical species belong to a diverse Middle American clade (MAC), and that this clade is sister to an almost completely geographically separated Holarctic clade (HOC). Here, the Middle American clade of Stenamma is revised to recognize 40 species, of which 33 are described as new. Included in the revision are a key to species based on the worker caste, and for each species where possible, descriptions and images of workers and queens, images of males, information on geographic distribution, descriptions of intraspecific variation, and notes on natural history.

40|$|Many {{studies show}} that {{seagrass}} δ 15 <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> increase {{with the amount of}} urbanization in coastal watersheds. However, there is little information on the relationship between urbanization and seagrass δ 15 <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> on a global scale. We performed a meta-analysis on seagrass samples from 79 independent locations to test if seagrass δ 15 <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> correlate with patterns of population density and fertilizer use within a radius of 10 – 200 km around the sample locations. Our results show that seagrass δ 15 <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> are more influenced by intergeneric and latitudinal differences than the degree of urbanization or the amount of fertilizer used in nearby watersheds. The positive correlation between seagrass δ 15 <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> and latitude hints at an underlying pattern in discrimination or a latitudinal gradient in the 15 N isotopic signature of nitrogen assimilated by the plants. The actual mechanisms responsible for the correlation between δ 15 N and latitude remain unknown...|$|R

40|$|With {{the study}} and {{technical}} development introduced here, we combine analogue sandbox simulation techniques with seismic physical modelling of sandbox models. For that purpose, we designed and developed a new mini-seismic facility for laboratory use, comprising a seismic tank, a PC-driven control unit, a positioning system, and piezoelectric transducers used {{here for the first}} time in an array mode. To assess the possibilities and limits of seismic imaging of small-scale structures in sandbox models, different geometry setups were tested in the first 2 -D experiments that also tested the proper functioning of the device and studied the seismo-elastic properties of the granular media used. Simple two-layer models of different materials and layer thicknesses as well as a more complex model comprising channels and shear zones were tested using different acquisition geometries and signal properties. We suggest using well sorted and well rounded grains with little surface roughness (glass beads). Source receiver-offsets less than 14 cm for imaging structures as small as 2. 0 – 1. 5 mm size have proven feasible. This is the best compromise between wide beam and high energy output, and is applicable with a consistent waveform. Resolution of the interfaces of layers of granular materials depends on the interface preparation rather than on the material itself. Flat grading of interfaces and powder coverage yields the clearest interface reflections. Finally, sandbox seismic sections provide images of high quality showing constant thickness layers as well as predefined channel structures and indications of the fault traces from shear zones. Since these were artificially introduced in our test models, they can be regarded as zones of disturbance rather than tectonic shear zones characterized by decompaction. The multiple-offset surveying introduced here, improves the quality with respect to <b>S</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> and source signature even more; the maximum depth penetration in glass-bead layers thereby amounts to 5 cm. Thus, the presented mini-seismic device is already able to resolve structures within simple models of saturated porous media, so that multiple-offset seismic imaging of shallow sandbox models, that are structurally evolving, is generally feasible...|$|R
