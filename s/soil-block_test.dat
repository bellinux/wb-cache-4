Five copper-based chemicals or zinc borate were blended into the aspen furnish at three retention levels. Tebuconazole or 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -N-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one (DCOI) were added as cobiocides to selected copper-based treatments. Panels were inoculated with four common molds {{and subjected to}} high temperature and humidity for 8 wk according to AWPA Standard E 24. Most panels experienced extensive mold growth, but panels treated with DCOI had marked resistance to attack as did combinations of copper-based preservatives and DCOI. Panels were also assessed for decay resistance in a laboratory <b>soil-block</b> <b>test</b> against the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum or the white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor, according to AWPA Standard E 10. All preservatives reduced weight losses caused by G. trabeum or T. versicolor below 10 %, except for micronized copper hydroxide or DCOI alone. The four other copper-based preservatives performed well independently and {{with the addition of}} DCOI or tebuconazole. The results suggest that incorporating combinations of copper-based preservative systems with organic cobiocides improved decay and mold resistance of aspen-oriented strandboard...|$|E
40|$|The decay {{resistance}} of fully bio-derived wood plastic composites, WPCs, was tested in both laboratory and field tests. The laboratory tests were performed according to modified versions of AWPA E 10 (<b>soil-block</b> <b>test)</b> and ENV 807 (tests in three un-sterile soils) {{and the field}} tests according to EN 252 (stakes in ground) and EN 275 (resistance to marine borers). The WPC materials for laboratory tests were injection molded test specimens with 50 % modified wood particles and 50 % cellulose ester (CAP) or poly-lactic acid (PLA) content. The field test specimens were taken from larger extruded decking board profiles with 60 % wood content and 40 % CAP. 60 / 40 -mix (wt/wt) for CAP corresponds to the same volumetric composition as 70 / 30 -mix (wt/wt) with polypropylene as matrix that was presented in Part 1 and 2. In all laboratory tests the control WPCs performed {{much better than the}} pine sapwood control blocks. The WPCs from modified wood performed better than the control WPC and WPCs from acetylated wood performed best with no detectable decay whatsoever. In the field stake test, the WPC from unmodified wood were slightly decayed whereas the WPCs from modified wood were sound. In the marine field test the WPC from unmodified wood were severely attacked by shipworm (Teredo navalis), whereas the WPCs from modified wood were sound...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Over-the-counter (OTC) wood {{preservatives}} can provide wood {{with both a}} moisture barrier and fungicidal protection against biodeterioration, yet there is little comparative data {{on the performance of}} these preservatives. In this study, the potential of various low-toxicity, OTC preservatives was evaluated on five western wood species, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii),lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The active ingredients tested were copper- 8 -quinolinolate, copper naphthenate, zinc naphthenate, 3 -Iodo 2 -propynylbutlycarbamate (IPBC), Bis (tri-n-butyltin) oxide (TBTO), TBTO, TBTO, and TBTO trichloromethylthio-phthalimide (Folpet). Small blocks and stakes of each species were dipped for 3 minutes in one of twelve OTC preservatives to simulate homeowner application. To examine the efficacy of these preservatives, treated blocks were subjected to a modified American Society of Testing and Materials Standards (ASTM) D 2017 - 81 <b>soil-block</b> <b>test</b> to evaluate above ground decay resistance as measured by wood weight loss following exposure to Postia placenta (Fr.) Cooke or Trametes versicolor (L:Fr.) Pilat, a brown and white rot fungus, respectively. Test stakes were placed in soil-beds maintained in an environmentally controlled greenhouse. The stakes were evaluated for the degree of decay at 3 month intervals for the first year, followed by 18 and 24 month ratings. Preservative treatments improved performance of most species except lodgepole pine; improvements were most noticeable in soil-bed trials with redwood and western redcedar. The results suggest that topical application of commercially available preservatives has merit for enhancing the performance of naturally durable woods in soil contact, but their value for less durable woods is questionable. Wood used above-ground will benefit most from such topical treatments, however, for best performance a yearly reapplication might be necessary for the less durable wood species...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} research {{on the effects of}} fungal decay on the mechanical properties of wood-plastic composites (WPC), results were inconclusive due to the influence of moisture absorption. This study was conducted to clarify the contributions of moisture and wood decay fungi to WPC damage. Changes in flexural strength (MOR), modulus (MOE), and weight of two extruded wood-polyethylene composite (WPC) formulations, yellow-poplar sapwood and redwood heartwood, were compared following 3 months of incubation with wood decay fungi. All materials were evaluated using modified agar-block tests in which the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor and the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum were employed as test fungi. In addition, <b>soil-block</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with yellow-poplar, one WPC formulation, and T. versicolor as test fungus only. It was determined that stiffness of WPC was affected more severely by moisture absorption than by fungal colonization. Strength of WPC was not affected by decay fungi but significantly (p 0. 0001) reduced by moisture absorption for a formulation containing 70 % wood filler. Calculation of weight loss in WPC was based on the wood fraction only. Modified agar-block and <b>soil-block</b> <b>tests</b> were equally suited for determining weight loss in WPC, but agar-block tests could be completed in a shorter time span. Weight loss of a formulation with 70 % wood filler and incubated with T. versicolor was twice as high as that of redwood in a modified agar-block test (6 % versus 3 %); however, only 1 % weight loss was obtained when the formulation contained 49 % wood filler. These results indicate that WPC can be designed to provide high fungal durability by controlling the material composition of the formulation. Weight loss is a more sensitive indicator of fungal decay than strength and stiffness measurements in WPC as well as in redwood...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioassay}} with Aspergillus niger is {{a simple}} way of determining the presence and amount of pentachlorophenol or tributyltin oxide in wood, {{but it does not}} appear useful for measuring strongly fixed chemicals such as chromated copper arsenate, borate, and fluoride. Its effectiveness in detecting other preservatives has not been reported. Accordingly, the bioassay was evaluated for its ability to detect various concentrations of 15 preservatives introduced into blocks of ponderosa pine. These results were compared with those from modified <b>soil-block</b> <b>tests</b> involving the same chemicals. Several of the formulations-three quaternary ammonium compounds, copper naphthenate, and Folpet imparted some decay resistance to the blocks but were not detectable with the bioassay. The remaining chemicals were all detectable, although sensitivities varied. These results suggest that the Aspergillus bioassay can be useful for detecting many wood preservatives...|$|R
40|$|Particleboard {{and medium}} density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) panels were produced using stone pine (Pinus pinea) cones, which were mixed with either wood particles or fibers from pine and beech wood at various ratios. Specimens from the panels were subjected to AWPA E 10 - 06 <b>soil-block</b> <b>tests</b> using two brown-rot fungi, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta and two white rot fungi, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus for 12 weeks. Specimens were also subjected to subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus, according to the JIS K 1571 standard test method for 3 weeks. Pinecone material in the furnish had no considerable effect on the decay resistance of particleboard and MDF specimens subjected to the brown-rot fungi; however, mass losses in the specimens exposed to the white-rot fungi were gradually decreased as the pinecone ratio in the furnish increased. No increased resistance was observed in the specimens exposed to the termites. In some cases, the specimens containing pinecone furnish had greater mass losses compared to the control specimens...|$|R

Boron preservatives have several advantages for application as wood preservatives including a broad spectrum of activity against insects and fungi, low mammalian toxicity, low volatility, and cost effectiveness. In addition, they are colorless, odorless and non-corrosive and nonflammable with favorable effects on wood's fire resistance. Boron treatment of wood provides excellent protection for aidoveground uses. However, boron treatment by itself has not been found to give adequate protection when wood is used in ground contact because of its leaching problem. This research examined the potential for decreasing the leachability of boron preservatives using water repellents. Southern pine (Pinus spp.) test samples were impregnated with several types and at different concentrations of borax/boric acid and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) mixture. Leachability performance of these treating solutions was determined. It was found that wood samples treated with boric acid or borax and then treated with PEG- 400 or PEG- 600 by double treatment method showed a significant increase in their water repellency and resistance to boron leaching. Protection performance of these treating solutions on native wood was also determined by soil-block and agar-block test methods. Weight loss by Lentinus lepideus and Poria monticola fungi and toxic threshold retention point for each treatment solution and biological test method were determined. The type of soil effect on the <b>soil-block</b> <b>test</b> was determined. It was found that it {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to choose soils only on the basis of waterholding capacity, pH, and weight as indicated by the ASTM standards. The results found in this research will serve their purpose as far as they are made use of in the wood preservation industry...|$|E
40|$|Serpula lacrymans, the dry rot fungus, is {{considered}} the most economically important wood decay fungus in certain temperate regions of the world, namely northern Europe, Japan, and Australia. Previously, copper-based wood preservatives were commonly used for pressure treatment of wood for building construction, but some decay fungi {{are known to be}} copper tolerant. In this study, <b>soil-block</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken to clarify the effect of copper, copper citrate, and alkaline copper quaternary-type D (ACQ-D) on the decay capabilities of S. lacrymans compared with an alternative wood preservative not containing copper. Twelve isolates of the dry rot fungus S. lacrymans and four other brown-rot species were evaluated for weight loss on wood treated with 1. 2 % copper citrate, 0. 5 % ACQ-D, and 0. 5 % naphthaloylhydroxylamine (NHA). Eleven out of 12 isolatcs of S. lacrymans were shown to be tolerant towards copper citrate. The ACQ-D and NHA preservatives, on the other hand, were both effective against the dry rot isolates...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Wood {{degrading}} {{ability and}} tolerance to wood-preserving chemicals of several fungi isolated from Douglas-fir utility poles were {{investigated by the}} agar-stick and soil-block methods. Birch (Betula. sp.) wood sticks and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) wood blocks were used. The <b>soil-block</b> and agar-stick <b>tests</b> provided identical weight loss rankings of the eight fungi from Douglas-fir poles. Breaking radius {{appeared to be a}} more sensitive and rapid indicator of decay than was weight loss and provided a reasonable basis for detecting decay fungi. Decay caused by the brown-rot fungi, Poria carbonica and Poria monticola was more severe with increase in incubation time expressed either as strength reduction or weight reduction. The white-rot fungus, Schizophyllum commune caused relatively little weight loss and gave erractic results. Except for Phialophora fastigiata., the fungi-imperfecti caused relatively little weight loss but a relatively large change in breaking radius after twelve weeks. In the preservative tolerance test, the brown-rot fungi were highly resistant to ammoniacal copper arsenite and moderately tolerant to creosote and pentachlorophenol. The white-rot fungus was susceptible to all preservatives except creosote. The fungi-imperfecti, Hyalodendron lignicola and Phialophora fastigiata were highly tolerant to all preservatives. In a study of classifying hymenomycetes isolated from Douglasfir utility poles into brown-and white-rot fungi by the oxidase test method, brown-rots were more prevalent than white-rot fungi. The intensity of the oxidative reaction and the time required showed considerable variation among the white-rot fungi...|$|R
