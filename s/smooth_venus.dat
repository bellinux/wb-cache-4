40|$|Abstract: Background: Analysis of {{bivalves}} for microbial bacteria is a {{tool for}} sanitary control. Methodology: 104 samples of bivalves made up of <b>smooth</b> <b>Venus</b> (Callista chione) and red cockles (Acanthocardia tuberculatum) were analysed for Escherichia coli by using MPN technique and for Salmonella by method ISO 6579 and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, analysed biochemically and by multiplex PCR. Results and Conclusions: Seasonal variation of faecal contamination was observed between wet and dry periods in three locations. Prevalence of Salmonella was 8. 6 % and onto 47 strains isolated, three serotypes groups were identified as: S. Kentucky, S. Newport and S. Glostrup. Regarding Vibrio parahaemolyticus, prevalence was 8. 6 % with 24 isolates identified and confirmed by multiplex PCR as tdh and trh negatives...|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{mortality}} of the <b>smooth</b> <b>venus</b> clam (Callista chione) was encountered when conditioning these clams in a hatchery system. A histopathological {{analysis was performed}} to establish the causes of this mortality episode. Our results showed an increase in rickettsia-like bacteria infection intensity between the individuals collected {{at the start of}} the conditioning in the hatchery and those collected during the mortality episode. Husbandry stress most likely increased disease susceptibility and progression in these clams. Rickettsia-like colonies were observed in large numbers in the gills of all individuals examined. Nematopsis sp. spores and rod-shaped basophilic bacteria could also been seen in some of the individuals examined. Microbiological analysis of clam tissue did not reveal the presence of any potentially pathogenic bacteria and all the clams were shown to be free of Perkinsus sp. parasites. The conditioning protocol was adapted from those used for other venerid clams due to the lack of data on this species. These findings highlight the need to perform further studies to evaluate the optimal parameters for C. chione broodstock conditioning...|$|E
40|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>venus</b> clam Callista chione is {{a commercially}} {{exploited}} bivalve species that {{lives on the}} sandy bottom of the Italian coast of the Northern Adriatic Sea. Currently, no information {{is available in the}} literature about the haemocytes of this bivalve species. In this study, we performed a morpho-functional characterisation of the haemocytes of C. chione. In freshly collected haemocytes, the total haemocyte count (THC) (measured by a Coulter Counter) varied markedly among individuals, and the mean number of haemocytes was 1. 2 (x 106) cells mL haemolymph- 1. The mean values for the haemocyte diameter and volume were 4. 2 µm and 77. 8 fL, respectively. In some cases, higher THC values were related to a smaller haemocyte size, but no correlation was detected between the THC and haemocyte diameter or between THC and cell volume. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between cell diameter and volume. Two haemocyte types were distinguished by light microscopy: granulocytes (76 %), with evident cytoplasmic granules, and hyalinocytes (24 %), with a few or no granules. After adhesion to slides and fixation, the cell diameter was approximately 10 µm for granulocytes and 7 µm for hyalinocytes. The granules of the granulocytes were stained in vivo with Neutral Red, indicating that they were lysosomes. The granulocytes and hyalinocytes were further distinguished as basophils and acidophils. Both the granulocytes and the hyalinocytes were able to phagocytise yeast cells. Of 2643 cells that were counted, 2007 (76 %) showed phagocytic activity. The granulocytes and hyalinocytes were both positive for some hydrolytic enzymes, whereas they were not positive for peroxidase or phenoloxidase. The two types of haemocytes also produced superoxide anion. Overall, this preliminary study indicates that both the granulocytes and hyalinocytes of C. chione are immune effector cells...|$|E
