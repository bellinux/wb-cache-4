40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether social differences in health persist or widen during early adulthood. METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up of the 1958 British birth cohort was investigated, using social class at birth and six health measures at ages 23 and 33. A slope of inequality was estimated to represent social differences in health. RESULTS: <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> in health were evident by age 23 : the prevalence of poor health increased with decreasing social position. This was observed for several but not all health indicators. <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> persisted to age 33. The slope of inequality was greatest for malaise (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 37 for men, 3. 21 for women) and obesity (OR = 4. 80 for men and 2. 84 for women), both at age 23, and for self-rated health in women at age 23 (OR = 2. 94) and age 33 (OR = 3. 22). Inequality increased significantly between ages 23 and 33 for limiting illness in men, and lessened, although not significantly, for malaise, overweight, and obesity; <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> remained constant for self-rated health, respiratory symptoms, and asthma or wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> in health evident in this sample by age 23 persisted to age 33.

Using data from Australia's National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004 - 2006, we examined absolute and relative income inequalities for DMFT and its separate components (DT, MT, FT) using adjusted proportions, means, and health disparity indices [Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) ]. Approximately 90 % of Australian adults had experienced caries, with prevalence ranging from 89. 7 % {{in the highest}} to 96. 6 % in the lowest income group. <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> in caries were evident across all components of DMFT, but particularly notable in Missing (SII = - 15. 5, RII = - 0. 3) and untreated Decay (SII = - 23. 7, RII = - 0. 9). Analysis of age- and gender-adjusted data indicated less variation in levels of disease experienced (DMFT) than in the health outcomes of its management (missing teeth).

40|$|We {{sought to}} examine the joint and {{independent}} contributions of working conditions and health-related behaviours in explaining <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in self-rated health (SRH). Nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Swiss Health Survey of 2007 were used for this study. Bi- and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out on a sample of 6950 adult employees of working age. We examined a comprehensive set of five health behaviours and lifestyle factors as well as twelve physical and psychosocial work factors as potential mediators {{of the relationship between}} social status and SRH. Analyses were stratified by sex and performed using two measures of social status, educational level and occupational position. Strong <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> were found for SRH, but mainly in men whereas in women the associations were either not linear (educational level) or not statistically significant (occupational position). <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> were also found for most lifestyle and all physical and psychosocial work factors studied. These three groups of factors equally contributed to and largely accounted for the <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in SRH although not all of the individual factors turned out to be independent and significant risk factors for poor SRH. Such risk factors included physical inactivity and obesity, poor posture and no or low social support at work (both sexes), heavy smoking (men) and underweight, overweight, uniform arm or hand movements at work, monotonous work and job insecurity (women). In conclusion, social inequalities (or more precisely educational and occupational status differences) in SRH were more pronounced in men and can be attributed for the most part to a sedentary lifestyle and to a physically demanding and socially unsupportive and insecure work environment. Apart from this main finding and overall pattern, sex-specific risk profiles were observed with regard to SRH and need to be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} importance of the health selection hypothesis for explaining <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in health. Although studies have argued that it may not be an important explanation of <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in health, previous analyses have not estimated, simultaneously, the relative effect of health on changes in social position and of social position on changes in health (social causation). Cross-lagged longitudinal analyses using structural equation models enable the estimation of the relative size of these pathways which would be useful in determining the relative importance of the health selection hypothesis over the social causation hypothesis. Data from four phases of the Whitehall II study (initially consisting of 10, 308 men and women aged 35 - 55 in the British civil service) were collected over a 10 year period. There was no evidence for an effect of mental (GHQ- 30 and SF 36) or physical health (SF- 36) on changes in employment grade. When financial deprivation was used as a measure of social position, there was a significant effect of mental health on changes in social position among men although this health selection effect was over {{two and a half times}} smaller than the effect of social position on changes in health.

Methods: In 1992, a cross-sectional mail questionnaire was sent to all 50 -year-old persons in two counties in Sweden, Örebro and Östergotland, and altogether there were 8888 persons. In 1997, the same population was sent a new questionnaire. The cohort, comprising the same respondents from 1992 and 1997, was of 5363 persons. An index of perceived oral health was constructed out of three questionnaire variables: satisfaction with teeth, chewing ability and the number of remaining teeth. This index value was set as a dependent variable in a regression model. Reports of toothache were investigated in a separate logistic regression model. Results: There were obvious <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in the perceived oral health index both in 1992 and in 1997. Marital status, foreign birth, education and occupation were all substantially related to the perceived oral health. The change in perceived oral health was analyzed.

40|$|Background We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} whether socioeconomic gradients in smoking among {{men and women}} increase with age {{as a result of}} differential uptake, quitting and smoking persistence over time. Methods A prospective British birth cohort (all births 3 – 9 March 1958) was followed to 41 years. Analyses of smoking at 41 years by socioeconomic position of origin include 10 521 participants and for socioeconomic position at 23 years n 9240. Results By 41 years half of the cohort had smoked regularly (1 cigarette/day). Smoking prevalence peaked at 23 years (40 per cent) and subsequently declined; quitting increased between 23 years (10 per cent) and 41 years (29 per cent). Individuals from manual backgrounds were more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than those from non-manual groups, and these differences increased over the two decades during which the cohort was followed up. For social position of origin, the odds ratio for current smoking at 23 years among women was 1. 28 (95 per cent confidence inter-val (CI) 1. 21, 1. 35), i. e. a 28 per cent greater risk of smoking per unit increment on a four-point scale from professional/ managerial to unskilled manual. The odds ratio increased to 1. 45 (95 per cent CI 1. 36, 1. 56) at 41 years, trend over time p 0. 01.

The intent was to address two obstacles that confront research in the United States regarding <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in women's health: how women's social class should be measured, {{and the absence of}} socioeconomic data in most health records. STUDY DESIGN [...] The study was a retrospective cohort analysis, using a community based random sample. Setting [...] Alameda County, California, 1987. SUBJECTS [...] 51 black and 50 white women, ages 20 to 80 years, identified by random digit dialling, were interviewed by telephone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Census data were linked to individual records via the respondents' addresses. Using number of full term pregnancies as an example, multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that individual class was not significantly associated with this outcome, whereas household class was: women from non-working-class households had 0. 8 fewer such pregnancies than women from working class households (95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 1. 4, - 0. 1). The block group measure functioned most like the household class measure (beta = - 0. 7, 95 % CI = - 1. 4, 0. 1), while the census tract measure was non-significant (beta = - 0. 4, 95 % CI = - 1. 2, 0. 4). Similar results were obtained for the outcomes: age at first full term pregnancy, percent of early terminated pregnancies, and yearly income.

The reason for this, however, is not clear, and {{the purpose of the present}} study was to explore possible mediating factors between social status and mental health. Methods The study has a cross-sectional design, and was based on a nationwide survey in Oslo, Norway, counting 12 310 people in the age of 30 – 60 years. Immigrants from non-western countries were excluded. Socio-demographic data were gathered from existing registers, whereas data on health, psychosocial variables and life style were gathered by structured interview. As indicator of mental health was used a 10 -items version of Hopkins Symptom Checklist, measuring psychological distress. Measures of general self-efficacy and sense of powerlessness was used as indicators of control of own life situation. Results A strong <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in mental health was found, the prevalence of psychological distress increasing by decreasing social status. Psychosocial factors, including self-efficacy, sense of powerlessness, control of work, social support and negative life events, in particular economic problems, as well as life style factors (physical exercise, BMI, smoking) and somatic health, likewise showed a <b>social</b> <b>gradient,</b> all risk factors increasing by decreasing social status. When adjusting for the risk factors in multivariate statistical analyses, the <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in mental health was eliminated. Low self-efficacy and sense of powerlessness emerged as important explanatory factors, alongside with poor social support, economic problems, smoking and somatic disorder. Conclusion Both individual characteristics, supposedly linked to the personality, like low self-efficacy, and factors related to the actual life situation, like economic problems and a feeling of powerlessness, contribute to the <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in mental health, and both aspects should be addressed in preventive work. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Social inequalities {{in health}} persist even in egalitarian {{countries}} such as Norway. There is a <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> found for many cancers, with higher incidence and mortality for lower socioeconomic groups. The <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> can be positive, with higher incidence for higher socioeconomic groups. Colorectal cancer {{is one of the}} most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide, with varying results in reference to a <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in incidence and mortality. Objective: To investigate colorectal cancer incidence associated with socioeconomic status in a Norwegian population. Method: Data from NOWAC (The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study) is used in a prospective cohort study, with data collected from 1991 until 2012. 83 524 women are included. The Cox Proportional Hazards model is applied to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for risk of colorectal cancers by level of education. The analyses are performed for colon and rectal cancer separately, with level of education as a categorical variable, adjusted for age. The final model for colon cancer is also adjusted for smoking, alcohol consumption and income, and stratified for subcohorts. Incidence rates by level of education are calculated. Results: A negative <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> is found for incidence of colon cancer. HR for those with 10 - 12 years of education compared to 7 - 9 years of education is 0, 98 (CI 0, 81 - 1, 17), HR for 13 - 16 years is 0, 73 (CI 0, 59 - 0, 91) and HR for 17 years or more is 0, 61 (CI 0, 44 - 0, 83). Smoking and alcohol are confounding factors and added into the model. Smoking reduces the negative <b>social</b> <b>gradient,</b> whilst adding alcohol increases it. Furthermore income is added and stratification for subcohorts done, resulting in a HR for 10 - 12 years of education at 1, 07 (CI 0, 88 - 1, 3) compared to 7 - 9 years of education, HR for 13 - 16 years is 0, 78 (CI 0, 61 - 0, 99) and HR for 17 years or more is 0, 66 (CI 0, 47 - 0, 92). Incidence rate for colon cancer is 65, 28 per 100 000 person years. For each level of education the incidence rates per 100 000 person years are: 7 - 9 years: 93, 36, 10 - 12 years: 68, 86, 13 - 16 years: 46, 95 and 17 years or more: 37, 67. No significant <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> is found for incidence of rectal cancer. HR for 10 - 12 years of education is 0, 99 (CI 0, 76 - 1, 23), HR for 13 - 16 years is 1, 01 (CI 0, 74 - 1, 37) and HR for 17 years or more of education is 0, 95 (CI 0, 64 - 1, 41) compared to 7 - 9 years of education. Incidence rate for rectal cancer is 30, 35 per 100 000 person years. For each level of education the incidence rates per 100 000 person years are: 7 - 9 years: 36, 03, 10 - 12 years: 29, 3, 13 - 16 years: 28, 31 and 17 years or more: 26, 14. Conclusion: There is a negative <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> associated with incidence of colon cancer, which remains after adding behavioural risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. No <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> is found for incidence of rectal cancer. The negative <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> for colon cancer incidence cannot be fully explained by known behavioural risk factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is the {{longitudinal}} analysis of health and healthcare data. Chapter 2 uses the first wave of, and latest longitudinal follow-up to, the Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS) to investigate the <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in cancer, considering both lifetime incidence and duration models of time-to-cancer [...] healthy time lived before developing cancer. Contrary to previous claims regarding the relationship between circumstances {{and the development of}} cancer, such as Deaton (2002) and Wilkinson (2010), a <b>social</b> <b>gradient</b> in time-to-cancer is observed, with those in the lowest two social classes developing cancer approximately 15...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether and}} how socio-economic status is associated with children’s behavioural development in today’s children. Using a large cohort of English children born in the early 1990 s we find significant social inequalities in several dimensions of child behaviour at age 7. We examine whether these inequalities are associated with characteristics of the child’s early home environment and parental behaviours. These include the material quality of the child’s home, maternal mental health, parental conflict and child diet. Most of these factors are socially graded and so could potentially account for the gradient in behaviours, but none singly account for {{a large part of}} the gradient in behavioural outcomes. However, taken together, these differences in the home environment can explain up to half the <b>social</b> <b>gradients</b> in child behaviours...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of obesity {{has been developing}} in virtually all OECD countries over the last 30 years. Existing evidence provides a strong suggestion that such an epidemic has affected certain social groups more than others. In particular, a better education appears {{to be associated with}} a lower likelihood of obesity, especially among women. This paper sheds light on the nature and the strength of the correlation between education and obesity. Analyses of health survey data from Australia, Canada, England, and Korea were undertaken with the aim of exploring this relationship. <b>Social</b> <b>gradients</b> in obesity were assessed across the entire education spectrum, overall and in different population sub-groups. Furthermore, investigations testing for mediation effects and for the causal nature of the links observed were undertaken to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between education and obesity. obesity, education, social disparities, mediation effect...|$|R
