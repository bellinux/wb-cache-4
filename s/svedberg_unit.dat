The two proteins comprise a significant amount of the total spore protein, are predominantly salt-soluble, and can be extracted by other solvents to a limited extent. The large 11. 3 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>unit</b> (S) globulin is composed of five polypeptides with molecular weights of 21, 000, 22, 000, 24, 000, 28, 000 and 30, 000. Each polypeptide has several isoelectric point (pI) variants between pH 5 and 7. The small 2. 2 S storage protein has a pI > 10. 5 and is composed of at least two major polypeptides of 6, 000 and 14, 000 Mr. The amino acid composition of both storage proteins reveals that the 11. 3 S protein is particularly rich in aspartic and glutamic acid, while the 2. 2 S protein has few acidic amino acids. During imbibition and germination the globulin fraction declines rapidly, with a corresponding degradation of individual polypeptides of each protein. Polyclonal antibodies against each of the two proteins were produced and used for immunolocalization to determine the site of storage protein deposition within the quiescent spore. The proteins were sequestered in protein bodies of 2 to 10 micrometers, that are morphologically similar to those found in the seeds of flowering plants.

The protein bodies also contained the three other abundant proteins present in L. angustifolius seeds: conglutins-α, -γ, and -δ. Pulse labeling experiments were carried out to determine the site of proteolytic processing of conglutin-α, a legumin-like 11 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>unit</b> storage protein.

Rate-zonal centrifugation of cotyledon extracts revealed that the 5 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>unit</b> (S) cytosolic form of MS was the only form present at 42 days postanthesis (DPA) when activity was first detectable. At later stages (48 DPA, 0 day, 26 hours, and 48 hours), both the 5 S and glyoxysomal 20 S forms were present, with the 20 S form becoming much more prevalent.

Comparisons of MS labeled in vivo and in vitro in wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed with poly(A) +RNA (from maturing and germinated seeds) revealed no detectable differences in subunit molecular weights. These results reinforced our other data indicating that MS was synthesized in the cytosol and acquired by glyoxysomes in both maturing and germinated cotton seeds without involvement of an intervening aggregate pool in the endoplasmic reticulum, or via processing of a cleavable precursor molecule.

40|$|Smaller {{very low}} density {{lipoprotein}} (VLDL) remnants interact more readily with tissues than do larger “intact” VLDL. This {{may be related}} to changes in the availability of VLDL apoproteins {{on the surface of the}} lipoproteins. To test this hypothesis VLDL were incubated at 37 °C with bovine milk lipase (LPL), and the abilities of LPL-treated VLDL preparations to compete with 125 I-low density lipoproteins (LDL) for interaction with cultured normal human fibroblasts were measured. At the same time, the immunologic activities of these preparations were also tested by double antibody radioimmunoassay. Triglyceride (TG) contents of VLDL fell by 30 - 90 % during incubation with LPL and, on zonal ultracentrifugation, VLDL of faster <b>Svedberg</b> <b>unit</b> of flotation (Sf 1. 063) rates (> 150) were gradually converted to smaller VLDL with lower Sf rates (21 - 60). LPL-treated VLDL competed two to five times more effectively with 125 I-LDL for binding to cellular receptors than did control VLDL. Control VLDL incubated with heat-inactivated LPL at 37 °C, or with active LPL at 4 °C had unaltered cell reactivities and TG contents compared with VLDL incubated without any enzyme. The direct uptake and degradation of LPL-treated VLDL was also assessed by using VLDL 125 I-labeled in apoprotein (Apo) B. LPL-treated VLDL- 125 I-ApoB were taken up and degraded by fibroblast at greater rates than were control VLDL- 125 I-ApoB. Thus, hydrolysis of VLDL lipids was accompanied by an increased ability of VLDL to interact with fibroblasts. The immunoreactivity of ApoB in the same VLDL preparations, expressed as the “apparent ApoB contents” of LPL-treated VLDL, increased by 10 - 50 % (P < 0. 02) in those assays that contained anti-LDL antisera, but the ApoB of control VLDL remained constant. However, assays that contained antisera directed against ApoB isolated from VLDL did not distinguish between LPL-treated and control VLDL. Thus, VLDL lipid hydrolysis was accompanied by changes in the immunoreactivity of VLDL-ApoB, which probably reflect changes in the disposition of ApoB on the surface of VLDL. The altered disposition of ApoB on VLDL “remnants” {{may be related to}} their enhanced interaction with cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{behavior of}} aqueous solutions of digitonin and of cattle rhodopsin in digitonin has been {{examined in the}} ultracentrifuge. In confirmation of earlier work, digitonin was found to sediment as a micelle (D- 1) with an s 20 of about 6. 35 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>units,</b> and containing at least 60 molecules. The rhodopsin solutions sediment as a stoichiometric complex of rhodopsin with digitonin (RD- 1) with an s 20 of about 9. 77 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>units.</b> The s 20 of the RD- 1 micelle is constant between pH 6. 3 and 9. 6, and {{in the presence of}} excess digitonin. RD- 1 travels as a single boundary also in the electrophoresis apparatus at pH 8. 5, and on filter paper at pH 8. 0. The molecular weight of the RD- 1 micelle lies between 260, 000 and 290, 000. Of this, only about 40, 000 gm. are due to rhodopsin; the rest is digitonin (180 to 200 moles). Comparison of the relative concentrations of RD- 1 and retinene in solutions of rhodopsin-digitonin shows that RD- 1 contains only one retinene equivalent. It can therefore contain only one molecule of rhodopsin with a molecular weight of about 40, 000. Cattle rhodopsin therefore contains only one chromophore consisting of a single molecule of retinene. It is likely that frog rhodopsin has a similar molecular weight and also contains only one chromophore per molecule. The molar extinction coefficient of rhodopsin is therefore identical with the extinction coefficient per mole of retinene (40, 600 cm. 2 per mole) and the E(1 per cent, 1 cm., 500 mµ) has a value of about 10. Rhodopsin constitutes about 14 per cent of the dry weight, and 3. 7 per cent of the wet weight of cattle outer limbs. This corresponds to about 4. 2 x 106 molecules of rhodopsin per outer limb. The rhodopsin content of frog outer limbs is considerably higher: about 35 per cent of the dry weight, and 10 per cent of the wet weight, corresponding to about 2. 1 x 109 molecules per outer limb. Thus the frog outer limb contains about five hundred times as much rhodopsin as the cattle outer limb. But the relative volumes of these structures are such that the ratio of concentrations is only about 2. 5 to 1 on a weight basis. Rhodopsin accounts for at least one-fifth of the total protein of the cattle outer limb; for the frog, this value must be higher.

Amino acid analyses demonstrate that the O. luteus RuBPCase large subunit is highly conserved and the small subunit much less so when compared with the chlorophytic plant peptides. The catalytic optima of pH and Mg 2 + have been determined as well as the response of enzyme catalysis to temperature. The requirements of NaHCO 3 and Mg 2 + for enzyme activation have also been analyzed. The Michaelis constants for the substrates of the carboxylation reaction (CO 2 and ribulose bisphosphate) were shown to be 45 and 48 micromolar, respectively. Competitive inhibition by oxygen of RuBPCase-catalyzed CO 2 fixation was also demonstrated. These data demonstrate that a high degree of RuBPCase conservation occurs among widely divergent photoautotrophs regardless of small subunit coding site...|$|R
40|$|Malate synthase (EC 4. 1. 3. 2), {{an enzyme}} {{unique to the}} glyoxylate cycle, was {{purified}} to homogeneity from cotyledons of 72 -hours, darkgrown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seedlings. Homogeneity of the enzyme was assessed by silver staining SDS-PAGE gels. Purification was accomplished by using a single buffer medium through six steps involving one ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on three columns (Sephacryl S- 300, DEAE Sephacel, Phenyl Sepharose). Large-scale preparation of glyoxysomes, a main step in all other published procedures, was not involved. The purified enzyme and that extracted from glyoxysomes {{appears to be a}} dodecamer with a native molecular weight of 750, 000 (sedimentation coefficient of > 20 <b>Svedberg</b> <b>units</b> [S] on sucrose gradients) composed of identical subunits (molecular weight approximately 63, 000). The monomer (5 S) occurs in the cytosol. Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits were judged to be monospecific for malate synthase by immunotitration, double immunodiffusion, and western blotting. Double immunodiffusion experiments revealed only partial immunological identity between the 5 S (cytosolic) and 20 S (glyoxysomal forms, although complete identity was observed between the 5 S form in immature and germinated seeds, and the 20 S form in immature and germinated seeds. Cross-reactivity of the cotton antimalate synthase serum was observed with extracts from five other oilseeds. Western blot analyses showed that malate synthase protein was not present in immature seeds prior to appearance of enzyme activity, but when present, subunit molecular weight was indistinguishable in immature, desiccated, and germinated seeds...|$|R
