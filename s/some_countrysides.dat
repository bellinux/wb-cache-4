Countryside zones are wilder areas of the world that have become infested with nightmares. <b>Some</b> <b>countryside</b> zones feature small Archon settlements with friendly NPCs, but these areas are not safe from monster attacks. Instance dungeons are special areas separated from the main world and can only be accessed through a gatekeeper.

30|$|Transport agencies, {{with their}} limited budgets, needs well {{substantiated}} support {{to be able}} to get the most out of their investments. For example, erecting wildlife fences effectively reduce the number of AVCs, but it is also extremely expensive, especially since fencing must be combined with fauna passages to ensure connectivity. The Swedish Transport Administration, who is responsible for all national roads in Sweden except for the municipal roads in cities and in the suburbs, currently lack a wildlife policy that can prioritize between different AVC countermeasures. In the road planning phase, a cost-benefit analysis is used to ensure that wildlife fences are erected when costs of AVCs are expected to be high. Recently, however, the Swedish Transport Administration has decided that there must be a possibility for wildlife animals to get across transport structures at least every fourth kilometre on <b>some</b> <b>countryside</b> roads (speed limit above 80  km/h, or equipped with wildlife fences, or with an average of at least 4000 vehicles per year) [61]. The distance is based on mean values of home-range areas/sizes (HR 0.5) for moose in Sweden, as has been suggested by Bissonette and Adair [62]. However, when considering countermeasures to enhance connectivity in the operation and maintenance of roads, it is considered possible to maximize the distance between crossings up to 6  km [63].|$|R
