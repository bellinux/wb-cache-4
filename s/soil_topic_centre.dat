The buildings considered, nearly always deprived of artistic value according to the set of rules in force, rise on the urban areas around the historical centre on which today the interest of the building market is concentrated, and with it a consequent, widespread, speculative interference, that doesn’t always reflect the original disposition of the architecture.

40|$|The purpose: Both {{academics}} and practitioners have demonstrated {{a keen interest}} in the topics of leadership style and employee performance within research and development (R&D) organisations. Much of the interest in these <b>topics</b> <b>centres</b> on claims that leadership style and local culture are linked to R&D performance. However, while the links between leadership and performance, leadership and culture, and work performance and employee satisfaction have been examined independently, few studies have investigated the association between all of these concepts. This study examines the relationship between leadership study and employee satisfaction in European R&D settings and provides empirical evidence that the leadership style is influenced by the national culture that is present. The paper presents a number of implications for theory and practice. Methodology: A quantitative study was carried out across a number of European R&D organisations, with the primary source of data obtained through the use of established surveys distributed to researchers and R&D leaders. Findings: Transformational leadership was found to be positively correlated with employe...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the world}} of work can give rise to new risk areas or they can change the way that {{occupational}} safety and health needs to be managed. This has implications for workplaces themselves and also for {{the occupational safety and health}} system. For this reason the 'changing world of work' has been a priority topic for the Agency. The European Week on Safety and Health at Work 2001 focused on accident prevention. This research information report reviews new trends in accident prevention due to the 'changing world of work' and needs for future research in this area. It is based on expert viewpoints and current scientific literature. The Agency's <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Research - Work and Health, a consortium of European research institutions, produced the report. The Dutch TNO Work and Employment coordinated the work.

50|$|COPERT is an MS Windows {{software}} program aiming at {{the calculation of}} air pollutant emissions from road transport. The technical development of COPERT is financed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), {{in the framework of}} the activities of the European <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. The COPERT methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU directive on national emission limits. The COPERT methodology is fully consistent with the Road Transport chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this working paper, {{prepared}} by the <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Research - Work and Health of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{is to look at}} the link between a good working environment and productivity. A better understanding of positive effects of a good working environment would support the implementation of effective health and safety policy at company level. It would complement the set of rules and regulations with a significant parameter that is directly linked to the intrinsic motivation of a company. This working paper focuses on the level of the individual company. The consequences of occupational safety and health hazards will encompass individual workers/victims as well as their families and social networks. Society as a whole has to deal with these negative outcomes of the production process. The information was collected in the form of literature, on the one hand, and case studies, on the other hand. This working paper demonstrates that health and safety measures have a positive impact not only on safety and health performance but also on company productivity. However, identifying and quantifying these effects is not always straightforward...|$|R
40|$|The EU Habitats Directive {{requires}} all {{member states}} to report every 6 years on {{the implementation of the}} Directive. The report covering the period 2000 &ndash; 2006 included for the first time an assessment of the conservation status of the habitats and species listed on annexes I, II, IV &amp; V of the Habitats Directive following an agreed format. Based on national reports submitted from member States the European <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Biological Diversity has prepared assessments for each biogeographical region at EU-level. The majority of the habitats of Annex I are not at favourable status although there is much variation both between countries and regions and between habitats. The results will be discussed at European level and at member state level with a case study of the German national report. At the same time a number of methodical problems became apparent both in Germany and at EU-level. Work is already under way to improve the next report for the period 2007 &ndash; 2012. The dimension of management needs, threats and pressures and the time scale for improvements of the conservation status are discussed. Habitats linked to agriculture appear to be particularly unfavourable...|$|R
40|$|Remote {{provision}} of supportive mechanisms for preventive health is a fast-growing area in eHealth. Web-based interventions {{have been suggested}} as {{an effective way to}} increase adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviours. This paper describes results obtained in the “Walk 2. 0 ” trial to promote physical activity through a self-managed walking programme, using a social networking website that provided an online collaborative environment. Engagement of participants with the website was assessed by monitoring usage ofthe individual social networking functions (e. g. status post). The results demonstrate that users generally preferred contributing non-interactive public posts of information concerned with their individual physical activity levels, and more occasionally communicating privately to friends. Further analysis of topics within posts was done by classifying word usage frequencies. Results indicated that the dominant topics are well aligned with the social environment within which physical activity takes place. <b>Topics</b> <b>centred</b> around four main areas: description of the activity, timing of the activity, affective response to the activity, and context within which the activity occurs. These findings suggest that strong levels of user awareness and communication occur in the social networking setting, indicative of beneficial self-image and self-actualisation effects...|$|R
