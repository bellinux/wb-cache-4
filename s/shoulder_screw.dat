5000|$|In {{good design}} practice, the {{threaded}} {{part of the}} screw should be small and only the smooth part should be {{in contact with the}} plates; {{in the case of a}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>screw,</b> the clearance between the screw and the hole is very small ( [...] a case of rigid bodies with negligible clearance).

60|$|There {{was a knock}} and a ring at the door, timid, as befitted a clergyman; and the servant-girl {{showed in}} Mr Evans. He was a thin and short young man, red faced, with a long nose and weak eyes, looking underfed and cold, keeping his <b>shoulders</b> <b>screwed</b> up in a {{perpetual}} shiver. He was an earnest, God-fearing man, spending much money in charities, and waging constant war against the encroachments of the Scarlet Woman.|$|R

50|$|Hawke's {{football}} career {{ended in}} 1966 when he dislocated his right <b>shoulder.</b> A <b>screw</b> was {{inserted in the}} point of the shoulder, which not only forced him to retire from football but also greatly affected his bowling. Nonetheless, he played home series against South Africa, Pakistan and India and toured South Africa in 1966-67 and England in 1968, where he played his final Test at Lord's. He finished his career after 27 Tests, 365 runs at 16.59, 91 wickets at 29.41 and a statement by his former Test captain, Richie Benaud, declaring Hawke as one of the finest medium-pace bowlers he had seen.|$|R
6000|$|They {{made their}} camp {{for two nights}} with these {{friendly}} people. They are as dull and stupid in most {{things as they are}} artful at fishing. But they are, beyond even the Munza-mulgars, mischievous mimics. Even the little ones would come mincing and peeping with wisps of moss and grass stuck on their faces for eyebrows and whiskers, their long tails cocked over their <b>shoulders,</b> their eyes <b>screwed</b> up, in imitation of the Men of the Mountains. Lank old Thimble laughed himself hoarse at these children. At night they beat little wood drums of different notes round their fires, making a sort of wearisome harmony. They also play at many sports--"Fish in the Ring," [...] "A tail, a tail, a tail!" [...] and [...] "Here sups Sullilulli." [...] But I will not describe them, for they are just such games as are played all the world over by Oomgar and Mulgar alike. They are all, however, young and old, hale and paralysed, incorrigible thieves and gluttons, and rarely comb themselves.|$|R
