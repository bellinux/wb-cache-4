This was repeated after <b>synoviorthesis</b> in the {{synovial fluid}} (SF) of 24 RA+, 4 RA-, and 10 OA patients. The following studies were undertaken: (a) {{the relationship between}} these components; (b) their correlation with the SF protein concentration and rheumatoid factor titre, when present. This analysis led us to the following conclusions. (1) Before <b>synoviorthesis</b> (a) The SF beta 1 e is significantly lower than beta 1 a in RA+. In OA, an inverse phenomenon is observed. (b) The concentration of beta 1 a and beta 1 e are proportional to the protein concentration in the SF of OA. A significant inverse relationship between beta 1 a, beta 1 e, and the titre of rheumatoid factor is found. (2) after <b>synoviorthesis</b> the same studies performed on knees at the time of one or more relapses shows that the same pathogenetic process is involved and that the immunological mechanism is little influenced by this treatment.

40|$|In {{this review}} the main {{stages in the}} history of {{intra-articular}} therapy of the rheumatic diseases are summarized. The first approach to such a local treatment has been likely performed in 1792 by the French physician Jean Gay, who injected in a swelling knee the “eau du Goulard” (Goulard’s water), namely a mixture based on lead compounds. In the XIX century iodine derivatives have been mainly applied as an intra-articular treatment. In the XX century, before the wide use of intra-articular corticosteroids, chiefly due to the Joseph Lee Hollander’s experiences, a variety of drugs has been employed, including cytostatics and sclerosing substances. A further important stage has been <b>synoviorthesis,</b> by using specific radionuclides, that would actually represent an anti-synovial treatment. In the last years a spread use of intra-articular hyaluronic acid, particularly in osteoarthritis, has been recorded, with the aim to warrant articular viscosupplementation. Future of intra-articular treatment should be represented by the biological drugs, i. e., anti-TNF, but it is still untimely to define the exact role of such a local treatment of arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Hip arthropathy in haemophilic {{patients}} is disabling for hip and other common target joints. Even if bleedings in the hip are not frequent, femoroacetabular alterations {{may affect the}} functional ability of patients {{at a very young}} age. A haematologic prophylaxis combined with an adequate lifestyle and regular and low-traumatic physical activity are the keys to preventing such arthropathy. In the early stages of arthropathy, anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy may be sufficient to limit its progression. In cases of recurrent symptoms, viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid, and chemical <b>synoviorthesis</b> are useful options. In more advanced stages, hip arthroscopy may be treated by synovectomy or loose body removal. For late stages, total hip arthroplasty (THA) is mandatory. Until a few decades ago, the clinical outcomes after hip arthroplasty were variable, due to the different management of patients and the use of old generation implants and couplings. In the last decade, the introduction of the multidisciplinary management and the use of modern cementless implants with high performing materials and less invasive surgical techniques have dramatically improved the functional results. Nowadays, as is the case for other target joints, the purpose of the management in haemophilia centers is the early detection of any hip alterations—by clinical and ultrasound (US) evaluations of patients in childhood—to reveal any early articular damage and to provide adequate treatment in case of symptoms. The present paper represents an updated review of the several approaches to hip arthropathy in haemophilia...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound {{examination}} {{is becoming}} more and more common in patients with rheumatoid diseases. Above all, it enables the assessment of articular soft tissues and constitutes a non-invasive examination. In a rheumatologist’s everyday practice, it is conducted at the stage of initial diagnosis as well as to monitor the treatment and to confirm the remission if the clinical picture is ambiguous. The first sign of arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) that is visible on ultrasound examination is the thickening of the synovial membrane of the joint cavities, tendon sheaths or bursae. It is frequently accompanied by the exudate in the joint, sheath or bursa. In a subsequent stage, in Doppler examination, enhanced vascularization of the synovial membrane is observed. Sometimes, the inflammatory process of the tendon sheaths also affects the tendons, which might lead to their damage. Moreover, ultrasound examination also reveals erosions and inflammatory cysts (geodes) which attest to the advancement of the disease. A dynamic ultrasound examination enables to diagnose the capsule-ligamentous contracture of the interphalangeal joints, which occurs due to the lack of rehabilitation that should begin at the moment of the commencement of the inflammation. The ultrasound image does not allow for the differentiation between various rheumatoid entities, including those encompassing the joints in the hand, wrist. The observed changes, i. e. thickening of the synovial membrane, hyperemia, effusions, erosions or tendon damage, may accompany various rheumatoid entities. The purpose of the ultrasound examination is to recognize these irregularities, determine their localization and advancement and, finally, to monitor the course of treatment. Furthermore, ultrasound scan enables to assess the joints and tendons in a dynamic examination in relation to local ailments of the patient as well as to monitor the biopsy, aspiration and medicine administration. Sonography is used for a US-guided administration of radioisotope substances for <b>synoviorthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of factor replacement to manage acute bleeding in haemophilia, haemarthrosis may occur due to delayed therapy or lack of detection, leading to joint damage. Orthopaedic surgery is one option to help improve patient quality of life. Assessment of current treatment patterns is required for physicians to optimize long-term management of patients; however, there are few studies available to determine the real-life situation in African/Middle-Eastern countries, such as Algeria. This was a multicentre, retrospective study of patients with haemophilia treated with on-demand factor replacement. Seven haematology centres in Algeria provided evaluable clinical data for 536 patients, including joint status and requirement for surgical intervention. Surgery was recommended in 326 (61 %) patients (239 patients with severe haemophilia, 79 moderate and eight mild). Surgical procedures per patient age group were: 11 in patients ≤ 5 years, 34 in 6 – 10 years, 169 in 11 – 20 years, 183 in 21 – 30 years and 122 in ≥ 31 years. 14 % of all procedures involved joint replacement, 56 % other major surgeries and 30 % minor surgeries (<b>synoviorthesis).</b> Minor surgery was most common in younger patients, while major surgeries increased proportionately with patient age. In Algeria, insufficient use of factor replacement has led to many patients with haemophilia experiencing haemarthrosis, leading to joint damage requiring surgery. This study aids assessment of {{the scale of the}} problem and identification of the surgical needs of patients. This may help plan targeted resourcing for patients most at risk of long-term disability and those likely to benefit from earlier surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with severe hemophilia {{it is today}} possible to prevent the development of arthropathy by giving effective continuous prophylaxis from an early age, thus preventing the VIII:C or IX:C concentration from falling below 1 % of normal. All the signs show that if a high-dose prophylactic regimen - that is, 3, 000 - 5, 000 U/kg body weight annually - is started as early as 1 - 2 years of age, the patients´ factor VIII/IX concentrations can be maintained {{at a level of}} at least 1 % and bleeds and joint defects can be virtually eliminated, allowing patients to live more or less normal lives, both physically and socially. Prophylaxis is also largely responsible for the changing picture in orthopedic surgery in hemophilia today, with a decreasing need of operations, an increasing average age of the patients, and a change in the kinds of operations performed. Although its outcome is inferior to that obtained in arthrosis, hip joint replacement in hemophilia is a viable option and should be considered as it is of value in certain cases. Surgery may also be undertaken in HIV-positive hemophiliacs under similar premises as for HIV-negatives, though indications for major surgery require meticulous consideration. In young hemophiliacs with inhibitors, a patient group otherwise difficult to treat, radioactive <b>synoviorthesis</b> is an appropriate treatment. The method is characterized by its ease of performance and limited requirements, and in most cases results in a manifest decrease in the joint bleeding frequency.

40|$|Introduction: Pigmented villonodular {{synovitis}} (PVNS) {{is a rare}} {{benign tumour}} of the synovium, most commonly arising around the knee. Resection remains the treatment of choice. The diffuse variant of the disease is prone to local recurrence (30 - 50 %). However distant dissemination is extremely rare. We report {{the case of a}} patient with massive loco-regional and late distant spread to the lungs of PVNS originating in the knee. Case report: A 69 yo women presented to our service 27 years ago with PVNS in her knee. Despite multible surgical resections, <b>synoviorthesis</b> and external beam radiotherapy, no local control was achieved. The disease spread in all thigh compartments. Due to the resistance to all convetional treatment modalities, isolated limb perfusion with TNFα and Melphalan was performed, without any effect on local control. After the disease was diagnosed in iliac lymph nodes, the patient was subjected to a systemic chemotherapy protocol with imitamib, which had to be abandoned, due to intolerance. Due to a giant lymphoedema of the entire limb, making up for a considerable part of the patient's body weight and in view of significant skin invasion, a hip disarticulation was performed. Finally, rapidly growing lung metastases appeared on CT scan, confirmed by core-needle biopsy. Palliative chemotherapy was initiated. Interestingly, histological analysis of the disease throughout the years remained consistent with classic benign PVNS. No sarcomatous dedifferentiation was observed, not even in the pulmonary lesions. Conclusion: PVNS is a benign tumour, with a high risk of local recurrence. Malignant behaviour, with loco-regional and distant metastases remains extremely rare. A histologically benign appearance does not exclude a clinically malignant behaviour with systemic spread...|$|E
