40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{other aspects of}} smoking behavior, {{little attention has been}} paid to the genetics of nicotine dependence. In this paper, three models (<b>single</b> <b>liability</b> dimension, independent liability dimension and combined model) have been applied to data on smoking initiation and nicotine dependence (n = 1572 Dutch twin pairs, mean age 30. 5). A combined model best described the data. This model postulates a smoking initiation dimension and a nicotine dependence dimension, which are not independent. For both males and females, individual differences in smoking initiation were explained by genetic (44 %), shared environmental (51 %) and unique environmental (5 %) influences. The nicotine dependence dimension was influenced only by genetic (75 %) and unique environmental (25 %) factors. The substantial impact of genetic factors on nicotine dependence emphasizes the need for further research to localize and identify specific genes and pathways involved in nicotine dependence. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Should lenders be made {{liable for}} {{environmental}} damages caused by their customers? In a recent paper Pitchford studied {{the case where}} the customer is a wealth-constrained manager-owned firm. He argued convincingly that a joint liability of lender and firm may reduce the firm's incentive to prevent an environmental damage and may therefore be socially harmful. However, his argument hinges {{on the assumption that}} the lender has no bargaining power and makes 0 -profits in a contract. In this paper we study all possible optimal contracts between the borrower and the lender. In particular we study the case where the lender has all the bargaining power. We use the weighted Nash-bargaining solution to handle both cases in a unified framework. The results for the case where the lender has a high bargaining power differ substantially from Pitchford's findings. Then a joint liability rule is socially preferable to <b>single</b> <b>liability</b> of the firm. In fact, often it is optimal to require a liability above the actual costs of a damage or to set it so high that it extracts all potential profits from the projec...|$|E

This study examined whether the inheritance of initiation of tobacco use in adolescents is independent of the inheritance of the number of cigarettes smoked.

The three models that were considered are (i) the <b>single</b> <b>liability</b> dimension model, (ii) the independent liability dimension model, and (iii) the combined model (CM). The results showed that there is not one underlying continuum of liability to smoking. The CM was the best-fitting model. This model postulates that there are separate initiation and quantity dimensions but allows for the possibility that there are some individuals who are so low on the liability to level of consumption that they are not using tobacco. There were no differences between males and females in the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in smoking initiation and quantity smoked. Smoking initiation was influenced by genetic factors (39 %) and shared environmental influences (54 %).

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that stressful life events (SLEs) influence the pattern of individual depressive symptoms. However, {{we do not know how}} these differences arise. Two theories about the nature of psychiatric disorders have different predictions about the source of these differences: (1) SLEs influence depressive symptoms and correlations between them indirectly, via an underlying acute liability to develop a dysphoric episode (DE; common cause hypothesis); and (2) SLEs influence depressive symptoms and correlations between them directly (network hypothesis). The present study investigates the predictions of these two theories. Method: We divided a population-based sample of 2096 Caucasian twins (49. 9 % female) who reported at least two aggregated depressive symptoms in the last year into four groups, based on the SLE they reported causing their symptoms. For these groups, we calculated tetrachoric correlations between the 14 disaggregated depressive symptoms and, subsequently, tested whether the resulting correlation patterns were significantly different and if those differences could be explained by underlying differences in a <b>single</b> acute <b>liability</b> to develop a DE. Results: The four SLE groups had markedly different correlation patterns between the depressive symptoms. These differences were significant and could not be explained by underlying differences in the acute liability to develop a DE. Conclusions: Our results are not compatible with the common cause perspective but are consistent with the predictions of the network hypothesis. We elaborate on the implications of a conceptual shift to the network perspective for our diagnostic and philosophical approach to the concept of what constitutes a psychiatric disorder...|$|R
40|$|Many complex {{diseases}} are usually considered as dichotomous traits {{but are also}} associated with quantitative biological markers or quantitative risk factors. For such dichotomous traits, although their associated quantitative traits may not directly underly the diagnosis of the disease status, if the associated quantitative trait is also linked to the chromosomal regions linked to the dichotomous trait, then joint analysis of dichotomous and quantitative traits should be more efficient than consideration of them separately. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the situation when a dichotomous trait can be modeled by a threshold process acting on a <b>single</b> underlying normal <b>liability</b> distribution. However, for many complex disorders, including most psychiatric disorders, diagnosis is generally based on a set of binary or discrete criteria. These traits cannot be modeled {{on the basis of a}} threshold process acting on an underlying continuous trait. We propose a likelihood-based method that efficiently combines such a discrete trait and an associated quantitative trait in the analysis, using affected-sib-pair data.

40|$|The {{power and}} {{complexity}} of the <b>single</b> member limited <b>liability</b> company (“SMLLC”) comes from a conceptual contradiction: the conflation of owner and organization for tax purposes and the separation of owner and entity for non-tax, state law purposes. The contraction has significant practical consequences, which this article explores and illustrates, considering: • The SMLLC in federal court (single member not permitted to represent the LLC) • The IRS’s tortuous path to determining whether an SMLLC’s sole member is liable for the SMLLC’s unpaid employment taxes (yes; yes vindicated by the courts; then no, as a matter of policy) • Transfer taxes on a single member’s contribution of land to the member’s solely-owned LLC (maybe taxable, maybe not) • Whether the membership transfer restrictions built into LLC statutes in order to prevent the separate creditors of an LLC member from intruding into the business of a multi-member LLC ought to be applied to allow a sole member to shelter assets from the claims of the sole member’s legitimate creditors (under advisement by one state supreme court for more than a year) The article concludes that “practitioners must exercise great caution when working with an SMLLC, because, depending on which legal regime applies, the SMLLC may be as visible and substantial as a stone wall, or as diaphanous and subject to disappearance as the Cheshire Cat. ...|$|R

Studying insomnia in aging populations is critical since the risk of insomnia increases with age, and insomnia is associated with numerous negative outcomes, such as cognitive impairments and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. The Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA) is a longitudinal study that investigates the relative contributions of genes and the environment to age-related changes in a broad range of characteristics. This thesis examined VETSA participants (n= 1237; mean age= 55. 6) and utilized classic twin analyses, neuropsychological assessments, hormone, genotype, and structural MRI data to explore the etiology of insomnia, the relationship between insomnia and depression, and the mechanisms through which insomnia may influence cognitive decline. Results demonstrate that genetic factors are responsible for approximately 34 % of the variation in individual differences in insomnia while non-shared environmental influences are responsible for the remaining 66 %; shared family environmental influences are negligible. This study was the first investigation {{of the extent to which}} symptoms of insomnia and depression share a <b>single</b> genetic <b>liability</b> or independent liabilities, as these disorders often co-occur. Results demonstrate that much of the genetic influence on insomnia is also associated with depression, suggesting that the comorbidity between these disorders reflects shared genetic effects. There is an association between insomnia and poorer performance on tests of general cognitive ability, visual spatial processing and memory, short term memory, and working memory. After adjusting for depression, insomnia was significantly related to visual spatial processing and memory, suggesting that treating insomnia might be a successful intervention for individuals who demonstrate visual spatial memory and processing impairments. To explore mechanisms through which insomnia influences cognitive decline, cortisol, hippocampal volume, and the apoE genotype were examined. Insomnia was significantly related to smaller hippocampal volume; there was no association between insomnia and cortisol levels. ApoE genotype is related to deficits in recovering from neuronal insult, but insomnia did not differentially impact cognition based on apoE genotype. However, trends towards interactions were observed, particularly on memory domains. These findings have implications for the treatment of insomnia and depression and may inform prevention and intervention techniques aimed at cognitive preservation, which is of central importance in successful aging...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the work}} of Eisenberg and Noe [2001], Suzuki [2002], Elsinger [2009] and Fischer [2014], we {{consider}} a generalization of Merton's asset valuation approach where n firms are linked by cross-ownership of equities and liabilities. Each firm is assumed to have a <b>single</b> outstanding <b>liability,</b> whereas its assets consist of one system-exogenous asset, as well as system-endogenous assets comprising some fraction of other firms' equity and liability, respectively. Following Fischer [2014], one can obtain no-arbitrage prices of equity and the recovery claims of liabilities as solutions of a fixed point problem, and hence obtain no-arbitrage prices of the `firm value' of each firm, which is the value of the firm's liability plus the firm's equity. In a first step, we consider the two-firm case where explicit formulae for the no-arbitrage prices of the firm values are available (cf. Suzuki [2002]). Since firm values are derivatives of exogenous asset values, the distribution of firm values at maturity can be determined from the distribution of exogenous asset values. The Merton model and most of its known extensions do not account for the cross-ownership structure of the assets owned by the firm. Therefore the assumption of lognormally distributed exogenous assets leads to lognormally distributed firm values in such models, as the values of the liability and the equity add up to the exogenous asset's value (which has lognormal distribution by assumption). Our work therefore starts from lognormally distributed exogenous assets and reveals how cross-ownership, when correctly accounted for in the valuation process, affects the distribution of the firm value, which is not lognormal anymore. In a simulation study we examine the impact of several parameters (amount of cross-ownership of debt and equity, ratio of liabilities to expected exogenous assets value) on the differences between the distribution of firm values obtained from our model and correspondingly matched lognormal distributions. It becomes clear that the assumption of lognormally distributed firm values may lead to both over- and underestimation of the “true" firm values (within the cross-ownership model) and consequently of bankruptcy risk, too. In a second step, the bankruptcy risk of one firm within the system is analyzed in more detail in a further simulation study, revealing that the correct incorporation of cross-ownership in the valuation procedure is the more important, the tighter the cross-ownership structure between the two firms. Furthermore, depending on the considered type of cross-ownership (debt or equity), the assumption of lognormally distributed firm values is likely to result in an over- resp. underestimation of the actual probability of default. In a similar vein, we consider the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a firm in the system, which we calculate as the negative α-quantile of the firm value at maturity minus the firm's risk neutral price in t= 0, i. e. we consider the (1 -α) 100...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} mining project {{feasibility}} studies and operations {{is still on}} short-term profitability with little view to a post-closure landscape and liability. The faults of both the original and the operation’s mine planners are therefore vested upon the closure teams who must deal with these planning decisions. Following completion of operations, most mining companies that have not adequately prepared for mine closure will face an inability to relinquish their project leases {{as a result of}} closure planning process shortfalls. Following from our own closure project experiences and of recent international mine closure conferences, we propose seven key lessons still to be learned if successful mine closure is to be achieved. Firstly, a paucity of baseline environmental monitoring data often incapacitates good closure planning from the outset with a failure to understand key closure risks and risk drivers for the site. Well-characterised environmental information prior to mining disturbance and monitored progressive rehabilitation is a great strategy to address this fault. An insufficient understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics and volumes of waste materials is a second critical fault of closure processes. A third significant issue is contaminated mine waters such as acid and metalliferous drainage (AMD). AMD is arguably one of the <b>single</b> biggest <b>liabilities</b> and management issue post-closure. Failure to engage stakeholders in a documented process is a fourth prime failing often seen with the fifth of mine closure procrastination. Like all of these causes, this problem often arises from thinking mine closure is an activity at end of life-of-mine rather than as a process that begins with the initial mine plan and then regularly continues throughout mine life. Diligent attention to regular planning assessment and stakeholder consultation from an early operational phase may fend off later criticisms, lead to closure outcomes better directed by years of underpinning work and also reduce end of mine costs. A sixth significant closure planning error is the failure to account for the long temporal scales that closure planning must accommodate, particularly so when costing closure. This failure is often due to closure views being short-term, to meet immediate regulatory and operational planning needs rather than focussed on the future. A seventh lesson from historic closure planning is the simple failure to have clear closure objectives and approaches to identified outcomes. This may result in a focus on technical studies that fail to provide better closure understanding, whilst expending hard-won closure-aimed budgets. Driving closure planning by well defined goals through corporate tools such as closure standards designed to meet both internal requirements and relevant closure guidelines is an ideal solution to avoiding wasted closure resources such as time and finances. Whilst learning and addressing these key closure lessons is no guarantee of successful relinquishment, recognition of these issues and judicious planning to overcome them is more likely to present well considered closure plans with greater chance of closure relinquishment in a sustainable socio environmentally manner that maintains a company’s and the broader mining industry’s licence to operate into the future...|$|R
