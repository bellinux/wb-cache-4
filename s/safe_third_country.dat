This can be for permanent settlement or limited to a certain number of years. It is the third durable solution and it can only be considered once the two other solutions have proved impossible.

Instead, their legality is derived from Article 31 of the convention, which states that a refugee should not be punished for illegally entering a country if they are arriving directly from a country where they were under threat. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) itself has cautioned against interpreting <b>safe</b> <b>third</b> <b>country</b> agreements too broadly, though it acknowledges {{that they may be}} acceptable in some circumstances. Such ambiguities have led some legal professionals in Canada to question the legality of the Canada-United States <b>Safe</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Country</b> Agreement.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} and assess the main items in the strategy followed by the EU and its member states on the externalisation of their asylum function. First, it analyses the European harmonisation of the return to <b>safe</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> and to countries of first asylum, which is carried out by means of readmission agreements. Second, {{it refers to the}} strategies defined by the Hague and the Stockholm programs concerning the External Aspects of the European Union Asylum Policy, on the detention centres for illegal immigrants abroad, and on the proposals for delocalisation of asylum applications processing centres beyond the EU borders. Finally, this paper considers whether the strategy of externalisation of the function of asylum sometimes lacks legitimacy, and to what extent there is a fair balance between the interests of the states and the protection of the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers...|$|R
5000|$|And in {{parallel}} a third stream of immigration {{starting in the}} mid 1980s were war refugees, of which West Germany accepted {{more than any other}} West European country due to an unqualified right to asylum. From 1986 to 1989, about 380,000 refugees sought asylum, mostly from Iran and Lebanon. Between 1990 and 1992 nearly 900,000 people from former Yugoslavia, Romania, or Turkey sought asylum in a united Germany. In 1992, 438,000 applied, and Germany admitted almost 70 percent of all asylum seekers registered in the European Community. By comparison, in 1992 only about 100,000 people sought asylum in the U.S. The growing numbers of asylum seekers led to a constitutional change severely restricting the previously unqualified right of asylum, that former [...] "refugees had held sacred because of their reliance on it to escape the Nazi regime". In December 1992, the Bundestag passed legislation amending the Basic Law, in which article 16 was changed to 16a. Persons entering Germany save from <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> were no longer granted asylum, and applications from nationals of so-called <b>safe</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> of origin were refused. , the numbers of asylum seekers had dropped significantly.|$|R

As with regard to many past attacks to Camp Liberty and Camp Ashraf, evidence points to Iran paramilitary forces being the perpetrators. UNHCR strongly condemned the attacks and stated that the residents are entitled to protection against expulsion or forced movement to any place where their lives or freedom would be threatened, and informed that it has supported the relocation of more than 900 residents to <b>safe</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> since 2011; as however, approximately 2,160 people still remain, UNHCR renewed its calls upon governments of other countries {{to find ways to}} offer long term solutions. The European Iraqi Freedom Association (EIFA), led by Struan Stevenson, Chairman of the European Parliament’s Delegation for Relations with Iraq from 2009 to 2014, who was deeply involved in diplomacy aiming to safeguard the lives and human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf, stated that to avoid further bloodshed just condemning the atrocity is not enough. EIFA urged the USA to provide air cover for Camp Liberty, the UN to [...] "stop any further obfuscation and officially recognise Camp Liberty as a refugee camp under its direct supervision and protection" [...] and asked that the [...] "international assistance to Iraq must be suspended forthwith until the security of the Camp Liberty residents is assured".|$|R

40|$|My Major Research Paper is an {{examination}} of non-Jewish African asylum seekers entering Israel from the Sinai Peninsula. I argue {{that the best way}} of solving the current crisis is through the implementation of a robust burden-sharing scheme. My research paper is split into three sections. The first section examines the ethical dimensions of non-Jewish asylum seekers in Israel. I argue that Israel’s founding as a Zionist state, meant to protect Jews from harm, gives it special responsibilities to African asylum seekers fleeing persecution. The best way to fulfill this responsibility is through the principle of humanitarianism. The second section examines a brief history of refugee protection and Israel’s status in it, starting with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. It then examines how Israel’s system of refugee protection attempts to meet its international obligations to African asylum seekers. Finally, the third section examines a solution to the influx of African asylum seekers – burden-sharing, a legal mechanism by which host countries can send refugees to <b>safe,</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> I argue that burden-sharing remains one of the few durable solutions available to the State of Israel, but Israel is ultimately failing to implement this policy because it lacks a refugee determination system. To justify this claim, I examine burden-sharing in international law, followed by an account of different jurisdictions application of burden-sharing, including the European Union. Finally, I examine how burden-sharing can be theoretically applied to non-Jewish African asylum seekers in Israel...|$|R
50|$|Immigration {{detention}} in the United States {{began in}} 1890s at Ellis Island. The administration of President Ronald Reagan further {{reacted to the}} mass migration of asylum seekers who arrived in boats from Haiti by establishing a program to interdict (i.e., stop and search certain vessels suspected of transporting undocumented Haitians). As the number of undocumented immigrants who were fleeing economic and political conditions increased, President Bush Sr's administration attempted to find a regional location to handle the influx of refugees and migrants. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) arranged for several countries in the region—Belize, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela—to temporarily provide {{a safe haven for}} Haitians however the Coast Guard was becoming increasingly overcrowded from holding hundreds of refugees and by November 18, 1991, the United States forcibly returned 538 Haitians to Haiti. Since the options for <b>safe</b> havens in <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> in the region proved inadequate for the sheer numbers of Haitians fleeing their country, the Coast Guard took them to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, where they were pre-screened for asylum in the United States.|$|R
