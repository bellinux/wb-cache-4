The study of message transmission speed in such kind of networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a realistic framework to model the message propagation process, and give a detailed expression of average information dissemination delay based on message size, users' selfishness, number of involved subscribers and other related parameters. We apply our model to real-life traces to assess its reliability by comparing the theoretical results with measured statistics, and present extensive upshots to evaluate the influence of various parameters on system performance. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

Bluetooth is a {{wireless}} system designed for <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections</b> of computing and telecommunication devices, aimed at cable replacement and personal networking. The main {{goal of this}} paper is to present a simulation environment for modeling interference based on frequency hopping spread spectrum and GFSK modulation. In this article, a complete structure of Bluetooth system model is established, and simulation procedures are given by applying SystemView, which is used as tool software for dynamic system simulation and performance analysis. In this context, the simulation model is used to emulate the Bluetooth process and analyze the results. The simulation model with SystemView could not only helps gain a better understanding of the basic principle and working modes of Bluetooth process, but also acts as a development platform for further research...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{personal}} area networks (WPANs) {{are getting}} popular {{in a variety}} of fields such as smart home, office automation, and e-healthcare. In WPANs, most devices are considerably energy constrained, so the communication protocol should be energy efficient. The IEEE 802. 15. 4 is designed as a standard protocol for low power, low data rate, low complexity, and <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections</b> in WPANs. The standard supports allocating several numbers of collision-free guarantee time slots (GTSs) within a superframe for some time-critical transmissions. Recently, COPE was proposed as a promising network coding architecture to essentially improve the throughput of wireless networks. In this paper, we exploit the network coding technique at coordinators to improve energy efficiency of the WPAN. Some related practical issues, such as GTS allocation and multicast, are also discussed in order to exploit the network coding opportunities efficiently. Since the coding opportunities are mostly exploited, our proposal achieves both higher energy efficiency and throughput performance than the original IEEE 802. 15. 4...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mobility}} of Army tactical networks, combined with their {{close proximity to}} hostile actors, elevates {{the risks associated with}} short-range network attacks. The connectivity model for such <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections</b> under active operations is extremely fluid, and highly dependent upon the physical space within which the element is operating, as well as the patterns of movement within that space. To handle these dependencies, we introduce the notion of "key cyber-physical terrain": locations within an area of operations that allow for effective control over the spread of proximity-dependent malware in a mobile tactical network, even as the elements of that network are in constant motion with an unpredictable pattern of node-to-node connectivity. We provide an analysis of movement models and approximation strategies for finding such critical nodes, and demonstrate via simulation that we can identify such key cyber-physical terrain quickly and effectively.

40|$|Resilience of most {{critical}} infrastructures against failure of elements that appear insignificant is usually taken for granted. The World Airline Network (WAN) is an infrastructure {{that reduces the}} geographical gap between societies, both small and large, and brings forth economic gains. With the extensive use of a publicly maintained data set that contains information about airports and alternative connections between these airports, we empirically reveal that the WAN is a redundant and resilient network for long distance air travel, but otherwise breaks down completely due to removal of short and apparently insignificant <b>connections.</b> These <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>connections</b> with moderate number of passengers and alternate flights are the connections that keep remote {{parts of the world}} accessible. It is surprising, insofar as there exists a highly resilient and strongly connected core consisting of a small fraction of airports (around 2. 3 %) together with an extremely fragile star-like periphery. Yet, in spite of their relevance, more than 90 % of the world airports are still interconnected upon removal of this core. With standard and unconventional removal measures we compare both empirical and topological perceptions for the fragmentation of the world. We identify how the WAN is organized into different classes of clusters based on the physical proximity of airports and analyze the consequence of this fragmentation.

40|$|Basic project {{objective}} was to provide multichannel interconnect modules and their required building blocks {{to be used for}} <b>short</b> <b>range</b> optical <b>connections.</b> Bitrates to be achieved were 2. 5 Gbit/s per channel. The modules fabricated based on flip-chip technology and used silicon submounts with V-grooves for coupling to singlemode fibres. The specified transmission rate was achieved. The optical coupling was acheived with a low attenuation. Laser and detector arrays were designed for a wavelength of 1. 3 #mu#m. Semiconductor data on the water were very homogeneous, therefore, a high yield for array selection could be achieved. Electronics were within the same package as the subassemblies. The ASICs demonstrated their capabilities for 2. 5 Gbit/s bitrate with good performance. In order to provide a package integrated fibre coupling we demonstrated a concept that provides very compact modules to be fabricated under very low-cost budgets. For optical coupling of fibres and waveguides within the interconnect system we analysed a new connector concept using beam expansion. Using this concept we could provide connectors with up to 10 channels. Their average attenuation was 0. 96 dB. Under 20 individual mating and unmatings we observed variations of only 1 %. (orig.)

The SCORE architecture designs an onthology based approach to a car’s high dynamic spatial context. From tracking systems, locally fixed federation collects data and offers it to car mounted reasoning systems. Those reasoning systems deduce spatial relationships between the car and other objects. The Implementation of SCORE in a fixed base driving simulator proved well and performant enough for such systems. 1 Driver Assistance Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) aim at supporting drivers with their driving task. Mandatory basis for the analysis of traffic behavior is a rich sensing system. We assume that stationary systems along the road will be available to gather tracking data from passing cars and integrate it into local traffic models. For the area of ubiquitous computing, the challenges of a highly dynamic environment in conjunction with dynamic <b>short</b> <b>range</b> network <b>connections</b> are addressed. It will then be the responsibility of the individual cars to gather and interpret accumulated traffic data from such stationary providers along the road.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a marked growth in the use of {{wireless}} cellular telephones, PCs and the Internet. This proliferation of information technology has hastened the advent of wireless networks which aim to increase the accessibility and reach of communications devices. Ambient Intelligence (Ami) is a vision of the future of computing in which all kinds of everyday objects will contain intelligence. To be effective, Ami requires Ubiquitous Computing and Communication, the latter being enabled by wireless networking. The IEEE's 802. 11 task group has developed a series of radio based replacements for the familiar wired ethernet LAN. At the same time another IEEE standards task group, 802. 15, together with a number of industry consortia, has introduced a new level of wireless networking based upon <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> ad-hoc <b>connections.</b> Currently, the most significant of these new Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) standards is Bluetooth, one of the first of the enabling technologies of Ami to be commercially available. Bluetooth operates in the internationally unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band at 2. 4 GHz. unfortunately, this spectrum is particularly crowded. It is also used by: WiFi (IEEE 802. 11); a new WPAN standard called Zig- Bee; many types of simple devices such as garage door openers; and is polluted by unintentional radiators. The success of a radio specification for ubiquitous wireless communications is, therefore, dependant upon a robust tolerance to high levels of electromagnetic noise.

Large-area CVD-grown graphene monolayers can be transferred onto arbitrary substrates to add active optoelectronic properties to intrinsically passive photonic integration platforms. In this work, we present graphene-based EAMs integrated in passive polymer waveguides. To facilitate modulation frequencies in the GHz range, a 50 Ω termination resistor as well as a DC blocking capacitor are integrated with graphene EAMs for the first time. Large signal data transmission experiments were carried out across the O, C and L optical communications bands. The fastest devices exhibit a 3 -dB bandwidth of more than 4 GHz. Our analytical model of the modulation response for the graphene-based EAMs is in good agreement with the measurement results. It predicts that bandwidths greater than 50 GHz are possible with future device iterations. Owing to the absorption properties of the graphene layers, the devices are expected to be functional at smaller wavelengths of interest for optical interconnects and data-communications as well, offering a novel flexibility for the integration of high-speed functionalities in optoelectronic integrated circuits.

We {{are only beginning to}} understand its heterogeneous structure, ranging from a strongly hierarchical organization in sensorimotor areas to widely distributed networks in areas such as the parieto-frontal cortex. Our study relied on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 32 fetuses with no detectable morphological abnormalities. After adapting functional magnetic resonance acquisition, motion correction, and nuisance signal reduction procedures of resting-state functional data analysis to fetuses, we extracted neural activity information for major cortical and subcortical structures. Resting fMRI networks were observed for increasing regional functional connectivity from 21 st to 38 th gestational weeks (GWs) with a network-based statistical inference approach. The overall connectivity network, <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> and interhemispheric <b>connections</b> showed sigmoid expansion curve peaking at the 26 – 29 GW. In contrast, long-range connections exhibited linear increase with no periods of peaking development. Region-specific increase of functional signal synchrony followed a sequence of occipital (peak: 24. 8 GW), temporal (peak: 26 GW), frontal (peak: 26. 4 GW), and parietal expansion (peak: 27. 5 GW). We successfully adapted functional neuroimaging and image post-processing approaches to correlate macroscopical scale activations in the fetal brain with gestational age.
