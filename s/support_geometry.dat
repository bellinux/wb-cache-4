Flat plate (FP), tubular (TU) and multichannel (MC) geometries are investigated using the dusty gas model (DGM) to describe transport of a multicomponent gas mixture through the macroporous support. It is shown that: (a) the <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> significantly affects membrane performance; (b) {{in the case of the}} multichannel geometry, the inner channels do not contribute efficiently to the overall gas transport; (c) best performance in terms of both flux and permselectivity is obtained for tubular geometry.

It is shown that bearing dynamic response is non-linear. Journal orbit complexity increases with pad compliance though the orbit amplitudes are marginally affected at low loads. At high loads, the journal is forced to operate outside the bearing clearance. The polymer liner reduces the maximum oil film pressure by a factor of 2 when compared to the white metal liner. The nonlinear dynamic response of compliant tilting pad journal bearings is thoroughly discussed...|$|E

GiD is used to construct a tessellation of the problem domain into FE-like regions (blocks in GMP terminology), and the interface obtains and transfers all the topological and geometrical information to GMP. Then, GMP automatically constructs a parameterization for each FE-like region of the GMP mesh, which later {{can be used to}} generate the actual FE-mesh and <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> updates during mesh refinements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLess {{control points}} {{are needed to}} {{represent}} a shape in T-Splines compared to NURBS and subsequently less time is spent in modeling. While {{getting more and more}} accepted by commercial software, T-splines, however, are yet part of VRML/X 3 D. The T-spline VRML is proposed in this work. An effective data structure is designed for T-splines to support online visualization. Compared to the NURBS and the polygonal representations, the proposed T-spline data structure representation can significantly reduce the VRML file size which is a central concern in online applications. As such, complex objects modeled in T-spline form have better chances for real-time transfer from servers to clients. Similar to other VRML nodes, T-spline VRML node can <b>support</b> <b>geometry,</b> color and texture. Users can interact with T-spline more effectively for LOD and animation applications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} several transport-related aspects {{relevant for}} the application of thin supported silica membranes for gas separation and nanofiltration. The influence of <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> on overall membrane performance is investigated. Planar (i. e., flat plate), tubular, and multichannel support geometries are investigated in numerical simulations of the membrane performance in gas separation. The emphasis is laid on the last two membrane geometries which are considered more suitable due to their greater surface-area-to-volume ratio and mechanical robustness. The dusty-gas-model (DGM) is used, and the contribution of different transport mechanisms occurring in a porous system (Knudsen diffusion, bulk diffusion and viscous flow) is accounted for. The comparison of geometries is performed in terms of the calculated flux and selectivity, in case of separation of pure H 2 and of a 50 - 50...|$|E

40|$|A liquid {{stretched}} {{between two}} solid boundaries forms a liquid bridge. The static stability (‘shape stability’) {{of the liquid}} bridge to disturbances whose contact-line is (i) pinned or (ii) moves with fixed contact-angle is studied. The liquid/gas interface is idealized as a mathematical surface of constant surface tension. Elementary results from the calculus-of-variations are utilized to derive a sufficient condition for stability without explicitly solving the boundary value problem associated with the second variation. The focus is generating ‘quick ’ checks on stability. The utility of the method is illustrated by limiting cases of the liquid bridge between parallel plates; the liquid cylinder and catenoid. Our stability criteria gives sharp bounds in some cases, recovering previously reported results and yields new predictions for mobile contact-line disturbances. We conclude with remarks concerning the effect of <b>support</b> <b>geometry...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for multistage multimesh gear transmission systems. The analysis predicts the overall system dynamics and the transmissibility {{to the gear}} box or the enclosed structure. The modal synthesis approach of the analysis treats the uncoupled lateral/torsional model characteristics of each stage or component independently. The vibration signature analysis evaluates the global dynamics coupling in the system. The method synthesizes the interaction of each modal component or stage with the nonlinear gear mesh dynamics and the modal <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> characteristics. The analysis simulates transient and steady state vibration events to determine the resulting torque variations, speeds, changes, rotor imbalances, and support gear box motion excitations. A vibration signature analysis examines the overall dynamic characteristics of the system, and the individual model component responses. The gear box vibration analysis also examines the spectral characteristics of the support system...|$|E

Through the use of IPIP's data definition language, the structure of the geometry components is defined. The data manipulation language is the vehicle by which a user defines an instance of the geometry. The manipulation language also allows a user to edit, query, and manage the geometry.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the rigid {{leading and trailing edges}} that hold the membrane could affect the aeromechanic performance of membrane wings. In this study the interaction between the supports and a membrane aerofoil is explored. Tests are performed at low Reynolds numbers, Re = 9 × 104, and incidences of 2 ◦- 22 ◦. Four different leading and trailing edge geometries have been analysed focusing on the unsteady characteristics of the wake and the structural vibration of the membrane. Results indicate that the wake’s shedding frequency is dependent on membrane’s <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> for low angles of attack (α), but is independent for higher values of α. Moreover, it has been found that the aeroelastic coupling between vortex shedding and membrane vibration interact, exciting the natural frequency modes of the membrane support. Hence, the results suggest that the leading and trailing edge geometry plays a crucial role on the overall performance of the membrane aerofoil. I...|$|E

40|$|Geometry {{compression}} for VRML {{has been}} an important item on the wish-list of the Web 3 D Consortium since 1996. It was widely understood that a binary format would be required to allow compressed geometry, which explains why there is still no geometry compression in VRML. We demonstrate here a compression technique that does not require a binary format and that is able to achieve bit-rates that are within 1 to 2 percent of those of a binary benchmark coder. Furthermore, our technique will allow complete conformance between the current ASCII standard and the future binary standard of VRML (or X 3 D). Translating between the two will not require to invoke complex compression or decompression schemes. Compressed nodes have an ASCII as well as a binary representation and conversion {{from one to the other}} is a simple symbolic mapping. The same decompression algorithm can be used to inflate a compressed node, no matter whether it was stored in ASCII or in binary. We do not argue against a binary format for VRML. A binary format will reduce parse time and might store a scene even more compactly. We argue to <b>support</b> <b>geometry</b> compression now [...] . without waiting for a binary specificatio...|$|E
