2500|$|Simple {{stepper motor}} drivers entirely {{energize}} or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to [...] "cog" [...] {{to a limited}} number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called microstepping. Computer controlled stepper motors {{are one of the most}} versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital <b>servo-controlled</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Various {{technologies}} {{can be used}} {{to avoid}} overvoltage, but it must be done so efficiently so that energy savings resulting from using the correct voltage are not offset by energy wasted within the device used to do so. Reliability is also important, and there are potential problems inherent in running full incoming power through electro-mechanical devices such as <b>servo-controlled</b> variable autotransformers.|$|E
50|$|The Noddy {{video camera}} was <b>servo-controlled</b> {{to pan and}} tilt ('nod') across a matrix of pre-arranged {{physical}} objects - captions and mechanical models. The camera was black-and-white, with electronically synthesised colour added to its output. This system eliminated the delay associated with swapping graphics upon a conventional copy stand. It also allowed for the depth required by mechanical objects such as clocks and a rotating globe.|$|E
5000|$|... "VSR-2: Talos FG" [...] {{is based}} {{primarily}} around a lower body support system of <b>servo-controlled</b> linear actuators, which are powered by an internal computer and electrical system. The actuators and unique ball joint design allows the unit's legs to function {{similar to the}} human by mimicking the contracting nature of the muscles, but with the complementing ability to 'push' the limb the opposite direction, removing the need for opposing actuators.|$|E
50|$|A Seismic {{vibrator}} propagates energy signals {{into the}} Earth {{over an extended}} period of time as opposed to the near instantaneous energy provided by impulsive sources. The data recorded in this way must be correlated to convert the extended source signal into an impulse. The source signal using this method was originally generated by a <b>servo-controlled</b> hydraulic vibrator or shaker unit mounted on a mobile base unit, but electro-mechanical versions have also been developed.|$|E

50|$|The Challenger 2E is {{an export}} {{version of the}} tank. It has a new {{integrated}} weapon control and battlefield management system, which includes a gyrostabilised panoramic SAGEM MVS 580-day/thermal sight for the commander and SAGEM SAVAN 15 gyrostabilised day/thermal sight for the gunner, both with eyesafe laser rangefinder. This allows hunter/killer operations with a common engagement sequence. An optional <b>servo-controlled</b> overhead weapons platform can be slaved to the commander's sight to allow operation independent from the turret.|$|E
50|$|This {{is similar}} to a U-tube tank but the water {{crossover}} duct is much larger and the air crossover contains a <b>servo-controlled</b> valve system. Since this valve controls the flow of air very little power is required. When the valve is closed, passage of air from one tank to the other is prevented and the resulting compression of air in the tank prevents flow of water also. When the valve opens, free movement of water and air is possible.|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 {{was both}} heavy and large. The {{pull-out}} handles at each corner needed four people to safely move the camera with the lens in place. It also required a separate remote {{camera control unit}} and the cable connecting the two was over 2 inches thick. The standard <b>servo-controlled</b> studio zoom lens had a 5 to 50° horizontal angle of view, with a minimum focus distance of either 36 inches (J type) or 18 inches (K type) ...|$|E
50|$|In direct coupled OTL designs, {{both the}} {{necessary}} blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and {{the selection of}} vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker. Typically, direct coupled OTL amplifiers will have a user-adjustable DC offset control, which allows the user to trim off any residual DC voltage residing at the amplifier's output terminals prior to operation. <b>Servo-controlled</b> variants also exist.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of his racing activity, he became {{interested}} in automobile stability and control and the potential for applications of aircraft technology. Under the sponsorship of General Motors, vehicle dynamics activity at CAL developed and substantiated the automobile dynamic equations of motion and developed the first variable stability (<b>servo-controlled)</b> cars. The first six-component tire testing machine was developed, leading to TIRF, the original high-speed, flat-belt tire tester in 1970. TIRF {{is still one of the}} most advanced tire testing machines in the world.|$|E
50|$|Key {{features}} of the design are the machine's interchangeable headblock system, which allows the ATR-100 to be converted to run either quarter-inch or half-inch magnetic tape. Ampex was the first company to implement a <b>servo-controlled,</b> direct-drive-capstan tape transport, which allows the tape speed and tension to be continuously monitored by a servo relay. The transport consequently has excellent wow and flutter specifications. The ATR-100 also features dual VU meters, or four VU meters {{in the case of}} the four track models, and a digital tape timer. An optional remote control is also available.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Howard {{was known}} to have a {{consistent}} working relationship with the legendary Stanley Kubrick, regarded by many {{as one of the}} greatest original filmmakers of all time. He would serve as special effects advisor on Kubrick’s [...] "2001: A Space Odyssey". Combining optical and mechanical effects, the special effects that Howard, Kubrick, and other experts refined and collaborated on *"multiplied technical innovations: the intensive use of front projection for the landscapes in [...] "The Dawn of Man" [...] or the invention of stepping motors <b>servo-controlled</b> by computer for moving the spaceships." ...|$|E
50|$|Through many experiments, it {{has been}} found that {{characteristics}} of a material can change as a result of LCF. Fracture ductility tends to decrease, with the magnitude depending on the presence of small cracks to begin with. To perform these tests, an electro-hydraulic <b>servo-controlled</b> testing machine was generally used, as it is capable of not changing the stress amplitude. It was also discovered that performing low-cycle fatigue tests on specimens with holes already drilled in them were more susceptible to crack propagation, and hence a greater decrease in fracture ductility. This was true despite the small hole sizes, ranging from 40-200 μm.|$|E
5000|$|The San Diego Hall of Science {{approached}} Spitz Laboratories {{to create}} a new type of star projector that would not obstruct the view for part of the audience or interfere with the movie projection system. Spitz created a <b>servo-controlled</b> [...] "starball" [...] that became the centerpiece of the system, dubbed a [...] "Space Transit Simulator". The spherical star projector and a number of independent planet projectors maintained a low profile while projecting a realistic sky for the astronomy presentations. These elements, along with a number of slide projectors and lighting systems, were all controlled by a PDP-15 minicomputer.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern implementations, however, are {{standard}} or slightly modified manual transmissions (and very occasionally modified automatics—even including {{a few cases}} of CVTs with [...] "fake" [...] fixed gear ratios), with <b>servo-controlled</b> clutching and shifting under command of the central engine computer. These are intended as a combined replacement option both for more expensive and less efficient [...] "normal" [...] automatic systems, and for drivers who prefer manual shift but are {{no longer able to}} operate a clutch, and users are encouraged to leave the shift lever in fully automatic [...] "drive" [...] most of the time, only engaging manual-sequential mode for sporty driving or when otherwise strictly necessary.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 110 57 mm gun is {{the newest}} multi-purpose, medium caliber gun. It {{is based on the}} Bofors 57 Mk 3. Compared to World War II destroyers or escorts fitted with 2 or 5 five-inch guns which could fire 15 rounds per minute per barrel, the single Mk 110 can fire salvos at up to 220 rounds per minute, up to a similar range of nine miles with minimal {{manpower}} in a turret with a stealthy radar signature. Linked to a digital fire control system, <b>servo-controlled</b> electro hydraulic gun laying subsystems provide extreme pointing accuracy, even in heavy seas. Current and proposed mountings for the weapon include the United States Coast Guard's National Security Cutter and the new Littoral combat ships.|$|E
50|$|Xerox {{acquired}} Diablo {{that same}} year, following which Lee departed {{to set up}} Qume Corporation in 1973. Xerox's Office Product Division had already been buying Diablo printers for its Redactron text editors. After 7 years trying to make Diablo profitable, the OPD focused on developing and selling the Diablo 630 which was mostly bought by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation. The Diablo 630 could produce letter quality output as good as that produced by an IBM Selectric or Selectric-based printer, but at a lower cost. A further advantage was that it supported the entire ASCII printing character set. Its <b>servo-controlled</b> carriage also permitted the use of proportional spaced fonts, where characters occupy a different amount of horizontal space according to their width.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 the 36-series tape {{recorders}} {{ended with the}} G36, and were superseded by the transistorised A77 with a <b>servo-controlled</b> direct drive capstan. Over 80,000 36-series recorders had been manufactured. The A77 was complemented by an integrated amplifier (A78) and FM tuner (A76). The start of the 1980s saw {{the introduction of the}} [...] "B7xx" [...] series of high fidelity components, which was in turn replaced by the B2xx series in the mid 1980s. The B2xx series was versatile (the B250 amplifier offering 10 signal inputs, each with automatic sensitivity calibration) and feature-rich, all components containing microprocessors. Contrastingly, the [...] "H" [...] line, with [...] "H" [...] standing for Human, went to the opposite extreme, with minimalist control interfaces: several [...] "H" [...] components having only three buttons.|$|E
