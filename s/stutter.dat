40|$|Recently, some {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} acquired <b>stuttering,</b> disfluencies that begin in adulthood. The nature of acquired <b>stuttering</b> differs in several respects from developmental <b>stuttering.</b> A case of acquired <b>stuttering</b> following drug overdose is presented and contrasted with previously reported cases. The case is noteworthy in that, while many characteristics of acquired <b>stuttering</b> are evidenced, several symptoms associated with developmental <b>stuttering</b> are also observed.

5|$|People who <b>stutter</b> include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose <b>stutter</b> was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E

50|$|In general, <b>stuttering</b> therapy aims {{to reduce}} <b>stuttering</b> {{to some degree}} in an individual, {{although}} there is disagreement about acceptable treatment outcomes from <b>stuttering</b> therapy. Some believe the only acceptable therapy outcome is {{a significant reduction in}} or total elimination of <b>stuttering,</b> others believe that speech which contains some <b>stuttering,</b> as long as the <b>stuttering</b> has become less tense and effortful, is just as acceptable, and yet others believe that the most important therapy outcome is the increased confidence a person has in his or her ability to talk, whether or not <b>stuttering</b> continues to be present. Additionally, the many different methods available for treating <b>stuttering,</b> and a history of promoting unsuccessful treatments, have left both stutterers and clinicians confused and frustrated about what can be accomplished with <b>stuttering</b> treatment.|$|R
5|$|Although Koniecpolski had a <b>stutter,</b> {{when he was}} 15, {{through his}} father's {{influence}} in the royal court, he secured an appointment as starosta (mayor) of Wieluń.

He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a <b>stutter</b> (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his <b>stutter</b> earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of <b>stuttering</b> {{modification}} {{therapy is}} not to eliminate <b>stuttering</b> but to modify it so that <b>stuttering</b> is easier and less effortful.

The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and {{is also known as}} block modification therapy.

40|$|The Antwerp {{epidemiological}} and phenomenological {{study on}} <b>stuttering</b> {{focuses on the}} onset and development of <b>stuttering.</b> Descriptive data related to the onset of <b>stuttering</b> were obtained {{for a group of}} 1549 participants.

The following aspects of <b>stuttering</b> and the related phenomena were studied: (a) stuttering-like disfluencies (type, frequency, duration, tension), (b) subtypes of <b>stuttering</b> and the role of temperament, (c) the onset of <b>stuttering</b> and the related variables, (d) precipitating factors post onset, (e) stuttering-associated behaviour (physical concomitants and avoidance), (f) awareness of <b>stuttering,</b> (g) speech attitude, (h) listeners‟ reactions. The findings provided a basis {{for the construction of a}} model of the onset of <b>stuttering</b> and a model of the development and consistency of <b>stuttering</b> characteristics and the related phenomena.

40|$|AbstractInroductionNeurogenic <b>stuttering</b> is an {{acquired}} disorder of speech fluency in adults resulting most commonly from {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) and stroke. Neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> frequently co-occurs with aphasia and dysarthria. It {{is important to consider}} what makes the core of neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> and which disfluencies are related to aphasia. MethodsWe examined neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> characteristics in five male patients with TBI. Speech fluency was assessed in three tasks. The new guideline for identifying <b>stuttering</b> and discriminating it from co-occurring speech and language deficiencies was created. ResultsWe found out that a) <b>stuttering</b> frequencies varied between different speech tasks, b) the most common <b>stuttering</b> type was repetition and c) the severity of <b>stuttering</b> increased linearly as the cognitive demands of the task increased and so did the types of <b>stuttering.</b> ConclusionMore {{research in the area of}} neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> is needed, especially for developing valid and reliable methods that take into account co-occurring speech and language deficiencies and communicative demands in various discourses...|$|R
5|$|Escaping Monarch {{during a}} time <b>stutter,</b> Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, {{students}} apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Coach Lumbly {{tells the}} debate team that Ginny has {{transferred}} to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his <b>stutter,</b> Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.|$|E
5|$|Rushing {{through the}} University, Jack {{narrowly}} rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a <b>stutter,</b> Jack reaches to unfreeze her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E
50|$|For a {{child that}} <b>stutters,</b> the focus of {{treatment}} to prevent the worsening of the condition, and families {{play an important role}} in the process. Successful elimination of mild <b>stuttering</b> is likely when treatment is initiated before four years of age. For those who have more advanced forms of <b>stuttering</b> and secondary behaviors, therapy is generally a variation or combination of two approaches: a fluency-shaping technique that replaces <b>stuttering</b> with controlled fluency, and <b>stuttering</b> modification therapy, which focuses on reducing the severity of <b>stuttering.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two omega-sequences are <b>stuttering</b> {{equivalent}} if {{they differ}} only by finite repetitions of elements. <b>Stuttering</b> equivalence {{is a fundamental}} concept {{in the theory of}} concurrent and distributed systems.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} finding that {{simultaneous}} interpreters have an increased number of stutter-like disfluencies in their speech when working through noise, the thesis sets out to explore {{the relationship between the}} <b>stutters</b> of normal speakers under stress and pathological <b>stuttering.</b> Since the conditions under which pathological <b>stuttering</b> can be suppressed, and in particular the absence of auditory feedback, appear to involve distraction from auditory feedback, it is hypothesised that attention to auditory feedback is important in pathological <b>stuttering.</b> The thesis is designed to determine whether this is also true of the <b>stutters</b> of normal speakers under stress, particularly interpreters. The role of stress is discussed in terms of its effects on attention deployment. It is proposed that the known attention narrowing effect of stress or high arousal may be operating to direct attention intermittently to auditory feedback in all types of <b>stuttering,</b> including delayed auditory feedback <b>stuttering.</b> Experiment 1 investigates the effect of reducing, amplifying, and delaying auditory feedback, and of speech tasks requiring different patterns of attention deployment, on the occurrence of <b>stutters.</b> The known effects of delayed auditory feedback are found. Interpreting elicits more <b>stutters</b> than shadowing, and a significant relationship is found between <b>stutters</b> and failures to attend to simultaneous task input. Experiment 2 is designed to elicit <b>stutters</b> in normal speakers by inducing anxiety and fluctuations of attention, using electric shocks and a divided-attention speech task. Anxiety does not increase <b>stutters,</b> hut {{there is some evidence that}} it increases attention to auditory feedback. The divided-attention task succeeds in increasing <b>stutters,</b> and a control condition of masked auditory feedback reduces <b>stutters.</b> It is concluded that attention to auditory feedback plays a role in the <b>stutters</b> of normal speakers, but only when attention is divided or fluctuating, and that these findings are consistent with the view that pathological and normal <b>stutters</b> are related...|$|R
25|$|With adult {{people who}} <b>stutter,</b> {{there is no}} known cure, though they may make partial {{recovery}} or even complete recovery with intervention. People who <b>stutter</b> often learn to <b>stutter</b> less severely, though others may make no progress with therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of a <b>stutter</b> {{is often not}} constant even for people who severely <b>stutter.</b> People who <b>stutter</b> commonly report dramatically decreased disfluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to pets, young children, or themselves. Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone, are often greatly feared by people who <b>stutter,</b> and increased stuttering is reported.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of differences in linguistic processing between people who <b>stutter</b> and {{people who do not}} <b>stutter.</b> Brain scans of adult people who <b>stutter</b> have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stuttering</b> is {{a complex}} speech disorder. There are two forms of stuttering: {{developmental}} <b>stuttering</b> and acquired <b>stuttering.</b> Developmental <b>stuttering</b> is a disorder of early childhood but acquired <b>stuttering</b> can develop at any age. Some medications can induce or deteriorate <b>stuttering</b> as an adverse effect. There are several reports of <b>stuttering</b> due to psychotropic drugs. Memantine, a glutamate antagonist used {{in the treatment of}} Alzheimer’s disease, has also been studied for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. This report presents deterioration of <b>stuttering</b> and speech problem in two children with autistic disorder who were receiving memantine. Based on our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} these adverse drug reactions have been attributed to memantine. In conclusion clinicians should consider that speech problems including <b>stuttering</b> may be due to the consumption of memantine, especially, in children may be a side effect of memantine especially in children...|$|R
5000|$|The {{individual}} now learns specific {{strategies to}} smooth out and minimize the moments of <b>stuttering.</b> The three most common strategies for altering the <b>stuttering</b> are cancellation, in which the person <b>stutters</b> {{all the way through}} a word, stops immediately, and then repeats the word <b>stuttering</b> a different way; pull-out, in which the person gains control over a moment of <b>stuttering</b> while it is happening and smooths it out; and preparatory set, in which the person prepares for a moment of <b>stuttering</b> before it happens, starts it gently and glides through it smoothly.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} for <b>stuttering</b> behaviors to return after <b>stuttering</b> modification therapy. While this type of therapy requires less effort that in fluency shaping, some concentration nonetheless needs to be applied. Moreover, a client that feels as if he has been cured of <b>stuttering</b> and stops doing the various exercises associated with the treatment may develop [...] "microstutters", which lead to the use of avoidance behaviors that increase the fear of <b>stuttering</b> further, which in turn leads to more severe <b>stuttering.</b> The main issue is that the fear of <b>stuttering</b> was not removed by therapy in the first place. If the microstutters were simply accepted as a reality, or if voluntary <b>stuttering</b> were used to prevent the development of new fears, the microstutters may occur but a relapse into severe <b>stuttering</b> may not.|$|R
25|$|Looney Tunes {{character}} Porky Pig has {{a notable}} <b>stutter,</b> which features {{in one of}} the character's most well-known catchphrases ("Th-th-th-that's all, folks!").

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, data on incidence, <b>stuttering</b> characteristics, co-occurring speech disorders, {{and recovery}} of neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> {{in a large}} sample of stroke participants were assessed. Following stroke onset, 17 of 319 participants (5. 3 %; 95 % CI, 3. 2 - 8. 3) met the criteria for neurogenic <b>stuttering.</b> <b>Stuttering</b> persisted in at least 2. 5 % (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 4. 7) {{for more than six}} months following the stroke. Participants with comorbid aphasia presented with a significantly higher frequency of <b>stuttering</b> compared to the group without aphasia (U= 13. 00, p((1 -tailed)) =. 02) but no difference was found for participants with co-occurring dysarthria and/or cognitive problems. Participants with neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> did not differ from those without <b>stuttering</b> in terms of stroke risk factors or stroke etiologic subtypes. Although the incidence of <b>stuttering</b> following stroke is lower than that for aphasia or dysarthria, these results show that clinicians should take neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> into account when assessing stroke participants' speech and language. LEARNING OUTCOMES: : Readers will be able to: (1) understand the need for systematic, prospective studies in neurogenic stuttering; (2) know the incidence and prevalence of neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> following stroke; and (3) know how neurogenic <b>stuttering</b> co-occurs with other speech-language disorders following stroke. status: publishe...|$|R
