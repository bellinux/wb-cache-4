40|$|How can the {{elongation}} {{measurement of}} the high volume instrument (HVI) be improved? A paper index card is clamped by the HVI breaker system and {{used to measure the}} system deflection as a function of load. This measured response is then used to correct the stress-strain response of cotton bundle breaks. The elongation of the cotton fibers {{at the peak of the}} curve is calculated from the corrected curve. A test group of 18 cottons was measured and compared to Mantis ® single-fiber data. The USDA crop samples from 1990 to 1994 were also measured using the modified HVI method, and the new results compared to standard HVI measurements. The modified analysis of the stress-strain curve based on the index card deflection produced a measurement for elongation that was more precise and had a lower standard deviation, compared to standard measurements on the HVI. Comparisons with simulated curves generated from Mantis® single-fiber data showed similar levels of elongation. However, both the modified HVI and Mantis® results were almost double <b>stelometer</b> elongation values. Correlations with <b>stelometer</b> data give a slope of approximately one with an offset of approximately 5 %. In all cases when measurements made on the 1990 to 1994 USDA crop samples were incorporated as predictors in yarn models, the new HVI elongation measurement proved to be a better predictor of yarn properties than were <b>stelometer</b> elongation data. Cotton fiber elongation (extensibility, elongation at breaking load) is one of the least utilized measurements from the high volume instrument (HVI) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the relationships among fiber linear density, tenacity, and structure is important to help cotton breeders modify varieties for enhanced fiber end-use qualities. This study employed the <b>Stelometer</b> instrument, which is the traditional fiber tenacity reference method and might still be an option as a rapid screening tool because of its low cost and portable attributes. In addition to flat bundle break force and weight variables from a routine <b>Stelometer</b> test, the number of fibers in the bundle were counted manually and the fiber crystallinity (CIIR) was characterized by the previously proposed attenuated total reflection-sampling device based Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) protocol. Based on the plots of either tenacity vs. linear density or fiber count vs. mass, the fibers were subjectively divided into fine or coarse sets, respectively. Relative to the distinctive increase in fiber tenacity with linear density, there was an unclear trend between the linear density and CIIR for these fibers. Samples with similar linear density were found to increase in tenacity with fiber CIIR. In general, Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) fineness increases with fiber linear density...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the relationship between cotton fiber strength (or tenacity) /elongation and structure is important to help cotton breeders modify varieties for enhanced end-use qualities. In this study, the <b>Stelometer</b> instru-ment was used to measure the bundle fiber tenacity and elongation properties of different cotton fibers. This instrument is the traditional fiber strength reference method and could be still preferred as a screening tool owing to its significant low cost and portability. Fiber crystallinity (CIIR) and maturity (MIR) were characterized by the previously proposed attenuated total reflection (ATR) -based Fourier transform infrared protocol that has microsampling capability and is suitable for the tiny <b>Stelometer</b> breakage specimens (2 5 mg), which cannot be readily analyzed by a conventional X-ray diffraction pattern. Relative to the distinctive increase in fiber tenacity with either CIIR or MIR for Pima fibers (Gossypium barbadense), there was an unclear trend between the two for Upland fibers (G. hirsutum). Although fiber elongation increases with elevated CIIR and MIR for Pima fibers, it generally decreases as CIIR and MIR increase for Upland fibers. Furthermore, small sets of Upland fibers with known varieties and growth areas were examined, and their responses to both CIIR and MIR are discussed briefly...|$|E
40|$|Mill {{modernization}} and global market require-ments necessitates the continual improvement of upland cotton, Gossypium hirustum L., cultivars. Recent focus by breeders {{is to create}} upland cotton with superior fiber quality that approaches pima cotton, Gossypium barbadense L. The objective {{of this study was}} to perform in-depth analysis of fi-bers produced by ‘FM 832 ’ and ‘MD 51 neOK ’ and their progeny, ‘MD 15 ’, that express transgressive segregation for fiber bundle strength. Results were generated via the <b>Stelometer,</b> Peyer AL 101, Fibro-graph, HVI™, AFIS, Favimat, Fiber Dimensional Analysis System (FDAS) 765, and miniature spin-ning.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{formulations}} with varying enzyme and chelator components is tested for flax fiber yield and properties using a recently developed enzyme retting system on Ariane flax grown as a winter crop in southeastern South Carolina. The levels of Viscozyme L, a commercial pectinase-rich enzyme mixture, and Mayoquest 200, a commercial chelator containing 38 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as tetrasodium salt, are varied. Enzyme retted flax straw is hand-carded and passed one time through a Shirley Analyzer for cleaning. The chelator level determines the fine fiber (i. e., Shirley cleaned) yield. Fiber strength measured by <b>Stelometer</b> is {{inversely proportional to}} enzyme level and not affected by chelator level. Fiber fineness measured by air flow methods is better with higher enzyme levels, and within enzyme levels the higher chelator levels tend to produce fibers with the highest degree of fineness. Relative cost calculations, taking into account fiber yield with costs of enzyme and chelators, {{provide a framework for}} determining retting efficiency and fiber quality. Results indicate that fiber properties can be tailored by enzyme or chelator levels. Further, commercial enzyme mixtures and chelators effectivel...|$|E
40|$|With {{the focus}} that short fiber content in cotton {{receives}} from textile mills, {{there is a}} need to improve the precision and accuracy of this measurement. In order to do this, it is neces-sary to understand the opportunities that exist to improve the measurement of short fiber. Since the Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) is the most widely recognized method for determining short fiber content in cotton, it is the focus of this study. Hand sortings of fibers were collected by length groups from three bales of upland cotton with micronaire values of 3. 7, 4. 3, and 5. 4. These fibers were tested for micronaire and strength by the Fibronaire and <b>Stelometer,</b> respectively, and then tested on AFIS to determine the lengths of the fibers ranging from 9. 53 mm to 25. 44 mm. Although short fibers were not present in a sample prior to testing on AFIS, the machine reported a short fiber content measurement. In addition, frictional properties and convolutions of individual fibers were determined by the RotorRing and by Favimat, respectively, for each sample. These tests indicated that the high micronaire cottons exhibited more convolutions than the low micronaire counterparts, and that the longer fibers exhibited higher frictional properties than shorter fibers. Short fiber content, fibers less than 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in) long, in cotton has a significant influence on the marketability, processing, and end-product quality of cotton. The accurate and precise measurement of short fiber content in a given cotton sample has been the goal of many research efforts (Zeidman et al., 1991). The American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) recognizes two methods for measuring short fiber content in cotton. The first is the Suter-Webb Array method (Alfre...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{elongation}} (ability {{to stretch}} before breaking) {{is one of}} the key components in determining overall yarn quality. Elongation in U. S. upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.) has remained largely neglected due to: absence of monetary incentives for growers to produce high elongation cotton; lack of research interests among breeders; and absence of a reliable fiber testing system for elongation. This study was conducted to determine the genetics of cotton fiber elongation via a diallel and generation means analysis (GMA). Findings from this study should lay the foundation for future breeding work in cotton fiber elongation. Of the seven distinctive upland parents used for the diallel study, general combining ability was far more prominent than specific combing ability for fiber elongation. Cultivar PSC 355 and Dever experimental line were the two parents identified as good combiners for fiber elongation in this study. The slight negative correlation between fiber elongation and strength remained true. Highly significant negative correlation was observed between fiber upper half mean length and elongation. Both <b>Stelometer</b> and HVI elongation measurements correlated well with values of 0. 85 and 0. 82 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. For the six families used in the GMA analysis, additive genetic control was prevalent over dominance effect. Based on the scaling test, no significant epistatic interaction was detected for fiber elongation. As expected, additive variance constituted a much larger portion of total genetic variation in fiber elongation than the dominance variance. On average, larger numbers of effective factor were identified in fiber elongation than all other fiber traits tested, suggesting that parents used in the GMA study are carrying different genetic materials/ loci for fiber elongation. Considerable gains in fiber elongation may be achieved by selectively crossing these materials in a pure-line breeding scheme while holding other important fiber traits constant...|$|E
