40|$|As {{business}} processes and information transactions {{have become an}} inextricably intertwined with the Web, the importance of assignment, registration, discovery, and maintenance of identifiers has increased.

In addition, many legacy <b>identifier</b> <b>systems</b> further complicate the landscape, making it difficult for content managers to select and deploy <b>identifier</b> <b>systems</b> that meet both the business case and long term information management objectives. This presentation will outline a model for evaluating identifier applications and the functional requirements of the systems necessary to support them.

40|$|Abstract: Mathematical {{models are}} often used in system {{identification}} applications. The dynamics of most sys-tems, however, change over time and the sources of these changes cannot always be directly determined or meas-ured. To maintain model accuracy, it is desirable to de-sign <b>system</b> <b>identifiers</b> that can adapt to these dynamical shifts. We use reinforcement learning to train an agent to recognize dynamical changes in a modeled system and to estimate new parameter values for the model. The subsequent actions of this agent are characterized as “moving ” the parameterized model on an optimal trajec-tory in model parameter space. It is found that this method is capable of quickly and accurately discerning the correct parameter values...|$|R
