25|$|Some {{of these}} sockets {{have one or}} more earth holes to allow 3-pin plugs. On {{properly}} wired circuits, the earth contact will be connected to earth. However, they cannot provide earthing to all types of plugs, {{as is the case}} of Schuko (which requires recessed sockets containing <b>side</b> <b>earthing</b> contacts) and French plugs (which require an earthing pin projecting from the socket).|$|E
50|$|Schuko sockets {{can accept}} two-pin {{unearthed}} Europlug (CEE 7/16) and CEE 7/17. Less safely, Schuko plugs can be inserted into many two-pin unearthed CEE 7/1 sockets and into some sockets {{with a different}} form of earth connection that will not mate with the earth contacts on the Schuko plug (e.g., some variants of the Danish socket). Many such sockets also lack the cavity required to prevent users from touching the pins whilst inserting the plug.The CEE 7/7 plug is a hybrid which includes both <b>side</b> <b>earthing</b> strips, as in CEE 7/4 Schuko, and an earthing socket, as in the CEE 7/6 plug. It can therefore achieve an earth contact with both CEE 7/3 (Schuko) and CEE 7/5 sockets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} earthing system for 230 kV substation and simulation for calculation of required parameters. In substation, earthing system is essential not only to provide the protection of people working or walking {{in the vicinity of}} earthed facilities and equipments against the danger of electric shock but also to maintain the proper function of the electrical system. By using proper conductor and electrode <b>side,</b> <b>earthing</b> system may be able to lightning effects. This paper is to provide information pertinent to safe earthing practices in AC substation design and to establish the safe limits of potential differences under normal and fault conditions. Standard equations are used in the design of earthing system to get desired parameters such as touch and step voltage criteria for safety, earth resistance, grid resistance, maximum grid current, minimum conductor size and electrode size, maximum fault current level and resistivity of soil. By selection the proper horizontal conductor size, vertical electrode size and soil resistivity, the best choice of the project for safety is performed. This paper mentions the calculation of the desired parameters which are simulated by MATLAB program. Some simulated results are evaluated. The goal {{of this paper is to}} be a safe earthing system for substations. Keywords—Safe earthing system, AC substation, MATLAB program...|$|E

Observations of the spiral plume are consistent with an orbital pole angle of anywhere from 0 to 16 degrees relative to the Earth, but a spectrographic observation suggest a significantly larger and therefore less dangerous angle of 30° - 40° (possibly as much as 45°).
