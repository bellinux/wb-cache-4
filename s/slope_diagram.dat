Agreement with the quasi-static balance is poor except for the low-beta values. Various reasons are possible to explain the different result from the expected curve from the quasi-static balance. For example, not waves but shocklets are being formed in the foreshock and the correlation sense remains positive irrespective of the value of beta, or the notion of the quasi-static balance needs to be extended to include kinetic or other effects such as temperature gradients or Landau damping. Magnetosonic-type low-frequency waves in the foreshock region are typically observed or recognized as 30 -s waves, 1 -Hz waves, shocklets, and SLAMS (short large-amplitude magnetic structures) (Greenstadt et al. 1995). It is considered that the initially transverse 30 -s waves with upstream propagation in the plasma frame become compressive under a refraction process. The compressive fluctuation results into steepening and low frequency steepened magnetosonic whistler modes can be formed (the so-called shocklets).|$|E

40|$|Background The central {{mission of}} every medical school is education, however most {{teachers}} {{have not received}} formal teacher training. Hence there is an expectation that faculty development (FD) with planned programmes to prepare faculty members for their role in teaching will be integral to medical school life. The widespread investment in FD is predicated {{on the belief that}} it enhances the effectiveness of teaching but the evidence is limited. Aim To carry out an in-depth exploration of FD in UK medical schools and evaluate the effectiveness of FD on teaching. The realist framework with its principle of explanatory causation was chosen to find out what works for whom in FD in what context, and why. This was an innovative use of the model in educational research. Methods A detailed literature review was carried out and combined with the researchers experience and insight of FD to develop eight realist hypotheses in the form of contexts, mechanisms and outcomes (CMO). Data that would support, modify or challenge the hypotheses were then collected in three phases. Phase I was a review and scoring of data on medical school FD webpages using a webpage scoring index. Phase II was observation and informal interviews of two cohorts of educators attending a FD course followed by detailed interviews of 12 educators (six from each cohort) six months later. Phase III was interview of FD coordinators and educators at eight medical schools. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Data analysis Quantitative data were analysed by descriptive methods, <b>slope</b> <b>diagrams,</b> bi-axial constructs and statistical analysis with Fisher’s exact test. Qualitative data were analysed by categorising and connecting strategies followed by summarising the relevant data under each hypothesis to check if the hypothesis was supported, modified or refuted. Findings The literature review revealed a paucity of publications on FD in the UK, however the 30 medical schools webpages reviewed showed data on FD activities. Data from all three phases were used to identify and explain the contexts (participatory approach/reflective practice, needs identification, supportive setting and standardization of medical teaching) that facilitated FD mechanisms (engagement, motivation, positive perception and professionalization). These led to the outcomes of improved confidence, competence, credibility and career progression. Conclusion Four realist theories of FD were identified (engagement, motivation, positive perception and professionalization) confirming the effectiveness of FD both in the short and long term and important recommendations for all FD stakeholders (educators, FD developers, universities and policy makers). In addition, I also made recommendations for future medical education researchers who choose the realist evaluation model...|$|R

Tie line slopes and the critical tie line have to be taken into consideration to select the active matter as well as its concentration and to predict the dominant recovery mechanism in sand column experiments. The sand column experiments quantified the recovery efficiency of each solution and identified the proportion of the recovery mechanisms (mobilisation vs. solubilisation). Washing solutions with an active matter concentration above the critical tie line caused dominating mobilisation. Mobilisation was also dominant when the active matter of the washing solution partitioned into the organic phase and the active matter concentration was below the critical tie line. Solubilisation and emulsification were dominant for washing solutions containing active matter, which principally partitioned into the aqueous phase and an active matter concentration below the critical tie line.

The distributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to extinction levels of A_K 7 (A_V 59 mag). Consequently, {{there appears to be no}} significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B 59 line of sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinction coefficients A_λ/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from the simple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, and agrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total to selective absorption R_V= 5. 5 and a grain size distribution favoring larger grains than those in the diffuse ISM.

The weldments with and without incomplete joint penetration (UP) were fatigue tested under constant amplitude axial loading for stress ratios of R = 0 and - 1. For the same applied stress amplitude, {{it was found that}} the fatigue life of weldments under R = - 1 is significant longer than under R = 0 due crack closure effects. The fatigue life of the weldments containing IJP was almost entirely devoted to crack gowth, while crack nucleation (and early growth) was found to be much more important for the butt weldments without IJP. It was found that the fatigue strength of the 5 mm weldments without IJP was not greater than that of t he 25 mm weldments without IJP as would have been expected for smaller size weldments. Estimates of angular distortions and calculations of induced bending stresses suggest that the performance of the 5 mm weldments is more affected by the bending stresses induced by weld distortions.

The pressure of main transition increased linearly with an increase in temperature. Extrapolation of temperature (T) -pressure (P) phase boundary to ambient pressure suggests the temperature of the main transition to be − 40. 3 °C, which has never been found by the DSC method. On the other hand, the temperature of LC/Lα phase transition in 50 % aqueous ethylene glycol was found to be − 12. 0 °C at ambient pressure. The main transition temperatures for DSPC, SOPC and DOPC are 55. 6, 6. 7 and − 40. 3 °C, respectively, at ambient pressure. The substitution of cis unsaturated chain for saturated chains of DSPC brings about the depression of the main transition temperature by about 48 (± 1) °C for each chain. The volume changes (ΔV) associated with the transitions were calculated from the transition enthalpy (ΔH) and the <b>slope</b> of T-P <b>diagram</b> (dT/dP) by means of the Clapeyron-Clausius equation. The value of ΔV for the main transition of SOPC bilayer membranes was reduced to half the volume change for DSPC bilayers, which means the introduction of the cis double bond in the acyl chain of lipids brings about the reduction of ΔV because of the disordered packing of unsaturated chains in the gel phase of lipid bilayer membranes...|$|R
