40|$|We present analytical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} investigations of electromagnetic resonant modes of a compact monofilar Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>resonator</b> shaped in a ring, with no central part. Planar spiral resonators are interesting as components of metamaterials for their compact deep-subwavelength size. Such resonators couple {{primarily to the}} magnetic field component of the incident electromagnetic wave, offering properties suitable for magnetic meta-atoms. Surprisingly, the relative frequencies of the resonant modes follow the sequence of the odd numbers, despite the nearly identical boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields at the extremities of the resonator. In order to explain the observed spectrum of resonant modes, we show that the current distribution inside the spiral satisfies a particular Carleman type singular integral equation. By solving this equation, we obtain a set of resonant frequencies. The analytically calculated resonance frequencies and the current distributions are in good agreement with experimental data {{and the results of}} numerical simulations.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} depth {{analysis}} of the inductive power transfer (or wireless power transfer, WPT) along a metamaterial composed of cells arranged in a planar configuration, in order to deliver power to a receiver sliding on them. In this way, the problem of the efficiency strongly affected by the weak coupling between emitter and receiver can be obviated, and the distance of transmission can significantly be increased. This study is made using a circuital approach and the magnetoinductive wave (MIW) theory, in order to simply explain the behavior of the transmission coefficient and efficiency from the circuital and experimental point of view. Moreover, flat <b>spiral</b> <b>resonators</b> are used as metamaterial cells, particularly indicated in literature for WPT metamaterials operating at MHz frequencies (5 - 30 MHz).
