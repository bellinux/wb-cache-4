40|$|Scania's modular {{production}} system {{makes a lot}} of adjustments possible, while costs for product development, production and spare parts are kept low. One of Scania's modular systems was the one for welded crossmembers. Scania uses a casted crossmember in their trailer truck for 4 x 2 chassis with air suspension. Because of the relatively high production costs for the casted crossmember a welded crossmember has been designed earlier on Scania. The design of the welded crossmember was not complete because it missed solutions for attachment of valves. This project was in collaboration between Scania in Södertälje and Ferruform in Luleå. The design of the crossmember was carried out in Södertälje and the production part of the project was carried out in Luleå. The goal of the project was to design a modular crossmember program for welded crossmembers and to suggest production line for the beams. Crossmembers with similar production operations were analyzed to minimize production costs. The welded air <b>suspension</b> <b>beam</b> should be fully designed. The beams studied were all closed, welded crossmembers which required production operations of pressing, welding and machining. The beams studied were air <b>suspension</b> <b>beam</b> of 4 x 2 chassis frame, GB-tipperbeam and two different endbeams. None of the beams could directly be combined because the stiffness differed too much, however the beams could be redesigned to facilitate the production. Three new air suspension beams and two new GB-tipper beams was designed and the strength of the welds were studied using Finite element analysis for the current load cases. The results showed that the stresses in both air <b>suspension</b> <b>beam</b> and GB-tipperbalken decreased with the new design. A proposal for a production line for welded crossmembers was developed with production operations, cutting, pressing, welding, machining, finishing and assembly. To manage the entire flow of crossmembers three NCmachines were needed and one laser machines. Calculations showed that the air <b>suspension</b> <b>beam</b> would lower the cost with 222 SEK/beam with the welded design. Validerat; 20110203 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Variations in {{micromachining}} processes cause submi-cron {{differences in}} the size of MEMS devices, which leads to fre-quency scatter in resonators. A new method of compensating for fabrication process variations is to add material to MEMS struc-tures by the selective deposition of polysilicon. It is performed by electrically heating the MEMS in a 25 C silane environment to activate the local decomposition of the gas. On a (1 0 1 5 100) m 3, clamped-clamped, polysilicon beam, at a power dissi-pation of 2. 38 mW (peak temperature of 699 C), a new layer of polysilicon (up to 1 m thick) was deposited in 10 min. The depo-sition rate was three times faster than conventional LPCVD rates for polysilicon. When selective polysilicon deposition (SPD) was applied to the frequency tuning of specially-designed, comb-drive resonators, a correlation was found between the change in reso-nant frequency and the length of the newly deposited material (the hotspot) on the resonator’s suspension beams. A second correlation linked the length of the hotspot to the magnitude of the power fluc-tuation during the deposition trial. In one sample, at a power dissi-pation of 10. 7 mW (peak temperature of 800 C), the cross section of a <b>suspension</b> <b>beam</b> increased from 6 to 9. 4 m 2 in 15 min. The resonant frequency increased 1. 96 % from its initial value of 86. 6 kHz. This change was in good agreement with the value of 2. 2 % predicted in a simulation. The mechanisms for changing resonant frequency by the SPD process include increasing mass and stiff-ness and altering residual stress. The effects of localized heating are presented. The experiments and simulations in this work yield guidelines for tuning resonators to a target frequency.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{trends of}} product miniaturisation and increased part complexity {{have led to}} a requirement for highly accurate coordinate metrology, suitable for small parts. Coordinate metrology of such parts is performed on a micro-coordinate measurement machine (micro-CMMs), for which a specialised micro-scale probing system is required. These probing systems consist of a probe onto which a stylus is mounted. The probe provides significant flexibility allowing the stylus tip to be easily deflected during contact with a surface. Achieving an optimum stiffness for the probe represents a significant design challenge, and often leads to undesirable compromises. For example, as stylus tip size reduces the contact pressure for a given load increases, requiring the probe stiffness to be kept as low as possible to prevent damage to the part surface; however, for a more robust probing system the stiffness should be increased. This thesis presents an improved tactile micro-probing system that makes use of an active suspension structure that can be tuned to have either low or high stiffness as required for each phase of a measurement. Development of the probe includes analytical and numerical modelling for a range of solutions as well as empirical investigations into the manufacture of a smart suspension structure for a prototype probing system.

In principle stiffness may be reduced down to zero at the point of beam buckling. It is also shown that such a probing system can provide isotropic stiffness for a range of different styli lengths.

40|$|One of {{the major}} trends in todays microelectronic {{industry}} is adding more and more functionality into electronic devices without compromising their size, performance and manufacturing costs. Usually, this is done by merging various components into one single chip. A very good example is the integrated miniaturized electromechanical micro devices technology, based on micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS). MEMS are replacing conventional devices {{and can be used}} as actuators and sensors {{with a wide variety of}} applications in health care, automotive, and the military. However, the successful commercialization of this technology is still hindered by the reliability of the devices. Stiction as one of the most significant reliability concerns is still a major barrier to achieve a high manufacturing yield and a reliable device performance. This thesis focuses on in-use stiction of polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) MEMS. The experiments were conducted on an electrostatically actuated torsional micromirror array. The obtained results pointed out that the micromirrors were capable of performing their designed function but with very poor reliability. It is shown that the main cause of failure is in-use stiction due to various surface adhesion forces. They either cause permanent stiction or an anomalous shifting of the pull-in window of the micromirrors. The shift of the pull-in window is used as an indication of the amount of mirror-to-electrode stiction. The influence of different geometrical designs on stiction has been studied. This includes the effect of the length of the hinge, the size of the micromirror and the height of the gap of the micromirror array. Furthermore, the impact of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on the micromirror stiction has been studied inside an environmental controlled chamber. The magnitude of the adhesion force is found to be in the order of 0 - 150 nN which is quantitatively determined using analytical and finite element methods for different sizes of the micromirrors. It should be noted that the accuracy of the determination of the adhesion force in a micromirror highly depends on how accurate the model is. In practice, the measured results will also be influenced by process variations. To overcome these limitations, a novel device is designed and fabricated. It can perform pull-off force measurements as an atomic force microscope (AFM). With this device, we have determined the magnitude of the van der Waals force and capillary force, respectively. I was shown that the total adhesion force shows a weak scale dependence on the apparent contact area. The maximum applied contact force does not affect the adhesion force which is explained by the fully elastic deformation between the contacting poly-SiGe surfaces. The impact of packaging outgassing on MEMS stiction has been studied. We reported for the first time the use of the micromirror array as a stiction sensor to investigate the glass frit outgassing induced stiction. Surface analysis shows that lead and carbon outgassing from the glass frit at high temperature can contaminate surfaces of the MEMS and increase the adhesion force of by 75 - 125 nN which is sufficient to induce stiction failures. Reducing the impact of the stiction in poly-SiGe MEMS devices has been realized in two approaches. In the first approach the intrinsic mechanical robustness of MEMS devices is improved through optimizing the geometrical dimensions, which hinders the influence of the adhesion relatively. In the second approach, the stiction reduction in poly-SiGe MEMS has been achieved by applying a self-assembled monolayers (SAM). Three different kinds of SAMs have been applied and compared on top of a poly-SiGe surface as an anti-stiction coating. The effect of a FDTS (perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane) SAM coating applied via vapor-phase process has been studied on both the micromirror array and the dedicated stiction devices. In conclusion, the stiction threat will eventually exist between two surfaces in MEMS devices. However, it surely can be reduced or overcome by a combination of optimized design, good surface treatment and a reliable hermetic package based on a more comprehensive understanding of stiction and adhesion. The importance of the stiction to device reliability will become more and more significant as we scale down MEMS continually.

40|$|Abstract — Microelectromechanical filters {{based on}} coupled lateral microresonators are demonstrated. This {{new class of}} {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) has potential signal-processing applications for filters which require narrow band-width (high Q), good signal-to-noise ratio, and stable temperature and aging characteristics. Microfilters {{presented in this paper}} are made by surface-micromachining technologies and tested by using an off-chip modulation technique. The frequency range of these filters is from approximately 5 kHz to on the order of 1 MHz for polysilicon microstructures with <b>suspension</b> <b>beams</b> having a 2 -m-square cross section. A series-coupled resonator pair, designed for operation at atmospheric pressure, has a measured center frequency of 18. 7 kHz and a pass bandwidth of 1. 2 kHz. A planar hermetic sealing process has been developed to enable high-quality factors for these mechanical filters and make possible wafer-level vacuum encapsulations. This process uses a low-stress silicon nitride shell for vacuum sealing, and experimental results show that a measured quality factor of 2200 for comb-shape microresonators can be achieved.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new z-axis high-sensitivity silicon-micromachined capacitive accelerometer fabricated us-ing a three-mask dissolved-wafer process (DWP). It employs capacitive sensing using overlap-area variations between comb electrodes and a torsional suspension system to provide high sensitivity without compromising bandwidth, full-scale range, or the pull-in voltage ceiling. Excellent electrical sensitivity is obtained by using high-aspect-ratio comb fingers with narrow air gaps of 2 m {{and a large}} overlap area of 12 m 300 m. Torsional <b>suspension</b> <b>beams</b> 150 m long with a cross-sectional area of 12 m 3 m are used to improve the mechani-cal gain. Simulations of the capacitance between sense fingers show a highly linear region over a wide 14 -m tip deflection range. Accelerometers were fabricated and yielded sensitivities of 263 – 300 mV/g, a nonlinearity less than 0. 2 % over a range of 4 to + 3 g, a full-scale range of 4 to + 6 g, and pull-in voltages greater than 8 V. A 3 -dB cutoff frequency of 35 Hz was measured in air. The calculated thermomechanical noise in the sensor is 0. 28 mg over this bandwidth.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{heterogeneous}} characterization of a MEMS electrodynamic micro-speaker. This MEMS micro-speaker consists of an optimized silicon structure based on a very light but very stiff membrane. The mobile part is suspended using soft <b>suspension</b> <b>beams,</b> also made of silicon, which enable large out-of-plane displacement. The electromagnetic motor is composed of a micro-assembly permanent ring magnet and of a deposit mobile planar coil fixed {{on the top of}} the silicon membrane. Previous publications have presented the MEMS as theoretically able to produce high fidelity and high efficiency over a wide bandwidth. The present study intends to validate the electrical, the mechanical and the acoustic performance improvements. The characterization of the microfabricated micro-speaker showed that the electric impedance is flat over the entire audio bandwidth. Some results validates the performance improvements in terms of audio quality as compared to state of the art of the MEMS micro-speakers, such as the high out-of-plane membrane displacement over ± 400 µm, the 80 dB SPL sound pressure level at 10 cm, the 2 % maximal distortion level, and the useful bandwidth from 335 Hz to cutoff frequency...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{analytically}} and numerically {{the spring}} softening and hardening phenomena {{that occur in}} electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical systems comb drive resonators utilizing folded <b>suspension</b> <b>beams.</b> An analytical expression for the electrostatic force generated between the combs of the rotor and the stator is derived and takes into account both the transverse and longitudinal capacitances present. After formulating the problem, the resulting stiff differential equations are solved analytically using the method of multiple scales, and a closed-form solution is obtained. Furthermore, the nonlinear boundary value problem that describes the dynamics of inextensional spring beams is solved using straightforward perturbation to obtain the linear and nonlinear spring constants of the beam. The analytical solution is verified numerically using a Matlab/Simulink environment, and the results from both analyses exhibit excellent agreement. Stability analysis based on phase plane trajectory is also presented and fully explains previously reported empirical results that lacked sufficient theoretical description. Finally, the proposed solutions are, once again, verified with previously published measurement results. The closed-form solutions provided are easy to apply and enable predicting the actual behavior of resonators and gyroscopes with similar structures. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for 3 D {{microfabrication}} with LIGA process that utilizes a deep X-ray mask {{in which a}} microactuator is integrated. The integrated microactuator oscillates the X-ray absorber, which is formed on the shuttle mass of the microactuator, during the X-ray exposures to modify the absorbed dose profile in X-ray resist, typically PMMA. The 3 D PMMA microstructures according to the modulated dose contour are revealed after GG development. An X-ray mask with integrated comb drive actuator is fabricated using deep reactive ion etching, absorber electroplating, and bulk micromachining with silicon-on-insulator wafer.
