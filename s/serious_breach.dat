5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E

25|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh War {{ended with}} a ceasefire {{agreement}} between the warring parties that came into effect on 12 May 1994. However, since then Azerbaijan and Armenia have reported over 7,000 breaches of the ceasefire; more than 100 breaches of the ceasefire and 12 Azerbaijani soldiers {{had been killed in}} 2015 alone.

40|$|The International Law Commission's {{decision}} to maintain Articles 40 and 41 {{is based on}} the conviction that <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms entail specific legal consequences within the field of state responsibility. Among these consequences, it is possible to distinguish between (i) specific obligations binding on other states, (ii) specific rights of other states and (iii) specific obligations of the responsible state. This article critically assesses whether international law recognizes specific consequences falling within the third of these categories. It discusses six prominent candidates suggested in international practice, literature, and the work of the ILC - such as the obligations to provide assurances of repetition, to pay punitive or exemplary damages or to prosecute individual perpetrators of serious wrongful acts. The article concludes that none of these candidates qualifies as a specific consequence of <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms — partly because the alleged specific obligation has not been recognized in international law, and partly because it equally applies to internationally wrongful acts that do not constitute <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> in the sense of Article 40. It follows that international law at present does not impose specific obligations on states responsible for <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> of peremptory norms. This in turn raises doubts as to the viability of the distinction between <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> and ordinary wrongful acts...|$|R

Hamas blamed Israel for not lifting the Gaza Strip blockade, and for an Israeli raid on a purported tunnel, crossing the border into the Gaza Strip from Israel on November 4, which it held constituted a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of the truce. Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce citing the frequent rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities.|$|E

Eight people were rescued by local Fire and Emergency services, and the A4077 road between Crickhowell and Gilwern was closed, for a period which {{was expected to be}} several weeks. Two families were provided with temporary accommodation, and twenty-three hire boats were also affected with cranes being brought in to help them back to their bases.|$|E
25|$|Hampden {{was one of}} {{the eight}} {{managers}} of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by impeachment rather than by attainder, which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard {{as in the case of}} an impeachment, and thus a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.|$|E

25|$|In January 1946 Browder began {{publishing}} a mimeographed weekly newsletter of economic analysis called Distributors Guide — Economic Analysis: A Service for Policy Makers. The subscription price was hefty — $100 per year; {{he wanted to}} gain a readership among business executives and political decision-makers. Browder produced a total of 16 issues, each based on his vision of Soviet-American cooperation, {{as opposed to the}} unfolding Cold War between the powers. The Communist Party regarded his independent publication as further evidence of a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of party discipline. On February 5, 1946, Earl Browder was expelled from membership in the CPUSA.|$|E
25|$|Following the Twitter outburst, Mascarenhas {{was banned}} for 14 {{days at the}} start of the 2011 season. Mascarenhas has apologised unreservedly for his actions. He was fined £1000 by Hampshire and £500 by the ECB. The panel {{considered}} this to be a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of the regulations, particularly given his status as a senior cricketer and club captain. Mascarenhas also stated that he tweeted this after a night out and his actions were stupid and irresponsible and that he regretted any offence it may have caused and that his tweet didn't reflect his true views on Miller.|$|E
25|$|After {{achieving}} {{independence from}} the Iberian crowns {{in the early nineteenth}} century, Argentina and Brazil inherited a series of unresolved territorial disputes from their colonial powers. The most <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> in the relationship was the Cisplatine War (18251828), led by the Brazilian invasion and annexation of the Banda Oriental. Despite the numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine–Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition on many levels, and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but the Brazilian economic rise in the 1980s led to the accommodation of Argentina as a secondary regional power and increasing cooperation.|$|E

25|$|The {{siege of}} Lal Masjid was one the <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> in the {{conflict}} and escalated {{the conflict in the}} summer of 2007. On 3July 2007, the militant supporters of Lal Masjid and the Pakistan police clashed in Islamabad after the students from the mosque attacked and stoned the nearby MoE secretariat. Their resultant faceoff with the military escalated, despite the intervention of then-ruling PML(Q) leaders Shuja'at Hussain and Ijaz-ul-Haq. The Pakistan police, aided by the Pakistan Army Rangers immediately put up a siege around the mosque complex which lasted until 11 July and resulted in 108 deaths. This represented the main catalyst for the conflict and eventual breakdown of the truce that existed between Pakistan and the Taliban groups. Already during the siege, there were several attacks in Waziristan in retaliation for the siege.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} {{heard in the}} Federal Court of Australia. Besanko J held {{that there was an}} implied term of mutual trust and {{confidence}} in the contract which operated only where a party did not have reasonable and proper cause for his conduct and the conduct was likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence, applying the decision in Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA. The Bank had committed a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> of its policies and that was a breach of the implied term. The Court dismissed Mr Barker's claims that the policies were incorporated into his contract and that the Bank had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. The court awarded damages assessed at $317,500, based upon discounted past and future economic loss.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} {{choosing}} Partridge for this role is unclear. Although he was, by then, {{one of the}} more eminent British surgeons, he never achieved the fame of his colleague, Sir William Fergusson. The Royal College of Surgeons' biography characterises him as 'a painstaking but not a brilliant surgeon; minute in detail and hesitating in execution'. More importantly, he had no experience with gunshot injuries. The contemporary medical press attacked the mission for its <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> in medical etiquette in presuming to consult on a patient without having been invited to do so by the attending medical practitioners. It amounted to patient stealing, and was an affront to the dignity of the profession (newly self-regulating since the creation of the General Medical Council in 1858). The Lancet was also scathing about the 'new manifestation of the proverbial insular pride which is ever insisting upon the immense superiority of everything British'.|$|E
25|$|Owain and Cadwaladr came to blows in 1143 when Cadwaladr was {{implicated in}} the murder of Prince Anarawd ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth, Owain's ally and future son-in-law, on the eve of Anarawd's wedding to Owain's daughter. Owain {{followed}} a diplomatic policy of binding other Welsh rulers to Gwynedd through dynastic marriages, and Cadwaladr's border dispute and murder of Anarawd threatened Owain's efforts and credibility. As ruler of Gwynedd, Owain stripped Cadwaladr of his lands, with Owain's son Hywel dispatched to Ceredigion, where he burned Cadwaladr's castle at Aberystwyth. Cadwaladr fled to Ireland and hired a Norse fleet from Dublin, bringing the fleet to Abermenai to compel Owain to reinstate him. Taking advantage of the brotherly strife, and perhaps with the tacit understanding of Cadwaladr, the marcher lords mounted incursions into Wales. Realizing the wider ramifications of the war before him, Owain and Cadwaladr came to terms and reconciled, with Cadwaladr restored to his lands. Peace between the brothers held until 1147, when an unrecorded event occurred which led Owain's sons Hywel and Cynan to drive Cadwaladr out of Meirionydd and Ceredigon, with Cadwaladr retreating to Môn. Again an accord was reached, with Cadwaladr retaining Aberffraw until a more <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> occurred in 1153, when he was forced into exile in England, where his wife was the sister of Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Hertford and the niece of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester.|$|E
