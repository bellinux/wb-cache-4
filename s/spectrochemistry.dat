40|$|In <b>spectrochemistry,</b> various plasma {{sources are}} used for the {{analysis}} of samples. The simplest way to characterise these plasma sources is to determine the absolute intensities of several atomic lines of the main plasma gas (argon or helium). From these measurements absolute population densities of excited states can be deduced and, via a so-called Boltzmann plot, the electron temperature Te and density ne. This method works quite well as long as the plasma is relatively close to equilibrium. The reason why spectrochemical plasmas can show strong deviations from equilibrium will be discussed. An other limitation of emission spectroscopy is the lack of accurate transition probabilities for transitions from highly excited states. For argon 15 of these probabilities have been determined with an uncertainty of ± 25 %...|$|E

Liquid introduction in general and flow injection specifically are the most widely used sample introduction methods for inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Nevertheless, problems persist in determination of analytes that are commonly investigated, as well as in specialty applications for those seldom considered by most analysts. Understanding the chemistry that is common to different groups of analytes permits the development of successful approaches to rinse-out and elimination of memory effects.

40|$|The mysterious {{flashes of}} light communicated by fireflies conceal a rich and {{exciting}} solution <b>spectrochemistry</b> that revolves around the chemiexcitation and photodecay of the fluorophore, oxyluciferin. A triple chemical equilibrium by double deprotonation and keto-enol tautomerism turns this simple molecule into an intricate case where the relative spectral contributions of six chemical species combine over a physiologically relevant pH range, rendering physical isolation and spectral characterization {{of most of the}} species unmanageable. To disentangle the individual spectral contributors, here we demonstrate the advantage of chemical oriented multivariate data analysis. We designed a set of specific oxyluciferin derivatives and applied a multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) procedure simultaneously to an extensive set of pH-dependent spectroscopic data for oxyluciferin and the target derivatives. The analysis provided, for the first time, the spectra of the pure individual components free of contributions from the other forms, their pH-dependent profiles and distributions, and the most accurate to date values for the three equilibrium constants...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{study of}} the {{mechanism}} of breakdown of w-phenyl-substituted fatty acids by Nocardia opaca has been made. Acids with an odd number of carbon atoms in the side chain (phenylpropionic, phenylvaleric and phenylheptylic acids) were converted to benzoic acid, and cinnamic acid was an intermediate. o-Hydroxy-phenylacetic acid {{was identified as a}} common product when acids with an even number of carbon atoms (phenylacetic, phenylbutyric, phenylcaproic and phenyl-caprylic) were used. This evidence supports / 3 -oxidation as a mechanism of break-down of short chain fatty acids by N. opaca. It was shown that Nocardia opaca would grow {{on a wide range of}} saturated aliphatic fatty acids as sole carbon and energy source (Webley, 1954), and that washed suspensions of glucose grown cells gave enhanced oxygen uptake in the presence of these acids (Webley & DeKock, 1952). The mechanism by which acid-fast organisms attack fatty acids is, a t present, unknown. In the present work the metabolism of o-phenyl-substituted fatty acids by N. opaca has been studied and the results are in favour of P-oxidation of the short chain fatty acids by this organism.

40|$|The color {{variations}} of light emitted by some natural and mutant luciferases are normally attributed to collective factors {{referred to as}} microenvironment effects; however, {{the exact nature of}} these interactions between the emitting molecule (oxyluciferin) and the active site remains elusive. Although model studies of noncomplexed oxyluciferin and its variants have greatly advanced the understanding of its photochemistry, extrapolation of the conclusions to the real system requires assumptions about the polarity and proticity of the active site. To decipher the intricate excited-state dynamics, global and target analysis is performed {{here for the first time}} on the steady-state and time-resolved spectra of firefly oxyluciferin complexed with luciferase from the Japanese firefly (Luciola cruciata). The experimental steady-state and time resolved luminescence spectra of the oxyluciferin/luciferase complex in solution are compared with the broadband time-resolved firefly bioluminescence recorded in vivo. The results demonstrate that de-excitation of the luminophore results in a complex cascade of photoinduced proton transfer processes and can be interpreted by the pH dependence of the emitted light. It is confirmed that proton transfer is the central event in the <b>spectrochemistry</b> of this system for which any assignment of the pH dependent emission to a single chemical species would be an oversimplification...|$|E
40|$|The CRPG {{is located}} in Nancy in eastern France, a region that in the nineteenth and {{first half of the}} twentieth centuries was {{providing}} France with almost all its coal and iron resources. This industrial activity led to the opening of the French engineering school of geology (Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Géologie-ENSG), to train the required leaders in industry. An outgrowth of the ENSG, the Centre de Recherches Pétrographiques et Géochimiques (CRPG), was created in 1953 as a laboratory of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) with a mandate to develop research in geochemistry and petrology, and to provide analytical and research expertise for French geologists in ore exploration around the world. The CRPG is now the central research focus of a strong environment of teaching and research in geology that includes five different research laboratories associated with the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL) and also the Université Henri Poincaré of Nancy, involving more than 250 CNRS researchers, university scientists, engineers and technicians. Early pioneering work in <b>spectrochemistry</b> by Kuppusami Govindaraju set the scene for a research specialisation in analytical geochemistry.

40|$|Radical cations of a heptathienoacene a,b-substituted {{with four}} n-decyl side groups (D 4 T 7 C+) form {{exceptionally}} stable p-dimer dications already {{at ambient temperature}} (Chem. Comm. 2011, 47, 12622). This extraordinary p-dimerization process is investigated here {{with a focus on}} the ultimate[D 4 T 7 C+] 2 p-dimer dication and yet-unreported transitoryspecies formed during and after the oxidation. To this end, we use a joint experimental and theoretical approach that combines cyclic voltammetry, in situ <b>spectrochemistry</b> and spectroelectrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. The impact of temperature, thienoacene concentration, and the nature and concentration of counteranions on the p-dimerization process is also investigated in detail. Two different transitory species were detected {{in the course of the}} one-electron oxidation: 1) a different transient conformation of the ultimate [D 4 T 7 C+] 2 p-dimer dications, the stability of which is strongly affected by the applied experimental conditions, and 2) intermediate [D 4 T 7] 2 C+ p-dimer radical cations formed prior to the fully oxidized [D 4 T 7] 2 C+ p-dimer dications. Thus, this comprehensive work demonstrates the formation of peculiar supramolecular species of heptathienoacene radical cations, the stability, nature, and structure of which have been successfully analyzed. We therefore believe that this study leads to a deeper fundamental understanding of the mechanism of dimer formation between conjugated aromatic systems...|$|E
40|$|Methods for the {{determination}} of trace elements in environmental and biological samples were developed and optimized. Parameters affecting sample introduction efficiency, matrix effects, sample throughput and tolerance to interfering species were evaluated for methods based on plasma <b>spectrochemistry</b> and electrochemistry. ^ A method was developed for {{the determination}} of copper {{in the presence of}} β- 2 -microglobulin. A mass balance of copper was performed at the end of in vitro incubations which required method development to quantify copper in the liquid and solid portions of the incubation solutions, along with copper adsorbed and mass transferred into the walls of the incubation vessel. A flow injection method was developed to accommodate the small sample volume and high dissolved solids content to allow for {{the determination of}} copper by ICP-MS. ^ A commercial introduction system was evaluated for the determination of trace elements in drinking waters and wastewaters by ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Parameters including increased throughput, reduced memory effects, increased stability and lower reagent consumption were evaluated as the system was successfully applied to U. S. EPA Methods 200. 8 and 200. 7, respectively. Particular attention was paid to the retention of mercury and sodium and long term stability during the analysis of samples containing high total dissolved salts. Results obtained with the new introduction system were compliant with EPA Methods 200. 8 and 200. 7 while increasing sample throughput two- or three-fold and significantly reducing memory effects. ^ A method was developed for the enhancement of signals for trace elemental analysis by DRC-ICP-MS. Signal enhancement was evaluated as instrumental and reaction gas parameters were optimized. Background noise levels remained relatively unchanged as signal intensities were improved, resulting in improved signal to noise ratios. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of gold in synthetic geological samples. ^ A method was developed for the preconcentration and speciation of arsenic by anodic stripping voltammetry using ion exchange resins. Ion exchange and instrument parameters were optimized. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) in waters without interference from problematic species such as Cu(II). Suitable detection limits were obtained and the method was validated using a certified reference material. ...|$|E
