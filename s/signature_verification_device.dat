This paper aims at realizing a system of signature verification using single electron transistors. Single electron transistors can be used as binary decision devices to create logic gates, flip-flops etc. These logic circuit components will be employed to realize a signature verification system. The advantage of single electron transistor is its compact size and low power requirement. Also, single electron transistors have a much faster switching speed. Hence, SETs can be said to be the electronic equipments of the future. Their application in an offline <b>signature</b> <b>verification</b> <b>device</b> would help create a system that is fast, robust and low power consuming.

40|$|Abstract- The <b>signature</b> {{identification}} or <b>verification,</b> means where "identification " implies matching a user signature {{against a}} signature {{associated with the}} identity that the user claim. Biometrics can be classified into two types Behavioral (<b>signature</b> <b>verification,</b> keystroke dynamics, etc.) and Physiological (iris characteristics, fingerprint, etc.). Signature and Finger Print verifications are most widely used personal verifications and {{are one of the}} first few biometrics used even before computers. <b>Signature</b> <b>verification</b> is widely studied and discussed using two approaches. On-line approach and offline approach. Online <b>signature</b> <b>verification</b> represents the dynamic information related to signature which is captured at the time when signature made. The offline <b>signature</b> <b>verification</b> represents the static information of signature. Offline systems are more applicable and easy to use in comparison with on-line systems {{in many parts of the}} world however it is considered more difficult than on-line verification due to the lack of dynamic information. This paper presents about offline Signature identification method that had more attraction in recent years because of its necessity for use in daily life routines and when the signature needs to be immediately verified like bank checks, Security for Commercial Transactions, Cheque Authentication, attendance etc. In this paper we present, features types and recent methods used for features extraction in offline <b>signature</b> <b>verification</b> systems.
