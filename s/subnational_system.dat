40|$|New Frontiers of State Constitutional Law: Dual Enforcement of Norms, {{edited by}} James A. Gardner and Jim Rossi, {{projects}} {{a new vision}} for state constitutional law through {{a collection of essays}} that reflect a shift in legal thinking about the relationship between national and <b>subnational</b> <b>systems</b> of constitutional law. This work charts a new course that gives voice to a recent, rising chorus of dissent among scholars and judges, namely that national and <b>subnational</b> <b>systems</b> of constitutional law cannot be adequately understood in isolation from one another. To the contrary, they are linked in a web of jurisprudential, social, and pragmatic connections structured by the American system of federalism. Here, multiple layers of constitutional law function together in a complex, interdependent process in which constitutional norms are developed, articulated, and enforced. The essays illuminate the role that state constitutions must play in any theory of federalism, and exemplify a fresh approach to state constitutionalism by discussing a range of issues, including recent debates regarding state constitutional protections for same-sex marriage. The entire work embraces the struggle between state and national power for dominance in American law and places both on equal ground. It contends that constitutional meaning in a federal system is never static and that it evolves over time. In addition to covering methods of judicial review, it discusses the handling of constitutional claims by courts at the state and national level and closely examines the way that courts and constitutions protect individual rights in a federal system...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. and Canadian tax {{systems are}} often compared, {{particularly}} in Can-ada. The comparison is usually {{made between the}} two federal tax systems, and little {{attention is paid to}} subnational-provincialktate and local-tax sys-tems in that context.

40|$|Among {{the social}} sciences, long-standing debates {{continue}} {{about the effects}} of economic globalisation. Part of that discussion is about the principles and practices by which to be modern and exhibit stewardship over economic, social and environmental well-being. Often 'sustainability' describes the principles of such care, and 'sustainable development' denotes the practices by which these are enacted. Debating the worth and consequences of economic globalisation involves asking to what extent the state is best placed to address the challenges of modern life. This question informs concerns about democracy and citizenship. Supra-statists advocate investing more power in structures and processes of global governance and government, suggesting more centralising and authoritarian strategies for 'the greater good'. Sub-statists are equally committed to devolving power to <b>subnational</b> <b>systems</b> of decision-making that privilege the local (Wapner 1995). Advocates of both positions attribute to existing state systems the vast majority of environmental woes, calling for the reorganisation of political life and the transference of power up or down spatial scales. Differences between supra-statists and sub-statists bring into sharp relief questions about the scale at which sustainable development is best deployed. The catch-cry think global, act local captures this uncertainty, suggesting that economic, social and environmental problems are transboundary, and the need to engage andempower via democratic and civic rights and responsibilities for sustainable development. Nowhere are such issues better etched than in relation to archetypal trans-boundary domains, the global commons, including the marine environment. Over 70 per cent of Earth is aquatic: oceans, coasts and islands are gravely at risk from processes of modernisation and economic globalisation, Despite the proliferation of mechanisms to advance sustainabl...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the way in which}} local and national forces operate to influence the design of <b>subnational</b> regulatory <b>systems,</b> this paper analyzes the development of alcohol regulation in the post-prohibition era. In particular, I examine why, in the period between 1933 and 1935, some states adopted a monopoly system of alcohol regulation and others a license system of alcohol regulation. I use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and case-based research to identify causal pathways leading to each regulatory outcome. I draw on state-level demographic, religious, and voting data, as well as measures of alcohol industry prevalence and prohibition enforcement to test hypotheses of alcohol regulatory origin and variation. My study shows that while the emergence of two universally adopted models of alcohol regulation was largely the design of capitalist elites, state-level variation reflected individual population and government preferences. I find the following conditions to be among those relevant to a state’s choice of framework: Canadian heritage population, conservative religious population, immigrant population, and popular as well as government attitudes toward national prohibition. My analysis points more broadly to a hegemonic relationship between elite generated priorities and agendas at the national-level and (limited) pluralist based legislative processes at the local-level...|$|R
40|$|Although fiscal (de) {{centralization}} literature explains {{easily the}} centralization of {{taxes on the}} basis of a superior tax administration capacity, it finds more difficult to argue why in federal and decentralized <b>systems</b> <b>subnational</b> governments are ready to accept the demise of their taxing powers. This paper aims to contribute to the debate by analyzing the conditions under in which sub-national governments are willing to cede their taxing power to a central authority. A simple bargaining model is used to illustrate the choices available to both the central (federal) government and the sub-national governments (regions), where the main contribution lies in the introduction of the expenditure side of the budget and of its relevance for solving the commitment issue. We conclude that tax centralization will take place – transfers will prevail over sub-national taxes – if substantial efficiency gains from the centralized administration of taxes are expected. To support this conclusion, the paper presents evidence from decentralization processes in Argentina, Canada and Italy. ...|$|R

Global health initiatives (GHIs) have the potential both to facilitate and exacerbate coordination at the national and subnational level. Evidence of the effects of GHIs on coordination is beginning to emerge but has hitherto been limited to single-country studies and broad-brush reviews. To date, no study has provided a focused synthesis of the effects of GHIs on national and <b>subnational</b> health <b>systems</b> across multiple countries. To address this deficit, we review primary data from seven country studies on the effects of three GHIs on coordination of HIV/AIDS programmes: the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank's HIV/AIDS programmes including the Multi-country AIDS Programme (MAP). Methods In-depth interviews were conducted at national and subnational levels (179 and 218 respectively) in seven countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, between 2006 and 2008. Studies explored the development and functioning of national and subnational HIV coordination structures, {{and the extent to which}} coordination efforts around HIV/AIDS are aligned with and strengthen country health systems.

40|$|As {{recently}} as a year ago, state governments were awash in revenue, but reports from state revenue officials suggest that growth in tax receipts has slowed considerably in recent quarters. The flow of tax revenues into state coffers has decelerated primarily because the economy has suffered a severe shock (it was weakening even before September 11) and delayed tax cuts enacted in earlier, more prosperous times have taken full effect. However, many tax analysts believe that long-term economic, technological, and political trends are also partially responsible {{and will continue to}} constrain state revenue growth even after the economy revives.; This article discusses the impact on state and local revenues of three such trends: the shift in the nation's mix of production and consumption from goods to services; the proliferation of electronic commerce; and the intensification of interjurisdictional competition. The author concludes that state and local tax systems are, indeed, out-of-sync with the economy's changing structure. He suggests greater voluntary coordination among tax jurisdictions in tax design and enforcement as the most promising strategy for enhancing revenue productivity. He also notes that more selective use of business tax incentives would help state and local governments to raise adequate revenues without significantly sacrificing other tax policy goals.; Whatever state and local tax reforms are adopted, the author writes, long-run potential threats to the revenue productivity and stability of <b>subnational</b> revenue <b>systems</b> should be continuously reevaluated. With the federal government shifting its priorities {{in the wake of the}} attacks on September 11, the states and their municipalities might be called upon to shoulder significantly wider domestic fiscal responsibilities. They should possess revenue systems that will enable them to meet these responsibilities effectively. Revenue; Tax incentives; State finance...|$|R

The problems that arise when it is so used have become a serious constraint {{on the development of the}} VAT—and closer economic integration—in Brazil, the EU, India and elsewhere. This paper describes and compares two recent proposals for forms of VAT intended to alleviate these difficulties: the VIVAT and the CVAT. Both enable the VAT chain to be preserved on inter-provincial trade without compromising the destination principle (allowing provinces to tax consumption at different rates) or introducing new scope for game-playing by the provinces. The key difference between them is that the CVAT requires sellers to discriminate between buyers located in different provinces of the federation, whereas VIVAT requires them to discriminate between registered and non-registered buyers.

40|$|International audienceWith a {{specific}} {{focus on the}} 2015 regional elections, this paper looks comparatively at the territorial dimension of FN national populist politics across two French regions, namely NPDCP and PACA, where the FN achieved its best electoral performances in 2015. Taking both the supply and demand sides of FN politics in France, it seeks to assess the salience and relevance of regional-identity frames of mobilization, and how these may shape the dynamics of FN support locally. Whilst a typical case of ‘national-populist party’, the Front national has recently diversified its strategies of electoral mobilization and organizational development at the subnational level, while also becoming increasingly embedded in local and regional politics. Distinctive patterns of regional identity politics reflect diverging strategies of mobilization {{as well as the}} presence of factions within the FN, which have a territorial basis along a North-South divide. Turning to the demand side of FN politics, the second section of this paper shows a positive relationship between the FN vote and the presence of specific socio-professional groups, i. e. farmers, blue collar workers and routine non manual employees, which have formed the bulk of FN support since the late 1990 s. The analysis confirms the positive correlation between unemployment and FN voting, while also corroborating the negative relationship with immigration at the communal level. Looking at regional variation in the above patterns, we find the FN’s appeal to working class voters to be similar in both regions, although the effect is more heterogeneous in the south. In PACA, support for the FN is more positively associated with the level of income in the commune, which may attest to the weight of the party’s traditional petty-bourgeois constituency in the region. Finally, contrary to anticipation, the effect of unemployment is found to be significantly stronger in the Mediterranean south. Finally, looking at the presence of regionalized patterns of party competition and the competitive location taken by the FN across NPDCP and PACA. suggests two electorally disparate regions and distinct <b>subnational</b> party <b>systems.</b> In the north, the strategic emphasis by Marine Le Pen on socio-economic issues may be accounted for by the fact that competition for votes takes place essentially between the FN and the left. In the south, on the other hand, party competition is increasingly characterized by the opposition between the FN and the mainstream right, which may produce stronger incentives for the FN to focus on cultural issues of immigration and national identity. Despite regional differences, however, nationalism remains a strong ideological feature of the French Front National, which is rooted in a populist radical right ideology...|$|R
