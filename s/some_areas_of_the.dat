5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt {{is prohibited}} altogether {{except on the}} highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate {{at the sides of}} the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid {{organs are}} absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E

50|$|Artificial leaky dams {{constructed}} from injection molded plastic {{have also been}} triailed in <b>some</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefit derived from this method is the wall doesn't corrode or compost over time requiring less management.|$|R
5|$|Lothian Buses also {{operates}} a nightbus network. Ridership increased when the routes were re-numbered and re-routed to match daytime routes and increased in frequency. The operation of night buses provides a continuous 24-hour bus service to <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. This ticket allows for unlimited travel all night on any night bus.|$|E
5|$|The {{penultimate}} restoration {{was undertaken}} by the Restoration Laboratory of the Vatican Museum between 1935–38. The scope of the work was to consolidate <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intonaco at {{the eastern end of}} the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.|$|E
5|$|The town is fictionally {{portrayed in}} the late Glyn Daniel's novel Welcome Death (1954). <b>Some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town {{have been used in}} the {{recording}} of the recent series of Doctor Who and The Sarah Jane Adventures (created by BBC Wales).

50|$|Autostereograms {{use this}} {{dependence}} of depth on spacing to create three-dimensional images. If, over <b>some</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, {{the pattern is}} repeated at smaller distances, that area will appear closer than the background plane. If <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> repeats is longer over <b>some</b> <b>area,</b> then that area will appear more distant (like {{a hole in the}} plane).|$|R
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort, {{especially}} the eastern part, has been refurbished into a park. <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort is now {{used by the}} local army garrison and boarding house for the local police families, which means the interior was not very well-maintained and the ground is littered with rubbish. Other government offices also set inside the fort.|$|R
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore {{is the presence of}} rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; in <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, {{and one or}} two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E

5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|London's {{buildings}} are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, {{partly because of}} their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. <b>Some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, particularly those {{just west of the}} centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey 1515.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park were {{formerly}} {{part of the}} princely {{state of}} Tehri Garhwal. The forests were cleared to make the area less vulnerable to Rohilla invaders. The Raja of Tehri formally ceded {{a part of his}} princely state to the East India Company in return for their assistance in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain. The Boksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate {{over most of the}} country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} accent and/or dialect spoken by natives {{throughout}} Texas is {{sometimes referred to}} as Texan English, which itself is a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English. Creole language is spoken in East Texas. In <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state—particularly in the large cities – Western American English and General American English, have been on the increase. Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread in South Texas, while African American Vernacular English, is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), and in <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, {{is the most}} {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E

The tornado travelled for about 10 km and injured 28 people.In the same day a tornado touches down near Vercelli and an F2-F3 tornado stuck <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> Pordenone, with some truck lifted off <b>the</b> ground, one <b>of</b> which thrown against a building.|$|R
5|$|Ultimately, the Marine Corps {{determined}} that the 37mm gun of the M2s and M3s was not powerful enough to defeat Japanese bunkers, and so they would be replaced with tanks armed with 75mm guns. Following {{the end of the}} Guadalcanal campaign, A Company returned to Australia, where the M2A4s were replaced with the new M4 Shermans in preparation for the Battle of Cape Gloucester in December 1943. They remained in service in <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Theater until 1943. After they served in the Pacific, they were used for training.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically {{in the range of}} 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E
50|$|FORR {{depends upon}} {{the idea that there}} are {{multiple}} reasons or rationales for performing actions while solving a problem. These reasons can be always right (it's always right to make a move in chess that will put the opponent in checkmate) or just sometimes right. The always-right reasons are the minority. The sometimes-right reasons can complete with each other: for example, in game playing, one good reason might be to capture pieces, while another might be to control <b>some</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board. In FORR, these competing reasons are called Advisors.|$|R
50|$|The Phasianidae are locally {{constituted}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> francolins, quails, partridges and the Indian peafowl, {{which is}} an alien species that has escaped from captivity in <b>some</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> francolins include the Cape francolin, Swainson's francolin, and Natal francolin, to name a few. The quails are represented by the harlequin quail and the common quail. The chukar partridge, another alien species from Eurasia, is restricted to Robben Island.|$|R
50|$|In {{a variant}} of this method, called Metal-induced lateral {{crystallization}} (MILC), metal is only deposited on <b>some</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> a-Si. Upon annealing, crystallization starts from <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> a-Si which is covered by metal and proceeds laterally. Unlike MIC process, where metal contamination in the obtained polysilicon is relatively high, the laterally crystallized silicon in MILC process contains very small amount <b>of</b> metal contamination. <b>The</b> crystallization speed is low, but is adequate for applications such as fabrication of thin film transistors. In this case, metal is deposited on <b>the</b> source/drain <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transistor and the channel is laterally crystallized.|$|R
