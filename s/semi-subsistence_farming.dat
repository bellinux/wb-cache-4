40|$|Ukraine {{belongs to}} the group of {{countries}} which are known for the widespread phenomenon of subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> Individual farmers are not obliged to produce financial reports and their incomes belong to the category of unobservable incomes. When checking the eligibility for social assistance the level of their incomes needs to be estimated. In a country, where poverty rate is quite high, the coverage of the poor with financial aid is relatively low and public finances under constant control, the importance of a fair and justified methodology for income imputation is particularly strong. In this situation, an outdated and unfair current system of agriculture income estimation in Ukraine calls for immediate changes. This paper presents recommendations for the Ukrainian government in the area of agriculture income imputation, where several methods of estimating farm income were proposed (including the one based on Household Budget Survey). The recommendations were preceded with the analysis of five countries' practices in this area: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Poland. A review of different means testing methods, including direct means testing and proxy means testing, served as an introduction to the topic. subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming,</b> hard to verify income, farm household income, income (agro-income) imputation, means testing methods...|$|E

The transition from the status-quo of an agricultural structure dominated by subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> in the view of restructuring, resulting in a more efficient sector - is a must. Present study proposes to evaluate the application of specific measures of the Romanian National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) that sought to support <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> between 2007 and 2013. Three NRDP measures have been identified under which <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> were eligible: Measure 112 "Setting up of young farmers", Measure 121 "Modernization of agricultural holdings", and Measure 141 "Supporting semi-subsistence agricultural holdings". The above measures belong to the 1 st Axis of the Common Agricultural Policy's second pillar, thus having a common general goal the improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, while aiming at restructuring and developing the physical potential and management of generation change - trying to keep the rural population in place.

40|$|<b>Semi-subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> {{households}} (SFHs) have persevered in Central and Southeastern Europe. An {{outlook on}} future perspectives of SFHs asks for reliable {{information on the}} phenomenon of SFHs {{and the impact of}} policy measures on their development options: (1) intensifying farming, (2) diversifying income creating activities, or (3) exiting farming for waged employment. This article focuses on SFHs and rural non-farm employment (RNFE). On the basis of a comparative 2007 -survey of 489 SFHs in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, three countries with particularly many SFHs, four major types of SFHs (rural pensioners, farmers, rural diversifiers, rural newcomers) were identified. For policy analysis, a multiobjective linear programming household model was developed. In the model, labour can be devoted to (1) farming, (2) self-employment and (3) waged employment. The policy scenarios reflect different development options for SFHs: (1) farm development, (2) start selfemployment, (3) farm development and start self-employment, and (4) stop agriculture.

40|$|Subsistence and semi-subsistence farming” {{has been}} a {{research}} topic in the last decades on which a generally agreed definition was not reached yet. The main approaches to this subject are based on some criteria such as: farm size, economic size and market participation. In {{the context of the}} last 2 waves of EU enlargement, the subsistence farming, a specific phenomenon in the New EU Member States that occurred {{as a result of the}} transition economies and land reforms, induced important social implications in the rural area and considerable development gaps between the Old Member States and the New ones. For efficiency and competitiveness reasons, with the Common Agricultural Policy a special rural measure was designed to support the drive to commercialization of subsistence and semi-subsistence farms in the NMS. For the practical implementation of this measure, the generally definition for <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> in the context of the NMS {{has been a}}greed as “the farm producing mainly for self-consumption, but also selling a certain part of the production”, in which the “surplus” part that is sold has a degree of regularity and consistency. This issue was debated in the new Member States (NSM), before the elaboration of the National Rural Development Plans, being tackled through the local characteristics of each NMS, depending on the development level of the respective economies, correlated with the degree of general modernization of the society and with the accuracy of the available data.

This polarization is strongly correlated to the existing gaps between the regions in terms of economic development – gaps that may in fact widen given the differential effects the CAP will produce in relation to each region’s agricultural structure.

40|$|Agriculture {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Turkey, both in social and economic terms. Subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> is an important characteristic of the Turkish agriculture. These farms are typically characterized by low productivity and only a small fraction of production has been marketed. While the rate of agriculture in national income was 14. 7 % in 2000, this rate is declined to 10. 7 % in 2005. Turkey is endowed with rich natural and human resources, but it is still far from reaching full potential of agricultural growth because of the inefficient agricultural policies. The prevailing conditions in agriculture combined with the mismanagement in macro and agricultural policies prevented an overall structural transformation of the sector. The long-term objectives of agricultural policies obviously need to be the improvement of productivity in the sector.

40|$|This chapter aims to {{overcome}} the gap existing between case study research, which typically provides qualitative and process-based insights, and national or global inventories that typically offer spatially explicit and quantitative analysis of broader patterns, and thus to present adequate evidence for policymaking regarding large-scale land acquisitions. Therefore, the chapter links spatial patterns of land acquisitions to underlying implementation processes of land allocation. Methodologically linking the described patterns and processes proved difficult, but we have identified indicators that could be added to inventories and monitoring systems to make linkage possible. Combining complementary approaches in this way may help to determine where policy space exists for more sustainable governance of land acquisitions, both geographically and with regard to processes of agrarian transitions. Our spatial analysis revealed two general patterns: (i) relatively large forestry-related acquisitions that target forested landscapes and often interfere with <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> systems; and (ii) smaller agriculture-related acquisitions that often target existing cropland and also interfere with semi-subsistence systems. Furthermore, our meta-analysis of land acquisition implementation processes shows that authoritarian, top-down processes dominate. Initially, the demands of powerful regional and domestic investors tend to override socio-ecological variables, local actors’ interests, and land governance mechanisms. As available land grows scarce, however, and local actors gain experience dealing with land acquisitions, it appears that land investments begin to fail or give way to more inclusive, bottom-up investment models...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the “spatial” structure of agriculture in Poland whose spatial development is analysed {{from the beginning}} of the transition towards a market economy up until the country’s forthcoming accession to the EU and the correlated implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (Cap). The paper analyses the social, political and economic forces behind the process of progressive differentiation in the regional structure of agriculture which have produced the existing disparities between the dynamic farming of the central and western areas and the <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> in the east. The analysis also explores the linkages between the spatial evolution of agriculture and the increasing disparities in terms of regional unemployment and development. In such a framework the Cap’s implementation by producing differential effects in relation to each region’s agricultural structure will lead to further polarisation of the spatial structure of agriculture and may exacerbate existing disparities. Therefore, the Cap’s contribution towards a balanced regional development depends upon its capacity to adapt itself to the needs of a comparatively backward agricultural system (with respect to that of the present fifteen members) and the specificity of its spatial structure. Consequently, it is of fundamental importance that sector intervention be complemented by an appropriate mix of rural development, regional and territorial policies.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to many Western European countries, in Romania {{the use of}} common pastures remains widespread and is strongly linked to the predominance of subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> {{in much of the}} country. The majority of permanent pasture in the country is under state or community ownership, and these areas are of high natural and cultural, as well as economic importance for Romania. Whilst traditional governance systems of the commons are still partly intact, or at least within living memory here, new institutions are forming in response to substantial changes in agriculture and rural life that have been occurring, particularly since Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007. We describe the changing role of common pastures for local communities in the case study region of Târnava Mare in Southern Transylvania, Romania. The number of active users here is decreasing, and those who have more animals are increasingly grazing their animals on long-term leased or private land, thus effectively no longer participating in the commons.

30|$|The {{agriculture}} {{sector is}} {{the mainstay of}} the Ethiopian economy as it accounts for nearly 45 % of GDP and employs about 85 % of labor forces (Dercon et al. 2012). Despite its strategic role for the country’s economy, the sector is dominated by subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> system (Alemu et al. 2006; Anley et al. 2007; Francesconi and Heerink 2011; Teshome et al. 2016). Smallholders own on average less than 1  ha land per holder account for about 95 % of land covered by crops on which they produce about 90 % of agricultural outputs in the country (CSA, 2014). Moreover, the ever-increasing population {{of the country is}} reducing the farm sizes rapidly (Bezu and Holden 2014; Headey et al. 2014). This population growth coupled with a legal restriction on agricultural land market hindered farm expansion that made farms smaller and hiring labor superfluous, which created a significant level of unemployment in the rural part of the country (Bezu and Holden 2014). Hence, {{there has to be a}} mechanism to support the livelihood of the agricultural communities and absorb the excess labor in the rural economy. As emphasized by Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001), the main options available for the unemployed rural community in this scenario are either migration to urban areas or engagement in off-farm activities in rural areas. Actually, smallholder farmers in developing countries rarely rely on a full-time agricultural work; rather, they often maintain a portfolio of activities in which off-farm activities are an important contributions to their well-being (Barrett et al. 2001; Foster and Rosenzweig 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Wouterse and Taylor 2008; Lanjouw and Murgai 2009; Zezza et al. 2009; Davis et al. 2010; Haggblade et al. 2010).|$|E

Amendments (cattle manure, grass residues and dolomitic lime) were incorporated to a depth of 20 cm in bands 15 cm wide down plant rows at rates of 10 and 20 t ha (in the amended area) for organic materials and 2. 5 and 5. 0 t ha for lime. The remainder of the field remained untilled. Additions of cattle manure rapidly increased soil pH, and concentrations of exchangeable K, Ca and Mg and extractable P were also greatly elevated. Grass residue additions increased pH progressively and increased exchangeable K and Mg and those of dolomitic lime increased pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg. Addition of each of the amendments decreased concentrations of exchangeable Al; the effect was greatest for animal manure after 6 weeks and for lime and grass residues at harvest. At harvest, addition of all three amendments had significantly reduced concentrations of both phytotoxic monomeric and total Al in soil solution. The system not only resulted in an increase in pH and extractable nutrients in row soil compared to that in the inter-row but also an increase in the size and activity of the soil microbial community. Maize yields were increased by additions of amendments under both unfertilised and fertilised conditions and yields were generally greatest at the higher rate of addition. Under unfertilised conditions, cattle manure treatments gave the greatest yields. Fertiliser additions increased yields greatly particularly in the control, grass residue and lime treatments. It was concluded that the strip tillage system used is a practicable way of applying high rates of organic materials to soils, that cattle manure has a rapid liming effect as well as being a nutrient source and that grass residues from rangeland decompose slowly and, therefore, have a slow liming effect...|$|E

40|$|Cotton {{production}} in Benin, West Africa, is intertwined with colonialism, which {{contributed to the}} trans­formation of the crop’s production system from traditional to modern. Through­out the years, {{the importance of the}} crop for the stakeholders varied. The last decades have witnessed a growing interest in cotton of farmers, businessmen, and the State. From having a marginal status during the seventies and {{the first half of the}} eighties, cotton grew in importance during the nineties, both in terms of area covered and income generated, averaging 37 percent of the total cultivated area in the country. Thus, cotton has a critical cash function and plays a key role in Benin’s economic growth, accounting for an important share in the State’s revenues and farm house­holds incomes. Indeed, the share of cotton exports represented 75 percent of the country’s total agricultural exports during the 2000 s, and the crop provided up to 80 percent of rural households incomes in the North. Though cotton is grown throughout the country, its production was always concentrated in the North, where it is embedded in a farming system formerly dominated by food crops. Hence, cotton transformed subsistence farming into <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> The central position of the crop in the country’s economy, which loomed large at the beginning of the 1990 s, led to agricultural and economic policies being greatly influenced by the crop for decades. The Structural Adjustment Program of the early 1990 s prescribed the liberalisation of the cotton sector, which had huge effects on the sector. This resulted in an increased importance of cotton farmer organisations that elapsed into the first ever hierarchical network in the country, and the crop being put at the forefront of agricultural development programs. Enduring benefits for farmers, farming communities, private actors, and the State were derived from that evolution. This gained cotton the status of ‘white gold’. The institutional dynamics that followed in the wake of liberalisation and their corollary of actors’ interactions generated never-ending conflicts of various kinds, particularly within the cotton farmers’ networks. These resulted in atomised networks. As a consequence, the benefits attached to cotton then started to wane and cotton production became a dilemma for farmers, as reflected in a steep decline of cotton production. This thesis aims at understanding the dynamic interactions between the economic activity of cotton production and the structure of social relations from community to household and individual level. It addresses the question of how farmers’ agency affected their organisations, the cotton system, and the collective action that evolved around the crop. The research was aligned along three main axes: the emergence of breakaway networks, the decline of social cohesion and the squeeze of collective action, and the livelihoods reconstruction after the demise of cotton production. The main theoretical perspectives underlying the conceptual framework were an actor-oriented approach, actor-network theory, livelihood theory, and a gender perspective. The research  is based on fieldwork carried out in four provinces in the North of Benin from January 2009 to April 2011. Benin is a country whose employment capacity and economic growth heavily rely on the agricultural sector, in which cotton is a dominant factor. This is still the case for rural areas in the North, where rural households have been heavily dependent on cotton as a critical cash crop for poverty alleviation. Northern Benin supplies more than 75 percent of the cotton yearly produced in the country, thanks to the favourable agro-ecological conditions prevailing there, and because there is less population pressure than in the southern part. The exploratory phase of the research covered four provinces: Borgou, Alibori, Atacora and Donga. Since the provinces of Borgou and Alibori host the heart of the cotton belt, subsequent data collection progressively focussed on these two provinces. The research adopted a mixed-methods design, applying quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. A survey was combined with focus-group discussions, in-depth interviews and the life history method, to unveil the dynamic interactions between social actors and their interactions with the material and technical elements of the cotton system. The life history method was used to document the experience of women leaders that had made them exceptions to the rule among women cotton farmers. Apart from cotton farmers and their leaders, other targets groups of the research, like inputs suppliers and executives of cotton bodies, often had to be found beyond the two provinces in other parts of the country. The research covered eight cotton networks in ten villages in the four provinces. Survey interviews and in-depth interviews were conducted with 148 heads of cotton farming households, men as well as women. About 80 percent of the farmers in the sample were in their 40 s or 50 s, and more than half of them had no formal education. Educated women represented only 17 percent of their category, suggesting that male cotton farmers are significantly more educated than their female counterparts. The average household size was 16, with about 11 workers in male adult equivalents. While agriculture is the main occupation and often the only source of income in the area, women turned out to rely less on agricultural incomes than men. With regard to networking, the process of atomisation resulted in about 20 percent of stayers in remnant networks, 51 percent of joiners of operating networks, and about 28 percent of creators of new networks. It was found that more than three quarters of cotton farmers broke away from their original network at least once during their cotton cropping career, and that creators of new networks were more likely to be leaders than stayers or joiners. The results further tell us that more than one in two cotton farmers (ever) had a leadership position. A significant association was found between these three categories of farmers and leadership status. Finally, a greater stock of social capital was correlated with the ability of leading cotton networks. The research indicates that the liberalisation of an agricultural value-chain can be harmful rather than beneficial when the State fails to play a coherent role during the shift from State monopoly to private interest. Cotton proved to be the lifeline for farmer organisations, and drove collective action in rural areas from the important resources it generated. However, the decline of trust within the networks in conjunction with poor management of cotton resources led to a reversed dynamic that tore networks apart, which resulted in their atomisation. Social relations deteriorated when the financial stakes became higher. As attested by the way the process of network atomisation evolved, cooperation within large groups requires legal sanctions to be sustainable. The qualitative results showed that the process of atomisation was nurtured by ties of friendship, kinship, residence and ethnicity at the start, after which networks extended to include other areas and more general member­­ship. From the survey results it can be inferred that push and pull factors interacted to influence the process of cotton network atomisation. The most influential of these factors were, on the one hand, mismanagement of network resources and manipulation of farmers by outsiders, and, on the other hand, trust in board members, hope for board positions, the expectation of profit, and support from public officials and ethnic or religious connections.   The research further demonstrates that gender myths and stereotypes obstruct women&# 39;s active involvement in managing organisations, in spite of their key position in the cotton production system at household level. Women were found 21 times less likely to be a leader than men in cotton organisations, and their presence on boards hardly empowered them because they spend their energy struggling to meet practical needs. Women’s admission to cotton boards appears to be instrumental for men and hides men&# 39;s real motives, judging by the way male board members tend to restrict the power of their female colleagues. However, men are inclined to give more freedom to women when they find their activities benefitting themselves, as was revealed by the data on livelihood adaptation strategies. The research clearly ascertains that farmers are more rational than often assumed and that they grow a crop as long as it is a source of livelihood and food security. Despite its current low to negative returns, cotton remains part of the livelihood diversification strategies of households because cotton production gives access to fertilisers which can then be used for food crops. However, relying on one source of income puts the livelihood system of rural households at risk. Faced with the cotton problems, households diversified their sources of income, first and primarily on-farm with food crops increasingly gaining a cash function. Additionally, they would deploy beyond-farm alter­native strategies, including migration of youth. It was also found that the decline of cotton production proved to result in more freedom for women. Because of their multiple extra-domestic activities, women are less vulnerable than men when it comes to coping with livelihood shortages. Their contribution to the provision for house­hold needs increased during the decline of cotton production and the ensuing income shortages compared to that of men. The livelihood adaptation strategies showed the decision making about income diversification to move from the centre of the household to its periphery...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the recent {{evolution}} of Romanian small farms. As a result of complex historic process the category of subsistence and <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> is well represented within Romanian Farm structure (Mathijs and al., 2004; Giruca and al., 2006). The recent data collected by the General Census and Farm Structure surveys gave some signs of the recent evolution. We focus specifically on the smallest categories and try to differentiate their evolution among different factors. Farm survival and Farm growth literature is abundant and focuses especially on initial farm size, specialisation or pluriactivity of the farm (Weiss, 1999). In contrast, the role of localization, linked to historical background or physical constraints, as a factor is more limited in the literature. Other institutional factors such as inheritance and succession have not really been approached until now. We choose to investigate those factors using a multiple regression on the 3 recent data collections in Romania.

The launching of a new programme is not successful unless it attracts the target people's attention. A good communication as far as the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned might help the farmers in the Timis County better use the resources they have at their disposal, and eventually optimize the whole-farm system. The findings of the research made to identify the manner in which communication, on the European funding for the 2007 - 2013 period, was made pointed out that the methods used did not succeed to lower the lack of interest or improve the information level of the people living in the Timis County. They neither stimulated them {{to find out more about}} this matter nor increased the number of people who applied for European financing.

40|$|Agricultural {{biodiversity}} is {{an environmental}} resource. Much {{of the agricultural}} biodiversity remaining in situ today is found on the <b>semi-subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> of poorer countries and the small-scale farms or home gardens of more industrialized nations. The traditional small farms of Hungary are labelled “home gardens” {{as a reflection of}} their institutional identity during the collectivisation period. Homesteads managed with family labor, they continue to serve essential food security and diet quality functions during economic transition. Home gardens contribute to the preservation of rural settlements and cultural heritage, and they contain relatively high levels of several components of agricultural biodiversity. The role of home gardens in the agri-environmental program that is now being formulated by Hungary and the European Union has not been elucidated, though the stated goal of these policies is to support multifunctional agriculture. This study estimates the private value that Hungarian farmers assign to home gardens and their biodiversity attributes, and indicates how such information might be used in designing least-cost mechanisms to support their maintenance as part of the national agri-environmental program.
