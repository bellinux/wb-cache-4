40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking achenes of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower seed weevil, Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower seed weevil, S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of achenes damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). Achenes infested by the gray sunflower seed weevil are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding achenes on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of achenes infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} achenes infested by the red sunflower seed weevil and banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> (Charlet and Gross, 1990). The red sunflower seed weevil oviposits in the developing achenes. The larvae feed on the developing kernels and when mature chew emergence holes in the pericarp (hull) (Oseto and Braness, 1979). The banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> oviposit on the bracts and florets. Early instars feed on the pollen and florets, later instars penetrate into achenes and feed on the developing kernels (Charlet et al., 1987, Charlet and Gross, 1990). In this study, we describe achenes infested by the red sunflower seed weevil, banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> and <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> and provide characters for separation of achenes infested by each of these pest species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{sunflower}}</b> <b>moth,</b> Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst), a major pest of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), is {{susceptible to}} Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner, but field control has been inconsistent. Our study was done to determine whether phenolics in damaged sunflower tissue are in a conjugated or free form and whether they influence the toxicity of B. thuringiensis to the <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth.</b> Larvae fed diets containing B. thuringiensis had reduced survival and growth. The LD 50 of B. thuringiensis was 52 international units of potency per gram of diet. Phenolic acids are general biocides. They were found in sunflower hybrids largely in the free (nonconjugated) form after tissue injury. The phenolics were probably converted from the conjugated form to the free form after release of glycosidases. By themselves and at the doses tested, specific phenolic acids did not affect <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> survival and growth. When cinnamic or p-coumaric acids were combined with B. thuringiensis in artificial diet, growth (measured as width of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> head capsules) of larvae was reduced {{compared with that of}} larvae fed diets containing B. thuringiensis. High phenolic sunflower might increase the effectiveness of B. thuringiensis as an agent for <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> control...|$|E
40|$|Four {{sunflower}} accessions {{were compared}} with a susceptible check, hybrid ‘ 894 ’, in the greenhouse to determine their resistance to the banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes Walsingham, and their interaction with Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner variety kurstaki. Antibiosis, expressed as lower larval weights, was detected {{in all of the}} accessions. In addition to being antibiotic, sunflower accession Ames 3291 was antixenotic to banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> oviposition and exhibited an additional impact on larval weight when B. thuringiensis was applied. By itself, B. thuringiensis provided better control of banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> than the resistance tested. However, banded sunflower moth-resistant sunflower would be a good option when B. thuringiensis or another insecticide is not applied, and it may prevent the economic threshold from being reached...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 1996 and 1997 to determine if honey bees, Apis mellifera L., could vector Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner variety kurstaki from hives equipped with a pathogen applicator to sunflower capitula and if the amount of B. thuringiensis deposited on the capitula would be sufficient to control the banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes Walsingham. The study demonstrated that honey bees became contaminated with B. thuringiensis as they exited hives equipped with filled pathogen applicators and deposited enough B. thuringiensis on the capitula to cause banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> larval mortality. When 2 methods of applying B. thuringiensis were compared, the honey bee vectoring method gave better or equivalent control of the banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> larvae than manual sprays, resulting in higher seed yields than manual sprays. The presence of honey bees also increased seed set which contributed to greater yield...|$|E
40|$|The banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an {{important}} economic pest of sunflower in the Upper Great Plains of North America. Economic losses due to reductions in seed number, weight, and quality can be significant. Previously, the potential for economic losses were estimated by sampling for adult moths. However, sampling for moths can be difficult and inaccurate. An alternative is to sample for banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> eggs, which can be accurately counted in the field by using a binocular 3. 5 headband magnifier. The egg counts are {{used to calculate the}} economic injury level (EIL) : EIL = C/(V×W×P×K), where C is the cost of treatment per unit area, V is the crop market value per unit of weight, W is the slope of the regression between banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> egg densities and weight loss per plant, P is a term for plant population per unit area, and K is the control treatment efficacy. Estimates of populations of banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> eggs are taken from the center of 400 -m spans along all field sides. From these samples and the calculated EIL, a map of the extent of the economically damaging banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> population throughout the field is made using economic distance; ED = e(((EIL/E) – 1. 458) /– 0. 262). Economic distance estimates the distance an economic population extends into the field interior along a transect from the sampling site. By using egg samples to calculate the EIL and mapping the distribution of economic populations throughout a field, producers can then make more effective pest management decisions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Homoeosoma electellum, is {{a serious}} pest of oilseed and {{confection}} sunflowers. In this study, we determine efficacy of resistance against this pest. Thirty commercial hybrids, inbreds, and varieties of sunflowers were tested in replicated field and laboratory studies. Trait efficacy is determined by pericarp strength by means of physical compression tests and damage to achenes. Initial sunflower entries were planted May 2014 and data collection began in early August 2014. A second season was planted June 2015, with sampling beginning late August the same year. In 2014, oilseed varieties showed a strength average of 2. 71 ± 0. 11 N while confection varieties showed an average of 4. 70 ± 0. 07 N. Of the four varieties selected for inclusion in 2015, RH 841 had the highest pericarp strength estimate at 9. 74 ± 0. 24 N and HA 467 had the lowest pericarp strength estimate at 4. 16 ± 0. 24 N. Bioassay screening from field and greenhouse grown sunflowers provided a baseline pericarp strength of up to 5 N for targeting in future sunflower host plant resistance trials. Results from choice feeding bioassays and infestation trials show HA 467 may be more susceptible to <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> than RH 841, RH 1130 EX, and HA 441. Data from 2014 and 2015 suggests that RH 1130 EX {{may be a good}} variety to explore for future <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> resistance traits and field hardiness. Additional data suggests that investigating thickness as a trait for sunflower resistance to <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> may be advantageous. The objectives of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the rate of pericarp hardening in confection and oilseed sunflowers; 2) Evaluate the effect of pericarp hardening on <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> larval feeding; and, 3) Evaluate the impact of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> resistance on sunflower yield components. Outcomes of these results will help sunflower producers reduce expenditures on chemical control measures and may reduce pest risk for earlier planting dates.

40|$|Delayed {{planting}} {{is recommended}} to reduce damage from sunflower insect pests in the United States, including the <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) and banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes Walsingham. However, in some locations, planting earlier or growing later-maturing hybrids could improve yield or oil content of sunflowers which would partially offset any added costs from insect pests or their management. Because the abundance {{and distribution of}} some sunflower insects have changed since recommendations for delayed planting were developed, experimental plots were grown in 2012 and 2013 at sites in North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. Sunflowers were planted two to four weeks earlier than normal, including hybrids that flower {{two to three weeks}} later than elite commercial hybrids. The sum of seed damaged by <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> and red sunflower seed weevil, Smicronyx fulvus LeConte, (i. e., total percentage) was influenced by location, but not the relative maturity of tested entries. However, when damage attributed solely to the red sunflower seed weevil was analyzed, more damaged seed were found for late-maturing entries in North Dakota and Nebraska. In addition to the trial data, current pest populations are lower than when delayed planting was first recommended and insecticide use during sunflower bloomis both common and effective. Together, these observations suggest factoring insect pests into planting time decisions may be unnecessary, except for areas with a history of problems with severe pests that cannot be managed using insecticides (e. g., sunflower midge, Contarinia schulzi Gagné) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine dose-mortality response of the banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Cochylis hospes Walsingham, to Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner and its effect on sunflower seed damage and yield. Of B. thuringiensis products tested, Cutlass AF and Javelin WG had the lowest LC 50 values and highest slopes and relative potencies for C. hospes. Javelin WG was superior to the other B. thuringiensis materials tested and to Asana XL in preventing seed damage. Sunflower heads sprayed with Javelin WG had higher yields than sunflower heads sprayed with Asana XL or the other B. thuringiensis products tested. Asana XL is a standard chemical insecticide and is considered to give good control of banded <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth.</b> As an alternative to Asana XL, any of the B. thuringiensis products tested could be employed for control of C. hospes larvae and to reduce the impact on beneficials in sunflower fields...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines influences {{upon the}} parasitoid guild of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Homoeosoma electellum Hulst (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a North American native specialist herbivore and pest of crop sunflower, Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus (L.). I approach the {{system from the}} genetic population, landscape, and habitat scales to determine the relevance of different variables towards future efforts in conservation biological control of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth.</b> At the population level, I used a set of 9 microsatellites, or polymorphic neutral genetic markers, to examine the population genetic structure and level of gene flow within the most important specialist parasitoid of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> Dolichogenidea homoeosomae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). I found that gene flow rates in this species are high, {{and that there are}} no signals of population substructure at the level of wild versus agricultural settings or local- regional geography. At the continental scale the population structure is detectable but gene flow still occurs. This points to a high degree of genetic mixing within this species in North America and indicates that genetic specialization towards wild or agricultural sunflower habitats is very unlikely. At the landscape scale I performed a field survey of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> larvae at 60 agricultural sunflower sites throughout the Central Valley of California during three summer growing seasons in 2003 - 2005. I then compared total parasitism rate, parasitoid species richness and relative proportions of generalist parasitoids to the proportion of habitat in the 1 km radius circular area around each field in annual crops, orchards, riparian habitat and wild sunflower habitat. To follow this, I set up a sentinel larvae experiment to test the effects of surrounding habitat type upon the parasitism parameters. In the survey, I found a significant positive relationship between parasitism rate and the two other parasitoid guild parameters: parasitoid species richness and proportion of parasitism due to generalist parasitoids. The proportion of the area surrounding the field in orchard habitat was positively correlated with parasitism, parasitoid species richness and relative impact by generalists compared to the specialist parasitoid. While not statistically significant, parasitoid guild parameters in the sentinel larvae experiment generally followed the trends found in the survey. At the flower and habitat scale I examined herbivore phenology in self seeding sunflower, Helianthus annuus var. annuus (L.) in 5 different patches during three peak bloom summer seasons to determine the relative abundance and within flower-head co-ocurrence rates of the major sunflower herbivores and their parasitoids. In addition to <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth,</b> H. electellum, I found several other common flower consuming herbivores in the wild sunflower habitat in California. One in particular, Plagiomimicus spumosum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), exhibited an earlier peak in and higher overall abundance relative to H. electellum and was present in high densities at all of the sites surveyed. This herbivore was rarely found in flowers with conspecifics or other florivore species and was statistically negatively correlated with other species at the flower-head level. This indicates that this species may be exerting competitive pressure within the flower consuming guild in wild settings. Observed larval parasitism of P. spumosum averaged 12. 2 %, compared to 33. 3 % parasitism of H. electellum. Two parasitoid species were found to attack both H. electelluma and P. spumosum: Bracon nuperus and Erynnia tortricis. Given that the co-occurrence of the two most abundant herbivores in flowers is significantly lower than that expected by chance and they share at least two parasitoid species, further experimental investigation of the interaction between these herbivores and the consequences for community composition is warranted. In summary, this research demonstrates that while the current population structure of the specialist parasitoid of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> does not show genetic substructure that could lead towards improved control of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> in agricultural fields, the role of generalist parasitoids and in particular those associated with nearby orchard habitat could be very important in biological control. In addition, complex interactions amongst herbivores in the wild sunflower habitats may contribute to the differences observed in parasitism rate between the wild and agricultural sunflower settings. These results show that using the tools and theories of population genetics, landscape and community ecology, we can contribute valuable information towards efforts in conservation biological control and sustainable agricultural practices...|$|E

40|$|Capitate glandular trichomes (CGT), {{one type}} of glandular trichomes, are most common in Asteraceae species. CGT can produce various {{secondary}} metabolites such as sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) and provide durable resistance to insect pests. In sunflower, CGT-based host resistance is effective to combat the specialist pest, <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth.</b> However, the genetic basis of CGT density is not well understood in sunflower. In this study, we identified two major QTL controlling CGT density in sunflower florets by using a F 4 mapping population derived from the cross HA 300 × RHA 464 with a genetic linkage map constructed from genotyping-by-sequencing data and composed of 2121 SNP markers. One major QTL is located on chromosome 5, which explained 11. 61 % of the observed phenotypic variation, and the second QTL is located on chromosome 6, which explained 14. 06 % of the observed phenotypic variation. The QTL effects and the association between CGT density and QTL support interval were confirmed in a validation population which included 39 sunflower inbred lines with diverse genetic backgrounds. We also identified two strong candidate genes in the QTL support intervals, and the functions of their orthologs in other plant species suggested their potential roles in regulating capitate glandular trichome density in sunflower.

Most isolates produced typical bipyramidal crystals, but the B. thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis isolate produced spherical crystals and the B. thuringiensis subsp. thompsoni isolate produced a pyramidal crystal. Analysis of the parasporal crystals by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the crystals from the B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and aizawai isolates contained a protein of 138 kDa whereas those from B. thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni contained a protein of 145 kDa. The crystals from B. thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis contained proteins of 125, 128, and 138 kDa, whereas those from B. thuringiensis subsp. thompsoni were the most unusual, containing proteins of 37 and 42 kDa. Bioassays of purified crystals conducted against second-instar larvae of H. nebulella showed that the isolates of B. thuringiensis subspp. aizawai, kurstaki, and thuringiensis were the most toxic, with 50 % lethal concentrations (LC(inf 50) s) of 0. 15, 0. 17, and 0. 26 (mu) g/ml, respectively.
