5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used {{to explain why the}} electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings, although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). After this season, he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve in this time.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers’ {{record for}} {{consecutive}} games {{lost in a}} single season would be surpassed twice; by the 2001 Carolina Panthers, who lost fifteen consecutive games after winning their opener, and the 2008 Detroit Lions, the only winless team to have done <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 16-game schedule. Ten NFL teams since the 1976 Buccaneers have lost 15 or 16 games in a season, but the Buccaneers’ 26-game losing streak from 1976 to 1977 still stands as the longest in modern NFL history. The aforementioned Detroit Lions have come the closest to matching the Buccaneers' losing streak, having lost 19 consecutive games between 2007 until finally winning in week 3 of the 2009 season.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was born}} on 23 May 1924 in Ilford, Essex, {{the son of a}} Welsh clergyman.

He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> visionary dream he experienced in 1939; he spelled its name variously as A'ashik, Oshik, or Aossic.

5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E

After the victory, {{he said it was a}} relief to get rid of the one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E
