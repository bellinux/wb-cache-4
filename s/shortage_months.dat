30|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is one of}} the major farming activities and livelihoods in the study area, and in this study farmers owned a wide range of livestock types that included cattle, sheep, goats, horse, mule, donkey and camel. The farmers rear livestock for various purposes, including draught power, milk, meat, transport, cash income, and manure. Livestock lie at the core of household risk management strategies in the study area since livestock selling was used to buy crops during food <b>shortage</b> <b>months.</b> The average size of livestock holding measured in terms of tropical livestock unit (TLU) was 2.62 in the study area. However, during the group discussion and in-depth interview, farmers reported that there was shortage of feed for their livestock, especially during the dry season because of the decreased productivity of available grazing lands and decrease of the grazing lands due to conversion of grazing land into cultivation land.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural biodiversity, {{commonly}} referred to as agrobiodiversity, is that part of biodiversity that is geared towards agriculture and food production. Agrobiodiversity is said to contribute much to food and nutrition, but there is lack of data confirming this, particularly from Eastern Africa. To assess the extent of agrobiodiversity on smallholder farms and in local markets and to connect these to food intake and perceptions of food security among smallholder farmers in Western Kenya, the thesis asks four main research questions: (i) What is the extent of food plant diversity in smallholder farms, the bio-physical and socio-economic factors influencing it and the contribution of this diversity to the household's food needs? (ii) What is the relationship between agricultural and dietary diversity? (iii) What linkages are there between agricultural and nutritional diversity? (iv) How does access to agrobiodiversity in local markets contribute to meeting household food needs and what is the extent of smallholder farmers' integration into these markets? Through a combination of focus group discussions, farm and market surveys conducted across three time points, results indicate that: (i) higher food plant species richness is found on farms managed by wealthier and older households. However, these households are not more food secure than the rest, (ii) while {{there is a lack of}} a strong relationship between agricultural and dietary diversity, dietary diversity is instead significantly influenced by socio-economic factors including a household's wealth status, ethnicity and education level, (iii) despite a diversity of locally available on-farm and market food species meeting existing macro-and micro-nutrient needs, there is a general lack of understanding of this diversity as food <b>shortage</b> <b>months</b> coincide with a lack of maize despite high availability of a diversity of other foods not only to replace the maize but also to contribute to a diverse diet, (iv) smallholder farmers rely on multiple food sources, with markets mainly for sourcing cereals, fruits and animal source foods. There is also low integration of smallholder farmers as sellers in local markets. Together, the four case studies show interlinkages across food availability, accessibility and utilisation, which when addressed with equal weight, could unlock local agrobiodiversity's potential as a path to food and nutrition security of smallholder farming households. </p...|$|E

30|$|The spark that {{ignited the}} ongoing {{conflagration}} in Syria was similar. Here {{it began in}} {{the southern city of}} Daraa near the Jordanian border, a region that had suffered severe water <b>shortages</b> for <b>months</b> previously. The hardship in rural areas was exacerbated by the local governor, an Assad regime placeman, whose system of water allocation, including drilling rights, was notoriously corrupt. The flashpoint came when several schoolchildren, all members of the same Al-Abazeed family, were arrested for writing anti-Assad graffiti on the walls of their school. The ensuing public protest was met with regime gunfire, and the unrest soon escalated. It is telling that the regime then tried to bring Daraa back into line by cutting off the city’s water supply altogether. In autumn 2012, there were reports that they had even tried to poison a local reservoir. The shortage of groundwater played a central catalytic role in both Yemen and Syria; and as we have seen, the destabilising influence of groundwater scarcity in these countries is far from played out yet (Arnold;Famiglietti;Gleick).|$|R
50|$|On September 18, the President of Honduras {{declared}} a state of emergency for several municipalities after surveying the affected regions by helicopter. The governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom provided a combined $310,300 for the purchase of relief items. Although most storm victims received aid within a few days, the deteriorated road network caused a large delay in relief efforts to the hard-hit Mosquitia region. Sewage systems and waterworks countrywide were in serious need of restoration. With the destruction of its sole water reservoir, much of Puerto Cortés endured potable water <b>shortages</b> for <b>months</b> in Gert's wake. Public health concerns rose in the wake of Gert, with the cost of required medicines pinned at $208,000. A contamination of the water supplies in rural areas exacerbated a cholera outbreak. By September 28, about 27,000 residents unable to reenter their flooded homes remained in government shelters. Seven weeks later, a temporary housing project was implemented for the 120 families most in need. Approximately 5,900 families across Honduras lost their source of income due to the storm.|$|R

40|$|Food {{shortages}} occur periodically and predictably in over- {{populated areas}} of {{the foothills of the}} Himalaya, leading to extensive out-migration and to indebtedness of farmers. A survey of four administrative areas and in-depth interviews of 120 households (a sample of diverse caste and ethnic groups, stratified by land area) was undertaken in two districts of western Nepal to document the severity of shortfall in local agricultural production and the range of household coping strategies. The duration of food <b>shortages</b> averaged 5 <b>months</b> of the year, but ranged enormously across households, with 4 % of sample families being entirely landless. Out-migration, wage labor, petty trade, high-interest loans, and land mortgage were well-established coping strategies, beneficial for some families in generating income and the possibility for investment, but for others leading to progressively greater debt, economic marginalisation and impoverishment. This study highlights the importance of encouraging diversified strategies for subsistence farmers to ensure cash revenue, much of which is derived from debt and emigration, and reviews the geographical and socio- economic factors influencing both constraints on household subsistence and responses to seasonal food deficits...|$|R

40|$|Unfortunately, drug {{shortages}} {{are common}} and unavoidable in modern healthcare. Current drug shortages in the United States include over 200 medications as of 4 / 21 / 2015. 1 These drug shortages create significant obstacles for clinicians {{and have a}} profound impact on the quality of healthcare. 2 The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) provides guidelines on how to manage drug shortages. 2 An effective plan to deal with drug shortages requires analysis at an individual hospital level and depends upon a number of factors: current drug inventory, purchasing history, frequency of use, and formulary costs of alternative agents (figure). Thus, each DASON member hospital must be responsible for creating a personalized drug shortage plan. Piperacillin/tazobactam has officially been on shortage since 4 / 2 / 2014. 3 The shortage has been critical over the past few months.

40|$|Taihu Lake, {{the third}} largest {{freshwater}} lake in China, {{is located in the}} Chanjiang Delta of the Yangtze River. Its waters are used by agriculture, industry and as major drinking water for several cities including Shanghai and Wuxi. The lake also is important for tourism, aquaculture and flood control. Taihu Lake and its surrounding areas are facing three major water-related threats: deteriorating water quality with inflow and runoff from its watershed; flooding during the rainy seasons; and water <b>shortages</b> during drier <b>months.</b> Noxious algae blooms are occurring with increasing frequency and water quality continues to decline. Remedial actions implemented to date have been ineffective. This paper proposes that the problems could be remedied by constructing a by-pass channel (BPC), which would divert low-quality water from the lake during low precipitation periods and allow better quality water to flow into the lake during high flow periods. This remedial action would simultaneously deal with the deteriorating water quality of Lake Taihu and maintain its water level at a desired level. A preliminary assessment of this strategy shows that, if the BPC were implemented, the water quality of Taihu Lake would be improved significantly in few years, the flood disaster would be greatly mitigated, and the water shortage problem in the basin would be alleviated...|$|R
40|$|Decades of {{conflict}} in eastern Myanmar have resulted in high prevalence of human rights violations and poor health outcomes. While recent ceasefire agreements have reduced conflict in this area, it is unknown whether this has resulted in concomitant reductions in human rights violations. We conducted a two-stage cluster survey of 686 households in eastern Myanmar to assess health status, access to healthcare, food security, exposure to human rights violations and identification of alleged perpetrators over the 12 months prior to January 2012, a period of near-absence {{of conflict}} in this region. Household hunger (FANTA- 2 scale) was moderate/high in 91 (13. 2 %) households, while the proportion of households reporting food <b>shortages</b> in each <b>month</b> of 2011 ranged from 19. 9 % in December to 47. 0 % in September, with food insecurity peaking {{just prior to the}} harvest. Diarrhea prevalence in children was 14. 2 % and in everyone it was 5. 8 %. Forced labor was the most common human rights violation (185 households, 24. 9 %), and 210 households (30. 6 %) reported experiencing one or more human rights violations in 2011. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified associations between human rights violations and poor health outcomes. Human rights violations and their health consequences persist despite reduced intensity {{of conflict in}} eastern Myanmar.

40|$|Well-targeted {{programs}} of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water can help overcome {{the problem of}} both floods and droughts, or in other terms meet the water demands for domestic as well as irrigation needs during the dry season. Addressing this, a novel form of conjunctive use management has been developed that involves strategically recharging floodwater in upstream areas to boost small-scale groundwater irrigation and to protect floodaffected areas downstream. For this, choice of site is a crucial component to implement the approach. A method was devised using GIS tools using readily available data from secondary sources {{to arrive at a}} suitability index to rank prospects across the entire Ganges basin. This basin was chosen because it has a well-known history of devastating flooding events and water <b>shortage</b> in dry <b>months</b> {{and is one of the}} largest and most heavily populated river basins in the world. Numerical modelling is being applied to an area characterized as having high prospects to help to understand the interactions between the groundwater and surface water and the impact of floods on groundwater system. One of the main components to be identified from the model is the peak flows to be captured successfully for recharge. This utilisation of high flows by diverting from the rivers to storage structures introduced within the model will help to identify the potential to manage and reduce the flood impact. This model can help to decide on the size and placement of the structures to store water for maximum recharge and subsequently in watershed management. The relationship between floodwater storage and recharge, and the optimisation of these two processes can also be brought out. Opportunities for conjunctive use of water identified by mapping and the understanding gained from modelling is to be piloted out in one of these sites to establish technical and institutional feasibility with the view to promoting larger-scale implementation...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{the main}} {{challenge}} facing animal husbandry in arid and semi-arid regions of the globe. These areas are characterized by a long dry season lasting between 6 and 8 months. At certain times during the long dry period, water can be so scarce that animals may face severe water shortages. Many {{studies have been conducted}} to highlight how ruminants cope during these times of severe water deprivation. Yet, livestock are much more often exposed to mild water <b>shortages</b> for several <b>months</b> in a year. Only a few studies have been conducted to investigate mild water restriction in ruminants, highlighting the effects on feed intake and blood parameters. However, the effects of mild water restriction on other physiological processes are yet to be studied. Therefore, the present study aimed at bridging this knowledge gap by investigating whether mild water restriction affects (a) the digestibility, digesta passage and faecal microbial biomass, (b) alters rumen fermentation, microbial yield and turnover, and (c) enhances nitrogen retention and shifts nitrogen excretion towards the faeces. Two feeding trials were conducted at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman, during the dry summer months (August-October) in 2013 and 2014. In each trial, three watering regimes (100 %, 85 % and 70 % of individual ad libitum consumption) were imposed to nine adult male Batinah goats in a 3 x 3 Latin Square design. Water intake, feed offered and refused, rumen fluid and solids, urine and faeces were quantified and their respective quality determined using standard procedures. The results revealed that mild water restriction does not affect feed intake and digesta passage of goats. However, there was an increase in apparent feed digestibility during water restriction but this was not associated with altered digesta kinetics. While the total faecal microbial mass was not affected by water restriction, the microbial community structure shifted towards fungal C when water was restricted to 70 % of ad libitum intake. Moreover, ammonium-N in the rumen fluid substantially increased when water was restricted to 70 % of ad libitum intake. Also, the proportion of butyrate increased when water was restricted to 70 % of ad libitum intake. These phenomena were associated with increases in protozoal counts when water intake decreased. Mild water restriction did neither affect the goats’ nitrogen balance nor the partitioning of nitrogen excretion between urine and faeces. Therefore, a restriction of the ad libitum water intake to 70 %, which is expected to occur more frequently with current climate change phenomena observed in the semi-arid tropics and subtropics, may be anticipated with serenity because it improves feed utilization in agro-pastoral farming systems without compromising the performance of regionally adapted goat breeds, and this observation may also pertain to other adapted breeds of domestic ruminants...|$|R
40|$|The West Australian {{election}} {{is likely to}} be a close-fought affair, according to Peter van Onselen THE West Australian election called for 26 February will be an interesting electoral test for the post-Latham Labor Party. It will be particularly interesting given that the new leader of federal Labor is WA’s own Kim Beazley. It should have come as no surprise to anyone that without the affable Beazley at the helm federal Labor lost two seats in the west at the last federal election, nearly losing two more. Meanwhile the Liberals held on to their marginal seats of Canning and Kalgoorlie. WA premier Geoff Gallop couldn’t keep the smile off his face when interviewed for the local 6 pm news following Latham’s resignation and Beazley’s announcement he was running for the leadership. WA attorney general Jim McGinty was the first senior Labor figure to publicly call for Latham to resign. Gallop called the election shortly after he did. Kim Beazley has indicated he will play his part in Gallop’s re-election bid. However he wasn’t doing the premier any favours last week when he announced he will be setting up a home base in Sydney to cut down on air travel. West Australians are parochial at the best of times. Gallop would have preferred Beazley kept his decision to spend more time over east private until after polling day. Last Wednesday night, the premier and opposition leader Colin Barnett squared off in the only leaders’ debate of the campaign. A leaders’ debate can be a valuable forum for an opposition leader, giving him an equal footing with the premier. Barnett used the stage to introduce his plan to build a canal from the Kimberley region in the north of the state to service water shortages in the state’s south-east. The ambitious project is a risky move for Barnett. As yet he has not given any details on how it would be funded, or exactly how much it will cost. The unsightly canal will also have to trail through a number of electorates to reach its destination. The federal treasurer, Peter Costello, appeared to distance himself from the project late last week, further complicating the issue for Barnett. The ambiguity attached to the proposal could mar the Coalition for the remainder of the campaign, even if the initial reaction in WA appears to have been positive. The proposal has a little bit of the Latham Medicare Gold about it. In contrast, Gallop looked polished and confident, even if he didn’t use the stage to make any significant announcements. He faced some tough questions about broken promises not to increase taxes and energy <b>shortages</b> from 12 <b>months</b> ago. These two issues are the reason he has never enjoyed a honeymoon period as leader and continues to trail in most polls. Barnett was effective at attacking Gallop on both these issues, even if as energy minister in the previous Court government he failed to take the necessary steps in reforming Western Power which served as the precursor to power outages on Labor’s watch. Last year I co-wrote a paper on the energy sector in WA for the academic journal Policy and Society. Our findings showed that Barnett was captured by the sector. As minister he failed to institute the long-terms reforms that were needed to guarantee supply into the coming decades. Nonetheless, voters know the outages happened while Labor were running the state, and blame them accordingly. Despite his failings as energy minister, Colin Barnett is no pushover. He is an experienced politician and policy wonk. He is a former head of the WA Chamber of Commerce, and he served as Richard Court’s deputy for eight years in government. As a minister he held a range of senior portfolios, and his television advertising campaign for this election draws voters attention to his past achievements. The Coalition’s message in the campaign is that voters have a choice between delays under Gallop or decisions under Barnett. Barnett’s past experience in government is essential in an Opposition Leader. It gives voters the confidence he could run the state. Federally, Beazley has the same experience; Mark Latham didn’t. This is why Beazley will be a much more dangerous opponent for Howard or Costello in 2007. This week Bob Hawke flew into Perth to help with Labor’s campaign. Both he and the premier launched into a scathing attack on the bias in reporting by the states only daily newspaper, the West Australian. Despite the lowest unemployment figures in the nation and the highest economic growth, both under Gallop’s stewardship, an editorial suggested voters face a ‘dismal choice’ on polling day. On the day of the debate the front page of the West carried a story of how the Labor Party is soft on drugs. That morning Barnett also launched his tough on drugs campaign. Labor’s chances of winning a second term in the west aren’t made any easier by the heavy rural malaportionment in the lower house. Rural voters are represented at the rate of about 2 : 1 over city voters. This favours the junior coalition partner the Nationals. The Labor Party tried to remove the malaportionment via parliament and the courts, but failed on both fronts. Rural voters are unlikely to thank Gallop at the polls for attempting to reduce their voting influence, no matter how undemocratic the present state of malaportionment might be. History tells us governments rarely get defeated after just one term. The last time it happened in WA was 1974, and before that 1933. But with just over three weeks left before polling day this election remains up for grabs. Peter van Onselen is a lecturer in politics at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia.
