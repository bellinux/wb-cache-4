[...] "The prevailing view", <b>says</b> <b>Alan</b> Friedman, [...] "was that if Washington wanted to prevent an Iranian victory, {{it would have to}} share some of its more sensitive intelligence photography with Saddam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kurzweil <b>says</b> <b>Alan</b> Turing's 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence {{launched}} {{the field of}} artificial intelligence. He admits that early progress in the field led to wild predictions of future successes which did not materialize. Kurzweil feels intelligence is the [...] "ability to use optimally limited resources" [...] to achieve goals. He contrasts recursive solutions with neural nets, he likes both but specifically mentions how valuable neural nets are since they destroy information during processing, which if done selectively is essential to making sense of real-world data. A neuron either fires or not [...] "reducing the babble of its inputs to a single bit". He also greatly admires genetic algorithms which mimic biological evolution to great effect.|$|E

60|$|I <b>say</b> <b>Alan</b> did as I did. Not {{that ever}} I looked at him, for I had enough ado {{to keep my}} feet; {{but because it is}} plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself, and looked as little where we were going, or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men.|$|R
6000|$|... "This crowns all!" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Alan.</b> [...] "Well, and I'm glad I came to Dunkirk. And so {{this was}} your business, was it? Halvers, I'm thinking?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Alan,</b> [...] "I am nae weathercock. Thirty guineas, if ye land {{me on the}} sea-side; and sixty, if ye {{put me in the}} Linnhe Loch." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' said John, thrilling, he {{knew not}} why, with communicated terror. 'No, I heard nothing; why?' And then, {{as there was}} no answer, he reverted to his pleading: 'But I <b>say,</b> <b>Alan,</b> you've just got to take me in. I'll go right away to bed if you have {{anything}} to do. I seem to have been drinking; I was that knocked over. I wouldn't turn you away, Alan, if you were down on your luck.' ...|$|R

When Michael's Americanophile friend Tex mentions that [...] "idol has gotta be Wayne", Alan mistakenly concludes he means Sleep. Tex tries to correct this misconception by drawling [...] "Get on yer horse and drink yer milk" [...] in an approximation of John Wayne's voice, but Alan is merely further confirmed in his belief that Sleep is the man to whom Tex is referring.|$|R

6000|$|... "Are ye {{there with}} it?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Alan,</b> looking back. [...] "The best day's work that ever either of ye did yet! And I'm bound to say, my dawtie, ye {{make a real}} bonny couple." ...|$|E

50|$|Andrew Berman {{says the}} film began when Warner Bros {{approached}} him <b>saying</b> <b>Alan</b> Arkin and Peter Falk {{wanted to do}} a movie together. Bergman said:I thought immediately, ‘Didn’t they do a movie?’ It’s like, they seemed so perfect for each other! Their personalities, you have a rabbit and a tortoise. You get a hysteric, a person who seems to have no feelings whatsoever…and I hate constructing plots, hate it more than anything, but I love constructing characters, and this was the perfect thing where the characters were the plot. Whatever Peter said to Alan, that was the plot... Since my stories are always about people getting in way over their heads... this movie was the perfect type for me.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's highly possible," [...] said he, sighing. [...] "But {{it seems}} strange ye shouldna carry it. However, as I was <b>saying,</b> this <b>Alan</b> Breck is a bold, desperate customer, and well kennt to be James's right hand. His life is forfeit already; he would boggle at naething; and maybe, if a tenant-body was to hang back {{he would get}} a dirk in his wame." ...|$|R

50|$|When Grandpa reveals he is a vampire, the Frog {{brothers}} {{try to kill}} him, but Sam stops them. Grandpa {{informs the}} Frogs that he is only a half vampire, and he feeds on animals {{in order to stay}} that way. When they ask him why killing Max did not restore his humanity, he tells them it is because Max didn't turn him, but The Widow Johnson did. Grandpa leads the boys to her house, and they go into the basement, only to be attacked by a swarm of female vampires. One of them over-powers Alan, so he yells for Edgar to help him. Edgar <b>says</b> to <b>Alan</b> that everything will be fine, but then <b>Alan</b> <b>says</b> the vampire forced him to drink her blood, and that he enjoyed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all here; <b>Alan</b> <b>says</b> there's {{nothing to}} add. I've {{been trying to}} {{understand}} it, but I can't quite realize it yet. The paper and the letter came together. I suppose he waited a few days, thinking he had cabled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An advocate, then, it'll have to be," [...] I continued, [...] "and I {{think it}} a more {{suitable}} trade for a gentleman that was three times disarmed.

Now, what <b>say</b> you, <b>Alan?</b> Could not a cadet of Royal Ecossais get a furlough, slip over the marches, and call in upon a Leyden student!" ...|$|R
