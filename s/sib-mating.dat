Although biparental inbreeding is likely to influence the dynamics of inbreeding depression {{and the evolution of}} selfing rates, it has received limited theoretical attention in comparison to selfing. The only previous model suggested that biparental inbreeding can favour the maintenance of stable intermediate selfing rates, but made unrealistic assumptions about the genetic basis of inbreeding depression. Here we extend a genetic model of inbreeding depression, describing nearly recessive lethal mutations at {{a very large number of}} loci, to incorporate <b>sib-mating.</b> We also include a constant component of inbreeding depression modelling the effects of mildly deleterious, nearly additive alleles. We analyze how observed rates of <b>sib-mating</b> influence the mean number of heterozygous lethals alleles and inbreeding depression in a population reproducing by a mixture of self-fertilization, <b>sib-mating</b> and outcrossing. We finally use the ensuing relationship between equilibrium inbreeding depression and population selfing rate to infer the evolutionarily stable selfing rates expected under such a mixed mating system. Results: We show that for a given rate of inbreeding, <b>sib-mating</b> is more efficient at purging inbreeding depression than selfing, because homozygosity of lethals increases more gradually through <b>sib-mating</b> than through selfing. Because <b>sib-mating</b> promotes the purging of inbreeding depression and the evolution of selfing, our genetic model of inbreeding depression also predicts that <b>sib-mating</b> is unlikely to maintain stable intermediate selfing rates. Conclusions: Our results imply that even low rates of <b>sib-mating</b> affect plant mating system evolution, by facilitating the evolution of selfing via more efficient purging of inbreeding depression. Alternative mechanisms, such as pollination ecology, are necessary to explain stable mixed selfing and outcrossing...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{inbreeding}} by <b>sib-mating</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful ecological strategies in the bark beetle family Scolytinae. Within this family, the many species (119) in Coccotrypes are found breeding in an exceptional variety of untraditional woody tissues different from bark and phloem. Species delineation by morphological criteria is extremely difficult, however, as in most other inbreeding groups of beetles, perhaps due to the unusual evolutionary dynamics characterizing <b>sib-mating</b> organisms. Hence, we here performed a phylogenetic analysis using molecular data in conjunction with morphological data to better understand mor-phological and ecological evolution in this <b>sib-mating</b> group. We used partial DNA sequences from the nuclear gene EF-a and the mitochondrial genes 12 S and CO 1 to elucidate patterns of morphological evolution, haplotype variation, and evolutionary pathways in resource use. Sequence variation was high among species and far above that expected at the species level (e. g., 19 % for CO 1 within Coccotrypes advena). The tendency for exhaustive sequence variation at deeper nodes resulted in ambiguous reconstructions of the deepest splits. However, all results suggested that species with the broadest diets were clustered in a single derived position—another piece of evidence against specialization as a derived evolutionary feature. 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|A natural {{population}} of Drosophila melanogaster from a cellar was followed {{throughout the year}} and its genetic structure analysed by a <b>sib-mating</b> approach (based on distributions of viability ratio in <b>sib-mating</b> offspring) and enzymatic polymorphism. Flies found early in spring, that had resisted cold temperature and food shortage during winter, were free of deleterious factors; no inbreeding depression was observed in the viability of their immediate descendants. In contrast, a population established during winter in a bucket of ripe fruit placed in the cellar, showed a high frequency of lethals. In both cases, the increasing effective size that followed the return of a favorable environment was associated with an inbreeding depression in further generations. The collected flies were highly heterozygous at enzyme loci, although the pattern was perturbed by drift and sampling error. The genetic structure of the populations may thus depend not only on effective population size but also on selection favoring heterozygotes either free of or bearing lethals (according to the conditions encountered). The observation of an annual cycle of change in enzymatic and deleterious allele frequencies, and degree of heterozygosity, depends then on when and how flies are collected...|$|E

The finding that sexuals fail to use genetic cues to avoid sib-matings cannot be attributed to the cost of recognition errors because any recognition system that would lead to a better than random ability to avoid <b>sib-mating</b> should be selected for when there are costs to inbreeding.

Hybrid vigor for in vitro callus growth {{may be useful}} in the selection of hybrid colonies following protoplast fusions involving N. tabacum. Seedlings of burley tobacco, grown in a greenhouse, were heterotic (P = 0. 01) for dry weight production. Heterosis for seedling vigor could contribute to maintaining re-sidual heterozygosity in selfed and <b>sib-mated</b> lines of tobacco. Phenotypic correlations of seedling dry weight with in vitro callus growth and root production were positive and sig-nificant (P = 0. 05). However, specific combining ability effects for in vivo seedling growth and in vitro callus growth were uncorrelated(r = 0. 00). These results indicate that specific intra-allelic gene interactions that promoted seedling growth were unrelated to gene com-binations that promoted in vitro callus growth.

Quail from the T-line, which had developed an inherent ability to resist the growth depressing effects of thiouracil stress, were observed to be as susceptible to heat stress as the P-line. Selected quail lines were observed to be less tolerant to high temperature stress than nonselected controls. Quail selected on a 20 percent protein diet containing 0. 2 percent thiouracil de-veloped the ability to resist the growth depressing effect of thiouracil (Marks, 1971). When evaluated under several nutritional regimes, this line of quail also had higher mean four-week body weights and lower mortality than quail selected on a conventional 28 percent protein diet. Parsons (1959) reported genetic differences in survival of Drosophila under tempera-ture stress with a mass inbred line being more resistant than <b>sib-mated</b> inbreds.

40|$|The beetle family Scolytidae {{includes}} several groups having regular <b>sib-mating</b> and extremely female-biased sex ratios. Two such groups {{are known to}} include haplodiploid species: (i) the tribe Xyleborini and (ii) Coccotrypes and related genera within the tribe Dryocoetini. Relationships of these groups have been controversial. We analysed elongation factor 1 -α (852 bp) and cytochrome oxidase 1 (1179 bp) sequences for 40 species. The most-parsimonious trees imply a single origin of haplodiploidy uniting Xyleborini (approximately 1200 species) and <b>sib-mating</b> Dryocoetini (approximately 160 species). The sister-group of the haplodiploid clade is the outcrossing genus Dryocoetes. The controversial genus Premnobius is outside the haplodiploid clade. Most haplodiploid scolytids exploit novel resources, ambrosia fungi or seeds, but a few have the ancestral habit of feeding on phloem. Thus, scolytids provide the clearest example of W. D.

40|$|Background: Bacteria of {{the genus}} Wolbachia are {{reproductive}} parasites widespread among arthropods. The most common effect arising from the presence of Wolbachia in a population is Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), whereby postmating reproductive isolation occurs in crosses between an infected male and an uninfected female, or when a male is infected with a different strain of Wolbachia {{to that of the}} female (bidirectional CI). Previous theoretical models have demonstrated that bidirectional CI can contribute to the genetic divergence of populations in haploid and diploid organisms. However, haplodiploid organisms were not considered in these models even though they include Nasonia parasitoid wasps - the best example of the implication of Wolbachia in ongoing speciation. Moreover, previous work did not investigate inbreeding mating systems, which are frequently observed in arthropod species. Results: We developed a stochastic two-island model which simulated three genetic scenarios, diploidy, haploidy, and haplodiploidy, with two CI phenotypes being considered for the latter: (1) male development of female progeny; and (2) mortality of fertilized eggs. We also investigated the effect of varying the proportion of sib mating. In the model each allopatric population was initially fixed for a single allele at a nuclear locus under positive selection and infected with one strain of Wolbachia. Each simulation presupposed that the two populations were fixed for a different allele and a different strain of Wolbachia. The degree of genetic differentiation observed in the locus under selection due to bidirectional CI was much lower for the two haplodiploid phenotypes than for either diploids or haploids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <b>sib-mating</b> may compensate for the lower efficiency of bidirectional CI in haplodiploids by maintaining genetic divergence. Conclusion: Our model suggests that maintenance of genetic differentiation facilitated by Wolbachia is more likely to occur in diploids and haploids than in haplodiploids. However, increasing the level of <b>sib-mating</b> may compensate for the weak effect of bidirectional CI in haplodiploids. Our work therefore gives a potential explanation for why the haplodiploid Nasonia species, which are infected with bidirectionally incompatible Wolbachia strains and undergo <b>sib-mating,</b> have differentiated genetically and maintained this differentiation without premating isolation...|$|E

A majority of the BC 1 progenies were triploid and the progenies from <b>sib-mating</b> were tetraploid or near tetraploids. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique was applied to assess the intergenomic recombination in the BC 1 populations of LA and OA hybrids obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. A total of 63 LA (LA × AA and AA × LA) and 53 OA hybrids were analysed. LA hybrids were originated through the functioning of 2 n gametes either as 2 n eggs or 2 n pollen while those of OA hybrids originated through functional 2 n pollen of diploid OA genotype. In both type of crosses, a majority of the progenies had originated through First Division Restitution (FDR) mechanism of functional 2 n gamete either with or without a cross over. However, there were nine LA- and four OA-genotypes where Indeterminate Meiotic Restitution (IMR) was the mechanism of 2 n gamete formation. Based on GISH, total amount of introgression of Longiflorum and Oriental genome into Asiatic genome was determined. Most of the BC progenies exhibited recombination and the amount of recombination was higher in LA hybrids as compared to OA hybrids. Intergenomic recombination was also determined cytologically in the 16 plants of sib-mated LA hybrids where both parents had contributed 2 n gametes. Based on these results the nature of interspecific lily hybrids obtained from uni- and bilateral sexual polyploidization leading to allotriploid and allotetraploid formation is discussed in the context of introgression and intergenomic recombinatio...|$|E

For the special case of <b>sib-mating</b> exclusion and Poisson distribution of family size, the formula simplifies to N(e) = N + 1, which differs from the previous results derived by many authors by a value of one.

Here, we develop a model that extends previous theoretical approaches by including segregation of bacterial strains during transmission as well as a continuum of breeding systems ranging from inbreeding (complete sib mating) to outbreeding (complete <b>sib-mating</b> avoidance). Our results demonstrate that (1) with segregation of strains, evolution is unlikely to lead to new CI types that co-occur as a double infection with the preexisting one, (2) inbreeding substantially hampers the evolution of new CI types, and (3) outbreeding facilitates the evolution of new CI types.

40|$|Sex ratio theory {{provides}} {{a clear and}} simple way to test if nonsocial haplodiploid wasps can discriminate between kin and nonkin. Specifically, if females can discriminate siblings from nonrelatives, then {{they are expected to}} produce a higher proportion of daughters if they mate with a sibling. This prediction arises because in haplodiploids, inbreeding (<b>sib-mating)</b> causes a mother to be relatively more related to her daughters than her sons. Here we formally model this prediction for when multiple females lay eggs in a patch, and test it with the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Our results show that females do not adjust their sex ratio behaviour dependent upon whether they mate with a sibling or nonrelative, in response to either direct genetic or a range of indirect environmental cues. This suggests that females of N. vitripennis cannot discriminate between kin and nonkin. The implications of our results for the understanding of sex ratio and social evolution are discussed...|$|E

According to Hamilton's ‘haplodiploidy hypothesis’, this diversity reflects the relatedness consequences of diploid vs. haplodiploid inheritance. However, an alternative ‘preadaptation hypothesis’ instead emphasises an interplay of ecology and the co-option of ancestral, sexually dimorphic traits for sib-rearing. The preadaptation hypothesis has recently received empirical support, but remains to be formalised. Here, we mathematically model the coevolution of sex-specific helping and sex allocation, contrasting these hypotheses. We find that ploidy per se has little effect. Rather, the ecology of sex shapes patterns of helping: sex-specific preadaptation strongly influences who helps; a freely adjustable sex ratio magnifies sex biases and promotes helping; and <b>sib-mating,</b> promiscuity, and reproductive autonomy also modulate the sex and abundance of helpers.

This idea was explored by two different approaches. In a study on patch-time allocation, we used females from ten populations and measured patch-residence times of individuals that visited multiple patches at different encounter rates. In a more detailed approach, thelytokous and arrhenotokous females from a single location were observed continuously while foraging, and all behaviors were recorded.

Whereas thelytokous females used foraging information to maximize their efficiency at high patch-encounter rates, arrhenotokous females merely reduced the number of offspring produced without changing patch times.

To directly assess how females and males pair in natural populations, we sampled 225 mating pairs, genotyped them at six microsatellite loci, and analysed the correlation between mating status and genetic relatedness. This analysis revealed pangamy, i. e. a random association of male and female genotypes. In addition, indirect methods inferred that sib-groups of ticks exploit distinct individual-cows, and hence that ticks probably move among cows during their parasitic lifetime. Altogether, these results negate the expectation of a high frequency of <b>sib-mating,</b> and show the coexistence of genetically diverging stocks within tick cohorts and populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When some {{combinations}} of maternal and paternal alleles have a detrimental effect on offspring fitness, females {{should be able}} to choose mates {{on the basis of their}} genetic compatibility. In numerous Hymenoptera, the sex of an individual depends of the allelic combination at a specific locus (single-locus Complementary Sex Determination), and in most of these species individuals that are homozygous at this sexual locus develop into diploid males with zero fitness. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this paper, we tested the hypothesis of genetic incompatibility avoidance by investigating <b>sib-mating</b> avoidance in the solitary wasp parasitoid, Venturia canescens. In the context of mate choice we show, for the first time in a non-social hymenopteran species, that females can avoid mating with their brothers through kin recognition. In "no-choice" tests, the probability a female will mate with an unrelated male is twice as high as the chance of her mating with her brothers. In contrast, in choice tests in small test arenas, no kin discrimination effect was observed. Further experiments with male extracts demonstrate that chemical cues emanating from related males influence the acceptance rate of unrelated males. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are compatible with the genetic incompatibility hypothesis. They suggest that the female wasps recognize sibs on the basis of a chemical signature carried or emitted by males possibly using a "self-referent phenotype matching" mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Haplodiploidy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} mechanisms of sex determination in animals. In many Hymenoptera, including all hitherto investigated social species, diploid individuals, which are heterozygous at the sex locus, develop as females, whereas haploid, hemizygous individuals develop as males (single-locus complementary sex determination, sl-CSD). Inbreeding leads to homozygosity at the sex locus, resulting in the production of diploid males, which are usually sterile and constitute a considerable fitness cost. Nevertheless, regular inbreeding without diploid male production is known from several solitary wasps, suggesting that in these species sex is not determined by sl-CSD but alternative mechanisms. Here, we examine sex determination in an ant with regular inbreeding, Cardiocondyla obscurior. The almost complete absence of diploid males after 10 generations of brother-sister mating in the laboratory documents for the first time the absence of sl-CSD and CSD with two or a few unlinked sex loci in a species of social Hymenoptera. Queens, which mated with a brother, appeared to decrease the number of males in their brood, as expected from the relatedness relationships under inbreeding. In contrast, some colonies began to show signs of an inbreeding depression after several generations of <b>sib-mating,</b> such as shortened queen life span, higher brood mortality, and a shift to more male-biased sex ratios in some colonies, presumably due to lower insemination capability of sperm.

However, we found a deficit of heterozygotes relative to Hardy–Weinberg expectations for most of the loci and in many collection sites, indicating a high level of inbreeding. This {{may be the result of}} founder effects and <b>sib-mating.</b> A high level of overall population genetic differentiation among B. glabrata collection sites suggested low gene flow at this rela-tively small spatial scale in this region. However, subsequent analyses also indicated that these patterns may also result from founder events and that an exchange of individuals between particular collection sites does exist. The isolation-by-distance correlation between collection sites of B. glabrata was found to be significant. However, only approximately 6 % of the variance in FST was explained by geographic distances suggesting that there are other factors affecting genetic differentiation among these collection sites. It is likely that the current population genetic structure reflects patterns of both migration and founder events. Results from this study are important for understanding the potential for local adaptation between schistosomes and their snail hosts at this epidemiologically relevant scale...|$|E
40|$|While phylogeographic {{patterns}} of organisms are often interpreted through past environmental disturbances, mediated by climate changes, and geographic barriers, {{they may also}} be strongly influenced by species-specific traits. To investigate the impact of such traits, we focused on two Eurasian spruce bark beetles that share a similar geographical distribution, but differ in their ecology and reproduction. Ips typographus is an aggressive tree-killing species characterized by strong dispersal, whereas Dendroctonus micans is a discrete inbreeding species (<b>sib-mating</b> is the rule), parasite of living trees and a poor disperser. We compared genetic variation between the two species over both beetles' entire range in Eurasia with five independent gene fragments, to evaluate whether their intrinsic differences could have an influence over their phylogeographic patterns. We highlighted widely divergent {{patterns of}} genetic variation for the two species, and argue that the difference is indeed largely compatible with their contrasting dispersal strategies and modes of reproduction. In addition, genetic structure in I. typographus divides European populations in a northern and a southern group, as was previously observed for its host plant, and suggests past allopatric divergence. A long divergence time was estimated between East Asian and other populations of both species, indicating their long-standing presence in Eurasia, prior to the last glacial maximum. Finally, the strong population structure observed in D. micans for the mitochondrial locus provides insights into the recent colonization history of this species, from its native European range to regions where it was recently introduced.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} studies {{were conducted in}} Andhra Pradesh, India, {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a rapid screening method using Perl's Prussian blue stain for screening grain samples from different pearl millet genotypes for zinc (Zn) content. A total of 29 entries representing a wide range of grain Zn concentrations was evaluated in 5 different seasons for genotype × environment interaction. The estimation of grain Zn content was done using the sib-mated grain samples from the 2005 rainy and 2006 summer seasons following the AAS method. Of these, 9 pearl millet genotypes with a wide range of grain Zn content were chosen to standardize the DTZ staining procedure. The procedure was further validated using the grain samples of the remaining 20 entries obtained from <b>sib-mating.</b> Results showed that whole grain flour of pearl millet genotypes with different Zn concentrations, when treated with DTZ stain, showed an increase in the intensity of red colour formation with increasing Zn concentration. The intensity of red colour varied in genotypes having low, medium and high grain Zn content. In genotypes having high Zn content, the red colour was more intense than in those having medium Zn content. The intensity of red colour was very less or none in genotypes having less than 37 mg Zn/kg. DTZ staining can therefore be useful at least in separating flour samples with Zn concentrations lower than 40 mg/kg. These results suggested that DTZ staining was effective in separating genotypes with high and low Zn contents. The cost analysis of DTZ staining protocol showed that the chemical cost per sample was approximately US$ 0. 75, which showed that this method was simple, rapid and inexpensive...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation {{of the great}} spruce bark beetle, Dendroctonus micans (Kugelann), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), for the EU. D. micans is a well-defined and distinguishable species, recognised mainly as a pest of spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) in Eurasia. Attacks on other conifers (Abies spp., Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii) are also reported. Supposedly originating from north-eastern Eurasia, D. micans has spread westward and is now distributed throughout the EU (22 Member States). It is a quarantine pest listed in Annex IIB of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC for Greece, Ireland and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Jersey) as protected zones. Wood, wood products, bark and wood packaging material of the conifers genera listed as hosts are considered as the main pathways for the pest, which is also able to disperse several kilometres by flight. The <b>sib-mating</b> habits of the species allow each single female {{to start a new}} colony on her own. The pest’s wide current geographic range suggests that it is able to establish anywhere in the EU where its hosts are present. The beetles attack living trees and usually complete their life cycle without killing their host, except under epidemic conditions at the limits of their distribution range, where hundreds of thousands of trees can be killed. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) is particularly susceptible. Biological control using the very specific predatory beetle, Rhizophagus grandis, is a widespread and efficient option that has been implemented in all areas suffering from outbreaks. It is complemented by sanitary thinning or clear-felling. All criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as potential protected zone quarantine pest were met. The criteria for considering D. micans as a potential regulated non-quarantine pest are not met since plants for planting are not the main pathway...|$|E
40|$|Progress in malaria {{control has}} led to a {{significant}} reduction of the malaria burden. Interventions that interrupt transmission are now needed to achieve the elimination goal. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) that aim to prevent mosquito infections represent promising tools and several vaccine candidates targeting different stages of the parasite's lifecycle are currently under development. A mosquito-midgut antigen, the anopheline alanyl aminopeptidase (AnAPN 1) is one of the lead TBV candidates; antibodies against AnAPN 1 prevent ookinete invasion. In this study, we explored the transmission dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum in mosquitoes fed with anti-AnAPN 1 monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) vs. untreated controls, and investigated whether the parasite genetic content affects or is affected by antibody treatment. Exposure to anti-AnAPN 1 mAbs was efficient at blocking parasite transmission and the effect was dose-dependent. Genetic analysis revealed a significant <b>sib-mating</b> within P. falciparum infra-populations infecting one host, as measured by the strong correlation between Wright's F-IS and multiplicity of infection. Treatments also resulted in significant decrease in F-IS as a by-product of drop in infra-population genetic diversity and concomitant increase of apparent panmictic genotyping proportions. Genetic differentiation analyses indicated that mosquitoes fed on a same donor randomly sampled blood-circulating gametocytes. We did not detect trace of selection, as the genetic differentiation between different donors did not decrease with increasing mAb concentration and was not significant between treatments for each gametocyte donor. Thus, there is apparently no specific genotype associated with the loss of diversity under mAb treatment. Finally, the anti-AnAPN 1 mAbs were effective at reducing mosquito infection and a vaccine aiming at eliciting anti-AnAPN 1 mAbs has a strong potential to decrease the burden of malaria in transmission- blocking interventions without any apparent selective pressure on the parasite population...|$|E
40|$|Inbred lines (F {{congruent}} to 1. 0) {{are commonly}} used {{in the development of}} commercial maize (Zea mays L.) single-cross hybrids (SC) in the developed Countries. Because of the high inbreeding depression for grain yield the higher price of the SC seeds limit its use by the majority of the farmers in the developing countries of Latin America. One way to Circumvent the problem would be the use of partly inbred lines selected for combining ability and for uniformity within the lines. The maintenance of their genetic integrity due to the variability within partly inbred lines, however, could limit the development of SC from partly inbred lines. Therefore, the objective of this research was to compare original S- 3 lines and maintained S- 3 lines to Study their feasibility to develop commercial SC from crosses of S- 3 lines. Eight and 10 original S- 3 lines from BR- 105 and from BR- 106 population, respectively, selected for combining ability and for uniformity, and their Counterparts maintained by <b>sib-mating</b> and mild selection for five generations were evaluated per se, in testcrosses with two testers, and by AFLP-based genetic similarity analysis. The S- 3 lines were maintained using 150 plants per line per generation with mild selection for uniformity; at least 75 plants per line per generation were saved. The results showed that three and two of the 12 traits evaluated as the line per se for the lines from BR- 105 and from BR- 106 population, respectively, changed significantly; whereas the testcrosses from original and maintained lines did not show any significant change. The genetic similarities estimates were high and the upper bound of the confidence interval for most of the lines reach the limit value (1. 0). These results Suggested that the genetic integrity of the S- 3 lines was maintained, which could allow the use of partly inbred S- 3 lines for the commercial development of maize single-crosses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Arabidopsis lyrata {{is a close}} outcrossing {{relative}} of Arabidopsis thaliana, the model organism of plant physiology and molecular biology. I studied variation in flowering time and the factors shaping the variation within and between A. lyrata populations in different environments. The role of the two important proximate factors determining flowering time, day length and temperature, were studied in climate chambers. The southern A. lyrata populations were found to flower in high frequency and quicker than northern A. lyrata populations in all studied environments, but the reaction of northern populations on long day length {{was found to be}} stronger than that of southern populations. Differences in vernalization requirement between A. lyrata populations were found in outdoor common garden, but in the climate chambers the results of vernalization experiments were not consistent. Strength and direction of selection on flowering time and other life history traits were studied in alpine and lowland A. lyrata populations in Scandinavia. Differences in selection were found both between populations and between years. Grazing sheep caused high levels of damage in inflorescences in the alpine population. In the lowland population there was less herbivory, caused by insects and hares. The difference in selection on flowering traits in the two study populations might be partly caused by selective grazing. Completely outcrossing mating system in A. lyrata is due to well developed self-incompatibility system. However, biparental inbreeding is likely to exist in natural populations and it may lead to spatial structuring of genetic variation within populations. I studied the effects of biparental inbreeding on components of fitness in A. lyrata in three different environments. I found inbreeding depression after <b>sib-mating</b> to be substantial. Stressful environment reduced the overall performance of the plants, but had no effect on the magnitude of inbreeding depression. A literature survey indicates that the observed levels of inbreeding depression in self-incompatible A. lyrata were higher than those of self-compatible species. This suggests that self-compatible species have purged some of their genetic load. The genetic basis of flowering time variation in A. lyrata can be further studied by using A. thaliana molecular tools...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Gynoecious {{inbred lines}} of {{cucumbers}} (Cucumis sativus L.) with high (HF), medium (MF) and low (LF) percentage of gynoecious plants {{were used in}} crosses with monoecious Chinese cultivars with high (HN), medium (MN) and low (LN) percentage of nodes with female flowers. F₁ and F₂ progenies from these parents crossed in all combinations were studied {{to determine the effect}} of levels of female flowering expression of gynoecious and monoecious parents on the percent gynoecious plants. The effect of mating systems on percent gynoecious plants and percent gynoecious plants with Chinese cucumber characters, wart-spine and long fruit, was studied in F₃ families from crosses of HF, MF, and LF gynoecious lines with an HN monoecious parent. The effect of planting date on percent gynoecious plants recovered was studied in the F₂ progenies of an HF gynoecious line crossed with Taishan, an MN monoecious cultivar. Level of female flowering tendency, expressed by percentage of female flowering nodes, in the monoecious parents had a much greater effect on the percentage of gynoecious plants in the F₁ and F₂ generation than did the degree of female flowering in the gynoecious parents. The effect of the gynoecious parent and the interaction of gynoecious X monoecious parent on percent gynoecious plants in the F₁ were non significant. In the mating system study, self pollination of selected completely gynoecious plants, requiring male flowering induction by chemical treatment, was significantly more effective in obtaining highly gynoecious progeny lines than selfing predominately gynoecious plants or <b>sib-mating</b> predominately gynoecious and completely gynoecious plants. There was no interaction between mating system and level of female flowering in the gynoecious parents. Planting date did not affect the percent of plants producing male flowers during the entire growing period, but early planting produced fewer plants with male flowers {{during the first half of}} their respective growing period than late plantings. By the end of the season, early and late planting were about equal in percentage of gynoecious plants, because a higher percentage of plants in the early plantings reverted from gynoecious to monoecious flowering during the last half of the growth period...|$|E
