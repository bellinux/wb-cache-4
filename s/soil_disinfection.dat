We surveyed 33 market gardeners producing lettuce and selling through three different marketing firms. Farmers used two alternative models to stagger harvests and three to introduce solarisation, based on increasing sheltered areas or number of lettuce cycles per year and reducing or abandoning summer crops. The choices of the farmers depended on their own leeway at the farm level or collective leeway at the supply basin level. Leeway at the farm level mainly depended on the area available under shelter and farm labourers' characteristics. The original result is that when no individual leeway is available or when its use affects {{the basic structure of}} the farm, marketing firms can enhance the technical innovations by developing closer economical and technical relations with their suppliers, orchestrating improved between-farm coordination and managing the diversity of technical systems and farms at the supply basin level.

This study was conducted in Omdurman city, which include, Omdurman, Karrari and Ombada localties, during the period from Augest 2006 to March 2007. 15 Boreholes were selected in the study area. These are distributed according to localities. The target samples were distributed in Omdurman, Karrari and Ombada localties, and were collected from Boreholes, Storage facilities, houses and Vendors, which are feeding the houses not connected to the network, samples were taken for laboratory analysis, which included chemical, physical and bacteriological examinations. The results of the study showed that, the majority of boreholes in study area were safe regarding chemical quality aspects. This included (F- NO 2 - NO 3 - CL – pH - TDS);the concentration of these parameters were within the allowable limits set by (WHO) and (SSMO). The samples taken from Elshab factory boreholes recorded high level of chlorides 7250 mg/l, exceeding the maximum permissible level of 250 mg/l, and TDS values, equaling 1023 mg/l, were also more than the maximum permissible level of 1000 mg/l in drinking water. Assessment of Groundwater Quality in Omdurman City 12 The results of physical quality of water samples, taken from the study area, were acceptable. The bacteriological analysis of the water samples taken from the boreholes in the study area recorded higher level of thermotolerant and Ecoli, (46 %) were more than the permissible levels set by (WHO) and (SSMO) standards. The results of samples taken from the Storage facilities showed that (66. 7 %) of these facilities were safe (not polluted). As for the Bacteriological quality of water samples taken from Houses, samples were found to be polluted by Ecoli and thermotolerant coliforms. It was observed that the contamination rate of water in houses which are not connected to the net work was (62. 3 %) higher in comparison with those directly connected to the net work. This demonstrates the importance of distribution system in alimentally the contamination rate.

While chemical <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> has been the method of choice in conventional farming systems, soil steaming has been the main strategy for the control of soil borne diseases in organic production. Both methods are extremely expensive and have been increasingly restricted for environmental reasons by government and organic standard setting bodies respectively. The use of tolerant varieties and of grafting onto resistant rootstocks were evaluated as potential replacements for soil steaming in organic and low input systems and found to be as effective in reducing root disease and increasing root fresh weight, fruit yield and number. The effects on fruit yield and quality characteristics were then further evaluated using different varieties for grafting and different growth media typically used in (a) organic (soil amended with manure), and (b) conventional (perlite fertilised with mineral fertilisers via the irrigation system) growth media/fertilisation regimes, and also a (c) novel “low input” growth medium designed to provide better aeration of the rooting zone.

During the most recent years it has even become a great challenge to control these weeds in conventional farming systems, although in comparison effective perennial weed control in organic farming systems remains more difficult. Without the option of herbicides, perennial weed control asks for a combination of proper timing and adequate mechanical weed control. Other options such as anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> may be useful as well. A field trial on marine loam soil in Lelystad was setup testing three mechanical weed control strategies and two anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> strategies to control Cirsium arvense, Rorippa sylvestris, Sonchus arvensis, Calystegia sepium, Equestium arvense, Tussilago farfara, Elymus repens, Rumex obtusifolius, and Polygonum amphibium. A rod weeder mounted behind a rigid-tine cultivator was compared with a broadcast root knife operating at 5 cm depth and at 15 cm. The machines were brought into action whenever weather conditions were suitable. Anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> treatments comprised the incorporation into the plough layer (c. 25 cm) of the weed biomass with 40 tons/ha fresh grass biomass or incorporation of the weed biomass alone. The grass was added to improve soil oxygen use thus lengthening the period with anaerobic conditions. Both treatments were covered with plastic sheets immediately after incorporation. The soil remained covered between 28 July and 15 October 2010. In the untreated control plots, soil coverage reached 100 % {{in the course of the}} season, regardless of weed species. Of the mechanical weed control methods the rod weeder showed the greatest reduction in soil coverage. Seven passes with the rod weeder between April 15 and August 12 reduced soil coverage from at least 90 % for Rorippa sylvestris to 99 % or more for Cirsium arvensis, Sonchus arvensis, Calystegia sepium, Equestium arvense, Tussilago farfara, and Polygonum amphihibium. Soil coverage was reduced less by treatments with the broadcast knife. Furthermore, soil coverage was reduced stronger by seven passes with the knife at 5 cm depth than after five passes with the knife at 15 cm, although cultivations at 15 cm were supposed to be more effective, needing fewer passes, than the root knife at 5 cm depth. The broadcast knife was most effective in controlling Cirsium arvensis, Sonchus arvensis, Equestium arvense, and Polygonum amphibium, resulting in at least 90 % reduction of soil coverage at both treatment depths. At Tussilago farfara this level of control was only reached after seven passes at 5 cm depth, the deeper cultivation only reaching 50 % reduction of soil coverage. Treatment of Calystegia sepium, Elymus repens and Rumex obtusifolius with the root knife showed a soil coverage reduction of between 45 and 75 % at 5 cm depth and between 15 and 40 % at a 15 cm working depth. Anaerobic <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> without fresh grass addition reduced soil coverage with at least 96 %, whereas addition of grass material increased this to at least 98. 5 %. Addition of fresh grass increased soil coverage reduction at all weed species compared with plastic sheets alone.

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> on {{bacterial}} communities. Soils were treated with an effective chemical fumigant chloropicrin and biofumigant mustard greens (Brassica juncea). While mustard greens did not affect the soil bacterial community structures very much, chloropicrin greatly reduced soil biomass and bacterial species richness. Chloropicrin also influenced the bacterial community structure, making the phylum Firmicutes dominant by occupying about 75 %. In more than two months, the proportion of Firmicutes was reduced to the basal level, and the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria became dominant. Since mustard greens worked as carbon sources for soil reduction, soils were treated with wheat bran and a low concentration of ethanol. Soil reduction with wheat bran and ethanol did not influence the soil bacterial community structures. Beta diversity analyzed by Principal Coordinate Analysis showed that bacterial communities in the soils except chloropicrin-applied soils formed a cluster. All together, biofumigant mustard greens, a probable substitute for chloropicrin, were demonstrated to cause much less damage on soil bacterial community than chemical chloropicrin...|$|E

Techniques such as soil steaming and soil solarization have been applied successfully. However, traditional steaming and solarization are unable to control viruses such as the Tobacco mosaic virus. Thus, methods for sustainable control of virus in soil are not available. Here, we tested the effect of short-duration soil steaming enhanced by the addition of exothermically reacting chemicals—potassium hydroxide or calcium oxide—and soil solarization. These methods were tested against three viruses having different stability: the highly stable Tobacco mosaic virus and the medium stable Potato virus Y, and the Cucumber mosaic virus as non-persistent control. Steaming was done in laboratory and open-field conditions after incorporation of exothermically reacting chemicals. Soils were solarized for 20  days using transparent polyethylene, ethylene–vinylacetate and high-effectiveness infrared films. Our results show that steaming with exothermic chemicals decreased the infectivity of the Tobacco mosaic virus below 3. 0  %. We also found that the Tobacco mosaic virus was not controlled by solarization. The Potato virus Y was totally controlled by steam treatments and by soil solarization with ethylene–vinylacetate or high-effectiveness infrared films. Overall, our findings evidence promising ways to control soil viruses...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{analysis}} is presented on {{the perspectives of}} highly insulated greenhouses for extensively heated greenhouse crops. Three crops were used as an example, ranging from Antirrhinum, with a yearly heating demand of 4 m³ of natural gas equivalents per m² to strawberry, with 13 m³ of gas consumption per m² per year. If Antirrhinum would be grown in a double glazed, highly insulated greenhouse with an energy recuperating dehumidification system, the remaining heat demand will be almost zero. Growing strawberries in such a greenhouse reduces the gas consumption for heating down to 7 m³/(m² year). When generating this heat with a heat pump, only 21 kWh/(m² year) will be needed for heating. In all greenhouse sectors, a tendency towards an intensified production by using artificial illumination can be seen. Illumination has a much higher impact on energy consumption than heating, so insulation of greenhouses for extensively heated crops is of less importance than improving the transmissivity or developing better lighting systems. Besides energy for heating and lighting, greenhouses use {{a substantial amount of}} energy for <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Here savings can be achieved by using biological disinfection, substrate systems or ozonized water. This project was funded by the research program ‘Kas als Energiebron’, the joined action and innovation program of the ministry of Economic affairs and LTO Glaskracht Nederland...|$|E
40|$|Grafting of {{vegetable}} transplants {{is a unique}} horticultural technology, which was adapted from the practice in perennial crops. However, rootstock/scion combinations may affect and alter the final size, yield, and quality of fruits of grafted plants, both immediately postharvest and during prolonged storage. We evaluated the effect of two rootstocks [TZ 148 and Nurit (commercial Cucurbita spp. hybrids) ] grafted on one scion (seedless watermelon cv. 1262) in two plant stands (2500 and 5000 plant ha- 1), on plant viability, number of marketable fruits (fruits weight above 5 kg) and fruit quality after one week storage at 20 °C, in non- or disinfested soil. <b>Soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> significantly improved the viability of non-grafted plants. All grafted plants significantly performed better vine vigor, with no wilt or vine decline symptoms, in either disinfested or non-treated soil, regardless {{of the type of}} the rootstock. Plant stand did not affect plant viability. The number of marketable watermelon fruits per m 2 was 75 to 700 % higher in grafted plants than in non-graft ed. Grafting on Nurit produced significantly more marketable fruits than grafting on TZ 148. The quality of fruits harvested from grafted plants was significantly better than non-grafted fruit in both plant stands and soils. Watermelons harvested from Nurit-grafted plants had better taste and texture and almost seedless compared to control and TZ- 148 -grafted plant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The current {{revision}} of pesticides in the EU, including those for <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection,</b> will necessitate {{the introduction of}} alternative integrated methods for the control of weeds and parasites in tobacco production in Italy. The present study compared the effect of some soil fumigants, biocontrol agents, cover crops and mulching for the control of tobacco weeds and root parasites. The {{results show that the}} different soil fumigants had an important role in increasing tobacco yield, due to their ability to control weeds and the nematodes Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne javanica. In particular, a typical nematicide like 1, 3 -dichloropropene did not control only nematodes but also Portulaca oleracea, a common weed in Italian tobacco fields. Fenamiphos, although showed a certain efficacy in controlling root-knot nematodes, did not generally have a satisfactory activity at the dose of 40 gm 1; cover crops like Trifolium squarrosum and Eruca sativa and a commercial formulation composed by the endomycorrhizal fungi Glomus spp., the antagonistic fungi Trichoderma spp. and bacteria including Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptomyces (Micosat F, CCS Aosta, Italy), were not able to control root tobacco diseases. The investigations confirmed that a prolonged monoculture causes a reduction of black root rot. Soil fumigation and the use of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), influencing the inoculum density of Chalara populations, can contribute to the maintenance or to the establishment of particularly unfavourable conditions for the saprophytic growth of the pathogen, leading to a lower development of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Verticillium wilt {{caused by}} the soilborne {{pathogen}} Verticillium dahliae {{is considered one of}} the most serious and destructive disease of chrysanthemum. After the ban of noxious chemicals for soil fumigation, including methyl bromide, alternative management strategies for control of V. dahliae such as biofumigation have assumed an increasing importance. This environmental friendly method is based on the glucosinolate-myrosinase system contained in Brassica plant cells which, in the presence of water, produces a number of toxic compounds, especially isothiocyanates, released in the soil after incorporation of brassicaceous green manures. Biofumigant products are also available in form of dry pellet or defatted seed meals (DSM) that contained glucosinolates ten times more concentrated than plant tissues. We tested in vitro the sensitivity of three V. dahliae morphologically distinct strains (10353, 10355, 10360) isolated from infected crysanthyemum plants cv. Veneri to two DSM differing in particle size (0. 3 or 1. 0 mm). Moreover, we use two different inoculum type: actively growing mycelium and mycelium derived from pathogen colonized seeds. The DL 90 values were subjected at ANOVA analysis and results showed that: i) 0. 3 mm DSM is more effective than 1 mm DSM, ii) different isolates of Verticillium dahliae show different sensitivity towards biofumigant treatments (10360 > 10353 > 10355), iii) mycelium developed from colonized seeds is less sensitive to the biofumigant treatments than active growing mycelium. These data although preliminary, suggest biofumigation can be a valuable tool for <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> against Verticillium dahliae. Further investigation will be performed in order to evaluated sensitivity of sclerotia derived mycelium to DSM...|$|E
40|$|Biological <b>Soil</b> <b>Disinfection</b> (BSD) or ‘soil resetting’ can technically, energetically and {{economically}} {{be an effective}} alternative to soil steaming. The program ‘Greenhouse as energy source’ of the Ministry of Economy, Agriculture and Innovation and the Dutch Horticultural Board gave fi nancial support to practical demonstrations and further development of this technology, in order to stimulate implementation of BSD in practice. Chrysanthemum growers, DLV Plant B. V., Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture and Thatchtec B. V. gained experience with BSD in four chrysanthemums companies. Additional research was conducted into possibilities {{to speed up the}} process and fi nd reliable process indicators. The disinfection and cultivation results (up to 5 cycles) was after BSD as good or better as after steaming in 3 of the 4 companies. Anaerobic conditions, one of the prerequisites for disinfection, were not achieved in the fourth company, which may explain the unsatisfactory disinfection. In intensive cultivation, three weeks without cultivation need {{to be included in the}} planning. Implementation in July offers the best fi t in terms of effectivity and income. The process can be shortened to 9 days by means of a higher Raw Proteine dose, but this leads to growth inhibition in the next cultivation. Adding a “primer” or “inoculum” with own soil bacteria does not suffi ciently increase the operational reliability, and is therefore deleted as a process step in the protocol. The disinfection process can be well monitored by means of oxygen measurement and total nematode counts. Additional indicators are the concentrations of nitrate, ammonium and bicarbonate in the 1 : 2 soil volume extract...|$|E
40|$|Replant disease (RD) {{severely}} affects apple {{production in}} propagation tree nurseries and in fruit orchards worldwide. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effects of <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> treatments on plant growth and health in a biotest in two different RD soil types under greenhouse conditions and to link the plant growth status with the bacterial community composition {{at the time of}} plant sampling. In the biotest performed we observed that the aboveground growth of apple rootstock M 26 plants after 8 weeks was improved in the two RD soils either treated at 50 °C or with gamma irradiation compared to the untreated RD soils. Total community DNA was extracted from soil loosely adhering to the roots and quantitative real-time PCR revealed no pronounced differences in 16 S rRNA gene copy numbers. 16 S rRNA gene-based bacterial community analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 454 -pyrosequencing revealed significant differences in the bacterial community composition even after 8 weeks of plant growth. In both soils, the treatments affected different phyla but only the relative abundance of Acidobacteria was reduced by both treatments. The genera Streptomyces, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Sphingomonas had a higher relative abundance in both heat treated soils, whereas the relative abundance of Mucilaginibacter, Devosia, and Rhodanobacter was increased in the gamma-irradiated soils and only the genus Phenylobacterium was increased in both treatments. The increased abundance of genera with potentially beneficial bacteria, i. e., potential degraders of phenolic compounds might have contributed to the improved plant growth in both treatments.

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Xiphinema {{index and}} X. diversicaudatum are {{nematodes}} that transmit the {{grapevine fanleaf virus}} and the Arabis mosaic virus, respectively. These viruses are the two agents mainly responsible for the disease that causes the most economic damage to grapevines worldwide. The infectious degeneration of grapevines affects vine performance and grape composition. The control of Xiphinema populations by <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> is now impossible because of the removal from the market of the last available chemical treatments. In this study, saponins are assessed as an alternative treatment to control nematode populations. Methods and Results: The nematicidal effect of saponins from Gypsophila paniculata roots was tested against X. index and X. diversicaudatum. In aqueous media, a concentration of 1 mg/mL {{was associated with a}} mortality of greater than 95 % in both nematodes, while in rearing soil, 73 % of X. index and 85 % of X. diversicaudatum were killed by 150 μg of saponins per gram of soil. In addition, an ecotoxicological study was undertaken on two soil bio-indicators (the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and soil nitrification) that revealed that they were not affected by Gy. paniculata saponins at a nematicidal concentration. In the soil, investigation of the major Gy. paniculata root saponins revealed that these molecules were completely degraded in the soil within 4 days. Conclusion: We show that Gy. paniculata saponins are an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment against two nematodes that transmit grapevine fanleaf virus. Significance of the Study: This saponin-based alternative to chemical treatments could provide an environmentally safe and efficient solution for vine growers to use against grapevine fanleaf vector nematodes...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} develop {{integrated}} crop management (ICM) systems in organic greenhouse production for improved control of tomato corky root rot (Pyrenochaeta lycopersici), tomato verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum), and cucumber powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii), compatible with and/or utilizing organic fertility management practices, while minimizing or eliminating permitted practices such as <b>soil</b> <b>disinfection</b> by steaming and foliar application of sulphur fungicide. Different concentrations of chitin (or chitosan -a water soluble form), fresh Brassica tissues, and cow manure based compost applied to soils infected with P. lycopersici alone and P. lycopersici plus V. albo-atrum reduced disease incidence and/or increased yield. However, efficacy differed between treatment types and concentrations. Compost or fresh Brassica tissue significantly increased soil microbial activity which may have increased competition and/or antagonism against soil pathogens, lowering disease incidence. Combining different treatments gave no synergistic or additive effects on incidence of both diseases, but the Brassica tissues plus chitosan combination improved yield. In tests of cultivar resistance/tolerance to the two pathogens, two "standard" cultivars were susceptible to both pathogens whilst the cherry type was tolerant to corky root rot, but not Verticillium. In soils infected with corky root rot only, grafting the cultivars onto a resistant root-stock effectively reduced disease incidence, but when infected with both pathogens, only one "standard" cultivar showed reduced disease incidence. In cucumbers, foliar application of chitosan reduced powdery mildew but Milsana® VP 2002 (a plant extract) was significantly better. Ampelomyces quisqualis and Pythium oligandrum (Biological Control Agents) were ineffective. There was no synergistic or additive effect detected with any combinations. Resistance/tolerance of cultivars significantly affected disease incidence. However, the more susceptible cultivar outyielded the tolerant one despite greater infection. Several components of an integrated strategy for control of diseases were identified with significant potential for development of more sustainable, organic protectedcropping systems.
