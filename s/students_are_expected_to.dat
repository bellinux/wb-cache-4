5|$|Undergraduate <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> fulfill most of {{the core}} {{requirements}} prior to the completion of their sophomore year; {{a wide variety of}} courses can be applied to this endeavor. Upon the completion of the Core Curriculum, students choose from approximately 50 major courses of study, in which they will receive their degree. One option is the personalized interdisciplinary major, which allows students to create their own course of study across various disciplines.

The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art.

Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

Even language professors frequently use the L-variant while explaining students the structure and usage of the H-variant; in essays, nevertheless, all <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> use H-variant.|$|E
25|$|After a {{competitive}} audition and interview, accepted students are streamed into Junior, Intermediate, or Senior Academy programs. This comprehensive program develops performance skills, musicianship, and academic excellence.

Through the support of private individuals and foundations, financial assistance is available for all students. Alumni of the Academy who have launched successful careers include Peter Simon, Katie Stillman, Eugene Nakamura, Marcin Swoboda, Janice LaMarre, Marta and Irena Kretchkovsky, and Karen Ouzounian.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of grade 9, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> take a standardised test {{in each of}} the first parts of their academic subjects. They again give these tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of grade 10.

The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies).|$|E
25|$|There are 972 {{schools in}} the territory. Most of these {{are located in the}} area's larger towns and villages. Attendance numbers {{diminish}} as one moves into the area's frontiers, particularly the vast, forested areas south of Ebolowa and Sangmélima. Here, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> walk long distances to attend school each day, or else to stay with relatives or alone in towns where schools are located. This problem is not as pronounced at the level of primary school, as these tend to be more widely distributed even in the remoter areas. Nevertheless, all {{schools in the}} province tend to be overcrowded.|$|E
25|$|Through {{its program}} of need-based {{financial}} aid, Yale commits {{to meet the}} full demonstrated financial need of all applicants.

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the European Commission {{presented}} {{a new strategy}} to decrease youth unemployment rate, which is close to 23% across the European Union. The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through work-based learning. Work-based learning for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students. The program also sets goals for learning foreign languages, and for teachers continued education. It also {{highlights the importance of}} using technology, especially the internet, in learning to make it relevant to students.|$|E
25|$|Since German {{universities}} do {{not offer}} accommodation or meals, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> organize and pay for board and lodging themselves. Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from Studentenwerk, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places {{for a fraction of}} students. Studentenwerk also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a Wohngemeinschaft (often abbreviated WG). Furthermore, many university students continue to live with their parents. One third to one half of the students works to make a little extra money, often resulting in a longer stay at university.|$|E
