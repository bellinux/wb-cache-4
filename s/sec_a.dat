500|$|The Chinese {{calendar}} was in need {{of reform}} since it inadequately measured the solar year at 365 ¼ days, giving an error of 10 min and 14 <b>sec</b> <b>a</b> year or roughly a full day every 128 years. Although the Ming had adopted Guo Shoujing's Shoushi calendar of 1281, which was just as accurate as the Gregorian Calendar, the Ming Directorate of Astronomy failed to periodically readjust it; this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the Ming and the Statutes of the Ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy. A sixth-generation descendant of the Hongxi Emperor, the [...] "Prince" [...] Zhu Zaiyu (1536–611), submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in 1595, but the ultra-conservative astronomical commission rejected it. This was the same Zhu Zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament, a discovery made simultaneously by Simon Stevin (1548–1620) in Europe. In addition to publishing his works on music, he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in 1597. A year earlier, the memorial of Xing Yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the Supervisor of the Astronomical Bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy; Xing would later serve with Xu Guangqi in reforming the calendar (Chinese: [...] ) in 1629 according to Western standards.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of transport vesicles that bud from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites {{is dependent on}} the COPII coat made up of three components: the small GTPase Sar 1, the Sec 23 / 24 complex, and the Sec 13 / 31 complex. Here, we provide evidence that apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG- 2), a Ca 2 +-binding protein of unknown function, regulates the COPII function at ER exit sites in mammalian cells. ALG- 2 bound to the Pro-rich region of <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A,</b> a ubiquitously expressed mammalian orthologue of yeast <b>Sec</b> 31, in <b>a</b> Ca 2 +-dependent manner and colocalized with <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> at ER exit sites. A Ca 2 + binding-deficient ALG- 2 mutant, which did not bind <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A,</b> lost the ability to localize to ER exit sites. Overexpression of the Pro-rich region of <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> or RNA interference-mediated <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> depletion also abolished the ALG- 2 localization at these sites. In contrast, depletion of ALG- 2 substantially reduced the level of <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> associated with the membrane at ER exit sites. Finally, treatment with a cell-permeable Ca 2 + chelator caused the mislocalization of ALG- 2, which was accompanied by a reduced level of <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> at ER exit sites. We conclude that ALG- 2 is recruited to ER exit sites via Ca 2 +-dependent interaction with <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> and in turn stabilizes the localization of <b>Sec</b> 31 <b>A</b> at these sites...|$|R

In a recent work (Amodio et al., 2013) we found that the reduced permanence of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>a</b> at the ERES could be the mean through which ER Stress modulates COPII assembling and vesicular trafficking. <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>a</b> is one of the component of the COPII vesicles coat and its GTPase activating function on Sar 1 {{is one of the key}} mechanisms of COPII assembly. Interestingly, we found that during ER Stress the association to the ER membrane of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>a</b> is reduced.

40|$|Prostate {{carcinoma}} (CaP) is {{a leading}} cause of cancer-related death in men. We have previously determined the microRNA (miRNA) profile of primary CaP in comparison with nontumor prostate tissue. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that inhibit protein synthesis on a posttranscriptional level by binding to the 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) of their target genes. In primary CaP tissue, we have previously found by miRNA sequencing that miR- 375 and miR- 200 c were upregulated 9. 1 - and 4. 5 -fold, respectively. A computational analysis predicted the 30 -UTR of the <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>A</b> gene as a potential target for bothmiR- 375 andmiR- 200 c. Here, we show that the 30 -UTR of <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>A</b> mRNA is indeed a target for miR- 375 and miR- 200 c and that both miRNAs downregulate <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>A</b> protein expression when ectopically expressed in human 293 T cells. In primary samples of CaP, we found a direct correlation between reduction of <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>A</b> mRNA and overexpression of miR- 375 but not of miR- 200 c. The reduced levels of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>A</b> protein were inversely correlated to the increased amount of miR- 375 in the LNCaP and DU 145 CaP cell lines when compared with normal prostate fibroblasts. In primary CaP, we also detected decreased amounts of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>A</b> protein when compared with corresponding normal prostate tissue.
