5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well <b>suited.</b> They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better <b>suited</b> to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, {{including}} cardiac conditions {{and a range of}} eye issues.|$|E
5|$|Individuals less <b>suited</b> to the {{environment}} {{are less likely to}} survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more <b>suited</b> to {{the environment}} are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact).|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better <b>suited</b> to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more <b>suited</b> for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the native}} {{conditions}} of where it developed, the Boreray is very well <b>suited</b> to conservation grazing, which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area. However, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust believe {{that this could be}} further capitalised on if the breed is developed further.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} changes to this game was the {{addition}} of 4 collectible power <b>suits.</b> Instead of finding a temporary power <b>suit</b> you can now collect 4 powerful <b>suits</b> by defeating a mid level bosses. The four <b>suits</b> are the Newtsuit, a <b>suit</b> that lets the player climb the ceiling and walls, the Wet <b>Suit</b> which allows the player to swim, a Rocket <b>Suit</b> that lets the player fly and a defensive <b>suit</b> called the Patriot <b>Suit.</b>|$|R
25|$|Every tile {{belongs to}} the two <b>suits</b> of its two values, e.g. 0–3 belongs both to the blank <b>suit</b> (or 0 <b>suit)</b> and to the 3 <b>suit.</b> Naturally the doubles form an {{exception}} in that each double belongs to only one <b>suit.</b> In 42, the doubles can be treated as an additional <b>suit</b> of doubles, so the double-six (6–6) belongs both to the six <b>suit</b> and the <b>suit</b> of doubles.|$|R
5|$|F. rubiginosa is also <b>suited</b> {{for use as}} a houseplant in low, {{medium or}} brightly-lit spaces, {{although}} a variegated form requires brighter light. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is easily propagated by cuttings or aerial layering.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there has}} been {{research}} suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best <b>suited</b> for its survival.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly <b>suited.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Diving <b>suits</b> can {{be divided}} into two classes: [...] "soft" [...] or ambient {{pressure}} diving <b>suits</b> - examples are wetsuits, dry <b>suits,</b> semi-dry <b>suits</b> and dive skins, and [...] "hard" [...] or atmospheric pressure diving <b>suits</b> - armored <b>suits</b> that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the <b>suit.</b>|$|R
50|$|When a <b>suit</b> {{is named}} trump, the {{jack in the}} <b>suit</b> of {{the same color as}} this trump <b>suit</b> becomes a {{powerful}} member of this trump <b>suit.</b> Then any card of that (expanded) <b>suit</b> outranks any card of a non-trump <b>suit.</b> The highest-ranking card in euchre is the Jack of the trump <b>suit</b> (called 'The Right Bower' or 'Right') then the other Jack of the same color, (called 'The Left Bower' or 'Left'). The cards are ranked, in descending order, J (of trump <b>suit)</b> J (same color as trump <b>suit)</b> A, K, Q, 10, and 9 of the trump <b>suit.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best <b>suited</b> to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is consensus that the type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not <b>suited</b> to Australia's requirements.|$|E
50|$|Recently, Michael Anton, {{author of}} The <b>Suit,</b> has {{advocated}} {{for the return}} of the drape <b>suit.</b> The American Zoot <b>suit</b> is an extreme exaggeration of the sack <b>suit.</b> Although the drape <b>suit</b> and the sack <b>suit</b> are similar, they are not the same cut and style.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{preferred}} <b>suit,</b> e.g. clubs or the <b>suit</b> {{of the first}} contract that was satisfied.

50|$|In many games, {{following}} <b>suit</b> is {{the obligatory}} action of playing a card {{of the same}} <b>suit</b> {{as that of the}} leading <b>suit.</b> A player must follow <b>suit</b> if that player has cards of the leading <b>suit</b> in his hands.

5000|$|Several <b>suits</b> work as power-ups, many {{of which}} are based on animals. Debuting in Super Mario Bros. 3, the Raccoon <b>Suit</b> (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki <b>Suit</b> each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller. In addition, the Tanooki <b>Suit</b> lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In Super Mario 3D Land, the Raccoon <b>Suit</b> reappears and is {{accompanied}} by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf. Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a Hammer Bros. <b>suit,</b> which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the <b>suit</b> and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer <b>Suit</b> was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded.Super Mario 3D Land features a [...] "Boomerang Suit" [...] which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles.
