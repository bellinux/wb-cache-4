40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} relationships among buyer‐supplier trust, joint operational activities, and the degree of mass customization as well as the interactions between cultural factors (i. e. long‐term <b>strategic</b> alignment and <b>autonomy)</b> and trust in the context of supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: The model of trust is based on joint operational activities and mass customization using theories of social capital and the resource‐based view of the firm. Also, culture‐related antecedents of trust are identified. Based on 208 responses from suppliers in the USA and China, this study uses structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study empirically supports the notion that trust positively drives manufacturer‐supplier activities in operations. It also supports the claim that joint operational activities contribute to mass customization capabilities in a significant way. Moreover, two culture‐related antecedents are found to be significantly related to trust. Research limitations/implications: The sample is limited to the auto industry in North America and China. As in other supply chain studies, individual respondents may have somewhat limited information about different aspects of their company 2 ̆ 7 s supply chain. Practical implications: In general, it appears that trust is important in determining mass customization capabilities regardless of culture. For practitioners, long‐term strategic alignment is more important for firms to increase trust than autonomy although both can significantly increase the level of trust between buyer and supplier. Originality/value: Long‐term <b>strategic</b> alignment and <b>autonomy</b> are identified as antecedents of trust and empirically supported...|$|R
50|$|As France's defeat was {{obviously}} inevitable, Italy entered {{the war on}} 10 June 1940, fulfilling its obligations towards the Pact of Steel. Mussolini hoped to quickly capture Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and the African colonies of Tunisia and Algeria from the French, but Germany signed an armistice (June 22: Second Armistice at Compiègne) with Marshal Philippe Pétain establishing Vichy France, that retained control over southern France and colonies. This decision angered the Fascist regime. In summer 1940, Mussolini ordered the invasion of Egypt, but Italian forces were soon driven back by the British (see Operation Compass). Hitler had to intervene with the sending of the Afrika Korps of General Erwin Rommel, that was the mainstay in the North African campaign. Continuing indications of Italy's increasing subordinatation to Germany arose during the disastrous Greco-Italian War. Mussolini had intended the invasion of Greece to prove Italy's <b>strategic</b> <b>autonomy,</b> but the Greeks humiliatingly put Italian forces on the defensive. Because of a putsch in Yugoslavia, Germany began a Balkans Campaign which had as result the dissolution {{of this country and}} Greece's defeat. On that occasion, Italy gained south Slovenia and part of Dalmatia. But despite territorial achievements, the Italian Empire was a paper tiger by 1942: it was faltering as its economy failed to adapt to the conditions of war, and Italian cities were being heavily bombed by the Allies. Also, despite Rommel's advances, the campaign in North Africa began to fail in late 1942. Complete collapse came after the decisive defeat at El Alamein.|$|E

40|$|The major {{relationships}} between {{regional economic integration}} and foreign direct investment (FDI) are well established, and have been extensively explored {{in the context of}} economic integration in the European Union (EU). Several studies have been conducted on the impact of FDI of intra-EU trade liberalisation and single market policies, and agglomerations and industrial clusters. However, {{with the exception of a}} few studies such as that by Pearce and Papanastassiou (1997) very little research has been done that is focused on the links between the strategic development of foreign-owned subsidiaries in Europe and their supply of European markets. This paper summarizes the literature on the implications of European economic integration for FDI; it highlights that there have been few studies that are centred on the strategic responses of MNCs to integration. The paper, then, assesses the impact of the strategic development of subsidiaries on the likelihood of them supplying Europe as the main or as a secondary market. This paper’s finding support the view that strategic and operational decision-making autonomy is important for those subsidiaries that export to Europe.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} India’s foreign policy {{preferences}} cannot be understood without referring to its state identity {{as it has}} evolved over time. The ambiva-lence that is evident throughout much of India’s post-Independence history lies in deep-seated identity sources—a unique mixture of post-colonial nationalism, civilizational exceptionalism and secular democracy. India’s identity has played out in foreign policy to place {{an inordinate amount of}} importance to <b>strategic</b> <b>autonomy</b> but with a normative aversion to power politics and use of force. This has led to an ambivalence that many observers find hard to understand. This orientation is now coming under increasing strain, because of the rise of a realist strand of thinking challenging the country’s traditional normatively driven foreign policy outlook. Realist thinking is posing as a distinct alternative that calls for a more proactive and power infused policy stance. The rise of China in India’s neighbourhood is giving greater weight to realist arguments. Although India’s core value of <b>strategic</b> <b>autonomy</b> is still in force in Indian foreign policy, the arti-cle suggests that it is taking on a different form that is more nuanced, more flex-ible and adaptable. As such, India may now be particularly well positioned {{to play the role of}} a ‘bridging power ’ more effectively, matching its state identity with a new evolving international role.

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{contributed to}} a complex {{security}} and strategic dynamics. In the evolving paradigm, India, in order to pursue its geo-strategic and security interests, faces several challenges in reorienting its strategic reformulations {{and at the same}} time maintaining its <b>strategic</b> <b>autonomy.</b> Considering the current geo-strategic parameters in the form of rise of China, evolving Pakistan-China ‘all weather friendship’ and ongoing imbroglio in Afghanistan on the one hand and the US strategy to contain China, seek assistance from Pakistan to fight international terrorism and shape smooth transition in Afghanistan on the other hand, places India at the centre-stage of the happenings. Given the current circumstances, no doubt, India is not only poised to play an important role in its region but also, at the same time, it possesses the necessary leverage to shape the strategic and security framework in the region either by siding with China or aligning with the US. However, both the permutations would pose serious challenges to India’s long term strategic calculations. A major objective of this paper is to trace the antecedents of India’s strategic culture since its independence, make a descriptive analysis of the predicament in which India is placed in the post-Cold War strategic era and highlight on India’s strategic policy postures portended not only to maintain its <b>strategic</b> <b>autonomy</b> but also to influence the future of the region and counter balance China-Pakistan nexus. 22 page(s...|$|E

While the private institutions that provide the same services {{was not included in the}} public system. They maintained a wide autonomy in organizing services, but they paid the autonomy with the absence of a strong financial support. In the last thirty years, the process of concessions before, and then of public-private partnership, and now, the general accreditation for private institutions and the increasing <b>strategic</b> and financial <b>autonomy</b> for the public institutions is leading to a different frame of reference. Private bodies if they want to work in partnership with the public institutions and receive public funds have to obtain accreditation so they reduce their differentiation and autonomy. Instead the public, in search of new opportunities and new funding, tend to adopt private law models. This path suggest us to affirm a new concept of "public service" objective and not subjective, and to seek common forms of regulation. We argue that should be requested more transparency and social control to the private operators who managed public services with public funding. While to the public bodies should be requested a greater responsibility and competitiveness with private entities that have the same standard of service.

40|$|In the {{foreign-owned}} subsidiary development literature, institutional {{differences between}} home and host country have been mainly neglected. It {{has been argued that}} one of the reasons for that is a lack of appropriate institutional perspective, which could engulf prevailing theories and perspectives in the subsidiary development literature. This study seeks to narrow this gap by suggesting a theoretically consistent framework based on insights from new institutional economics and internalisation theory. It applies the concept of institutional distance in order to investigate the effects of transaction cost differentials {{between home and}} host country on subsidiary development. Thereby, it aims at contributing to existing literature to disentangle the institutional distance concept into formal and informal institutions. In particular, it explores the association between institutional distance and subsidiary organisational network relationships and <b>strategic</b> decision-making <b>autonomy</b> of subsidiaries in the Northwest of England. Furthermore, it is among the pioneering studies that propose systematic conceptual and empirical investigation of an interaction term between formal and informal institutional distance in the context of subsidiary development. Based on a unique census-like database of foreign-owned subsidiaries in the Northwest of England, a large-scale postal survey has been conducted. The database contains the most complete and up-to-date data of foreign-owned subsidiaries. It, thereby, minimises some limitations of previous studies, such as small sample bias or home country bias. Following the current best practise in the field, the institutional distance variables have been derived from secondary data. In particular, formal institutional distance measures have been used from the World Economic Forum and informal institutional distance from the World Value Survey. The choice of the variables has been guided explicitly by theory as demanded in the literature. The results indicate that informal institutional distance has a pronounced negative effect on the strength of intra- and inter-organisational relationships, and decision-making autonomy in foreign-owned subsidiaries. However, formal institutional distance seems to be less relevant where subsidiary development is concerned, only becoming significant in the interaction terms. This reveals the complex interplay between the two institutional dimensions. The results lend support to some of the theoretical expectations. It suggests a tendency that foreign-owned subsidiaries have stronger links to other units in the Multinational Enterprise network, and has more decision-making autonomy, if formal institutional distance is large and informal institutional distance is low. The policy implications seem to point towards only very limited means for a host location to influence subsidiary development through formal institutional adjustments. Overall, it might be more promising to focus on investment from home countries that are informal institutional close. Managers at subsidiary and headquarters level might be well advised to take informal institutional distance into consideration. It seems that such frictions could impede the exploitation of formal institutional transaction cost differentials between home and host country.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the funding and {{governance}} of research universities have attempted {{to make them more}} strategically active in contributing to national goals. However, the ability of universities to develop strategic capabilities as cohesive organisations is limited by the inherent uncertainty of research processes and results, and the dominant influence of scientific communities on research priorities and evaluation standards.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{transition}} from an “industrial economy” to a “new-Knowledge economy” has brought to light the importance of Intellectual Capital (IC), as a crucial factor for the firms’ value creation and the achievement of a sustainable competitive advantage (Williams, 2001; Chen et al., 2005; Lev et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008). The relevance of IC has also emerged in the public sector, already influenced by the reform process which implied a greater <b>strategic</b> and operational <b>autonomy</b> for public organizations (New Public Management). In particular in higher education sector Universities are considered as “critical players in the knowledge-based society” (Secundo et al., 2015 : 419) since they are devoted to the production and diffusion of knowledge, investing basically in in research and human resources. (Sanchez and Elena, 2006). These economic and political changes have required Universities to develop new IC measurement and reporting models, {{with the emphasis on}} the role of voluntary disclosure in order to respond to the growing demand for transparency regarding the use of public funds and the outcomes achieved in terms of research and teaching (Ramirez et al., 2007; Bezhani, 2010). However, IC reporting research is still focused primarily on the private sector. Studies about University IC reporting are just beginning to emerge (Bezhani, 2010; Low et al., 2015; Secundo et al., 2015). However few of them discuss the explanatory factors of the levels and types of IC disclosure. Thus, the present research, grounded on several theories (Stakeholder Theory, Agency Theory, Signalling Theory and Resource Dependence Theory) aims to contribute to this new strand of research by pursuing two objectives: 1. 	To investigate the level of IC disclosure of 61 Italian Sate universities, applying the content analysis method to the 2014 annual reports with an un-weighted Disclosure Index based on the theoretical framework developed by Low et al. (2015); 2. 	To test, through a linear regression model, the relationship existing between six explanatory factors (Size, age, financial independence, financial performance, board size and board independence) determined according to the aforementioned theories and previous research and the level of IC disclosure represented by the Disclosure Index. The results of Content Analysis show a medium Intellectual Capital Disclosure Index (0. 52 out of 1). Moreover, consistent with the results of Low et al. (2015) the IC categories most disclosed are Internal Capital (42. 14...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{subsidiary}} autonomy has featured prominently in recent subsidiary management research (Collinson & Wang, 2012; Gammelgaard, McDonald, Stephan, Tuselmann & Dorrenbacher, 2012; Gammelgaard, McDonald, Tuselmann, Dorrenbacher & Stephan, 2011; Pisoni, Onetti & Fratocchi, 2010; Tong, Wong & Kwok, 2012). Yet despite this, the notion {{is not yet}} fully understood. For example, studies by Miozzo and Yamin (2012), Balogun, Jarzabkowski and Vaara (2011), Gammelgaard et al. (2011), Sandvik (2010), Sargent and Matthews (2006) and Delany (2000) have claimed that instead of a subsidiary’s autonomy being derived entirely through assignment from the head office, it may be developed beyond the assigned levels by the subsidiary itself. However, none of these previous studies have explicitly differentiated between different types of autonomy. Additionally, Gammelgaard et al. (2012), Pisoni et al. (2010) and Young and Tavares (2004) have noted that further research {{may be needed to}} redefine subsidiary autonomy in relation to the different value functions, such as marketing and finance. This is because recent studies such as those of Collinson and Wang (2012) and Gammelgaard et al. (2011) have proposed that a subsidiary’s autonomy may vary across these value functions. This is in contrast with the traditional assumption held by the majority of previous studies (such as those of Couto, Vieira and Borges-Tiago [2005] and Takeuchi, Shay and Li [2008]) that a subsidiary’s level of autonomy would be consistent across all value functions. The relationships between subsidiary autonomy and related concepts such as authority (Chiao & Ying, in press; Gammelgaard et al., 2011; Gupta & Govindarajan, 1991; Mudambi, 1999; Young & Tavares, 2004) have also yielded conflicting results, and require further investigation. Tong et al. (2012), Young and Tavares (2004) and Brock and Paterson (2002) noted that in order to address these gaps in the extant literature, research must first establish an understanding on how {{the nature and extent of}} autonomy (including its different types) are perceived and negotiated by the subsidiary and the parent company. Gammelgaard et al. (2012), Gammelgaard et al. (2011) and Young and Tavares (2004) have argued that more research is particularly needed to investigate the role that the different types of autonomy play in influencing the process of subsidiary development (Balogun et al., 2011; Birkinshaw & Hood, 1998; Cavanagh & Freeman, 2012; Delany, 1998, 2000). Such an investigation must also consider the role of the different types of autonomy in the development of subsidiary initiatives, which are those actions by the subsidiary management that drive the subsidiary development process (Balogun et al., 2011; Birkinshaw, Hood & Jonsson, 1998; Cavanagh & Freeman, 2012). With this in mind, the current study’s broad research problem was ‘What role do the different types of autonomy play in subsidiary initiatives and role development?’ In order to address this research problem, the study drew upon agency theory (Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Saam, 2007), the network model of the MNE (Andersson & Forsgren, 1996; Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1990) and the decision process perspective (Bower, 1970; Burgelman, 1983 a). In doing so, the study was able to answer the following research questions which emerged from the literature review: Research Question 1 a: How do subsidiaries and headquarters understand autonomy? Research Question 1 b: How do subsidiaries and headquarters negotiate autonomy? Research Question 2 a: What role do the different types of autonomy play in the development of subsidiary initiatives? Research Question 2 b: How do the different types of autonomy influence subsidiary development? The study employed a qualitative research design through the use of multiple case studies. Qualitative data was found by Singh (1981) and Pisoni et al. (2010) to be necessary in order to fully explore the complexities of subsidiary autonomy in detail. A case study was selected as the most appropriate research strategy for this current study as it investigated a contemporary issue, and involved ‘how’ research questions (Yin, 2009). The current study employed a multiple case study design based on 10 cases so as to gain more powerful inferences than could be obtained from a single case (Yin, 2009). The cases were selected using judgement (purposive) sampling, snowball sampling and opportunistic sampling techniques (Patton, 1990; Tharenou, Donohue & Cooper, 2007). Of the 10 cases, 6 involved interviews with the head office, 9 involved interviews with the subsidiary, and 5 incorporated the views of both the head office and the subsidiary. This enabled the study to address the research gap identified by Brock and Paterson (2002), Tong et al. (2012) and Young and Tavares (2004) through the development of an in-depth, multiple-perspective understanding of subsidiary autonomy. The data for the study was collected through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with senior managers at both the subsidiary and head office level within the selected cases. This data was supplemented by the addition of documentary evidence that was collected from newspaper articles, industry journals and company websites. Once the data had been collected through the interviews and documentation, the study used a template approach to data analysis (Crabtree & Miller, 1992). This approach involved four steps: ‘immersion in the data’, ‘coding’, ‘creating categories’ and ‘identification of themes’ (Green et al., 2007). The findings of the current study make a number of key theoretical contributions to the field. First, the findings for Research Question 1 a led to the development of a revised, comprehensive definition for subsidiary autonomy. This extended the key previous definitions of Ambos, Andersson & Birkinshaw. (2010), Brooke (1984), Chiao and Ying (in press), Gammelgaard et al. (2012), Tong et al. (2012) and Young and Tavares (2004), and refined those of Najafi-Tavani et al. (2012) and O’Donnell (2000) by differentiating between autonomy and authority. The findings for Research Question 1 a also extended the network model of the MNE (Andersson & Forsgren, 1996; Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1990) in two key ways. First, the findings recognised the need for the model’s application at an interdepartmental, rather than organisational, level. Second, the findings identified that local environment factors will not only affect subsidiary behaviour, but will more specifically force the subsidiary to employ or develop autonomy. The findings for Research Question 1 b then identified and applied terminology for two separate and distinct types of autonomy: assigned and assumed. Assigned autonomy was found to be delegated to the subsidiary by the head office, and falls within the subsidiary’s authority. Assumed autonomy, on the other hand, is developed by the subsidiary independently, and exceeds its authority. These findings thus addressed the research gap identified by Tong et al. (2012), Young and Tavares (2004) and Brock and Paterson (2002) in relation to the precise origins of a subsidiary’s autonomy, and the resultant types of autonomy. The findings for Research Question 1 b also had a number of implications for agency theory (Arrow, 1985; Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Saam, 2007). First, they refuted the agency theory assumption of different risk preferences by revealing that subsidiaries are often less risk averse than the head office. Second, the findings refined agency theory's goal conflicts assumption to include three additional causes of agents acting against their principal’s direct instructions. These causes include: the subsidiary being forced to assume its own autonomy on account of indifference or lack of interest from the head office; the subsidiary assuming its own autonomy in order to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of an operation; and the head office allowing or facilitating the extension of a subsidiary’s autonomy beyond its authority. Third, the findings refined agency theory by recognising the difference between ‘real’ and ‘stated’ goals of the principal, and in doing so challenged the assumption that an agent’s failure to follow its assigned charter will result in agency problems. The findings for Research Question 2 (a & b) then identified assumed autonomy as necessary to not only generate subsidiary initiatives, but also to lead to successful subsidiary development. In doing so, the findings addressed the research gap identified by Gammelgaard et al. (2012), Gammelgaard et al. (2011) and Young and Tavares (2004). In order to facilitate this process, the findings revealed that a low level of subsidiary-head office communication in the formative stages of initiative creation is essential to their longer-term viability. In addition, head office endorsement of these initiatives was found to be imperative if they are to successfully translate into subsidiary development. This in turn was found to require a strong subsidiary-head office relationship. The findings for Research Question 2 (a & b) also extended the network model of the MNE by specifically noting that a subsidiary may only develop its role to a position of equality or even superiority vis-à-vis the head office through the use of assumed autonomy. Lastly, the findings for Research Question 2 (a & b) had three significant implications for the decision process perspective (Bower, 1970; Burgelman, 1983 a). First, the study extended the application of the perspective to the subsidiary development context. This led to the replacement of Burgelman’s (1983 a) original terms ‘induced’ and ‘autonomous’ strategic behaviours with the more appropriate terms of ‘assigned autonomy’ and ‘assumed autonomy’ respectively. Second, the findings for Research Question 2 (a & b) extended the decision process perspective by revealing that a subsidiary’s autonomous strategic actions (or assumed autonomy) can influence not only the strategic context, but also the structural context. Third, the findings challenged the perspective’s assumption that corporate strategy did not affect the subsidiary’s autonomous <b>strategic</b> actions (assumed <b>autonomy)</b> by revealing the importance of HQ endorsement of initiatives. In addition to the aforementioned theoretical implications, the study’s findings also have practical inferences for managers at both the subsidiary and head office level. For subsidiary managers, the study first recognised the need to assume autonomy in order to successfully develop the subsidiary’s contributory role. The study also identified the need for subsidiary management to maintain a strong relationship with the head office so as to maximise the chance of initiatives being endorsed. At the same time, the study’s findings revealed the need for subsidiary managers to limit the extent of communication with the head office in the initial stages of initiative generation in order to facilitate their development. For head office managers, the study first recognised the need to permit the subsidiary to assume autonomy beyond its formally assigned levels so as to aid the subsidiary development process. Second, the study also identified the need for head office management to be open to supporting and endorsing subsidiary initiatives. Finally, while the current study has made a number of contributions (both theoretical and practical) to the understanding of subsidiary autonomy, these contributions must be viewed in light of the study’s limitations. First, the study did not investigate in detail the effect of local environment factors (through their influence on subsidiary autonomy) on subsidiary initiatives and development. Future research could therefore further explore the role these factors play in influencing not only subsidiary initiatives and development, but also the types of subsidiary autonomy. Second, given the resource and time constraints, the current study was unable to employ a longitudinal design, which would have been ideal for assessing variations in the amount of autonomy possessed by a subsidiary or its value-chain functions over time (Gammelgaard et al., 2011; Pisoni et al., 2010). It is therefore anticipated that by employing a longitudinal design, future research could obtain an even greater insight into the dynamic nature of subsidiary autonomy. Finally, the study provided analytical generalisations, rather than statistical generalisations (Yin, 2009). It is therefore hoped that future research can use the current study’s analytical generalisations as a basis upon which to develop quantitative measures to empirically test the conclusions drawn...|$|R
