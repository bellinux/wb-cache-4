40|$|In the {{sovereign}} debt market, the typical remedies to resolve sovereign default are either the negotiation route or a unilateral exchange offer. However, {{as a result}} of increasing insecurity in {{the sovereign}} debt market due to rogue sovereign debtors who take advantage of their immunity to opportunistically default and create unfavorable restructuring deals, creditors began resorting to a previously limited remedy: litigation. Although litigation to resolve sovereign default was not a new concept in the sovereign debt market, it was ineffective due to the creditor’s inability to actually recover the money judgment from the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtor.</b> In NML Capital v. Argentina, the Second Circuit determined that the injunctive remedy was necessary to motivate sovereign debtors to meet the obligations to their creditors and to reduce the nonpayment risk in the sovereign debt market.

In grappling with the first question the literature has pointed to, and argued about, the roles of reputation, punishments, rewards and renegotiation.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} woes of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, {{and other}} nations have reinvigorated {{the debate over whether}} to bail out defaulting countries or, instead, restructure their debt. Bailouts are expensive, both for residents of the nation being bailed out and for parties providing the bailout funds. Because the IMF, which is subsidized by most nations (including the United States), is almost always involved in country debt bailouts, we all share the burden. Yet bailouts are virtually inevitable under the existing international framework; defaults are likely to have systemic consequences, whereas an orderly debt restructuring is currently impractical. This article analyzes and compares debt restructuring alternatives to bailouts. Under a free-market option, <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtors</b> and their creditors attempt to consensually negotiate a debt restructuring, aided by collective-action clauses and by exchange offers with exit consents. Under a statutory option, <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtors</b> and their creditors would be bound by an international convention that sets forth a process to facilitate debt restructuring.

40|$|There {{are three}} reasons for {{attempting}} to reach a common understanding of the responsibilities of sovereign borrowers and their lenders. First, the flow of capital to <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtors</b> is exceptionally important to the world economy. Industrialized countries rely on it to finance their budget deficits, these days to a breathtaking extent. Developing countries need it to develop. Misbehaviour, either by the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtors</b> or by the creditors, destabilizes this key component of the international financial system, making credit less available and more costly. Second, sovereign finance is uniquely unforgiving of mistakes. Unlike corporate or personal <b>debtors,</b> <b>sovereigns</b> {{do not have access}} to a formal bankruptcy process in which insupportable liabilities can be adjusted according to pre-established rules. From a legal standpoint, sovereign debts are therefore ineradicable absent the consent and cooperation of the creditors. Unfortunately, the process by which that consent and cooperation must be sought – sovereign debt restructuring – remains unpredictable and disorderly. Third, the human cost of prodigal sovereign borrowing, reckless sovereign lending or incompetent sovereign debt restructuring is incalculable. Perusing a major international newspaper on any day of any year is all that is required to make good this proposition. A consensus about the responsibilities of sovereign borrowers and lenders, together with improvements in the way in which sovereign loans are planned, executed, documented and, when necessary, restructured, will directly affect the lives of most of the people that live on this planet. ...|$|R

40|$|The Greek {{restructuring}} of March 2012 illustrates how non-price contract terms {{can have a}} significant effect on the pricing of sovereign debt. In the Greek restructuring, bonds governed by local law suffered NPV haircuts in the range of 60 - 75 %, whereas those bonds governed by foreign law were paid in full and on time. Other contract parameters such as the currency in which the debt is denominated and the exchange on which it is listed can also affect the leeway a <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtor</b> has in dealing with its creditors. In general, we find that sovereigns with strong institutions and investor protections are able to issue bonds under local parameters at relatively lower interest rates. In contrast, sovereigns with relatively weak investor protections have lower bond ratings and are forced to pay relatively higher interest rates on their debt. The important exceptions are those lower rated sovereigns who issue debt under foreign parameters. We believe that these sovereigns are able to obtain lower rates because by issuing bonds under foreign parameters, they reduce (eliminate) their ability to expropriate investors’ wealth once the debt is issued...|$|E

40|$|Ten {{years ago}} Collective Action Clauses {{were all the}} rage. They offered the {{illusion}} of a market-based mechanism for reorganizing public debt without the holdup problems of unanimous creditor vote. More recently they have been hailed as an answer to Europe’s sovereign debt ills. Concerns about higher costs of sovereign debt finance ex ante were pushed aside for greater predictability at the ex post stage. Yet, CACs had been known before, mostly for debt issued under the law of England rather than the state of New York; moreover, they were implied even when not explicitly stated. Building on recent work by Gelpern and Gulati, this paper will argue that if and how sovereign debt will be restructured is as much determined by a sovereign’s position in the global financial system as by specific clauses found in contractual covenants. Those at the apex of the system can always refinance; those on the periphery only when their default threatens the survival of those at the apex. Critically, a sovereign’s position in the global financial system is a function of a tripartite relation: the sovereign debtor’s to its private creditors, the creditors ’ to their home country, and the relation between the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtor</b> and the home country of the financial intermediaries. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{restructuring}} of sovereign bonds with and without collective action clauses. One conclusion is that collective action clauses can allow efficient debt renegotiation in a formal model of sovereign debt renegotiation while unanimity rules offer incentives for opportunistic behavior by bondholders that leads to inefficient outcomes. With collective action clauses, the mutual gains from renegotiation can be internalized by bondholders so that the holders of each bond issue have incentives {{to participate in a}} collective debt restructuring. The analysis abstracts from transactions costs, and the last conclusion might well be sensitive to renegotiation and coordination costs.

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by Bulow and Rogoff (1988, 1991) against sovereign debt buybacks are re-examined in a willingness-to-pay framework. This paper argues that the Bulow-Rogoff framework treats default by a debtor as an event with no dead-weight loss, and, as such, underestimates the potential gains from a buyback. The willingness-to- pay framework allows dead-weight costs of default to be introduced in a consistent and simple fashion into the buybacks calculus. Two versions of this framework are considered. First, a model in which the default costs induce an all-or-nothing default decision is analysed. In this case, an ambiguous result is derived in which the variability of the debtor’s income determines whether (small) buybacks are beneficial to the debtor, even though expected total transfers to the creditor increase, consistent with Bulow-Rogoff. In a second version, default costs are modelled so as to induce at most a partial default. This model corresponds most closely, {{in terms of the}} repayment behaviour of the <b>sovereign</b> <b>debtor,</b> to the models used by Bulow and Rogoff. It is shown that small buybacks are always beneficial to the debtor in this case. The second version is extended to include an investment opportunity. Only if the country has sufficiently scarce resources when the investment can be made, will a buyback be harmful to the interests of the debtor.
