40|$|A triple-mode {{silver-plated}} ceramic {{cavity filter}} with wide spurious-free response is presented. It uses single mode ceramic slabs as interfacing resonators with the cube to give wide spurious-free performance up to 4 GHz for an 1800 -MHz base station filter. Three square apertures at the slab-cube interface give simple and flexible control of transmission zero placement while maintaining low insertion loss. The parallel {{nature of the}} slab-to-cube coupling allows a simple cuboid structure without chamfers or intermode coupling elements. A <b>seven-pole</b> <b>filter</b> in the DCS- 1800 transmit band is built using a slab-slab-cubeslab-slab structure and measured. Along with wide spuriousfree performance, the filter achieves around 1 dB of band edge insertion loss with more than 50 dB of attenuation, 20 MHz from the band edges, and from an 11 -cm(3) package. The near band performance shows all of the seven poles in the return loss. The insertion loss is 1. 1 dB on the low side (1805 MHz), 1. 0 dB on the high side (1880 MHz), and 0. 6 dB at the band center. The wideband response shows more than 40 dB of attenuation up to the frequency 3. 7 GHz...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{duplexer}} design with two microstrip bandpass filters which are designed using Open Loop Square Resonator method and matching {{between these two}} bandpass filters using T-junction matching devices. Both <b>seven-pole</b> band-pass <b>filters</b> for the receiver at 1710 - 1785 MHz and transmitter at 1805 - 1880 MHz, with fractional bandwidth of 4. 29 % and 4. 07 % respectively, of the center frequencies were implemented by resonators and admittance inverters with a 0. 1 dB ripple in the pass band. Agilent Advance Design Simulation (ADS) EM simulator was used in obtaining {{the dimensions of the}} resonators, extraction of coupling coefficients and external quality factors associated with the microstrip design. Results obtained showed a return loss of about 8 dB, insertion loss less than 1 dB and isolation between transmit and receive filters of about 32 dB. The choice of the square open-loop resonators against parallel coupled lines is to avoid the inherent shift in the center frequency of the parallel coupled technique. The designed microstrip duplexer filter showed good agreement with theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|Within the Microelectronics Industry, {{the core}} {{research}} {{is focused on}} the realization of the Moore's law, which states that circuit density doubles every 24 months, shaping the framework of the More of Moore paradigm. However, Moore's law is expected to end, as devices are reaching limitations inherent to the approach of the atomical dimensions. Alternative research paths emerged, forming the new More than Moore paradigm. This consists in using the microfabrication technological knowhow towards the realization of alternative devices and applications, among others the miniaturization and integration of Radio Frequency (RF) devices by Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), i. e. RF-MEMS. The RF-MEMS devices offer high performance, tuning by movable parts and open new perspectives at extra high frequency i. e. 30 to 300 GHz. In this thesis, cavity resonators' design and characterization are introduced, as a preliminary discussion. Their integration in the bulk of High Resistivity Silicon (HR-Si) wafers by micromachining techniques is realized at 60 and 75 GHz. Further, the tuning performance induced by internal volumes of perturbation is thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the integration of a voltage controlled tuning system for air filled cavity resonators is realized at 60 GHz, using a MEMS based Faraday cage. Additionally, a new miniaturization concept is demonstrated using High Impedance Surfaces (HIS). A <b>seven-pole</b> Chebyshev bandpass <b>filter</b> is realized in Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC). Finally, ultra-low phase-noise oscillators at 60 GHz are realized using cavity resonators integrated in HR-Si and LTCC. These oscillators improve {{the state of the art}} for integrated oscillators in the frequency band from 40 to 80 GHz, demonstrating the highest factor of merit, to our best knowledge and to date, FoM = - 199 dBcHz @ 1 MHz offset from the carrier frequency, fosc = 59. 98 GHz.
