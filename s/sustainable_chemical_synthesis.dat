40|$|The chemoselective {{three-phase}} hydrogenation of an Ombrabulin intermediate {{based on}} a nitro-stilbene framework {{was used as a}} case study for the formation of the primary amine without affecting the Cdouble bond; length as m-dashC double bond. Two catalysts were tested: Pt nanoparticles supported on ZnO (Pt/ZnO) and agglomerated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). Both materials show a high selectivity at close to full conversion in terms of amine formation (> 99 %) without changing the configuration of the central stilbene Cdouble bond; length as m-dashC double bond. The continuous hydrogenation process was first tested in lab scale reactors (2 mL and 6 mL) combined with a high pressure interdigital micromixer to ensure efficient three-phase contact. While the specific reactor performance (defined as productivity per unit of reactor volume) was 1. 5 -fold higher for the Pt/ZnO, the NCNT catalyst was found to be more suitable for flow operation due to a lower pressure drop over the catalytic packed bed. The catalytic reactor was then scaled up to 50 mL and operated in the EcoTrainer mobile modular platform for the hydrogenation of the Ombrabulin intermediate demonstrating a safe, flexible and <b>sustainable</b> fine <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|R

The speed of {{sequencing}} of microbial genomes and metagenomes is providing an ever increasing resource for the identification of new robust biocatalysts with industrial applications for many different aspects of industrial biotechnology. Using 'natures catalysts' provides a <b>sustainable</b> approach to <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis</b> of fine <b>chemicals,</b> general chemicals such as surfactants and new consumer-based materials such as biodegradable plastics. This provides a sustainable and 'green chemistry' route to <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis</b> which generates no toxic waste and is environmentally friendly. In addition, enzymes can play important roles in other applications such as carbon dioxide capture, breakdown of food and other waste streams to provide a route to the concept of a 'circular economy' where nothing is wasted. The use of improved bioinformatic approaches and the development of new rapid enzyme activity screening methodology can provide an endless resource for new robust industrial biocatalysts. This mini-review will discuss several recent case studies where industrial enzymes of 'high priority' have been identified and characterised.

We demonstrate that 4 -substituted cycloketones, readily available from renewables, present excellent platforms for Baeyer-Villiger upgrading. Such substrates exhibit substantially higher levels of activity, and produce lactones at higher levels of lactone selectivity at all values of substrate conversion, relative to non-substituted cyclohexanone. For 4 -isopropyl cyclohexanone, readily available from β-pinene, continuous upgrading was also evaluated in a plug flow reactor. Excellent selectivity (< 90 % at 65 % conversion), stability and productivity were observed over 56 h, with over 1000 turnovers (mol. product / mol. Sn) being achieved with no loss of activity. A maximum space-time yield almost twice that obtained for non-substituted cyclohexanone was also obtained for this substrate (1173 vs. 607 g (product) kg- 1 (cat) cm- 3 (reactor) h- 1). The lactone produced is also shown to be of suitable quality for ring opening polymerisation.

40|$|Chiral {{molecules}} play {{a central}} role in our daily life and in nature, for instance the different enantiomers or diastereomers of a chiral molecule may show completely different biological activity. For this reason, it is a vital goal for synthetic chemists to design selective and efficient methodologies that allow the synthesis of the desired enantiomer. In this context, it is highly important that the concept of green chemistry is considered while designing new approaches that eventually will provide more environmental and <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The aim of this thesis is to develop the concept of combining transition metal catalysis and aminocatalysis in one process (dual catalysis). This strategy would give access to powerful tools to promote reactions that were not successful with either transition metal catalyst or the organocatalyst alone. The protocols presented in this thesis based on organocatalytic transformations via enamine or iminium intermediates or both, in combination with transition metal catalysis, describes new enantioselective organocatalytic procedures that afford valuable compounds with high chemo- and enantioselectivity from inexpensive commercial available starting materials. In paper I, we present a successful example of dual catalysis: the combination of transition metal activation of an electrophile and aminocatalyst activation of a nucleophile via enamine intermediate. In paper II, the opposite scenario is presented, here the transition metal activates the nucleophile and the aminocatalyst activates the electrophile via an iminium intermediate. In paper III,we present a domino Michael/carbocyclisation reaction that is catalysed by a chiral amine (via iminium/enamine activation) in combination with a transition metal catalysts activation of an electrophile. In paper IV, the concept of dual catalysis was further extended and applied for the highly enantioselective synthesis of valuable structural scaffolds, namely poly-substituted spirocyclic oxindoles. Finally, in paper V the concept of dual catalysis was expanded, by investigating more challenging and environmentally benign processes, such as the successful combination of a heterogeneous palladium and amine catalysts for the highly enantioselective synthesis of functionalised cyclopentenes, containing an all carbonquaternary stereocenter, dihydrofurans and dihydropyrrolidines...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} novel Pd-catalysed C–H bond functionalisation methodologies, with a view towards their application in <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis.</b> The basis of this project focuses {{on the need for}} more efficient utilisation of precious metal catalysts, such as Pd, achieved by mechanistic understanding of the role of heterogeneous Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) in such chemistry. An overview of observations from Pd-catalysed cross-coupling and C–H bond functionalisation chemistry is given initially, focusing on the mechanistic dichotomy between observed homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic manifolds in these fields. The generation of potentially harmful stoichiometric byproducts in direct arylation methodologies is also examined for two classes of commonly-used electrophilic arylating agents, aryliodonium and aryldiazonium salts (Chapter 1). The synthetic utility of C–H bond functionalisation chemistry has been exemplified through the development of complementary conditions for the direct arylation of the amino acid tryptophan (I) to form highly fluorescent 2 -aryltryptophans (II), all of which have been evaluated using several key mass-based green metrics (Chapter 2). These conditions have also been shown to be effective for the functionalisation of tryptophan-containing peptides. Initial rates kinetic analysis of the activity of several homogeneous and heterogeneous Pd catalysts in other direct arylation chemistry has highlighted remarkable similarities between apparently distinct catalysts, which suggests the formation of a comparable active catalyst phase. Heterogeneous Pd sources have also been successfully applied to the selective functionalisation of several biomolecules (Chapter 3). The final part of this thesis describes fundamental studies {{on the nature of the}} ubiquitous Pd 0 catalyst Pd 2 (dba) 3. The major and minor isomers of this catalyst were characterised both in solution and in the solid state, which revealed that dynamic exchange between these species and free ligand varies significantly as a function of temperature. Crucially, this catalyst has also been shown by NMR and MS studies to be a source of catalytically competent PdNPs under commonly-found experimental conditions (Chapter 4) ...|$|E

40|$|Polaromonas sp. strain JS 666 is {{the only}} {{isolated}} bacterium capable of aerobic growth using the groundwater pollutant cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cDCE) as a sole carbon source. Its genome has a wealth of evidence of recent gene acquisition through horizontal gene transfer, and contains gene clusters predicted to encode enzymes allowing the metabolism {{of a wide variety}} of xenobiotic compounds. Culture growth using each of these hypothesized substrates was tested experimentally, and many were confirmed as sole carbon sources for strain JS 666. In addition to pollutant degradation, many of these metabolic pathways have applicability in the field of biocatalysis, as does the genome-assisted pathway prediction approach to biocatalyst discovery. During (or immediately following) growth on cDCE, cultures of Polaromonas sp. strain JS 666 oxidize ethene to epoxyethane at an increased rate, and also cometabolically oxidize several other chlorinated ethenes. Given the involvement of a monooxygenase in other species 2 ̆ 7 1 -chloroethene (vinyl chloride) oxidation, it was hypothesized that alkene oxidation in strain JS 666 was due to the activity of a monooxygenase that also was responsible for the first step in cDCE oxidation. The alkene oxidation activity of strain JS 666 was investigated using gene expression analysis, proteomics, and whole-cell kinetic assays. Results of these experiments pointed to the upregulation of a cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) during growth on cDCE and during oxidation of ethene. To determine the activity of this cyclohexanone monooxygenase, its gene was cloned and heterologously expressed in an E. coli host. Our CHMO expression system exhibited activity on cyclohexanone, but not cDCE or ethene, disproving our hypothesis about its involvement in alkene oxidation. The heterologously expressed monooxygenase was also investigated for enantioselective oxidation of racemic cyclic ketones to chiral lactones, and was discovered to have very high enantioselectivity with the tested compounds. Chiral lactones and other single-enantiomer oxidation products are valuable for fine chemical synthesis, and their biocatalytic production is more environmentally sustainable and often less expensive than traditional techniques. The research described in the following chapters illustrates the many opportunities that arise when the fields of bioremediation and biocatalysis converge. The shared research goals and methods of these two areas lend themselves to interdisciplinary research, and increased communication and crossover between them should provide benefits for both environmental remediation and <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} <b>sustainable</b> and {{economical}} <b>chemical</b> processes {{is a key}} priority for the chemical industry. Cascade catalysis presents a promising technology to meet this need by combining multiple catalysts to drive a sequence of catalytic steps in one reactor. These catalysts work cooperatively to achieve desired products with higher selectivity/atom efficiency than from using any single catalyst alone. Consequently, this cascade approach enables efficient use of feedstock and reduces the operational work-up between catalytic sub-steps, leading to both time and cost benefits. Research described in this dissertation investigates the use of heterogeneous-based cascade catalytic systems to advance carbon dioxide hydrogenation for producing value-added products. Carbon dioxide is an abundant and nontoxic carbon source; its conversion provides <b>sustainable</b> routes for <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis</b> and opportunities to balance green-house gas emissions that are linked to climate change. In this dissertation, copper- and molybdenum carbide-based heterogeneous catalysts were evaluated for the hydrogenation {{of carbon dioxide and}} subsequent intermediates, i. e. formic acid and formate esters, to produce methanol. Catalysts identified from these sub-reactions were combined to devise several cascade systems for carbon dioxide hydrogenation. A series of mixed homo-/hetero-geneous cascade systems were first targeted via pathways at both Lewis acidic and basic conditions. Surface interactions between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts seemed {{to play an important role}} in catalytic performance, ultimately leading to catalyst deactivation and ineffective cascade systems. Several heterogeneous-based cascade systems were developed to eliminate these interactions; these systems worked cooperatively to produce methanol and/or dimethyl ether. For example, a system containing an iridium- and a copper-based catalyst enhanced the methanol production by threefold (via the formic acid intermediate) compared to employing each catalyst alone. The study was further extended to evaluate several molybdenum carbide supported metal catalysts to produce alcohols and hydrocarbons. The role of temperature and metal type on reaction performances and pathways was also elucidated. In addition to developing novel heterogeneous cascade systems for carbon dioxide hydrogenation, research described in this dissertation also provides useful insights for designing similar types of catalytic systems for other challenging and multi-step chemical transformations of interest...|$|R
