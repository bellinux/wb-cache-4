25|$|A {{new study}} using {{comparative}} molecular field analysis (CoMFA) to establish three-dimensional quantitative <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> (3D QSAR), while searching for novel active pharmacophores as potentially potent HGMR inhibitors, was recently published. Using this novel technique researchers {{were able to}} screen for compounds with high screening scores. In addition to the conventional statin-like compounds with HMG-like moiety, eight additional compounds with completely different pharmacophore structure were found. This structure-based virtual screening procedure is considered promising for rational quest and optimization of potential novel HGMR inhibitors.|$|E

25|$|ATSDR has a {{computational}} toxicology laboratory that conducts research and modeling {{on the effects}} of toxic substances on human health. The agency's toxicology work involves pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, quantitative <b>structure–activity</b> <b>relationship</b> methods, and benchmark dose modeling, as well as establishing minimal risk levels for human exposure to hazardous substances. One model developed by the toxicology laboratory showed that children were much more susceptible than adults to chemical exposure from inhalation and oral exposure. In the aftermath of chemical spills and emergencies, the laboratory also conducts research for state and local health departments on the health effects of the chemicals involved.|$|E
25|$|BPFs {{are members}} of a family of {{peptides}} whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF teprotide (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect in vivo. Teprotide had limited clinical value {{as a result of its}} peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> required for inhibition of ACE was growing. David Cushman, Miguel Ondetti and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In {{a virtual}} screen for novel agonists, a <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> was {{determined}} {{from the most}} potent compounds ('hits') identified. These hits contained a pyrazolopyrimidine core (shown in figure 5), which is important for potency toward the 5-HT2C receptors. Compounds with maximum potency featured two substituents linked to the core structure. The first substituent is a piperazine ring, containing a small hydrophobic group; the second substituent is a phenyl part containing a halogen- and/or oxygen-containing side chain (electronegative groups), see derivatives 1 and 2 in figure 5. Addition of aromatic groups to the piperazine ring reduces potency (derivative 4 in figure 5) {{and the absence of}} the piperazine ring or substitution with other aliphatic- or cyclic groups reduces potency as well (derivatives 5 and 6 in figure 5).|$|E

25|$|The <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> of {{morphine}} {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength {{of morphine}}) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E
25|$|Ligand-based drug design (or {{indirect}} drug design) {{relies on}} knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules {{may be used}} to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn {{may be used to}} design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> (SAR) {{studies of}} LGIC {{receptor}} ligands are valuable to investigate their structure and function. [...] An antagonist-like molecule with low intrinsic activity (ia) decreases {{the frequency of}} channel-opening and the permeability of ions. Small lipophilic C5 (R1) (see fig. 5) substituents afford compounds with potent antagonism which indicates that the C5 substituent may fit in a narrow, hydrophobic groove of the binding region in the receptor. [...] It seems that the amino acid residues that interact with the C7 (R2) substituents {{have little to do}} with ligand binding but play a big role in ion channel gating. [...] Sterically bulky substituents show a greater interaction with the gating amino acid residues and favor the open conformation af the ion channel because of sterical repulsion.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-Iodomelatonin was {{synthesized}} in 1986 and its radioligand, 2--melatonin, {{has been}} useful in finding cellular targets of melatonin. Though the melatonin receptor wasn’t characterized and cloned {{in the human}} being until 1994 {{it was possible to}} start carrying out binding studies in various tissues before that time. As mentioned in the <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> chapter above, certain groups are important for the activity. The most important groups are the 5-methoxy group and the acylaminoethyl side-chain, because they bind to and activate the receptors. The –NH group of the indole ring is not important for binding and activation. Therefore it is possible to replace it with other aromatic ring systems. The aromatic ring and the ethyl side-chain hold the correct distance between those two groups. The correct distance is the key to good binding and more important than what type of aromatic ring system the analogue contains. Therefore it is possible to use different ring systems in melatonin receptor analogues, if the distance is right.|$|E

Significant correlation coefficients (hologram quantitative structure-activity relationships: r 2 = 0. 91, q 2 = 0. 78; comparative molecular field analysis: r 2 = 0. 98, q 2 = 0. 77) were obtained, indicating the potential of these 2 D and 3 D models for untested compounds. The models were then used to predict the potency of an external test set, and the predicted (calculated) values are in good agreement with the experimental results.
