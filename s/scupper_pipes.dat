5000|$|The Wheel Wreck is {{the remains}} of a {{shipwreck}} lying in Crow sound off Little Ganinick in the Isles of Scilly. [...] The wreck site consists of a discrete mound of cargo, that appears to consist of numerous sizes of different iron wheels, cogs, clack valves, tubes and boiler pipes. Lead <b>scupper</b> <b>pipes</b> and other small artefact material show the ship was once present, however, not much remains of this vessel today. [...] A Trotmann style anchor lies some 60m from the site, and this along with the cargo, date the site as sometime just after 1835. It has been published that this may be the wreck of the Padstow, however, being lost in 1804 this can not be so as neither boiler tubes or Trotmann anchors were invented back then. The wreck was discovered by local divers Todd Stevens and Phillip Roberts in 2005 and investigated by the archaeological contractor for the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 in 2006. It still remains unidentified.|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with the}} Greek Education Ministry and the Royal Hellenic Navy, the sponge divers {{salvaged}} numerous {{artifacts from the}} waters. By the middle of 1901, divers had recovered bronze statues named [...] "The Philosopher", the Youth of Antikythera (Ephebe) of c. 340 BC, and thirty-six marble sculptures including [...] "Hercules", Ulysses, Diomedes, Hermes, Apollo, three marble statues of horses (a fourth was dropped during recovery, and is lost on the sea floor), a bronze lyre, and several pieces of glasswork. Ship's equipment included lead <b>scupper</b> <b>pipes</b> and hull sheeting, {{and a set of}} four massive lead sounding weights (up to 14 kg). These are the only sounding weights ever discovered on an ancient shipwreck in the Aegean, though comparable examples have been recovered along the Levantine coast. Many other small and common artifacts were also found, and the entire assemblage was taken to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The death of diver Giorgos Kritikos and the paralysis of two others due to decompression sickness put an end to work at the site during the summer of 1901.|$|E
