5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and <b>Still</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
25|$|The first {{painting}} of Matisse acquired {{by a public}} collection was <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Geraniums (1910), exhibited in the Pinakothek der Moderne.|$|E
5000|$|Ermocrate Bucchi (1842 [...] - [...] 1885) was an Italian painter, {{mainly of}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> flowers.|$|R
50|$|Only three <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> by Meganck are known, {{all three}} signed. Two {{of them are}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> dead game and one is a vanitas <b>still</b> <b>life</b> dated to 1664.|$|R
50|$|His son, Giovanni Crivelli (il Crivellino, died 1760), painted <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> {{fish and}} hunted game. He {{worked for the}} court in Parma.|$|R
25|$|In 1912 for his <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Chair Caning (Nature-morte à la chaise cannée), Picasso pasted a {{patch of}} {{oilcloth}} with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.|$|E
25|$|Tom Robbins waxed {{philosophical}} {{about the}} Remington SL3, a typewriter {{that he bought}} to write <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Woodpecker. He eventually did away with {{it because it is}} too complicated and inhuman for the writing of poetry.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century the Spanish painter Juan Sánchez Cotán pioneered the Spanish <b>still</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> austerely {{tranquil}} paintings of vegetables, before entering a monastery in his forties in 1603, after which he painted religious subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Adriaenssen also {{produced}} pronkstillevens (ostentatious <b>still</b> <b>lifes)</b> <b>with</b> expensive glasses and dishware. The subgenre of pronkstillevens {{was developed in}} Antwerp during the 1640s.|$|R
50|$|Corrado Michelozzi (16 August 1883 - 1965) was an Italian painter, {{active in}} Livorno in a Divisionist style, mainly {{depicting}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> floral and fruit arrangements.|$|R
50|$|According to the RKD {{he was a}} {{registered}} pupil of Johannes Bronckhorst and is known for fruit and flower <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> <b>with</b> a specialty in insects and birds.|$|R
25|$|Vase {{paintings}} {{even had}} {{an influence on}} the development of modern painting. The linear style influenced artists such as Edward Burne-Jones, Gustave Moreau or Gustav Klimt. Around 1840, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller painted a <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Silver Vessels and Red-Figure Bell Krater. Henri Matisse produced a similar painting (Intérieur au vase étrusque). Their aesthetic influence extends into the present. For example, the well-known curved shape of the Coca-Cola bottle is inspired by Greek vases.|$|E
25|$|The century {{began with}} several trends taking hold in art. In 1901, Paul Gauguin painted <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Sunflowers, his homage {{to his friend}} Van Gogh who had died eleven years earlier. The group known as Les Nabis, {{including}} Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard, took up Gauguin’s harmonic theories and added elements inspired by Japanese woodcuts to their still-life paintings. French artist Odilon Redon also painted notable still life during in this period, especially flowers.|$|E
25|$|Henri Matisse {{reduced the}} {{rendering}} of still-life objects even further {{to little more}} than bold, flat outlines filled with bright colors. He also simplifyied perspective and introducing multi-color backgrounds. In some of his still-life paintings, such as <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Eggplants, his table of objects is nearly lost amidst the other colorful patterns filling the rest of the room. Other exponents of Fauvism, such as Maurice de Vlaminck and André Derain, further explored pure color and abstraction in their still life.|$|E
50|$|Since 1957 Boris Shamanov {{has participated}} in art exhibitions. He painted portraits, <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> flowers in exterior, genre scenes, and landscapes. Boris Shamanov worked in oils, tempera, and watercolors.|$|R
50|$|Egidus Nuemans or Egidius Nuemans ({{active in}} Antwerp 1691-1735) was a <b>still</b> <b>life</b> painter active in Antwerp {{in the second}} half of the 17th century. Only a few works by his hand {{depicting}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> flowers and fruit are currently known.|$|R
50|$|He {{is remembered}} for his {{geometric}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> oranges, his cubistic scenes with nudes and his paintings of bottles, flasks and jugs. His style was characterised by clear, bright lines and few colours.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1920, Miró {{developed}} a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including House with Palm Tree (1918), Nude with a Mirror (1919), Horse, Pipe and Red Flower (1920), and The Table - <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Rabbit (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied {{to only a}} portion of the subject. For example, The Farmer's Wife (192223), is realistic, but some sections are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman's feet, which are enlarged and flattened.|$|E
25|$|Though Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio {{died when}} Antonio Barberini was only 3 years old, the Cardinal {{later became a}} great admirer of his work and his {{extensive}} art collection included Caravaggio's paintings such as <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Fruit, Cardsharps and The Lute Player. Antonio had purchased the art collection of Francesco Maria Del Monte upon the cardinal's death which had included {{a large number of}} important works. Pope Urban VIII had purchased a number of works directly from Caravaggio and it is likely Antonio also inherited a number of these. An inventory of Antonio's assets was compiled upon his death in 1671 which included a large number of such artworks by artists of the period.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Perls further donated 13 {{works by}} Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger, Soutine and Pascin to the Metropolitan. That gift {{was one of}} the largest ever {{received}} by the Metropolitan’s department of 20th-century art and greatly helped round out the museum’s collection. Two were from 1910, Picasso’s Nude in an Armchair and Braque’s oval Candlestick and Playing Cards on a Table, and the third was Picasso’s <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>With</b> Pipes from 1912. The gift also included several Picassos from the 1930s, notably Sleeping Nude With Flowers and Girl Asleep at a Table. Klaus Perls was subsequently named honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum. The Perls Foundation was set up after the Perls Gallery closed in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|His works {{fall into}} three main groups: barn {{interiors}} {{with an emphasis}} on the <b>still</b> <b>life</b> element, 'ontbijtjes' and <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> dead fowl. The influence of François Ryckhals {{can be seen in the}} first two groups. [...] Ryckhals may have been Angel’s teacher in Middelburg.|$|R
50|$|Frans Geerts’ work is very diverse. He painted {{realistic}} and romantic portraits, pastoral and religious scenes, <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> flowers and landscapes. He predominantly made oil paintings, but also watercolors, ink drawings and even tapestries.|$|R
50|$|His {{paintings}} were mainly of animals, marine and <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> fish, sometimes in harbours. Together with his father, he {{is considered the}} founder of the <b>still</b> <b>life</b> movement in Utrecht. He collaborated with Adam Willaerts and was influenced by JB Wijtvelt. He had Jacob Gillig as a pupil.|$|R
25|$|Many famous {{artists have}} painted <b>still</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> peach fruits placed in prominence. Caravaggio, Vicenzo Campi, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, Severin Roesen, Peter Paul Rubens, Van Gogh {{are among the}} many {{influential}} artists who painted peaches and peach trees in various settings. Scholars suggest that many compositions are symbolic, some an effort to introduce realism. For example, Tresidder claims the artists of Renaissance symbolically used peach to represent heart, and a leaf attached to the fruit as the symbol for tongue, thereby implying speaking truth from one's heart; a ripe peach was also a symbol to imply a ripe state of good health. Caravaggio paintings introduce realism by painting peach leaves that are molted, discolored {{or in some cases}} have wormholes – conditions common in modern peach cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Around April 1906 he met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 {{years younger}} than Matisse. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key {{difference}} between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and <b>still</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas. During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris—Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein and Michael's wife Sarah—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition Gertrude Stein's two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|Petrus Christus’ {{portrait}} of a bride and groom visiting a goldsmith is a typical example of a transitional still life depicting both religious and secular content. Though mostly allegorical in message, the figures of the couple are realistic and the objects shown (coins, vessels, etc.) are accurately painted but the goldsmith is actually a depiction of St. Eligius and the objects heavily symbolic. Another similar type of painting is the family portrait combining figures with a well-set table of food, which symbolizes both the piety of the human subjects and their thanks for God’s abundance. Around this time, simple still-life depictions divorced of figures (but not allegorical meaning) were beginning to be painted {{on the outside of}} shutters of private devotional paintings. Another step toward the autonomous still life was the painting of symbolic flowers in vases on the back of secular portraits around 1475. Jacopo de’ Barbari went a step further with his <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Partridge, Iron Gloves, and Crossbow Arrows (1504), among the earliest signed and dated trompe-l'œil still-life paintings, which contains minimal religious content.|$|E
50|$|His {{perspective}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> typically included pilasters, arches, niches and bas-reliefs in the background. On {{the side}} {{he placed his}} typical <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> objects characterized by their inclusion of luxurious, coloured fabrics, edged and embroidered in gold, heavy curtains and silverware. The scenes were bathed in luminous reflections of light.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, in 1950-1969 years Kapitolina Rumiantseva taught {{drawing and}} {{painting}} in secondary art school. Since 1970, Kapitolina Rumiantseva has participated in Art Exhibitions. She painted landscapes, <b>still</b> <b>lifes,</b> genre scenes, sketches from the life. Most famous for her sensual <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> wildlife flowers and fruits in interior and exterior.|$|R
2500|$|Soon after Van Gogh {{arrived in}} Paris he began {{painting}} <b>still</b> <b>lifes</b> <b>with</b> {{the goal of}} experimenting with contrasting colors. He wrote to a friend in England that {{his goal was to}} create [...] "intense coloration, not gray harmony." ...|$|R
25|$|Weinrich turned 60 on July 16, 1933. Although she had led a {{full and}} {{productive}} life devoted to development of her own art and {{to the advancement of}} modernism in art, she did not cease to work toward both objectives. She continued to work in oil on canvas and board, pastel and crayon on paper, and woodblock printing. Her output continued to vary in subject matter and treatment. For example, <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> <b>with</b> Leaves, circa 1930 (oil on canvas, 18 x 24 inches) contains panels of contrasting colors with outlining similar to Knaths's style. Movement in C Minor, circa 1932 (oil on board, 9 x 12 inches) is entirely abstract. It too relates to Knaths's work, both in treatment (again, outlined panels of contrasting colors) and in its apparent relationship to music, something in which Knaths was also interested. Fish Shacks, circa 1936 (monochrome woodblock print) is severely abstract and has a strong Cubist feel. Untitled Abstraction, circa 1938 (oil on canvasboard, 12.25 x 12 inches) {{is very different from the}} abstract work of the earlier 1930s. It is a geometric abstraction showing influence of Wassily Kandinsky consisting of rectilinear color panels in cool tones with to contrasting panels in ochre and red. Floral Still Life, circa 1940 (Crayon on paper, 7 x 9.5 inches) contains a frame within a frame, emphasizing the surface plane dramatically, and is also entirely abstract. Its composition consists of star-like shapes in blue and magenta in a lively pattern against a dark, textured background.|$|E
