50|$|Fisheries {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} in the 1970s by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to determine the fishery composition and life stages of estuarine fish using this specific bay. Sixty-six species were caught during these studies and, as in the Barnegat system, the catches were dominated by forage species, with bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) being very abundant. The top ranked fish by their relative abundance were: bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), sea herring (Clupea harengus), white perch (Morone americana), northern puffer (Sphoeroides maculatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), and <b>striped</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Anchoa hepsetus). Commercial fisheries activities include the harvest of northern quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), white perch, winter flounder, and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). The bay is an important spawning and nursery area for blue crab. The area between Graveling Point and the Wading River tributaries supports large eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) beds, {{many of which are}} considered extremely productive seed beds.|$|E
50|$|Spanish {{mackerel}} are voracious, opportunistic, carnivores. As {{with other}} members of the genus, food consists mainly of small fishes with lesser quantities of shrimp and squid. <b>Striped</b> <b>anchovies</b> (Engraulidae) and clupeoids such as menhaden, alewives and thread herring (Opisthonema), are particularly important forage in North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Veracruz. The percentage of anchovies consumed is higher for juveniles than for adults.|$|R
50|$|King {{mackerel}} are voracious, opportunistic carnivores. Their prey {{depends on}} their size. Depending on area and season, they favor squid, menhaden and other sardine-like fish (Clupeidae), jacks (Carangidae), cutlassfish (Trichiuridae), weakfish (Sciaenidae), grunts (Haemulidae), <b>striped</b> <b>anchovies</b> (Engraulidae), cigar minnows, threadfin, northern mackerel, and blue runners. They do not attack humans but will defend themselves against perceived threats, including humans flailing or thrashing in man-overboard and similar situations, by biting.|$|R
5000|$|Adult {{bluefish}} {{are strong}} and aggressive, {{and live in}} loose groups. They are fast swimmers which prey on schools of forage fish, and continue attacking them in feeding frenzies even after {{they appear to have}} eaten their fill. Depending on area and season, they favor menhaden and other sardine-like fish (Clupeidae), jacks (Scombridae), weakfish (Sciaenidae), grunts (Haemulidae), <b>striped</b> <b>anchovies</b> (Engraulidae), shrimp, and squid. They are cannibalistic and can destroy their own young. Bluefish sometimes chase bait through the surf zone, attacking schools in very shallow water, churning the water like a washing machine. This behavior is sometimes referred to as a [...] "bluefish blitz".|$|R
40|$|Virginia {{serve as}} an {{important}} nursery area for bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix. Describing the diet composition of young-of-the-year (hereafter, age- 0) bluefish in this region is essential to support current Chesapeake Bay ecosystem modeling efforts and {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the foraging ecology of these fish along the U. S. Atlantic coast. The stomach contents of 404 age- 0 bluefish collected from the lower Chesapeake Bay and adjacent coastal zone in 1999 and 2000 were examined as part of a diet composition study. Age- 0 bluefish foraged primarily on bay <b>anchovies</b> Anchoa mitchilli, <b>striped</b> <b>anchovies</b> Anchoa hepsetus, and Atlantic silversides Menidia menidia. Other fishes such as striped bassMorone saxatilis, white perchMorone americana, Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, and bluefish were seasonally important. Crab zoea and megalope Callinecte...|$|R
2500|$|Restoration of the {{flushing}} {{tunnel and}} other initiatives have increased oxygen {{levels in the}} canal, supporting the return of some aquatic life. Within months of restarting the flushing tunnel in 1999, John C. Muir of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment was amazed to see pink jellyfish, blue crabs {{and a variety of}} fish. By 2009, white perch, herring, <b>striped</b> bass and <b>anchovies</b> were living in the waterway. By 2014, [...] the Gowanus Canal Conservancy reported that herons, egrets, bats and Canada geese were living nearby. However, individuals and populations may be at risk for reproductive problems.|$|R
