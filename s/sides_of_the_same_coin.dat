25|$|In {{his book}} , Mamdani claims {{the two types}} of rule were each <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> He {{explains}} that colonialists did not exclusively use one system of rule over another. Instead, European powers divided regions along urban-rural lines and instituted separate systems of government in each area. Mamdani refers to the formal division of rural and urban natives by colonizers as the “bifurcated state.” Urban areas were ruled directly by the colonizers under an imported system of European law, which did not recognize the validity of native institutions. In contrast, rural populations were ruled indirectly by customary and traditional law and were therefore subordinate to the “civilized” urban citizenry. Rural inhabitants were viewed as “uncivilized” subjects and were deemed unfit to receive the benefits of citizenship. The rural subjects, Mamdani observed, had only a “modicum of civil rights,” and were entirely excluded from all political rights.|$|E
500|$|In {{her efforts}} to vividly {{describe}} the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to [...] "capricious tyrants" [...] who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's [...] "softness" [...] has [...] "debased mankind".|$|E
500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Who's the monster, and who made the monster?

2500|$|The {{movement}} {{consisted of}} the boycott of foreign goods and also the social boycott of any Indian who used foreign goods. The Swadeshi movement {{consisted of the}} usage of natively produced goods. Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was a gap {{which had to be}} filled by the production of those goods in India itself. Bal Gangadhar Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> The large Bengali Hindu middle-class (the Bhadralok), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness. [...] The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision took the form predominantly of the Swadeshi ("buy Indian") campaign led by two-time Congress president, Surendranath Banerjee, and involved boycott of British goods.|$|E
2500|$|Schopenhauer's {{identification}} of the Kantian noumenon (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed [...] "will" [...] deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the Ding an sich (the Thing in Itself), the reality that {{is the foundation of}} our sensory and mental representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description {{of the relationship between the}} phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that phenomena and noumena are two different <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Noumena do not cause phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the principle of sufficient reason. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813).|$|E

2500|$|Marx's {{critique}} of {{the ideology of the}} human rights thus departs from the counterrevolutionary critique by Edmund Burke, who dismissed the [...] "rights of Man" [...] in favour of the [...] "rights of the individual": it is not grounded on an opposition to the Enlightenment's universalism and humanist project on behalf of the right of tradition, as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> However, as Étienne Balibar [...] puts it, [...] "the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears both as the language in which exploitation masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a stake". Das Kapital ironizes on the [...] "pompous catalogue of the human rights" [...] in comparison to the [...] "modest Magna Charta of a day work limited by law": ...|$|E
2500|$|Sumner was {{a friend}} of Samuel Gridley Howe and a guiding force for the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, started in 1863. He {{was one of the most}} {{prominent}} advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. [...] He was largely excluded from work on the Thirteenth Amendment, in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would have abolished slavery and declared that [...] "all people are equal before the law." [...] During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. [...] He viewed segregation and slavery as two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts. The bill failed, but Sumner revived it in the next Congress, and on his deathbed begged visitors to see that it did not fail.|$|E
2500|$|In South-East and East Asia, Maudgalyāyana is {{honored as}} a symbol of filial piety and psychic powers. Maudgalyāyana has had an {{important}} role in many Mahāyāna traditions. The Ullambana Sutra is the main Mahāyāna sūtra in which Maudgalyāyana's rescue of his mother is described. [...] The sutra was highly influential, judging from the more than sixty commentaries that were written about it. Although the original Sankrit sutra already encouraged filial piety, later Chinese accounts inspired by the sutra emphasized this even more. Furthermore, Chinese accounts described merit-making practices and filial piety as two inseparable <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> The sūtra became popular in China, Japan, and Korea, and led to the Yulanhui (China) and Obon (Japan) festivals. This festival probably spread from China to Japan in the seventh century, and similar festivals have been observed in India (Avalamba), Laos and Vietnam. The festival is celebrated on the seventh lunar month (China; originally only on the full moon, on the Pravāraṇa Day), [...] or from 13 to 15 July (Japan). It is believed that in this period ancestors reborn as pretas or hungry ghosts wander around. In China, this was the time when the yearly varṣa for monastics came to an end (normally translated as rains retreat, but in China this was a Summer Retreat). It was a time that the monastics completed their studies and meditation, which was celebrated. Up until the present day, people make merits and transfer merit through several ceremonies during the festival, so the spirits may be reborn in a better rebirth. The festival is also popular among non-Buddhists, and has led Taoists to integrate it in their own funeral services.|$|E
