A 21 -year-old female patient presented cough, sore throat and a suppurative <b>swollen</b> <b>gum</b> for 10 days prior to hospital admission. Physical examination revealed moderate pallor and swollen inferior gum. CBC re vealed Hb 6. 5 g /dL, hematocrit 18. 4 % MCV 97 fL MCH 34 pg, WBC 18. 5 ′ 10 9 /μL (1 My/ 3 Bt/ 69 Sg/ 1 Eo/ 0 Ba/ 20 Ly/ 6 Mo), Platelets 43 ′ 10 9 /μL. The peripheral blood smear presented with 3 % blast cells (type 1) and granulocytic dysplasia. Bone marrow biopsy showed 100 % cellularity. 50 % of cells were from granulocytic precursors, diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. The diagnosis of AML was established: granulocytic sarcoma with massive gum infiltration (immature granulocytic cells) and 10 % of blasts in bone marrow. The patient received induction chemotherapy (3 + 7 daunorubicin 90 mg/m 2), and gum tissue culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

40|$|Background: Data on {{oral health}} {{experiences}} among pregnant women {{in developing countries}} are lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the oral health awareness and experience among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Rivers State Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out during the period between February and March 2013. Pretested, well-structured, and self-administered questionnaire allowing open and closed responses was used for data collection. Results: The age of the subjects ranged from 18 to 49 years and the age group 28 - 37 years was significantly more (P < 0. 00). Majority, 241 (82. 0 %) significantly had at least secondary education than 53 (18. 0 %) who had primary education or less (P < 0. 01). Less than 10 % of the participants were aware of the effect of pregnancy on oral health and the impact of oral disease on pregnancy outcome. In general, the experienced oral health problems among the pregnant women were tooth decay 21. 1 %, dental pain 42. 2 %, pain from the gum 22. 8 %, <b>swollen</b> <b>gum,</b> 23. 5 %, gum bleeding 32. 7 %, and excessive salivation 46. 1 %. However, only 27. 9 % had visited the dental clinic most of whom, were those with more than three children (P < 0. 01). Excessive salivation was significantly experienced more than other oral health problems and in women with three or less children. Conclusion: Oral health awareness among the subjects was poor and a sizeable number of pregnant women experienced oral health problems during pregnancy. There is a need for the development of guidelines that will promote referral and visit of pregnant women for dental consultation...|$|E

MethodsThirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (<b>swollen</b> <b>gum,</b> weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. These samples were collected from two major dental clinics in Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) respectively and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile Mitis salivarius agar (MSA) plates and incubated as above. The isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. Tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. The plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum cidal concentration (MCC) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. Antibiotic sensitivity test was also carried out. The results were statistically analyzed. ResultsThe extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. Our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. The microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of S. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be Staphylococcus spp. The Gram reaction confirmed 13 Gram-negative and 18 Gram-positive organisms. The n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. MIC showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. The antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. ConclusionsSince the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (S. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} which behavioral factors to include in guidelines for the Japanese public to achieve an acceptable level of oral healthiness. The objective was to determine the relationship between oral health related behaviors and symptoms related to oral disease and tooth loss in a Japanese adult community. Methods Oral health status and lifestyle were investigated in 777 people aged 20 years and older (390 men and 387 women). Subjects were asked to complete a postal questionnaire concerning past diet and lifestyle. The completed questionnaires were collected when they had health examinations. The 15 questions included their preference for sweets, how many between-meal snacks they usually had per day, smoking and drinking habits, presence of oral symptoms, and attitudes towards dental visits. Participants were asked about their behaviors at different stages of their life. The oral health examinations included examination of the oral cavity and teeth performed by dentists using WHO criteria. Odds ratios were calculated for all subjects, all 10 year age groups, and for subjects 30 years or older, 40 years or older, 50 years or older, and 60 years or older. Results Frequency of tooth brushing (OR = 3. 98), having your own toothbrush (OR = 2. 11), smoking (OR = 2. 71) and bleeding gums (OR = 2. 03) were significantly associated with number of retained teeth in males. Frequency of between-meal snacks was strongly associated with number of retained teeth in females (OR = 4. 67). Having some hobbies (OR = 2. 97), having a family dentist (OR = 2. 34) and consulting a dentist as soon as symptoms occurred (OR = 1. 74) were significantly associated with number of retained teeth in females. Factors that were significantly associated with tooth loss in both males and females included alcohol consumption (OR = 11. 96, males, OR = 3. 83, females), <b>swollen</b> <b>gums</b> (OR = 1. 93, males, OR = 3. 04, females) and toothache (OR = 3. 39, males, OR = 3. 52, females).

Its leaf’s extract is being used as a medicine in cough, diarrhea, and oral ulcers and in some <b>swollen</b> <b>gums</b> wound. Its fruit is rich in vitamins A, C, iron, phosphorus and calcium and minerals. It contains high content of organic and inorganic compounds like secondary metabolites e.g. antioxidants, polyphenols, antiviral compounds, anti-inflammatory compounds. The phenolic compounds in guava help to cure cancerous cells and prevent skin aging before time. The presence of terpenes, caryophyllene oxide and p-selinene produces relaxation effects. Guava leaves contain many compounds which act as fungistatic and bacteriostatic agents. Guava has a high content of important antioxidants and has radio-protective ability. Quercetin is considered as most active antioxidant in the guava leaves and is responsible for its spasmolytic activity. Its ethyl acetate extract can stop the germ infection and thymus production. Guava possesses anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-plaque and anti-mutagenic activities. Guava extract shows antinociceptive activity and is also effective in liver damage inflammation and serum production. Ethanolic extract of guava can increase the sperm quality as well as quantity and can be used for the treatment of infertile males.|$|R

The highest impact was reported on eating (35. 5 %) followed by cleaning (28. 3 %) and the lowest impacts were on speaking (8. 6 %) and social contact (8. 7 %). Problems which contributed to all eight impacts were toothache, sensitive teeth, exfoliating teeth, <b>swollen</b> <b>gums</b> and bad breath. Toothache was the most frequently associated cause of almost all impacts in both private and public school attendees. After adjusting for confounders in the 3 multiple variable regression models (whole sample, public and private school attendees), active caries maintained a significant association with the whole sample (OR 2. 0 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 6) and public school attendees (OR 3. 5 95 % CI 2. 1 - 5. 6), and higher SES was associated with only public school attendees’ Child-OIDP (OR 1. 9 95 % 1. 1 - 3. 1). Conclusion: This study showed that the Arabic version of the Child-OIDP was applicable for use among schoolchildren in Khartoum. Despite the low prevalence of the dental caries pathology (24 %), a significant relationship, with an average moderate intensity was found with OHRQoL. Focus in this population should be on oral health education, improving knowledge of the prospective treatment opportunities and provision of such services...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{identification}} and quantitation using mass spectrometry has evolved {{as the dominant}} technique for studying the protein complement of a system: cell, tissue or organism. The proteomics of body fluids is a very active research area as there is great potential for protein biomarker discovery; application of such technologies would revolutionise medical practice and treatment. Saliva, through its non intrusive nature of sampling, is an ideal body fluid for disease diagnosis, screening and monitoring. Gingivitis is a gum disease with symptoms including bleeding, <b>swollen,</b> and receding <b>gums.</b> After dental decay, gingivitis {{is estimated to be}} the most common disease worldwide, and around 40...|$|R
40|$|History of Present Illness: A 34 -year-old HIV {{positive}} female {{presented to}} the emergency department with a three-week history of <b>swollen,</b> painful <b>gums.</b> She had difficulty eating and chewing, along with aches and general malaise. The patient was an everyday smoker and was not taking any antiretroviral medication. Significant findings: Physical examination revealed inflamed gingiva, ulceration, and soft tissue necrosis (Image 1) along with mandibular lymphadenopathy (not shown). Given her symptoms, poor oral care, and her immunocompromised state, she was given a diagnosis of Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG) or Vincent’s Angina. Discussion: Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG, Vincent’s Angina, or Trench Mouth) is the only periodontal disease in which bacteria invade non-necrotic tissue. The etiology is usually secondary to fusobacteria and spirochete overgrowth of bacteria which is normally present in the oral cavity. HIV infection, previous necrotizing gingivitis, poor oral hygiene, malnutrition, smoking, and stress are predisposing factors. Antibiotics and improved nutrition have significantly decreased the incidence of ANUG. The prevalence of ANUG among HIV infected patients varies from 4. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>swollen</b> gellan <b>gum</b> hydrogels {{in terms of}} mechanical properties, weight loss, and cell growth inhibition of leachates is presented. Low-acyl gellan gum (LAGG), high-acyl gellan gum (HAGG), and a HAGG–LAGG blend were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7. 4 and 37 °C for up to 168 days. The gels exhibited their maximum mass loss and swelling after 28 days of immersion in PBS. LAGG gels exhibited lower value for mass loss and the chain-release diffusion coefficient than gels consisting of HAGG and the HAGG–LAGG blend. The change in mechanical and rheological characteristics during soaking of the three hydrogels was attributed to mass loss, while LAGG hydrogels also showed evidence of effects because of cation exchange with the surrounding medium. The mechanical characteristics of the LAGG, HAGG, and blend hydrogels relative to each other did not change during swelling (although the magnitude changed). L 929 fibroblasts growth inhibition tests showed that the leachate products of the three gels can be considered noncytotoxic, which is important for their future application in tissue engineering...|$|R
