25|$|She {{spent time}} in Sydney before going to New Guinea for seven years. She was {{evacuated}} to Sydney when the Second World War began and working as an assistant for a city photographer, Norton Travaire. Over {{the next seven years}} she covered an average of 24 weddings each weekend. At the end of the evening, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> for the bridal car to drive her home.|$|E
25|$|The last {{eleven years}} of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, {{including}} a self-imposed vow of near-silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging {{his life and}} acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> the prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those who could gained admittance, {{those who could not}} were shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound was not easy; yet, her belief in him was absolute.|$|E

25|$|Teoh {{was engaged}} to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two-year courtship, and had been {{planning}} to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child. National Registration Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the birth certificate if he is physically present {{at the time of}} birth; after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister Shahrizat Abdul Jalil said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> the NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school to one closer to her hometown, and look into assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
500|$|At her formal {{campaign}} launch on 4 October, Independent Mary Davis accused Fine Gael {{of using}} polling companies to research attacks on her. She also pledged <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> the Government {{to bring the}} office of President {{under the terms of}} the Freedom of Information Act and that she would publish an annual expenditure report for the Áras. David Norris also made a pledge to publish expenses. Mrs. Davis eventually accepted [...] "collective responsibility" [...] for mortgage lending decisions made after she was appointed to the board of the ICS building society.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you swim, Mr. Prothero?" [...] {{the lady}} asked, though {{a moment before}} she had {{determined}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>ask</b> him a question again. But {{this time it was}} a lucky question.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> Mrs. Shutterfield to {{come with}} her and {{introduce}} her, but that lady was away from home, and so she had come by herself to ask me a very great favor.|$|R
60|$|Her {{decision}} had been indicated in an instant, {{but it had been}} made after days and nights of anguished deliberation. She had known <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>asked,</b> <b>she</b> had decided what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right.|$|R
500|$|A popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid {{after her}} death, {{living in the}} Aegean. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> the sailors on any ship she would {{encounter}} only one question: [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] ( [...] ;"), to which the correct answer was: [...] "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" [...] (Greek: [...] "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει"). [...] This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. [...] Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Cold as Ice" [...] {{is based on}} a {{relationship}} Cox had with a girl named Alice. Having fallen in love with her in the fifth grade, he proposed to marry her on the school's playground. Alice rejected Cox, calling the ring he had given her [...] "a cheap piece of crap." [...] Years later, Cox worked with Alice at a Subway restaurant. Occasionally, [...] "for no reason", <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him to watch her change into her uniform in the restaurant's refrigerator, which he described as having been as [...] "cold as ice". Cox suspects that [...] "she was trying to torture me or something." [...] The song [...] "Bite Marks" [...] is about [...] "sadomasochism and boy prostitution." [...] In the song, Cox references an experience he had when he was kissing a man who bit him [...] "really, really hard" [...] on his shoulder, leaving bite marks [...] "for like two weeks." [...] This experience, along with other abuses he received as a child, formed the lyrical basis of the song.|$|E
2500|$|Morris' family doubted {{she would}} have {{accepted}} a ride from the police, given her fear of them, and questioned why <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> to be dropped off miles from where she lived. A key witness to the event stated that when she asked Nizah where she lived that it sounded like 15th and Walnut. [...] The message could have been misconstrued because Ms. Morris was incoherent.|$|E
5000|$|As they slowly stroll away {{along the}} South Bank, Harvey invites Kate {{to ask him}} the {{questions}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence [...] "...is in transition." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> another question, but at {{that instant}} the clatter of hoofs and sound of voices arose from the courtyard, and with a hurried bow he was gone. The door opened again almost {{instantly}} to the bright laughing face and coquettish figure of Mrs. Sepulvida.|$|R

2500|$|Crosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, {{when she}} would not respond to his ardor, Crosby {{threatened}} suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly's husband {{was in and out}} of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly's mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was [...] "unheard of...even among Boston Episcopalians." [...] Peabody's parents were outraged that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> for a divorce and at her affair with Crosby. Dick's father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry's father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922 to discuss the situation, but Harry's father would not talk to him; despite his disapproval of Harry's irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz he'd been asking for, but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly's former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitude towards her. Polly later described Harry's character as: [...] "He seemed to be more expression and mood, than man," [...] she wrote, [...] "yet he was the most vivid personality I've ever known, electric with rebellion." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{paused a}} moment, half {{thinking}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> it, {{but at last}} she determined against it.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the close}} {{friendship}} between the two women, Edith Head assumed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>asked</b> to design the wedding dress. Instead, Helen Rose, a costume designer in the wardrobe department of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), was selected. The dress was a wedding gift to Kelly from the MGM studio.|$|R
25|$|After her {{travels with}} Mrs. Watt, Smart {{returned}} to Ottawa where she {{spent six months}} writing society notes for the women's page of The Ottawa Journal. At parties <b>she</b> <b>would</b> often <b>ask</b> about Barker, saying she wanted to meet and marry him. Soon Smart began a correspondence with the poet.|$|R
5000|$|Campus Front held a dharna at Sullia {{college as}} the teacher insisted five women {{students}} to remove their headscarf during a photo session at the college stating that they would look betterThe protesters ended their dharna only when the lecturer told that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>ask</b> students to remove their headscarf ...|$|R
6000|$|He waited, {{watching}} her and wondering whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him to stop, {{but she said}} quietly: [...] "Well, I shall, no doubt, hear how you get on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there is, when you've got a {{girl like}} Lottie to deal with. Quite likely <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him herself. We must take him because we can't leave her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{dare you}}," [...] <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> herself--"how dare you show your {{weakness}} and betray your imbecile anxieties? Shake them off; rise above them. If you cannot do this, hide them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{into that}} {{carriage}} immediately, and you shall know by decision," [...] said Lady Belamour, with icy frigidness, {{but not the}} same fierceness as before; and Aurelia submissively obeyed, silenced by an imperious gesture when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>asked,</b> [...] "How is it with him?" [...] whom she durst not name.|$|R
60|$|She pulled hurriedly at {{the handle}} of the hoarse old bell, and the gate soon opened. Before going in, she gave him one last, wide, {{wondering}} look, as if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>asked</b> him with imploring emphasis: ‘O! don’t you understand?’ And out of that look he vanished from her view.|$|R
60|$|Lawson sniggered. Since Mrs Chaplin {{held the}} purse-strings {{if she wanted}} a new frock for the {{occasion}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> certainly not <b>ask</b> her husband for the money.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Sid should marry a homely girl, I should hate her," [...] she said, one day. [...] "Is he not splendid?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask,</b> {{when her}} son chanced to dwarf {{physically}} his associates.|$|E
60|$|Was once lost always lost {{really true}} of chastity? <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> herself. She might prove it false {{if she could}} veil bygones. The recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but, in this country, there aren't any {{lions and}} tigers, loose: so they hunt other creatures, you see." [...] I hoped, but in vain, {{that this would}} satisfy her, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> no more questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Close to Lady Catharine's! Gillian {{will be glad}} to {{tell her}} {{anything}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>ask</b> about it. You had better come over to tea some afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> {{have stayed}} here for hours longer, talking to that absent personality, {{powerful}} and mysterious {{more than ever}} now, listening to the rugged voice which <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never hear again.
