40|$|Sarcopoterium spinosum (L.) Spach [Poterium spinosum L., Spinaporci] is a SE-stenomediterranean species, {{widespread}} in the coastal thermo-Mediterranean zone of Aegean islands, of mainland Greece and the Ionian islands, of coastal Anatolia; in the Western part of Mediterranean coast, the species is located in more fragmented sites on the Balkan Coast and in Tunisia (Djerba); {{there is also a}} small population of S. spinosum in Malta, while in Italy the species reaches the western limit of its distribution, with the populations in Sardegna, and it occurs in other three locations: Calabria, Apulia and Sicily. Its distribution in Apulia included until now one location, on the ionian side of Salento: Palude del Capitano, near Nardò (Lecce). This issue deals with a new record at "Punta Penne-Punta del Serrone", above of Brindisi. This location is far a little more than 50 km from the other stand, and it is the only one on the Adriatic coast of Italy. The environment consists of a low and rocky coast, settled by succulent and perennial halophytes (Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moric.) Moris, Limonium virgatum (Willd.) Fourr e Atriplex portulacoides L.) and little "embryonic shifting dunes" (code 2110 Council Directive 92 / 43 /EEC). In the inner area there are salt marshes with Juncus acutus L. and Schoenus nigricans L. or patches of maquis. In this habitat occurs Sarcopoterium, in association with Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., Calicotome infesta (Presl) Guss. subsp. infesta, Myrtus communis L., Cistus ssp. and other <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrubs.</b> The whole stand consists of about 100 plants, with a good natural spread...|$|R
5000|$|... 15 {{types of}} {{vegetation}} have been defined {{in just one}} part of the ecoregion in Colombia.Most of the vegetation is tall, dense evergreen tropical rainforest, rich in plant species.It includes well-drained terra firme upland forest, well-drained floodplain forest, poorly drained floodplain forest and swamp forest.The whitewater rivers carry organic and mineral sediments washed down from the Andes, which they deposit during the annual floods, so the soils in the floodplains are richer in nutrients than in the terra firme areas. The floodplain forests belong to the Purus várzea ecoregion.The Peruvian part of the ecoregion contains areas of nutrient-poor white sand similar to the Brazilian campinarana ecoregion.The vegetation is <b>sclerophyllous</b> low <b>scrub</b> or open-canopy low forest with distinctive flora and fauna and high levels of endemism.The sandstone plateaus in Colombia have shrub and savanna vegetation related to the Guiana region.|$|R
50|$|Kodkods are {{strongly}} associated with mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andean and coastal ranges, particularly the Valdivian and Araucaria forests of Chile, which {{is characterized by the}} presence of bamboo in the understory. They prefer evergreen temperate rainforest habitats to deciduous temperate moist forests, <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub</b> and coniferous forests. They are tolerant of altered habitats, being found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas.|$|E
50|$|The Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean is {{the first}} of its type to be {{designated}} by the Man and the Biosphere Programme. It combines the Tingitane Peninsula in Morocco and the southern Iberian Peninsula of Andalusia. Both countries are located in a biogeographic region of deciduous forests and evergreen <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub</b> within the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone. The maritime area of the biosphere reserve is dominated by the Strait of Gibraltar, which links the two peninsulas. The reserve also encompasses natural and human communication routes between Africa and Europe.|$|E
50|$|In {{the west}} of the country, mild wet winters and hot dry summers provide ideal {{conditions}} for the Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests of the region which include evergreen oaks, Aleppo pines and other conifers. Where the trees have been removed for timber, <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub</b> predominates, such as maquis shrubland, and garrigue in calcareous areas. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, forests covered about one third of the country, but a hundred years later, this had reduced to about 3%. The remaining forest cover is mostly in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range and consists of thorny and glossy-leaved trees such as common box, Myrtus communis, broom, terebinth, strawberry tree and wild olive.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Relationships between {{composition}} of secondary vegetation and environment were studied in central North Island, New Zealand. A classification procedure {{was used to}} identify broad compositional groups which included forest, broadleaved scrub, shrub-fernland, <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub</b> and shrubland, and tussock-shrubland. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to examine relationships between species ’ distributions and mean annual temperature and rainfall, stand age, distance from intact forest, slope, topography, and drainage. There were marked differences in the environmental relationships of individual species. We conclude that temperature and rainfall have a dominant role in determining succession after disturbance at a regional scale, but distance from intact forest, topography, slope and solar radiation, become important at local scales. Variation unaccounted for by these environmental factors is most likely linked to historical factors such as variation in disturbance and/or grazing and browsing regimes. Intervention by managers will probably be required {{in the future if}} the current diversity of secondary vegetation in central North Island is to be maintained...|$|E
40|$|Aerial plant biomass {{has been}} sampled by {{harvesting}} on several sites in fynbos {{communities of the}} south­western Cape Province. Biomass in stands of about two years old ranged from about 2 200 kg per ha to about 7 500 kg per ha. Mature stands comprised about 11 000 to 15 000 kg per ha in heaths and 15 000 to 26 000 kg per ha in <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub.</b> The data indicate a maximum annual growth rate of 1 000 to 4 000 kg per ha early {{in the development of}} a stand, but growth rates appear to decline rapidly as communities age. Young stands are dominated by hemicryptophytes, which comprise about 2 000 to  6   000 kg per ha, or about 60 to 75 per cent of the biomass in stands of about four years old. Shrubs become prominent later, but the hemicryptophytes persist. The data indicate that the biomass, growth rates and the shape of the growth curves of fynbos communities are on the whole similar to those of analogous vegetation in other zones of mediterranean type climate. However, there are important structural differences in that analogues of the northern hemisphere (garrigue, chaparral) do not have a significant component of persistent hemicrytophytes. Although Australian heath communities do have this feature, the hemicryptophytes are not as prominent as in fynbos. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to follow the extent of forest types during the Palaeocene and Eocene {{in time and space}} over Europe. Problems that hinder {{producing}} more detailed maps of potential Eocene vegetation are the different palaeogeographic configuration of land and sea and changing relief due to orogeny, the variation in global climate, atmospheric circulation and the world ocean. The early Palaeogene palaeofloristic sites in Europe are widely spaced and the data so far obtained are of varying quality from one site to another. The differences between zonal, intrazonal (azonal) and extrazonal formations and impact of precipitation must be considered. Objective definitions of units based on diversity percentages of components are still to be elaborated. The macropalaeobotanical data thus far available allow us to distinguish intuitively three zonal vegetation types: 1) Broad-leaved evergreen/semi-evergreen quasi-paratropical forest with a high diversity of woody angiosperms related to tropical families, ferns and a low diversity of conifers (mostly Doliostrobus), 2) Broad-leaved nothophyllous evergreen forest with evergreen Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Altingiaceae, Myrtaceae and some conifers (Pinus, Doliostrobus, Cephalotaxus) and 3) Polar deciduous to mixed mesophytic forest with well diversified angiosperms predominantly deciduous and moderate representation of Ginkgo, conifers and ferns. Intrazonal (azonal) formations include riparian gallery forests, coal-forming swamp forests, and poorly developed mangroves with marginal freshwater wetland/aquatic vegetation. The Eocene extrazonal vegetation is less distinct in Europe, consisting probably of pine forests in high mountains and lowland <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub</b> on specific substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between fleshy-fruited plants and their vertebrate seed dispersal agents often has been depicted as subject to important interannual variation, but no study {{has thus far}} documented such variation on a long-term basis. This paper {{presents the results of}} a 12 -yr investigation on fleshy-fruited plants and avian frugivores in a Mediterranean montane locality of southeastern Spain. The main objective was to document patterns and correlates of long-term vari- ation in the composition and abundance of fruits and birds, with particular reference to seed dis- persers. During October–December (‘‘autumn’’ period) 1978 – 1990, abundance of ripe fruits and birds was assessed in a 4 -ha plot in dense, well-preser ved <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>scrub,</b> by means of counts in permanent plots and mist-netting, respectively. Diet composition and fruit preference patterns of Erithacus rubecula and Sylvia atricapilla, the two most abundant seed dispersers, were also inves- tigated over the same period, using fecal sample analyses. Possible consequences to the birds of annual variation in fruit supply and diet composition were investigated using data on fat deposition levels and recapture rates of mist-netted individuals. Total fruit abundance (i. e., mean ripe fruit density of all species combined) fluctuated among years between 5. 4 ± 11. 1 fruits/m 2 (mean ± 1 SD; 1986) and 77. 1 ± 78. 0 fruits/m 2 (1989) and was positively related to the amount of rainfall in the preceding spring. Not all fruiting species bore ripe fruits ever y year, and among those species that did, fruit density fluctuated asynchronously and to variable degrees. Seven out of 13 species exhibited significant supra-annual periodicity in fruit abundance, with fluctuation periods ranging from 2 to 6 yr. Variation in the abundance of each of the six most abundant fruit species was unrelated to annual variation in rainfall. The autumn bird assemblage at the study site was made up of year-round resident species (54. 1...|$|E
