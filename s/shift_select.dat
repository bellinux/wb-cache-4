The simulation model outcomes provided strong indications that such expansion of the AIMDs is both feasible and cost effective.

Their data centric behavior as well as harsh restrictions on energy makes WSN different from many other networks known.

It is a clustering algorithm, where nodes are organized in clusters and send their data to a <b>shift</b> <b>selected</b> cluster head. It will provide improvement on energy consumption in terms of member nodes, by making cluster heads static.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} new {{experimental}} techniques {{for the study}} of strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We used a high numerical aperture imaging system to probe 87 Rb atoms in a two-dimensional lattice with single-site resolution. Fluorescence imaging allows to detect single atoms with a large signal to noise ratio and to reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice. We applied this new technique to a two-dimensional Mott insulator and directly observed number squeezing and the emerging shell structure. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions to theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We find entropies around the critical value for quantum magnetism. In a second series of experiments, we demonstrated two-dimensional single-site spin control in the optical lattice. The differential light shift of a tightly focused laser beam <b>shifts</b> <b>selected</b> atoms into resonance with a microwave field driving a spin flip. In this way, we reach sub-diffraction limited spatial resolution well below the lattice spacing. Starting from a Mott insulator with unity filling we were able to creat...|$|R

DESIGN: We examined three <b>shifts,</b> <b>selected</b> at random, for each resident (without residents' knowledge) during emergency rotations. Information from patient charts was compared with residents' computerized records for rotation (location and preceptor) and patient (age, sex, diagnosis, and procedure) information. SETTING: The Northeastern Ontario Family Medicine Program, a program designed to provide remote, rural, and northern resident experience. PARTICIPANTS: First-, second-, and third-year residents on emergency rotations in the academic years 1992 to 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance, reliability, and validity of tracking records. RESULTS: Residents recorded patient encounters 88 % of the time. Compliance with rotation information was high (100 % rotation, 94 % preceptor). Agreement on patient age and sex was high. Procedure compliance was somewhat lower (83 %). Intrarater reliability (91 %) and inter-rater reliability (78 %) are acceptably high, as is validity when compared with a gold standard entry (88 %). CONCLUSIONS: Regular entry of reliable and valid data is facilitated by the computerized resident-patient encounter tracking program.

40|$|The {{reformulation}} {{of existing}} boundaries between {{primary and secondary}} care, in order to <b>shift</b> <b>selected</b> services traditionally provided by Emergency Departments (EDs) to community-based alternatives, has determined a variety of organisational solutions. One innovative change has been the introduction of fast-track systems for minor injuries or illnesses, whereby community care providers are involved in order to divert patients away from EDs. These facilities offer an open-access service for patients not requiring hospital treatments, and may be staffed by nurses and/or primary care general practitioners operating within, or alongside, the ED. To date {{little research has been}} undertaken on such experiences. To fill this gap, we analyse a Walk-in Centre (WiC) in the Italian city of Parma, consisting of a minor injury unit located alongside the teaching hospital's ED. We examine the link between the utilisation rates of the WiC and primary care characteristics, focusing on the main organisational features of the practices and estimating panel count data models for 2007 - 2010.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-four patients who participated in an intramural Phase I/II parotid-sparing IMRT dose-escalation protocol using the SIB treatment technique had their dose distributions reevaluated to assess the impact of random and systematic setup errors. The dosimetric effect of random setup error was simulated by convolving the two-dimensional fluence distribution of each beam with the random setup error probability density distribution. Random setup errors of! " 1, 3, and 5 mm were simulated.

A total of 54 drivers (40 employees working at day shift, and 15 employees working at night <b>shift)</b> <b>selected</b> randomly agreed to participate. Fatigue developments while driving were monitored during 1 st day, 3 rd day and 5 th day from a weekly rooster. Fatigue was measured thoroughly via changes in heart rate (HR), reductions in Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) frequency using flicker apparatus, and increases in subjective sleepiness scale using the modified Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Measurements were done for both day and night shifts, right before the drivers leaving the main depot in Plumpang, Jakarta for targeted gas stations and right after their return back to the depot (there were about 3 - 4 trips in a shift). Results of this study found that there was no significant effect of the measurement day on fatigue. Changes in HR appeared to be less sensitive to fatigue and sleepiness. Interestingly, fatigue development at night shift was significantly higher than that of day shift, based on changes in CFF and modified KSS (p< 0. 05). In general, fatigue level appeared to be at moderate-high levels, and the company was suggested to implement a comprehensive fatigue management system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to find out}} if it's {{feasible}} to use on/off solenoid valves and pneumatic actuators to operate heavy duty manual transmissions. The <b>shift</b> and <b>select</b> operations in the transmission will be position controlled to reduce wear and tear. The on/off solenoid valves are more complicated to control than proportional valves, but are cheaper, smaller and more robust. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of automotive industry. This lead to limiting sensory inputs to only a position sensor for each of the two actuators. The gear change dynamics of a heavy duty transmission with the added pneumatics was modeled in MATLAB-Simulink. This enabled the development of a gain scheduled controller for the system. The pneumatics and control system was then implemented in a test rig consisting of a transmission driven by an electric motor, and the results were compared to those of the simulations. The results show that full gear changes with both <b>shift</b> and <b>select</b> actuation can be done in under 350 ms, and that the model replicates the dynamics in a realistic manner. It was found that one should implement RPM-matching in the system. This would lead to less wear and tear on the transmission, lower shift times and higher consistency in shift times. These results show that the use of on/off solenoid valves are a feasible choice of control method for the system. </p...|$|R

30|$|Then the {{challenge}} is to develop a pulse sequence potentially able to differentiate histological changes. For instance, to discriminate other modifications from fat infiltration, several fat suppression pulse sequence can be used: short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) [16] has been used to detect muscle edema in DMD though STIR suppresses the signal of all tissues with a short T 1 and not selectively the fat. Another pulse sequence, chemical <b>shift</b> <b>selected</b> imaging (CHESS) [17] can provide a selective suppression of fat signal and can be combined with a T 2 weighted (T 2 w) imaging [18]. Chemical shift water–fat separation methods such as multipoint Dixon [19] and iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) [20] separate the water signal from the fat signal using the known phase shift that occurs due to the different precessional frequencies of fat and water. The IDEAL method has also been combined with a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) imaging sequence to create the IDEAL-CPMG method providing a pair of fat and water decomposed images at each echo time; the water-isolated and fat-isolated signals can then be fitted directly with monoexponential decay curves to measure the T 2 of water and the T 2 of fat [21]. If fat is totally suppressed, T 2 is then a strict water T 2; however, fat is not often correctly suppressed minimizing the expected difference between T 2 (fat[*]+[*]water) and theoretical water T 2. As well, the difference between calculated T 2 (the true T 2) image, more difficult to obtain and often more noisy, and a T 2 weighted (T 2 w) image must not be underestimated [22].|$|R
