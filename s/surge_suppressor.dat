50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded surge relief valve, spring-loaded pressure safety valves, pilot-operated valves, <b>surge</b> <b>suppressors,</b> and rupture disks.|$|R
25|$|While a MOV is {{designed}} to conduct significant power for very short durations (about 8 to 20 microseconds), such as caused by lightning strikes, it typically {{does not have the}} capacity to conduct sustained energy. Under normal utility voltage conditions, this is not a problem. However, certain types of faults on the utility power grid can result in sustained over-voltage conditions. Examples include a loss of a neutral conductor or shorted lines on the high voltage system. Application of sustained over-voltage to a MOV can cause high dissipation, potentially resulting in the MOV device catching fire. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has documented many cases of catastrophic fires that have been caused by MOV devices in <b>surge</b> <b>suppressors,</b> and has issued bulletins on the issue.|$|R

40|$|An {{on-going}} {{question in}} the field of surge protection study is how to predict incipient failure of power electronics {{in the event of a}} short time, high voltage, and high energy transient surge propagation. The work presented in this thesis addresses the above question by investigating how a high voltage transient surge, whose duration is in the microseconds range, will propagate through the two-level transient voltage suppressor system that is intended to protect sophisticated electronics situated close to the service entrance of a building. In this work the energy patterns relevant to the individual components of the system are evaluated using numerical methods and some of the results are also compared with those obtained using SPICE simulations. Although several mathematical models for surge protection components are discussed in the literature and some device specific ones are provided by manufacturers, there is no evidence to show that a complete analysis, using any such model, has been performed to predict the energy absorptions and associated time lags between the components in a TVSS. Numerical simulation techniques using MATLAB are used to estimate the energy absorption and associated time delays in relation to the propagated transient surge, in individual components of a transient voltage <b>surge</b> <b>suppressor.</b> This study develops mathematical models for particular nonlinear transient surge absorbing elements, specifically for the metal oxide varistor and transient voltage suppressor diode, formulates the state equations which are used to numerically simulate several instances of the transient voltage <b>surge</b> <b>suppressor</b> system, and presents simulation results. All results are validated experimentally using a lightning surge simulator. The outcomes established using the two approaches indicate that the theoretical energy calculations are within 10 % of the experimental validations for the metal oxide varistor, which is the main energy absorbing element in the system. The remaining energy distributions in the line-filter components and the transient voltage suppressor diode, which are at least 10 times smaller, are all within 20 % of the experimental results. The times at which, the metal oxide varistor and the transient voltage suppressor diode switches to heavy conduction mode are also simulated accurately...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{transmission}} and reception systems of optical signals are widely used. Receiving the optical signal in such systems is carried by photoreceiving modules {{based on a}} photodetector, which defines {{the quality of the}} received signal, the range and speed of the entire system. However, hitherto used p–i–n- and avalanche photodiodes do not fully meet the growing demands. The present work is devoted to investigate the photovoltaic characteristics of semiconductor thin base transistor structure based on germanium, which is superior the silicon counterparts by speed and gain. Investigated p+–n–p-structures were obtained by diffusion of antimony onto the substrate of p-type germanium to a depth of 1 micron and alloying of indium to the part of its surface which creates diffusion layer of ?+-type and with thickness of 0, 5 microns. Experiments have shown that the reverse biasing of a single p+-n-emitter-base junction leads to a smooth increase in reverse current, at the same time when it is connected in series to forward biased collector p-n-junction there is a sharp increase in the current by voltage, giving properties of voltage <b>surge</b> <b>suppressor.</b> This behavior of the current-voltage characteristics {{can be explained by the}} punch-through effect when the space charge regions of the emitter junction and the space charge region of collector junction touch each other and the conditions are realized for double carrier injection into a fully depleted region of the transistor.

40|$|Abstract—Although {{electric}} {{submersible pumps}} (ESPs) {{have been produced}} for almost 100 years, the actual causes of certain electrical failures are still unknown. Why do failures occur on startup or two weeks after an electrical storm? Most of {{the answers to these}} questions can be found from an analysis of tra-ditional grounding techniques and consideration of how electrical insulation fails. ESPs are predominantly operated on ungrounded power, which can lead to arcing faults and residual charge. Fre-quently the wellhead is not even used as a ground. At other times cathodic protection installers insist on no other connections to the wellhead. Some ground wire connections can actually exacerbate the electrical damage done by lightning. Three-wire power systems are still quite prevalent in the oil field. Ferroresonance and lack of third-harmonic magnetizing current can produce very distorted waveforms. All these topic are investigated. A consensus seems to be building that one grounding configuration does provide superior reliability.

Figure 1 is an overview of the WSMR water supply system. The WSCS provides water for approximately 90 square miles of the 3, 700 square mile missile range. The WSCS was designed and installed in 1990 and in need of upgrading and repair. The system was evaluated and found to be only moderately functional. The WSCS consists of an IBM compatible personal computer (PC) based user interface, located at the WSMR Water Plant and Fire Dept. and industrial-type computers called Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based stations at the Water Plant, water wells and tanks. The stations communicate over a 400 MHz radio half-duplex link. The serial message utilizes the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Block Check Character (BBC) type of error checking. The Master station controls pumping by downloading pump settings to the slave stations. The slave stations upload data to the master such as tank level, pump status, energy usage, gallons of water pumped and various alarms. The system was analyzed and the design was found to be sound. The system did require improvements. These improvements include adding <b>surge</b> <b>suppressors,</b> software upgrades, absolute reading flow rate sensors, and providing adequate environmental cooling for the control system.

50|$|These {{devices are}} not rated in joules because they operate {{differently}} from the earlier suppressors, {{and they do not}} depend on materials that inherently wear out during repeated <b>surges.</b> SM <b>suppressors</b> are primarily used to control transient voltage surges on electrical power feeds to protected devices. They are essentially heavy-duty low-pass filters connected so that they allow 50/60 Hz line voltages through to the load, while blocking and diverting higher frequencies. This type of suppressor differs from others by using banks of inductors, capacitors and resistors that suppress voltage surges and in rush current to the neutral wire, whereas other designs shunt to the ground wire. Surges are not diverted but actually suppressed. The inductors slow down the energy. Since the inductor in series with the circuit path slows the current spike, the peak surge energy is spread out in the time domain and harmlessly absorbed and slowly released from a capacitor bank.|$|R

At the date of this release, we have certified over 70 HE processing and storage cells at our Site 300 facilities. In Chapters 1 and 2 respectively, we address the need and methods of lightning certification for HE processing and storage facilities at LLNL. We present the preferred method of lightning protection in Chapter 3, as well as the likely building modifications that are needed to comply with this method. In Chapter 4, we present the threat assessment and resulting safe work areas within a cell. After certification, there may be changes to operations during a lightning alert, and this is discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 lists the maintenance requirements for the continuation of lighting certification status. Appendices of this document are meant as an aid in developing your own certification process, and they include a bonding list, an inventory of measurement equipment, <b>surge</b> <b>suppressors</b> in use at LLNL, an Integrated Work and Safety form (IWS), and a template certification sign-off sheet. The lightning certification process involves more that what is spelled out in this document. The first steps involve considerable planning, the securing of funds, and management and explosives safety buy-in. Permits must be obtained, measurement equipment must be assembled and tested, and engineers and technicians must be trained in their use. Cursory building inspections are also recommended, and surge suppression for power systems must be addressed. Upon completion of a certification report and its sign-off by management, additional work is required. Training will be needed in order to educate workers and facility managers of the requirements of lightning certification. Operating procedures will need to be generated and/or modified with additional controls. Engineering controls may also be implemented requiring the modification of cells.
