The main result generalizes some {{previous}} {{results of}} the first author (and his co-authors) concerning the asymptotic behavior of solutions of discrete equations; see, e.g., [5 – 16]. In papers [5, 7], in our best knowledge, the retract principle is extended to discrete equations (see [9 – 11] as well). In [6, 8, 14, 16] delayed discrete equations are considered by the retract technique, and in [12] the retract principle is given for discrete time <b>scales.</b> <b>Papers</b> [13, 15] are devoted to {{the extension of the}} retract principle to dynamic equations.
