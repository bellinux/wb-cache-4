5|$|The AJ-2 {{incorporated}} all of {{the changes}} made to the late model AJ-2P and 55 aircraft were ordered on 14 February 1951. The AJ-2 deleted the <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> for the third crewman, but retained the third seat in the cockpit from the AJ-2P.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight crew}} was five (two pilots, navigator, and radio {{operator}} with the flight engineer in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> behind {{the flight deck}} opposite crew rest berths) {{and there were two}} stewards to attend to the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Monturiol's {{ultimate}} plan envisaged {{a vessel}} custom-built to house his new engine, {{which would be}} entirely built of metal and with the engine housed in its own <b>separate</b> <b>compartment.</b> Due {{to the state of}} his finances, construction of the metal vessel was out of the question. Instead, he managed to assemble enough funds to fit the engine into the wooden Ictineo II for preliminary tests and demonstrations.|$|E

25|$|In {{new housing}} developments, the NDCBU {{location}} is fixed by the developer, not the USPS, {{and may be}} located hundreds of yards away from the addressee's actual residence. A parcel locker for receipt of packages and a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> for outgoing mail are usually built into the station. The mail carrier will have a key to a large door on one side that reaches all the compartments, and the residents or tenants will each have {{a key to the}} door into their individual compartment on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment,</b> was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E
25|$|Inuit made {{clothes and}} {{footwear}} from animal skins, sewn together using needles made from animal bones and threads made from other animal products, such as sinew. The anorak (parka) {{is made in}} a similar fashion by Arctic peoples from Europe through Asia and the Americas, including the Inuit. The hood of an amauti, (women's parka, plural amautiit) was traditionally made extra large with a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> below the hood to allow the mother to carry a baby against her back and protect it from the harsh wind. Styles vary from region to region, from the shape of the hood to the length of the tails. Boots (mukluk or kamik), could be made of caribou or seal skin, and designed for men and women.|$|E

500|$|Two of {{the three}} prototypes crashed during testing, but their loss did not {{materially}} affect {{the development of the}} aircraft as the first batch of Savages had been ordered on 6 October 1947. The most significant difference between the XAJ-1 and the production aircraft was the revision of the cockpit to accommodate a third crewman in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment.</b> The first flight by a production aircraft occurred in May 1949 and Fleet Composite Squadron FIVE (VC-5) became the first squadron to receive a Savage in September. The squadron participated in testing and evaluating the aircraft together with the Naval Air Test Center (NATC) in order to expedite the Savage's introduction into the fleet. The first carrier takeoff and landing made by the bomber took place from the [...] on 21 April and 31 August 1950, respectively. Many, if not most, surviving AJ-1s had their tails upgraded to the improved AJ-2 configuration.|$|E
500|$|A {{decision}} was made to replace the six NR-23 guns in the nose with four AM-23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50% greater than that of the NR-23 and to totally revise the gun installation. The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> made of heat-resistant steel and provided with a special blast deflector chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets. [...] Two doors were provided {{at the bottom of the}} chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing. One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent cartridges and links were saved and sometimes ignited. Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber. The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem.|$|E

2500|$|Each Engine Room {{held two}} sets of turbines, each driving a [...] {{diameter}} four-bladed propeller [...] Each set comprised a single high pressure (27kg/cm²) turbine, a medium pressure (10kg/cm²) turbine, and two low pressure two-flow rotor turbines (4kg/cm² and 1.25kg/cm²). Four turbo generators, each of , were used; two in the forward engine room, and the rest in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> directly abaft the main machinery spaces, adjacent to the magazines for the aft [...] turrets.|$|E
2500|$|V. rotundifolia is a {{sprawling}} shrub that can grow {{as tall as}} 1.5 m though it typically ranges from 0.5 to 1 m in height. As a product of its rapid nodal rooting, the plant can form dense mats reaching in excess of 10 m from the parent plant. New stems are green, square and fleshy initially before maturing brown and woody. Older, large-diameter stems are covered with heavily fissured bark. Running horizontal stems produce frequent upright branches. Leaves are strongly aromatic, intensifying when crushed. The majority of leaves are simple, but they can occasionally be palmate trifoliate or 2-leaved. Leaves measure 2 to 6.5cm in length and 1-4.5cm in width. Leaf margins are entire. The leaf shape varies from ovate to obovate with acute bases and obtuse apexes. Occasionally, leaf apexes are acute or emarginate. Upper leaf surfaces are dark green whereas lower leaf surfaces range in color from silver to white to light green; all leaf surfaces are tomentose. Petiole bases are typically somewhat purple and measure 0 to 1cm in length. Blades are cupped downward slightly. Leaf veins are lighter green than surrounding tissue. Flowers are borne in indeterminate panicles that may be terminal or axillary. Infloresences measure 3 to 7cm in length. The calyx is cup-shaped and 4 to 4.5cm long. Flowers are zygomorphic, purple to blue-purple, and short pedunculate. They are two-lipped and funnel-form (measuring 8mm in length). Four stamens are didynamous and extend beyond the corolla tube (measuring 9 to 10mm). The style extends beyond the stamens (total length: 12mm). Pollen is tricolpate. Ovaries consist of two carpels with each containing two single seeded locules. Fruits are globose drupes that are green while immature but turn yellow and red before maturing to bluish black. The fruits are frequently incorrectly characterized in the literature as [...] "seeds or berries". Each drupe contains a maximum of four seeds though there are usually fewer {{as a result of}} seed abortion. Each seed is encapsulated in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment.</b> Endosperm is absent. Seeds germinate into tender seedlings that bear two cotyledons and quickly develop two red-margined true leaves. Ploidy level is 2n = 32, 34*.|$|E

60|$|In these Works {{all sorts}} of {{articles}} are manufactured {{to be used by}} other branches of the Salvation Army. Thus I saw poultry-houses being made for the Boxted Small Holdings; these cost from £4 5s. to £4 10s. net, and were excellent structures designed to hold about two dozen fowls. Further on large numbers of seats of different patterns were in process of manufacture, some of them for children, and other longer ones, with reversible backs, {{to be used in the}} numerous Army halls. Next I visited a room in which mattresses and mattress covers are made for the various Shelters, also the waterproof bunk bedding, which costs 7s. 9d. per cover. Further on, in a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment,</b> was a flock-tearing machine, at which the Mormon I have mentioned was employed. This is a very dusty job whereat a man does not work for more than one day in ten.|$|E
6000|$|Half a dozen steps took us {{over the}} path of mossy stones to a house where the whole manufactory was at work. One room held the enamel powders all neatly {{arranged}} in jars of scrupulous cleanliness, a few blank copper vases ready to be operated on, an invisible bird who whistled and whooped in his cage, and a case of gaily painted butterflies ready for reference when patterns were wanted. In the next room sat the manufactory--three men, five women, and two boys--all as silent as sleep. It {{is one thing to}} read of cloissonnée making, but quite another to watch it being made. I began to understand the cost of the ware when I saw a man working out a pattern of sprigs and butterflies on a plate about ten inches in diameter. With finest silver ribbon wire, set on edge, less than the sixteenth of an inch high, he followed the curves of the drawing at his side, pinching the wire into tendrils and the serrated outlines of leaves with infinite patience. A rough touch on the raw copper-plate would have sent the pattern flying into a thousand disconnected threads. When all was put down on the copper, the plate would be warmed just sufficiently to allow the wires to stick firmly to the copper, the pattern then showing in raised lines. Followed the colouring, which was done by little boys in spectacles. With a pair of tiniest steel chopsticks they filled from bowls at their sides each compartment of the pattern with its proper hue of paste. There is not much room allowed for error in filling the spots on a butterfly's wing with avanturine enamel when the said wings are less than an inch across. I watched the delicate play of wrist and hand till I was wearied, and the manager showed me his patterns--terrible dragons, clustered chrysanthemums, butterflies, and diapers as fine as frost on a window-pane--all drawn in unerring line. [...] "Those things are our subjects. I compile from them, and when I want some new colours I go and look at those dead butterflies," [...] said he. After the enamel has been filled in, the pot or plate goes to be fired, and the enamel bubbles all over the boundary lines of wires, and the whole comes from the furnace looking like delicate majolica. It may take a month to put a pattern on the plate in outline, another month to fill in the enamel, but the real expenditure of time does not commence till the polishing. A man sits down with the rough article, all his tea-things, a tub of water, a flannel, and two or three saucers full of assorted pebbles from the brook. He does not get a wheel with tripoli, or emery, or buff. He sits down and rubs. He rubs for a month, three months, or a year. He rubs lovingly, with his soul in his finger ends, and little by little the efflorescence of the fired enamel gives way, and he comes down to the lines of silver, and the pattern in all its glory is there waiting for him. I saw a man who had only been a month over the polishing of one little vase five inches high. He would go on for two months. When I am in America he will be rubbing still, and the ruby-coloured dragon that romped on a field of lazuli, each tiny scale and whisker a <b>separate</b> <b>compartment</b> of enamel, will be growing more lovely.|$|E
