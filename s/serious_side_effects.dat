5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
50|$|One <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> {{that has}} been {{described}} is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.|$|R
5000|$|Methysergide maleate (antiserotonin agent but {{not used}} {{because of the}} <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of retroperitoneal fibrosis) ...|$|R
50|$|The most <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is {{frequent}} hepatotoxicity {{which prompted}} regulatory agencies to issue several warnings and restrictions.|$|R
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. <b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
25|$|The first {{effective}} treatment, atoxyl, an arsenic-based drug {{developed by}} Paul Ehrlich and Kiyoshi Shiga, {{was introduced in}} 1910, but blindness was a <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{penicillin}} is used at {{high doses}} hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia can occur. Developing hypernatremia after administering {{high doses of}} penicillin can be a <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gray baby {{syndrome}} (also termed Gray or Grey syndrome) {{is a rare}} but <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> {{that occurs}} in newborn infants (especially premature babies) following the accumulation of antibiotic chloramphenicol.|$|R
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5â€“7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E
50|$|Torsades de pointes is {{the most}} <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of {{dofetilide}} therapy. The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include vomiting, black stools, diarrhea, and constipation. The more <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> pneumonitis, {{may result}} if {{aspirated}} into the lungs. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Activated charcoal works by absorbing the toxin.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Diaphragmatic {{paralysis}} due to phrenic nerve {{injury is}} a known, and potential <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of cardiac surgery in children. We analyzed prevalence, demographics, clinical impact, {{and management of}} this paralysis.|$|R
25|$|More <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include low blood {{pressure}} and allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As {{amiodarone}} can have <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. <b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding {{it can cause}} problems in the baby. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, {{abnormalities}} in {{the electrical}} {{cycle of the}} heart, low blood pressure and the potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Vigabatrin {{was found}} by Feucht et al. to be an {{effective}} add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> (dyskinesia).|$|R
50|$|Another {{recently}} described rare, but <b>serious,</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is propofol infusion syndrome. This potentially lethal metabolic derangement {{has been}} reported in critically ill patients after a prolonged infusion of high-dose substance in combination with catecholamines and/or corticosteroids.|$|R
50|$|<b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> of {{triamcinolone}} include sore throat, nosebleeds, increased coughing, headache, and runny nose. White patches in {{the throat}} or nose indicate a <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itch, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing. An additional <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> for women is a prolonged menstrual cycle.|$|R
25|$|Published {{clinical}} trials of MSM {{did not report}} any <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> {{but there are no}} peer-reviewed data on the effects of its long-term use in humans.|$|E
25|$|While {{sildenafil}} improves some {{markers of}} disease {{in people with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension, {{it does not appear}} to affect the risk of death or <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|Indometacin is {{a potent}} drug with many <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> {{and should not be}} {{considered}} an analgesic for minor aches and pains or fever. The medication is better described as an anti-inflammatory, rather than an analgesic. Indometacin can also affect warfarin and subsequently raise INR.|$|E
5000|$|Clozapine is an {{effective}} treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ("treatment-resistant" [...] or [...] "refractory" [...] schizophrenia), but it has the potentially <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.|$|R
25|$|When {{taken by}} mouth common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> include tendon rupture, {{numbness}} due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin {{is in the}} fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA.|$|R
25|$|<b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> of infliximab, {{like other}} immunosuppressants of the TNF class, can be serious and {{potentially}} fatal, and infliximab carries an FDA black-box warning on the label. Listed <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, risk of re-activation of tuberculosis, serum sickness, {{and risk of}} multiple sclerosis. <b>Serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> also include lymphoma and severe infections.|$|R
25|$|Myopathy with {{elevation}} of creatine kinase (CK, aka CPK) and rhabdomyolysis {{are the most}} <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> occurring rarely {{at a rate of}} 2.3 to 9.1 per 10,000 person-years among patients taking atorvastatin. As mentioned previously, atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately if this occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{evidence}} available only permits making a weak conclusion, but {{it suggests that}} a physician properly managing opioid use in patients with no history of substance dependence or substance abuse can give long-term pain relief with little risk of developing addiction, abuse, or other <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{that target}} the {{autoimmune}} response are also used. Intravenous immunoglobin {{is the best}} second-line treatment for SPS. It often decreases stiffness and improves {{quality of life and}} startle reflex. It is generally safe, but there are possible <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and it is expensive. The European Federation of Neurological Societies suggests it be used when disabled patients do not respond well to diazepam and baclofen. Steroids, rituximab, and plasma exchange have been used to suppress the immune system in SPS patients, but the efficacy of these treatments is unclear. Botulinum toxin has been used to treat SPS, but it {{does not appear to have}} long-term benefits and has potential <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> In paraneoplastic cases, tumors must be managed for the condition to be contained. Opiates are sometimes used to treat severe pain, but in some cases they exacerbate symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Carbenoxolone (CBX) is a glycyrrhetinic acid {{derivative}} with a steroid-like structure, {{similar to}} substances {{found in the}} root of the licorice plant. Carbenoxolone is used for the treatment of peptic, esophageal and oral ulceration and inflammation. Electrolyte imbalance is a <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of carbenoxolone when used systemically.|$|R
40|$|Received 20 July, 2008; Accepted 5 Aug, 2008) Abstract Priapism {{is a rare}} but <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of psychotropic {{drugs with}} {{incidence}} of 15 - 26 %. Approximately all of of the atypical antipsychotic drugs are reported with this complication. in this report a 24 -years old man with multiple delusions which was treated with risperidone(6 mg),was affected by priapism after two months. After drug dose reduction and finally discontinuation, olanzapine(5 mg) was started. Only one dose of this drug cause recurrence of priapism. Therefore this drug was discontinued also. After clozapine starting(150 mg),priapism was induced. Therefore {{it is necessary for}} physicians whom prescribe serotonin-dopamin antagonist drugs must consider this rare but <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> J Mazand Univ Med Sci 2008; 18 (66) : 98 - 101 (Persian...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Bladder instillations with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are {{commonly}} used as immunotherapy for bladder carcinoma. Sometimes patients experience <b>serious</b> systemic <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> such as sepsis or pneumonitis. Granulomatous hepatitis is a rare <b>serious</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> which has been considered a hypersensitivity reaction to BCG. PATIENT [...] The first case of granulomatous hepatitis after BCG bladder instillation in which mycobacteria were identified by staining techniques and mycobacterial DNA was detected in liver tissue using the polymerase chain reaction is reported. CONCLUSION [...] The granulomatous hepatitis was caused by BCG infection of the liver after haematogenous dissemination of BCG, rather than hypersensitivity...|$|R
