5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then <b>serial</b> <b>music.</b> Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, modernism in English {{remained}} {{in the role of}} an avant garde movement, depending on little presses and magazines and a small but dedicated readership. The key group to emerge during this time were the Objectivist poets, consisting of Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, Basil Bunting and Lorine Niedecker. The Objectivists were admirers of Stein, Pound and Williams and Pound actively promoted their work. Thanks to his influence, Zukofsky was asked to edit a special Objectivist issue of the Chicago-based journal Poetry in 1931 to launch the group. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics were to treat the poem as an object and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet's ability to look clearly at the world, and in this they can be viewed as direct descendants of the Imagists. Continuing a tradition established in Paris, Zukofsky, Reznikoff, and Oppen went on to form the Objectivist Press to publish books by themselves and by Williams. In his later work, Zukofsky developed his view of the poem as object to include experimenting with mathematical models for creating poems, producing effects similar {{to the creation of a}} Bach fugue or a piece of <b>serial</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Encompassing a {{wide variety}} of post-Romantic styles {{composed}} through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. Modernism (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and <b>serial</b> <b>music.</b> A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 1930.

2500|$|Within the {{community}} of modern music, exactly what constituted serialism was also a matter of debate. The conventional English usage is that the word [...] "serial" [...] applies to all twelve-tone music, which is a subset of <b>serial</b> <b>music,</b> {{and it is this}} usage that is generally intended in reference works. Nevertheless, a large body of music exists that is called [...] "serial" [...] but does not employ note-rows at all, let alone twelve-tone technique, e.g., Stockhausen's Klavierstücke I–IV (the focus of Ruwet's criticism, they use permuted sets), as well as his Stimmung (with pitches from the overtone series, which also is used as the model for the rhythms) and Pousseur's Scambi (where the permuted sounds are made exclusively from filtered white noise).|$|E

2500|$|In music theory, a {{parameter}} denotes {{an element}} {{which may be}} manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for pitch, loudness, duration, and timbre, though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in <b>serial</b> <b>music,</b> where each parameter may follow some specified series. Paul Lansky and George Perle criticized {{the extension of the}} word [...] "parameter" [...] to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense, but it remains common. [...] The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Much musical {{experimentation}} {{was taking}} place inside other Paris institutions. In 1954 Pierre Boulez founded Le Domaine musical, which between 1954 and 1966, presented regular concerts of new music by composers including Schoenberg and Webern.
