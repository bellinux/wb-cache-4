25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the existence of}} a hydrocarbon with the C10H16 formula and diamond-like structure of the molecule was suggested by H. Decker at a conference in 1924. Decker called this molecule decaterpene and was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had not been synthesized yet.|$|E
25|$|According to many Rastas, the {{illegality}} of cannabis in {{many nations}} {{is evidence of}} persecution of Rastafari. They are not <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest {{the rules and regulations}} of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} {{accepting}} of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he [...] "love the idea of Adam" [...] but {{was having a hard}} time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, [...] "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster." [...] Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers [...] "did a decent job of bringing [...] to a conclusion". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was [...] "always impressed with [...] costume/make-up". Furthermore, he was positively <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> [...] "took [...] a minute to recognize" [...] Adam's appearance in [...] "Restless" [...] sans makeup.|$|E

60|$|Oddly enough, {{they also}} were {{discussing}} deviations from the normal. On the table was a plant in full flower, and Ailie, who had lent <b>it,</b> was expressing <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should bloom so late in the season.|$|R
500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the special}} effects, the costuming, the set re-constructions and the {{residual}} payments to The Original Series cast, Behr later described [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] as [...] "probably the most expensive hour of episodic TV ever produced". The only member of The Original Series cast who was spoken to directly by the producers was Leonard Nimoy, who was enthusiastic about the idea and was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had taken them so long to come up with it. The remaining cast members were each contacted through Paramount's legal department. Dennis McCarthy wanted to re-work the Jerry Fielding score previously used on [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". He said that he intended to use the production equipment and orchestra available to bring the score up to the same scale previously seen on Deep Space Nine. However, the producers wanted a new score and so McCarthy explained that he composed it in a Fielding-inspired mindset. The only piece that was directly re-recorded by McCarthy was the Alexander Courage [...] "Theme from Star Trek", which involved a 45 piece orchestra.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, who got the story from {{another member of the}} writing staff, Mike Scully. When the show runners of this season, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, took over the job from David Mirkin, they wanted to [...] "take the show back" [...] to the Simpson family. Their goal was to have at least 15 episodes per season that {{revolved}} around the family or a member of the family, but they still wanted to do the annual Halloween episode, a Sideshow Bob episode, an Itchy and Scratchy episode, and a [...] "format bending" [...] episode, which in this season was [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". They wanted the family episodes to be realistic, and Oakley thought [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] was a good example. When Scully pitched the idea to the writers, Oakley was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had not been done earlier on the show. He thought the story sounded like something that would have been done by the third season because it was [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "organic".|$|E
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{movie is}} simply a failure of imagination.

2500|$|As well as {{winning the}} Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, Haddon earned the Book Trust teenage fiction award. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was also long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and [...] "many {{observers}} were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not {{advance to the}} shortlist." [...] John Carey, chairman of the Booker panel of judges, told The Guardian, [...] "We have several clashes of opinion among the judges but I found Haddon's book about a boy with Asperger's syndrome breathtaking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} often {{described}} as [...] "a show about nothing". However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated [...] "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was {{we want to show}} how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the many}} {{differences}} with his earlier films, The Straight Story {{did not contain}} profanities, sexual content or violence; it was rated G (general viewing) by the Motion Picture Association of America, which came as [...] "shocking news" [...] to many in the film industry, who were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> [...] "did not disturb, offend or mystify". As Le Blanc and Odell stated, the plot made it [...] "seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film – a surreal road movie".|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{it should}} be seen as no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> took some time for the {{translation}} to be accepted by all. Further, it was never, at least on record, as promised by James I, royally proclaimed as the Bible of the Church of England.|$|R

2500|$|However {{without the}} expert's help, Seppmann and Hegley {{immediately}} clogged the millstone. [...] Thinking more speed would help, {{they put on}} full sail. [...] Instead the rising wind set the arms spinning so fast the operators couldn't stop it. [...] The wooden parts grew so hot that the windmill {{was in danger of}} catching fire. [...] Meanwhile, a crowd of onlookers had gathered outside, eager to see Seppmann's curiosity finally in operation and <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> seemed to be running so fast it might tear itself apart. [...] In desperation Seppmann tossed something into the gears, but it shattered and a piece was flung away with such force that it shot a hole through the rim of Seppmann's hat. [...] At last Seppmann and Hegley were able to unfurl some of the sails and halt the mill. [...] Ultimately they learned that the clog was due to poor dressing of the millstones and after making improvements, including a better brake, were operational by late September.|$|E
2500|$|With two defeats Wally Hammond {{would have}} to win the last three Tests to regain the Ashes, though Don Bradman had done this in the last series in Australia. The Melbourne wicket had a {{reputation}} for fast, pacey wickets, but after two shocks at Brisbane and Sydney few were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not living up to its reputation; [...] "The 1947 wicket was not as tame as all that, but it was, for Melbourne, exceedingly meek". Ray Lindwall was fit again and resigned his job when his employers refused him leave to play in the Test. [...] Fred Freer was dropped and the Chinaman bowler George Tribe was replaced by the leg-spinner Bruce Dooland. Arthur Morris had failed in the two Tests, but was given another chance instead of Ken Meuleman. Peter Smith was ill with appendicitis and James Langridge had strained a muscle in catching practice the day before the match, so Hammond had no spinner apart from Doug Wright and the 37-year-old fast bowler Bill Voce was recalled. Don Bradman won the toss and chose to bat on New Year's Day.|$|E

I was, like my friend Lieutenant Ryan, in the Mayo Fusiliers; when I {{had the good fortune}} to be mentioned, in despatches, in {{connection}} with an affair in which the transport that took us out to Portugal was engaged with two French privateers. In consequence of the mention, General Fane appointed me one of his aides-de-camp; and I acted in that capacity during the campaign that ended at Corunna.
