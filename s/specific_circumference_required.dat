40|$|Along the {{coastline}} {{and in particular}} in the deltaic estuaries of the Netherlands, the occurring of numerous flow slides have been recorded. Analysis of these historical instabilities has resulted in empirical guidelines for verification of occurring of flow slides. The request to tender for the Engineering & Construct project Dredge Sludge project Hollandsch Diep in the Netherlands prompted the development of realistic design tools which enables the prediction of the initiation of static liquefaction in a reliability based framework. The realisation of a disposal area with a volume of approximately 10 million m 3 in a restricted <b>circumference</b> <b>required</b> the excavation up to 38 m depth and construction of a ring dike, while designing the required slope with sufficient reliability. Based on international literature, in-house experience and laboratory and field tests a simplified static liquefaction model based on the critical state framework has been developed. For the reliability assessment a robust method has been adopted using stochastic analysis of the dominant parameters, while using a regional database. Several planned and unplanned failures during the realisation of the dredging activities were successfully analysed using the simplified stochastic approach of the modified state parameter model. The article gives insight into the determination and application of the state parameter approach in the reliability based framework and discusses the practical and academic needs for further developments and research.

40|$|Lymphoedema is {{reported}} to occur in approximately one in four women following curative treatment for breast cancer. Reported rates are almost exclusively for level 1, 2, 3 axillary clearance with few data for the current practice of level 1, 2 dissections. Swelling can affect the whole upper limb but frequently will remain restricted to hand, forearm or upper arm. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine incidence after level 1, 2 dissection, degree and site of swelling and risk factors which might determine such incidences. Results were available on 198 patients. The cumulative prevalence of lymphoedema after level 1, 2 dissections was 14 % in the arm, 12 % in the forearm and 16 % in the hand, assuming a circumference difference of more than 5 % indicated lymphoedema. Moderate lymphoedema representing more than 10 % circumference difference was found in 1 % (arm), 3. 5 % (forearm) and 0. 5 % in the hand. Risk factors for lymphoedema were experience of the surgeon (upper arm only), dominant limb (forearm only) and right-sided cancer treatment (for hand only). When lymphoedema in any site was considered, right-sided treatment and nodal status were independently significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that lymphoedema is a common complication following level 1, 2 dissection. Whole limb volume is often considered the main outcome measure for detecting lymphoedema and determining success of treatment, yet swelling may be restricted to regions of the limb and site <b>specific</b> <b>circumference</b> measurements are therefore recommended.

These two instruments were equipped with several rings, and the rings of one were similar both in size and in scale {{to those of the}} other. Using the classic method of drawing the scale on the circumference of a ring, we analyze the scales of the Small Simplified Armillary Sphere and the Sun-and-Stars Time-Determining Instrument. Like the scale feature of the Simplified Armilla, we find that these two instruments selected the <b>specific</b> <b>circumference</b> which can be drawn by two kinds of scales. If Joseon’s astronomical instruments is applied by the dual scale drawing on one circumference, we suggest that 3. 14 was used as the ratio of the circumference of circle, not 3 like China, when the ring’s size was calculated in that time. From the size of Hundred-interval disk of the extant Simplified Sundial in Korea, we make a conclusion that the three rings’ diameter of the Sun-and-Stars Time-Determining Instrument described in the Sejiong Sillok (世宗實錄, Veritable Records of the King Sejong) refers to that of the middle circle of every ring, not the outer circle. As analyzing the degree of 28 lunar lodges (lunar mansions) in the equator written by Chiljeongsan-naepyeon (七政算內篇, the Inner Volume of Calculation of the Motions of the Seven Celestial Determinants), we also obtain the result that the scale of the Celestial-circumference-degree in the Small Simplified Armillary Sphere was made with a scale error about 0. 1 du in root mean square (RMS) ...|$|R

The LTI Criterion 400 uses an infrared semi-conductor laser diode for slope distance measurement. A vertical tilt-sensing encoder provides vertical inclination, while a fluxgate electronic compass measures magnetic azimuth, completing the data required to establish a point’s three-dimensional location in space. It is used to map the position of every branch point in the canopy down to a certain size and also the positions of various reiterations, breaks, kinks, or any other eccentricities in the tree.

Design Growth was studied within 6 -month intervals {{in a rural}} Senegalese community during one dry and two rainy (hungry) seasons. Responsiveness {{was defined as the}} change divided by the standard deviation of each anthropometric indicator. Contrast was defined as the difference in responsiveness between dry and rainy seasons. Setting The study was conducted in Niakhar, a rural area of Senegal under demographic surveillance, with contrasted food and morbidity situations between rainy and dry seasons. Subjects Some 5000 children under 5 years of age were monitored at 6 -month intervals in 1983 - 1984. The present analysis was carried out on a sub-sample of children aged 6 - 23 months with complete measures, totalling 2803 children-intervals. Results In both univariate and multivariate analysis, mid-upper arm circumference was found to be more responsive to nutritional stress than the commonly used weight-for-height Z-score (contrast = − 0 · 64 for mid-upper arm circumference v. − 0 · 53 for weight-for-height Z-score). Other discriminant indicators were: muscle circumference, weight-for-height, BMI and triceps skinfold. Height, head circumference and subscapular skinfold had no discriminating power for measuring the net effect of nutritional stress during the rainy season. Conclusions The use of mid-upper arm circumference for assessing nutritional stress in community surveys should be considered and preferred to other nutritional indicators.

The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently proposed new criteria for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, which requires the presence of central obesity as measured by ethnic <b>specific</b> waist <b>circumference</b> (WC) cutoff values. Currently, no specific WC thresholds for diagnosis of central obesity in Hispanics are available. The objectives were to determine the appropriate gender specific WC thresholds for diagnosis of central obesity in Mexican American adults and to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome using IDF definition with and without the modified WC in this population. Data from 3265 Mexican American adults aged 20 - 80 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 - 2006 were used. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was compared using IDF criteria with and without the modified waist circumference. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that yielding at least 80 % sensitivity, the WC value of 90 cm in both genders was more appropriate in predicting the presence of two or more metabolic syndrome risk factors in this population. Based on this cutoff, there was 34 % reduction in the prevalence of central obesity in women (82. 5 % to 54. 2 %). The age adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome decreased from 58. 4 to 48. 2 %. The metabolic syndrome was more common among Mexican American men than women (55. 8 % in men versus 37. 8 % in women, P = 0. 0003).

We also explored variation in anthropometric associations by sex and ethnicity. Methods We performed cross-sectional analysis of 22, 293 {{men and women who}} were from five ethnic groups and 21 countries, and at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Standardised anthropometric associations with type 2 diabetes and AUC of glucose status from OGTT (AUCOGTT) were determined using multiple regression. Explanatory power was assessed using the c-statistic and adjusted r 2. Results An increase in BMI, waist circumference or WHR had similar positive associations with type 2 diabetes, AUCOGTT and explanatory power after adjustment for age, sex, smoking and ethnicity (p< 0. 01). However, using BMI and WHR together resulted in greater explanatory power than with other models (p< 0. 01). Associations were strongest when waist circumference and hip circumference were used together, a combination that had greater explanatory power than other models except for BMI and WHR together (p< 0. 01). Results were directionally similar according to sex and ethnicity; however, significant variations in associations were observed among these subgroups. Conclusions/interpretation The combination of BMI and WHR, or of waist circumference and hip circumference has the best explanatory power for type 2 diabetes and glucose status compared with a single anthropometric measure.

First group consisted of subjects [mean age 57 (45 to 73), duration of diabetes of 10 years (4 to 16) ] prescribed a long-acting basal (glargine, detemir), premixed (biphasic insulin Aspart 30, Humalog Mix 25) or short-acting (aspart, lispro) insulin analogues. Patients from second group [mean age 59 (46 to 75), duration of diabetes for 10 years (5 to 15) ] were treated with intermediate- acting basal (Protophane, Humulin NPH), premixed (biphasic human insulin 30, Humulin M 3) and regular (Actrapid, Humulin R) human insulins.

We examined the validity of IDF WC cut points for identifying insulin resistance (IR), the underlying cause of {{the metabolic}} syndrome, in predominantly black, young Jamaican adults. Methods Participants from a 1986 birth cohort were evaluated between 2005 and 2007 when they were 18 - 20 years old. Trained observers took anthropometric measurements and collected a fasting blood sample. IR was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment computer programme (HOMA-IR). Sex specific quartiles for IR were generated using HOMA-IR values and participants in the highest quartile were classified as "insulin resistant". Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the best WC to identify insulin resistance. The sensitivity and specificity of these values were compared with the IDF recommended WC cut-points. Results Data from 707 participants (315 males; 392 females) were analysed. In both sexes those with IR were more obese, had higher mean systolic blood pressure, glucose and triglycerides and lower mean HDL cholesterol. The WC was a good predictor of IR with an ROC area under the curve (95 % CI) of 0. 71 (0. 64, 0. 79) for men and 0. 72 (0. 65, 0. 79) for women. Using the Youden Index (J) the best WC cut point for identifying IR in male participants was 82 cm (sensitivity 45 %, specificity 93 %, J 0. 38) while the standard cut point of 94 cm had a sensitivity of 14 % and specificity of 98 % (J 0. 12). In the female participants 82 cm was also a good cut point for identifying IR (sensitivity 52 %, specificity 87 %, J 0. 39) and was similar to the standard IDF 80 cm cut point (sensitivity 53 %, specificity 82 %, J 0. 35). Conclusions The WC that identified IR in young black men is lower than the IDF recommended WC cut point.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is a long-term}} process, explained by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, that starts early in life and {{is involved in the}} pathophysiology of a large percentage of cases with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of fat distribution and especially the contribution of visceral fat accumulation to the development of metabolic disorders. Visceral adipose tissue can be studied through different imaging techniques. The accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, as opposed to subcutaneous fat, increases the risk of developing metabolic disease and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Visceral adipocytes secrete a variety of cytokines known as adipocytokines suggesting that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that may affect the function of other organs. Weight loss, particularly a reduction in waist circumference, improves insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and serum adipocytokines, reducing the risk of developing chronic disease and CVD. Waist <b>circumference</b> is a <b>required</b> component of {{metabolic syndrome}} under the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, rather than an optional component as used by other previous classifications. Studies have shown that using a lower waist circumference threshold within the context of metabolic syndrome increases the prevalence, but decreases the risk of mortality and type 2 diabetes. It is possible that waist circumference acts as a marker for other risk factors. These findings reinforce the notion that reductions in visceral adipose tissue should be a primary aim of strategies designed to reduce health risks associated with metabolic syndrome. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between adverse birth outcomes and urinary biomarkers of prenatal atrazine exposure, while taking into account exposures to other herbicides used on corn crops (simazine, alachlor, metolachlor, and acetochlor). METHODS: This study used a case-cohort design nested in a prospective birth cohort conducted in the Brittany region of France from 2002 through 2006. We collected maternal urine samples to examine pesticide exposure biomarkers before the 19 th week of gestation. RESULTS: We found quantifiable levels of atrazine or atrazine mercapturate in urine samples from 5. 5 % of 579 pregnant women, and dealkylated and identified hydroxylated triazine metabolites in 20 % and 40 % of samples, respectively. The presence versus absence of quantifiable levels of atrazine or a specific atrazine metabolite was associated with fetal growth restriction [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 0 - 2. 2] and small head circumference for sex and gestational age (OR = 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 2. 7).

It is not clear {{the extent to which}} the Army’s current method for determining body composition compares with more widely accepted methods. Objective: To compare the Army’s current body circumference based method of assessing body composition to validated clinical assessments of body composition including skinfold thickness measurements and body circumferences and breadths. Design: Test-retest Setting: Human Performance Lab. Patients or Other Participants: 28 male (24. 57 ± 4. 39 years) and 12 female (24. 17 ± 4. 95 years) Army ROTC cadets from the University’s Warrior Battalion. Interventions: Body fat percentage (%BF) was calculated utilizing three separate techniques: 1) from body density as obtained using the Army’s current circumference measurement protocol (ARMY) for males (neck and umbilicus) and females (neck, waist and hip), 2) indirectly from lean body weight as determined via breadth, limb, and body circumference measurements (LBC) for males (waist circumference, knee circumference, and bi- iliac breadth) and females (umbilicus circumference), and 3) from body density calculated from skinfold thickness (SKF), measured with Lange calipers (Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc., Cambridge, Maryland, USA) at three sites on the right side of the body, (triceps, supra-ilium, and thigh for females; chest, abdomen, and thigh for males). Percent body fat was calculated from body density using the Brozek 2 -Compartment model equation. Main Outcome Measurements: A repeated measures ANOVA with an alpha level of p< 0. 05 was used to assess differences in %BF as calculated by LBC, SKF, and ARMY. Results: Body fat percentage in males as calculated via ARMY (16. 79 ± 4. 00 %) was significantly higher than LBC (11. 86 ± 3. 19 %, p< 0. 001) and SKF (12. 25 ± 3. 14 %, p< 0. 001). In females, ARMY (27. 17 ± 4. 04 %) was significantly lower than LBC (28. 42 ± 3. 40 %, p= 0. 001) and significantly higher than SKF (24. 62 ± 2. 68 %, p= 0. 026). Conclusions: Results from the current study indicate %BF determined using the Army’s current body circumference based measurements is inconsistent with more commonly accepted, validated methods such as skinfold thickness measurements. The overestimation of %BF for both genders brings into question the reliability of the Army’s current protocol.

Results: Females infants of primiparae, born at 40 th gestational week, had the lowest median birth weight, 3500 g, followed by female infants of multiparae, 3640 g, and male infants of primiparae, 3650 g. The greatest median birth weight, 3730 g, had male infants of multiparae. Median birth length value at the 40 th gestational week for male infants of primiparae and multiparae, as well as female infants of multiparae is the same, 55 cm, while is lower in female infants of primiparae (54 cm). There is no difference in median head circumference at the 40 th gestational week between female infants of primiparae and multiparae, and male infants of primiparae (35 cm). Mean birth weight and length of liveborn infants at 37. to 41. gestational week differed significantly between certain parities (F= 8, 723, Df= 2, p&lt; 0, 001; F= 3, 292, Df= 2, p= 0, 037, respectively). No {{significant difference was found}} for head circumference (F= 0, 983, Df= 2, p= 0, 374). Conclusion: The average birth weight of infants within Tuzla Canton is bigger in comparison with the centile that have been used so far...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the formulation and validation {{of a novel}} time-accurate method for the computation of forced response and flutter in multiple blade row turbomachinery. Advanced gas turbine and aeroengine designs require unsteady computational methods to predict aeroelastic behaviour and prevent the occurrence of flutter or forced response which could ultimately lead to engine failure. Currently, time-accurate schemes can successfully represent unsteady flows across multiple blade rows if the domain encompasses the full circumference. However, the large domain size and range of time scales involved make this approach very expensive and unfeasible during the design cycle. More efficient methods {{take advantage of the}} inherent time-space periodicity in turbomachines to reduce the computational domain to a single bladed passage per row. These single-passage multi-row methods successfully model unsteadiness due to rotor-stator interaction or blade vibration by applying phase-lagged boundary conditions. However, they are limited to assemblies without passage-to-passage variations in the time-averaged flow field. In multi-stage turbomachinery, where the interaction of rows with unequal blade counts in the same frame of reference creates steady circumferential variations, single-passage methods cannot be applied as no phase-shifted temporal periodicity exists between adjacent passages. Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} represent non-axisymmetries such as inlet distortions or stagger profiles using a single passage approach. The time-domain Fourier method presented in this thesis models multi-row non-axisymmetric flows on a reduced number of passages. In order to capture stationary variations, the flow inside several discrete passages, which are located at different circumferential positions, is solved using a time-accurate scheme. Boundary conditions at the azimuthal and inter-row surfaces are approximated from a time-space Fourier series and couple the individual passages. The method is validated for several applications including low engine order forcing in an aerodynamically mistuned assembly and rotor-rotor interaction. It is demonstrated that, within the limit of the Fourier approximation, the resulting solution is equivalent to the full <b>circumference</b> solution and <b>requires</b> only a fraction of the computational resources.

40|$|Michelin {{develops}} and manufactures tires. To {{check their}} tire, different tires tests are used. During the testing process of agricultural tires, some endurance tests are performed on a circular test track where a convoy, {{made of a}} truck pulling two single-axle trailers without suspension system, is driven at a constant speed. Depending on the tested tires, {{it has been observed}} that the convoy may become severely instable. This instability is a large problem for the test team since the tires undertake too much overload which makes test results unexploitable. This is time consuming and expensive for the company. The aim of this thesis is two-folded. The first aim is to identify the phenomenon causing the instability from experimental data and also the parameters which influence the phenomenon. The second aim is to model the phenomenon from technical data in order to predict instability behaviors in advance. Models have been developed and the behavior have been analyzed and compared with experiments. The main result of this work is that the instable behavior is due to the excitation of natural modes of the convoy by the tires frequencies. Natural modes are identified as the natural bouncing mode of the trailers. The bouncing natural mode of a trailer depends on tires stiffnesses and the load on the trailer. Tires excitation frequencies are related to the test speed, the trailer track width and the rolling circumference of the tires. To get a good prediction tires stiffness and tires rolling <b>circumference</b> under operation <b>require</b> to be better characterized. Thanks to this work the test teams {{have a better understanding of}} the phenomenon and a tool which can be used to give a rough indication about problematic configurations. This tool cannot totally predict instable behaviors with the technical data at our disposal since some more parameters, which are not quantified for now, might influence the phenomenon. Nevertheless, these parameters have been highlighted by this study and if explored by the test team, a working predicting tool could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator {{activated}} receptor-g (PPARG) and {{lipoprotein lipase}} (LPL) play {{important role in}} lipid ho- meostasis, insulin resistance and adipogenesis, and their gene variability could be considered as predictive genetic mar- kers for metabolic syndrome (MetSy). The aim {{of the study was}} to estimate possible associations of PPARG (Pro 12 Ala) and LPL PvuII (+/–) polymorphisms with MetSy and its traits. Study included 527 subjects. According to the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definitions, subjects were classified into the meta- bolic syndrome group and control group. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction frag- ment length polymorphism methods. In the total sample, LPL variants were associated with waist circumference (c 2 = 7. 263, d. f. = 2, p= 0. 026) and with BMI (c 2 = 6. 549, d. f. = 2, p= 0. 038), where PvuII (+/+) genotype carriers had the highest risk for increased waist <b>circumference</b> (<b>specific</b> PvuII (+/+) vs. others analysis c 2 = 7. 033, p= 0. 008) and increased BMI (specific Pvu II(+/+) vs. others analysis c 2 = 5. 154, p= 0. 023). LPL gene variants were also associated with HDL-C levels (c 2 = 6. 901, d. f. = 2, p= 0. 032), where PvuII (–/–) genotype carriers had higher HDL-C values in comparison to others (spe- cific Pvu (+/+) vs. others analysis c 2 = 6. 504, p= 0. 011). Furthermore, PvuII (–) allele carriers had significantly lower glucose (allele based analysis Add Value=– 0. 0878, c 2 = 5. 878, d. f. = 1, p= 0. 015). Significant interaction was detected be- tween PPARG and LPL that affected HDL-C levels in male population (c 2 = 11. 790, d. f. = 1, p= 0. 0006) in the manner that Ala/PvuII(+) contributed to the lowest HDL-C values (Specific Ala/ Pvu(+) vs. others analysis was c 2 = 11. 750, p= 0. 0006). According to obtained results LPL and PPARG gene variants could be susceptibility factors of obesity and lipid status, contributing to development of MetSy, particularly in males. Because of antiatherogenic function of HDL-C, the identification of genetic variants associated with HDL-C can provide useful information related to genotype-phenotype relationships. Since the interplay between PPARG and LPL gene and gender seems to be significant it could point to the personalized behavioural recommendations for prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
