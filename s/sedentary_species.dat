5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a <b>sedentary</b> <b>species</b> because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a <b>sedentary</b> <b>species,</b> and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than <b>sedentary</b> <b>species,</b> such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
50|$|The rocky reef, kelp {{forest and}} {{emergent}} rock habitats in these MPAs support numerous species of invertebrates, plants, fish and marine mammals; {{among them are}} garibaldi, rockfish, octopus, gorgonians, nudibranchs, bat rays, kelp bass and many more. The <b>sedentary,</b> invertebrate <b>species</b> located there are set aside from recreational harvest.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} native to {{tropical}} southeastern Asia. Its range extends from southern Myanmar through the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo to Java. It is a <b>sedentary,</b> non-migratory <b>species</b> and is mainly found in the lowlands. Its main habitat is primary rainforest with vines, epiphytes, tangled shrubs and fallen trees, but it also inhabits secondary forest, plantations, coastal scrub, mangroves, parks, wooded suburbs and overgrown gardens.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the term}} [...] "freshwater smelts", {{the members of}} the Osmeriformes are {{generally}} marine, or amphidromous or anadromous migrants. Even the <b>sedentary</b> freshwater <b>species</b> in this family are usually tolerant of considerable changes in salinity. Almost all osmeriforms spawn in fresh water, thus the marine species are generally anadromous. They are found in temperate oceans worldwide and in temperate freshwater of the Holarctic and around the South Pacific region; only a handful of species occur in tropical waters. The eggs are surrounded by an adhesive membrane.|$|R
25|$|Most amphipods are detritivores or scavengers, {{with some}} being grazers of algae, omnivores or predators of small insects and crustaceans. Food is grasped {{with the front}} two pairs of legs, which are armed with large claws. More {{immobile}} species of amphipods eat higher quantities of less nutritious food rather than actively seeking more nutritious food. This {{is a type of}} compensatory feeding. This behaviour may have evolved to minimise predation risk when searching for other foods. Ampithoe longimana, for example, is more sedentary than other species and have been observed to remain on host plants longer. In fact, when presented with both high- and low-nutrition food options, the <b>sedentary</b> <b>species</b> Ampithoe longimana does not distinguish between the two options. Other amphipod species, such as Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis, which have superior predator avoidance and are more mobile, are better able to pursue different food sources. In species without the compensatory feeding ability, survivorship, fertility, and growth can be strongly negatively affected in the absence of high-quality food. Compensatory feeding may also explain the year-round presence of A.longimana in certain waters. Because algal presence changes throughout the year in certain communities, the evolution of flexible feeding techniques such as compensatory feeding may have been beneficial to survival.|$|E
500|$|Bee-eaters are monogamous {{during a}} nesting season, and in <b>sedentary</b> <b>species,</b> pairs may stay {{together}} for multiple years. Migratory bee-eaters may find new mates each breeding season. The courtship displays of the bee-eaters are rather unspectacular, with some calling and raising of throat and wing feathers. The {{exception is the}} performance of the white-throated bee-eater. Their [...] "butterfly display" [...] involves both members of a pair performing a gliding display flight with shallow wing-beats; they then perch facing each other, raising and folding their wings while calling. Most members of the family engage in courtship feeding, where the male presents prey items to the female, and such feeding can account for much, if not all, of the energy females require for egg creation.|$|E
500|$|Many of the shearwaters in {{the genus}} Puffinus are {{proficient}} divers. While {{it has long}} been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the sooty shearwater and more <b>sedentary</b> <b>species</b> such as the black-vented shearwater have shown maximum diving depths of [...] and [...] Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the Audubon's shearwater, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from white-chinned petrels to slender-billed prions, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{bristled}} grassbird (Chaetornis striata) {{is a small}} passerine bird in the monotypic genus Chaetornis. Also {{known as}} the bristled grass warbler, this species is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, where it is patchily distributed in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. These insectivorous birds skulk in dense and tall grasslands, often in marshy areas, habitats that are threatened by human activities. Formerly considered to be <b>sedentary,</b> the <b>species</b> may be migratory, moving south and east in the Indian peninsula during winter and returning to their breeding grounds in the northern plains south of the Himalayas.|$|R
50|$|According {{to their}} {{geographical}} origin, the delta birds contain the following types: arctic species (27); Siberian (32); European (108); Mediterranean (29); Mongolian (33); Chinese (2). The transpalearctic type contains 43 species.For Romania's latitude - delta included - the north-originating species (Arctic and Siberian) appear as winter-and passage birds, while the south-originating species (European, Mediterranean and Mongolian) are met with as <b>sedentary</b> and summer <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of the <b>sedentary</b> bird <b>species</b> {{the hawk}} (Buteo buteo rothschild) {{is the most}} notable, along with the Atlantic canary (Serinus canaria), common House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), Rock Dove (Columba livia), Atlantic European Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis parva) and the Azorean {{subspecies}} of Common blackbird (Turdus merula azorensis). Migratory and marine birds are {{more common in the}} islands of the Azores, resulting in the identification of several species including approximately 37 nesting species on Monte Brasil annually (28 land and eight marine species). During the summer, and especially along the mount's southern coast there are large bands of nesting species of Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), and the ubiquitous Caspian Gull (Larus cachinnans).|$|R
2500|$|The Yunnan {{nuthatch}} is a <b>sedentary</b> <b>species.</b> It {{exists in}} pine forests with sparse undergrowth, and avoids dense spruce and fir forests. Occasionally, it occurs on small pine trees [...] high, in open forests or among scattered groups of trees. In the summer, it lives at altitudes between [...] {{above sea level}} (ASL), and travels down into valleys during winter to heights up to [...] ASL.

2500|$|Metapopulation {{theory was}} first {{developed}} for terrestrial ecosystems, and subsequently {{applied to the}} marine realm. In fisheries science, the term [...] "sub-population" [...] {{is equivalent to the}} metapopulation science term [...] "local population". Most marine examples are provided by relatively <b>sedentary</b> <b>species</b> occupying discrete patches of habitat, with both local recruitment and recruitment from other local populations in the larger metapopulation. Kritzer & Sale have argued against strict application of the metapopulation definitional criteria that extinction risks to local populations must be non-negligible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{water quality}} of the lake varies widely during various seasons [...] summer, premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon [...] as the depth and width of the lake mouth varies causing a dynamic {{situation}} of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lake. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and premonsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and <b>sedentary</b> <b>species</b> in the lake. However, euryhaline species still dwell in the lake. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and {{is reported to be}} rich in benthic biodiversity. Toxicity levels of heavy metals such as magnesium, lead, zinc, nickel, cadmium, aluminum and copper and chemicals such as ammonia, sulphate and fluoride in the lake are well within permissible limits.|$|E
5000|$|Thekla's lark (Galerida theklae) breeds on the Iberian Peninsula, in {{northern}} Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Somalia. It is a <b>sedentary</b> (non-migratory) <b>species.</b> This {{is a common}} bird of dry open country, often at some altitude. Thekla's lark was named by Alfred Edmund Brehm in 1857 for his recently deceased sister Thekla Brehm (1833-1857). The name is a modern Greek one, Θέκλα (Thekla), which comes from ancient Greek Θεόκλεια (Theokleia) derived from θεός (theos, [...] "god") and κλέος (kleos, [...] "glory" [...] or [...] "honour"). The population is declining in Spain, {{but this is a}} common bird with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R

50|$|Typical of most raptors that {{breed in}} Africa, the crowned eagle is {{non-migratory}} and is largely <b>sedentary.</b> This <b>species</b> usually inhabits a fixed territory {{throughout the year}} during its adult life. There {{is evidence that the}} birds move about to some degree when circumstances require it, for example when they need to change mates in isolated breeding areas. The greatest movement of any notable distance is usually associated with juvenile birds, which wander relatively widely before maturation. Forty-four birds of various ages that were ringed in southern Africa and recovered were all found near the ringing localities. Small movements by crowned eagles has resulted in them being sighted in improbable habitats, such as on an open savanna hill in Kenya, an open river bed in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and even a golf course in Nairobi.|$|R

30|$|Responses to {{the effects}} of {{urbanization}} differ among butterflies. Hiura (1973) found that forest <b>species,</b> <b>sedentary</b> butterflies, univoltine <b>species,</b> and wild-tree feeders were greatly influenced by urbanization. In Osaka City, Japan, drastic decreases in species richness were first observed in Hesperiidae between the 1930 s and 1950 s, second in Satyridae between the 1950 s and 1960 s, and third in Pieridae between the 1970 s and 1980 s (Imai 1998). Species richness in Hesperiidae was most markedly decreased in urban green areas, suggesting that this family is most sensitive to habitat isolation through urbanization, except highly migratory species, such as Parnara guttata (Imai 2004). In our study, Hesperiid species richness in the urban green areas was lower than that in GF. P. guttata was observed in NS, BD, and HF. However, Burara aquiline, Satarupa nymphalis, and Thymelicus leoninus were only observed in GF. These three species have been not observed in urban green areas in Korea (Kim et al. 2012). The response of Satyridae to urbanization showed a similar trend with that of Hesperiidae (Imai 2004). In our study, Mycalesis francisca and M. gotama were absent from the four urban green areas. However, the Korean distribution of the two species has broadened recently because of vegetation changes due to the success of reforestation (Kwon et al. 2012). Ishii et al. (1991) noted that Satyrid species disappear in urban green areas because they are mainly forest <b>species,</b> <b>sedentary</b> butterfly, and wild-tree feeders. Furthermore, Ishii (2001) showed that the percentages of bamboo-grass feeders, univoltine species, and non-migratory species were lower in urban parks compared with those in Satoyama. However, urban landscapes often have high species diversity, even including rare and threatened species (Shepherd 1994). Spindasis takanonis, an endangered Korean species, has been observed in the Hongneung Forest (Lee and Kwon 2012). This species lives mainly at the forest edge of urban and suburban areas in Korea. Lee and Kwon (2012) suggested that there is a case that urban green areas play important roles in the conservation of rare species.|$|R

40|$|Cleaning {{behaviour}} by fishes {{has been}} described to be either facultative or specialised. If being specialised in cleaning is more advantageous than to be a facultative cleaner, cleaner fishes would prefer to settle on reefs were ecological conditions promote specialisation. To test this hypothesis, {{we looked at the}} influence of physical and ecological factors on cleaner wrasse abundance, studying variations in L. dimidiatus density between 10 atolls of French Polynesia. We used a multiple regression method based on permutations of distance matrices. Our study reveals that L. dimidiatus are significantly more numerous at sites where ecological factors, such as the species richness of the fish community, may promote their cleaning activity. Moreover, they were significantly more abundant in atolls presenting a large number of <b>sedentary</b> fish <b>species,</b> few predators and few fishes living in large groups. Finally, physical factors, such as the distance between atolls, the lagoon surface, the mean percentage of hard substrate, the mean current index, and the mean depth, play a minor role in the occurrence of L. dimidiatus...|$|R

50|$|Black swans {{were once}} thought to be <b>sedentary,</b> but the <b>species</b> is now known to be highly nomadic. There is no set migratory pattern, but rather {{opportunistic}} responses to either rainfall or drought. In high rainfall years, emigration occurs from the south west and south east into the interior, with a reverse migration to these heartlands in drier years. When rain does fall in the arid central regions, black swans will migrate to these areas to nest and raise their young. However, should dry conditions return before the young have been raised, the adult birds will abandon the nests and their eggs or cygnets and return to wetter areas.|$|R
