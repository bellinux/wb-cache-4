Conversely, you may deduce from a long term tendency to build up debt the existence of latent <b>structural</b> <b>underemployment.</b> Typically private lenders (banks) boldly venture forth: whether they lend to developing countries like in the 1970s, covered by the expected stream of high future coupons, or excessive consumption of their own folk covered by higher paper valuations of assets, it is the same basic story. In the eventual shakeout (due yet again, in the last instance, to latent underemployment), the debt overhang is preserved by substituting public debt for private debt (bailouts), and—keeps growing.|$|E

Structural vector auto-regression suggests that changes in domestic output and prices are overwhelmingly determined by aggregate demand and supply shocks, and while oil production and high international prices negatively affect agricultural output, the effects are small. Consistent with empirical evidence for neighbouring Cameroon, we observe minimal impact on Chad’s manufacturing sector. We associate our findings with <b>structural</b> <b>underemployment</b> and the inefficient use of existing production factors. In this context, increased public expenditures in tradable sectors present the opportunity to make oil revenues an engine of national development. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the labor market during the Great Recession and find some startling {{features}} underlying the stagnation and decline of 2007 - 10. The population {{in the labor force}} has stagnated while the population that is out of the labor force has grown sharply. For the first time since we have had adequate data, the likelihood of an individual leaving the labor force from being unemployed is higher than the likelihood that he or she will move from unemployment to employment. We argue that the most plausible reasons for the continued slump in the labor market have to do with inadequate aggregate demand and are not because of structural or skill-mismatch reasons. aggregate demand, cyclical, labor market, labor transitions, <b>structural,</b> <b>underemployment,</b> unemployment,...|$|E
40|$|Various {{dilemmas}} concerning {{modern economy}} and business {{have been in}} the focus of scientific discussion in recent years (Klich, 2013; Renko & Knezevic, 2013; Szarucki, 2013; Agrawal & Gugnani, 2014; Pardhasaradhi & Grace, 2015). In modern economy, not only researches but corporations face complex economic and business dilemmas in their daily routine. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission addresses key economic challenges by stimulating innovations, sustainability policies, social and environmental responsibilities. These challenges require the mobilization of significant resources by science, innovation and regional policy makers and scientific communities across Europe (EUA, 2014). Broader scientific discussions are crucial for the success of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. According to the Global Risks Report 2015, the biggest threat to world stability in the next 10 years arise from the four most serious economic risks. These are high <b>structural</b> unemployment or <b>underemployment,</b> energy price shock, critical information infrastructure breakdown and fiscal crises. We continuously agree that innovation is critical to global prosperity (WEF, 2015). Currently, the internationalisation of family businesses is an increasingly important research area. Substantial numbers of FBs are forced to expand into foreign markets in order to survive and grow in the competitive environment (Daszkiewicz & Wach, 2014). The roles of business angels are especially important taken both decreasing the levels of formal venture capital investment and growing average amount of individual deals. Angel investors are the key players in generating high-growth companies, essential to regional economic development. As a result, they have attracted the attention of policy makers (Rostamzadeh et. al., 2014). Consequently, this issue of EBER concentrates on the current dilemmas of modern economy and business, particularly dealing with the Baltic States, Slovenia and Poland. Five out of eight articles published in this issue are research papers, two are conceptual papers, while one is a literature review...|$|R

Promoting job creation and tackling {{the economic and social}} consequences of unemployment, underemployment and preventing social exclusion are a priority for all our countries. Although G 20 countries are at different stages of development and there is no “one size fits all” labour market policy, G 20 countries will benefit from well-designed, integrated and consistent public policies. (G 20 Labour and Employment Ministers’ Declaration, 18 – 19 July 2013) Since 2008, the global economic and financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures are estimated to have resulted in the loss of 10 million jobs across Europe. Moreover, fiscal consolidation measures have led to reductions in funding for social security and related labour market measures across most European welfare settings. Within these constraints, innovative social security and labour market measures have been developed to enable inclusivity whilst also promoting the structural resilience of labour markets to economic recession. <b>Structural</b> issues of <b>underemployment</b> and wage depression have significantly intensified this challenge. For the purposes of this themed issue, a pragmatic definition of innovation where “mainstream” policies within specific national contexts serve as the point of reference for qualifying policies as “new” or innovative is adopted. Critically addressing the underlying rationale, scope and impacts of specific social security and employment measures across a number of European countries, this themed issue aims to assess the characteristics and impact of innovative social security and employment policies in promoting key labour market objectives. These key objectives include the use of short-term policy instruments to counteract the impact of economic crises on the employability and labour market access of vulnerable groups and those aimed at improving the long-term capacity and resilience of distinct European societies and labour markets to cope with economic crises and labour market restructuring. This set of themed papers has been chosen to be published by the International Social Security Review because the subject matter coincides and is supportive of the topical priorities of the International Social Security Association for the triennium 2014 – 2016; namely, i) they investigate a number of proposed innovative responses as regards to how social security programmes may better support social cohesion and economic growth and ii) address issues related to how social security programmes may better adapt their current practices to cater to the needs of “atypical” population groups. Within this issue, “atypical” groups are defined as vulnerable groups within the labour market including young people (younger than age 25), migrants and disabled workers. Employment figures reveal that the unemployment rate in these groups is significantly higher than the average unemployment rate in all European countries...|$|R

[...] Dept. of Economics and the Social Science Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 There are two distinct traditions that have widely different {{views on the}} fundamental problem of economic development. This dissertation makes {{a contribution to the}} tradition known as the Scarcity in the Midst of Plenty Approach, which views the problem as an inability of less developed economies to fully utilize their existing resources because of demand constraints. The result of this situation is that these economies are frequently left with an inefficient production structure, high levels of <b>structural</b> <b>underemployment,</b> and few investment inducements that can ameliorate it. In order to solve this problem, the author argues that a development strategy must be implemented that is capable of combining short term demand targeting with long term structural change. Accordingly, the thesis of this dissertation is that the combination of balanced growth, employer of last resort, and the developmental state can serve as a development strategy that can successfully combine these two elements as well as minimize <b>structural</b> <b>underemployment.</b> Consequently, we argue that this strategy can initiate and/or sustain a development process in less developed economies. Our results demonstrate that this is indeed the caseAbstract [...] Introduction [...] The proper objective of an economic development strategy and some issues of terminology [...] A post-Keynesian/structuralist strategy for economic development : the synthesis of balanced growth, employer of last resort, and the developmental state [...] Financing our post-Keynesian/structuralist strategy for development [...] Balanced growth [...] Employer of last resort in less developed economies [...] The developmental state and post-Keynesian/structuralist economics [...] Conclusion [...] Reference...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model is constructed to investigate the concurrent movements {{in the number of}} traded goods, <b>structural</b> <b>underemployment,</b> and real income. Departing from the neoclassical tradition of the dichotomy of consumption and production, individuals are assumed to be both consumers and producers. The equilibrium is characterized by the tradeoff between the economies of specialization and the market transaction costs incurred in market exchanges. Transaction is costly and its efficiency dependent on infrastructure and the collective marketing effort exerted by all participants. Coordination among participants would result in an optimal amount of marketing effort and correctly identify the most efficient economic structure. Failing to achieve the proper coordination would not only decrease real income in each economic structure, but also prevent the selection of the most efficient economic structure. These two unfavorable outcomes of coordination failure could result in two different types of underemployment. Ths story is related to the "Search costs" and the "Coordination failure" approaches in the New Keynesian Economics but goes beyond the existing literature by endogenizing the equilibrium economic structure...|$|E
