40|$|For an {{experience}} to be phenomenally conscious is {{for there to be}} <b>something</b> <b>it’s</b> like; our talk about phenomenal consciousness accordingly is permeated by the expression ‘there’s <b>something</b> <b>it’s</b> like’. It would be natural for the linguistically inclined philosopher to react to this situation by trying to advance investigations into the nature of phenomenal consciousness by determining what we mean by that expression: after all, if discourse about phenomenal consciousness accurately refl ects the nature of its subject matter, that nature should be at least partly revealed in the meaning of the most central expressions in that discourse. A recent theory of the syntactic and semantic properties of ‘there’s <b>something</b> <b>it’s</b> like’, presented in service of gaining insight into the structure of consciousness itself, appears in Lormand 2004; the twin purposes of the present article are to evaluate Lormand’s story, and thereby to bolster our understanding of the meaning of ‘there’s <b>something</b> <b>it’s</b> like’. 1 Lormand’s analysis, as provided in section 2 of his essay, has a startling consequence: the inner sense theory of consciousness is analyti-Thanks for recent discussions to James John, Peter Ludlow, and Jessica Wilson and for helpful comments to an anonymous referee.

Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the Count of Caxias, assumed the presidency (governorship) of Rio Grande do Sul and the command of the four Brazilian Army divisions headquartered in the province. Beginning in 1849, the Imperial government directly assisted the besieged Uruguayan government of Colorados in Montevideo, and on 6 September 1850 the Uruguayan representative Andres Lamas {{signed an agreement with}} Irineu Evangelista de Sousa to transfer money to the Montevideo government through his bank. On 16 March 1851, the Empire of Brazil openly declared its support of Colorado government of Uruguay against Oribe, <b>something</b> <b>it</b> had been covertly doing for more than two years. This did not please the Argentine government, and it began mobilizing for war.|$|E
5|$|Within minutes all the Dorniers {{had been}} hit. Feldwebel Johannes Petersen's Do 17 was flying {{higher than the}} others. It was hit, and caught fire, but carried on. Günter Unger lined up his Do 17 in order to attack a hangar and {{released}} his 20 110-lb bombs before his starboard engine was knocked out. Unteroffizier (Junior Officer or NCO) Schumacher watched as three hangars were destroyed by Unger’s bombs. Unger’s Dornier was then was hit by <b>something.</b> <b>It</b> bled black smoke and lost speed. Unger was engaged by No. 111s Harry Newton. Newton was shot down by accurate return fire and bailed out. However, Newton fired a burst of machine gun fire at the Dornier in frustration before leaving the Hurricane. He damaged the Dornier, but Unger flew on. Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hermann Magin was lining up a hangar when he was hit and slumped over. The quick reactions of the navigator, 28-year-old Wilhelm-Friedrich Illg, saved the crew. He took control and {{climbed out of the}} defensive fire before ordering the crew to abandon the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches <b>something,</b> <b>it</b> carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E
