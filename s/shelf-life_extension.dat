30|$|High {{temperature}} (above 100  °C) companied {{with appropriate}} irradiation or microwave treatment showed excellent {{performance on the}} <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> of CSB. However, the greatly extended shelf life was mainly ascribed to the inhibited microbial growth in CSB. Increasing hardness and taste variation were observed with the prolonging of storage time. Different from irradiation or microwave treatment, photon treatment was supposed to prolong the shelf life of CSB due to its anti-staling activity, but much faster microbial growth occurred during storage comparing to irradiation or microwave treatment.

40|$|Wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) is {{a popular}} remedy {{regarding}} both traditional and conventional medicine. It is used as the antiseptic, aromatic, expectorant, stomachic, antispasmodic, carminative and preservative substance. For {{the purpose of this}} paper, wild thyme essential oil was isolated from the dried herb T. serpyllum by hydrodistillation. Original semi-industrial distillation device SP- 130 performing distillation by water and steam was used for the hydrodistillation of T. serpyllum essential oils. The temperature during the hydrodistillation in the device SP- 130 ranged from 100 °C - 102 °C at atmospheric pressure, and the whole process lasted 5 hours. The isolated essential oil is a liquid of light yellow colour and the odour characteristic of the genus Thymus. Obtained yield of essential oil was 0. 08 %, with 65 components identified in the tested essential oil. The most represented chemical groups are sesquiturpene hydrocarbons with 35. 1 %, and oxygenated sesquiturpenes with 34. 8 %. The main components of essential oil of T. serpyllum were: trans-nerolidol (24. 2 %), germacrene D (16. 0 %), thymol (7. 3 %), δ-cadinene (3. 7 %) and β-bisabolene (3. 3 %). The essential oil showed significantly better ability to neutralize DPPH free radicals (IC 50 = 0. 503 μL / mL) compared with synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT. Synthetic chemical compounds such as BHA and BHT are used in food industry as antioxidants due to their ability to prolong the shelf-life of foodstuffs by protecting them against deterioration caused by oxidation, such as fat rancidity, colour changes, degradation of the flavor and loss of nutrient value. In recent years, there is a considerable interest in finding natural compounds that could replace sinthetic antioxidants because of adverse toxicological reports on many synthetic compounds. Lamiaceae herbs and their essential oils or extracts application has proven to be the effective preservation agents for the <b>extension</b> <b>shelf-life</b> of foodstuffs, indicating their potential use in food industry as functional ingredients and food additives. The antioxidant activity of extracts from some Lamiaceae herbs is comparable to that of the most common synthetic antioxidants BHT and BHA. Free radicals are a major cause of many degenerative diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, skin aging, old age dementia and arthritis. Epidemiological data and randomized clinical trials provide sample indications that antioxidants play a fundamental role in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. They act as scavengers of reactive oxygen species and metal chelators that protect human cells and reduce oxidative damages. Natural antioxidants are important in the food industry because they can have a double functionality, that is, they can be useful as a food preservation agents while providing important health benefits for humans by maintaining our health and preventing disease. This investigation showed that the essential oil of T. serpyllum can be an important source for the production and application in the food industry as nutritional supplements, functional food components or natural food antioxidants...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate the effect of selected antimicrobial agents on the shelf life of osmotically pretreated gilthead seabream and to establish reliable kinetic equations for shelf-life determination validated in dynamic conditions. Methods and Results: Fresh gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) fillets were osmotically treated with 50 % high dextrose equivalent maltodextrin (HDM, DE 47) plus 5 % NaCl and 0 · 5 % carvacrol, 0 · 5 % glucono-δ-lactone or 1 % Citrox (commercial antimicrobial mix). Untreated and treated slices were aerobically packed and stored isothermally (0 - 15 °C). Microbial growth and quality-related chemical indices were modelled as functions of temperature. Models were validated at dynamic storage conditions. Osmotic pretreatment with the use of antimicrobials led to significant <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> of fillets, in terms of microbial growth and organoleptic deterioration. Conclusions: The shelf life was 7 days for control samples at 5 °C. The osmotic pretreatment with carvacrol, glucono-δ-lactone and Citrox allowed for <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> by 8, 10 and 5 days at 5 °C, respectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of the study show the potential of adding carvacrol, glucono-δ-lactone or Citrox in the osmotic solution to extend the shelf life and improve commercial value of chilled osmotically pretreated fish products.

Handpick vs mechanical harvest, early and late harvest date, potassium metabisulfite vs ascorbic acid (AA) addition (antioxidants), aeration and fining agents effect, hot-break prior pressing, filtering conditions and hotpack temperature, were evaluated. Late harvest juices had better quality. AA juice quality was comparable to sulfited juices, thus AA could be used as sulfite substitute. Hot-break juices had significantly higher phenolic and antioxidant capacity, lower turbidity and brown color than traditional cold-pressed juices; however, hot-break juices darkened faster over time. Harvesting method, hot-pack and hot-break temperature did not affect juice quality. Compared to traditional diatomaceous earth (DE) filtration, 500 kDa polymeric crossflow membrane filtered-juices had lower turbidity and brown color. Ceramic membranes produced juices with comparable quality to DE. Fining agents partially removed browning precursors but were not as effective as sulfite in browning prevention.

Potassium sorbate effectively slowed microbial growth in scallops (Pecten fumata) when used in conjunction with vacuum packaging. Shelf-lives of 21 - 28 days at 4 °c were obtained. Inhibition of spoilage for extended periods and temperature abuse of sorbate treated scallops did not appear to increase the risk of spore germination and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum Types A, B, E and F. Toxin was produced by Type A at 27 °c, but only after the scallops had deteriorated beyond acceptability. No toxin was produced at 4 °c or 10 °c. The effect of K-sorbate on the shelf-life of blue grenadier (Macruronus novaezelandiae) fillets was less dramatic. Inconsistent results could be expected due to the variable properties of the fish flesh. pH is an important factor, as it affects the proportion of sorbic acid present in the undissociated state.

40|$|The physico-mechanical {{properties}} of 3 films composed by carvacrol, grape seed extract (GSE) and chitosan in different proportions were studied. The films, prepared by solvent casting technique {{with the following}} compositions of the casting solutions in carvacrol, GSE and chitosan: film- 1 : 9. 6 ppm– 684 ppm– 1. 25 % w/v, film- 2 : 60 ppm– 400 ppm– 1. 2 % w/v and film- 3 : 90 ppm– 160 ppm– 1. 24 % w/v and were compared to a control (1. 25 % w/v chitosan) film. Mechanical, structural, barrier and colour {{properties of}} the films were evaluated. Film- 3 presented the lowest water vapour and carbon dioxide permeabilities (WVP and CO 2 P) and tensile strength (TS) values and the highest oxygen permeability (O 2 P), whereas film- 1 presented the highest water content and the lowest crystallinity, CO 2 P, TS and luminosity. These results suggest that in the range studied, carvacrol and GSE affect the film structure and its mechanical properties due to hydrophilic (GSE) and hydrophobic (carvacrol) compounds. This work will help the development of edible films, based on physico-mechanical properties, contributing to food preservation and <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} packaging (air, vacuum) with or without addition of sodium acetate (2 % W/V) on <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) under refrigeration, {{for a period of}} 18 days. Four different treatments were tested: CAP: control air pack; SAAP: sodium acetate treated aerobic packaging; VP: vacuum packaging in the absence of sodium acetate; and SAVP, sodium acetate under VP. Trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N), free fatty acids (FFA) and peroxide values (PV) of SAVP samples were lower compared to the other treatments during the entire refrigerated storage period. In the present study, the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) level showed fluctuations during storage indicating that TBA values may not reveal the actual rate of lipid oxidation. Total viable counts for fresh rainbow trout stored aerobically exceeded 7 log CFU g- 1 after 10 - 11 days, while treatments SAAP and VP reached the same value on days 12 and 16, respectively. In contrast, SAVP samples did not reach this value throughout the 18 -day. Psychrotrophic counts of SAVP samples were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower compared to the control samples during storage period. A...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> of Ricotta cheese {{coated with}} a chitosan/whey protein edible film and stored under {{modified}} atmosphere at 4 degrees C was evaluated. The chitosan/whey protein film had 35 % and 21 % lower oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability, respectively, and about three times higher water vapor permeability than film prepared with chitosan alone. Over a 30 -day storage period, no differences in the pH of control and coated Ricotta cheeses were observed. While the titratable acidity of the control increased linearly {{during the first two}} weeks and remained constant {{for the rest of the}} storage period, the corresponding values for coated Ricotta cheese did not change significantly during the first 21 days and reached the acidity level (0. 34 +/- 0. 02 milliequivalent/ 100 g of analyzed sample) of the control only on day 30. The viable numbers of lactic acid bacteria and mesophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the chitosan/whey protein coated cheese, compared to the control, at each storage time. Our findings suggest a potential utility of chitosan/whey protein coatings to extend fresh dairy product shelf-life. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDairy fermentations {{are among}} the oldest food {{processing}} applications, aimed at preservation and <b>shelf-life</b> <b>extension</b> {{through the use of}} lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures, in particular strains of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Traditionally this was performed by continuous passaging of undefined cultures from a finished fermentation to initiate the next fermentation. More recently, consumer demands on consistent and desired flavours and textures of dairy products have led to a more defined approach to such processes. Dairy (starter) companies have responded to the need to define the nature and complexity of the starter culture mixes, and dairy fermentations are now frequently based on defined starter cultures of low complexity, where each starter component imparts specific technological properties that are desirable to the product. Both mixed and defined starter culture approaches create the perfect environment for the proliferation of (bacterio) phages capable of infecting these LAB. The repeated use of the same starter cultures in a single plant, coupled to the drive towards higher and consistent production levels, increases the risk and negative impact of phage infection. In this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding LAB phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects...|$|E
