40|$|The {{identification}} of submillimetre <b>phytoplankton</b> is important <b>for</b> monitoring environmental and climate changes, {{as well as}} evaluating water for health reasons. Current <b>standard</b> methods <b>for</b> <b>phytoplankton</b> species identification require sample collection and ex situ analysis, an expensive procedure which prevents the rapid {{identification of}} phytoplankton outbreaks. To address this, we use a glass-based microchip with a microchannel and waveguide included on a monolithic substrate, and demonstrate its use <b>for</b> identifying <b>phytoplankton</b> species. The microchannel and the specimens inside it are illuminated by laser light from the curved waveguide as algae-laden water is passed through the channel. The intensity distribution of the light collected from the biochip is monitored with an external photodetector. Here, we demonstrate that {{the characteristics of the}} photodiode signal from this simple and robust system can provide significant and useful information as to the contents of the channel. Specifically, we show first that the signals are correlated to the size of algae cells. Using a pattern-matching neural network, we demonstrate the successful classification of five algae species with an average 78 % positive identification rate. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept for field-operation, we show that the chip can be used to distinguish between detritus in field-collected water and the toxin-producing cyanobacterium Cyanothece...|$|R

40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} cycle of zinc (Zn) in the South Atlantic, at 40 °S, was investigated {{as part of}} the UK GEOTRACES program. To date there is little understanding of the supply of Zn, an essential requirement <b>for</b> <b>phytoplankton</b> growth, to this highly productive region. Vertical Zn profiles displayed nutrient-like distributions with distinct gradients associated with the water masses present. Surface Zn concentrations are among the lowest reported for the world's oceans (< 50 pM). A strong Zn-Si linear relationship was observed (Zn (nM) = 0. 065 Si (μM), r 2 = 0. 97, n = 460). Our results suggest that the use of a global Zn-Si relationship would lead to an underestimation of dissolved Zn in deeper waters of the South Atlantic. By utilizing Si* and a new tracer Zn* our data indicate that the preferential removal of Zn in the Southern Ocean prevented a direct return path for dissolved Zn to the surface waters of the South Atlantic at 40 °S and potentially the thermocline waters of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. The importance of Zn <b>for</b> <b>phytoplankton</b> growth was evaluated using the Zn-soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) relationship.

40|$|The complex {{patterns}} {{observed in}} marine phytoplankton distributions {{arise from the}} interplay of biological and physical processes, but {{the nature of the}} balance remains uncertain centuries after the first observations. Previous observations have shown a consistent trend of decreasing variability with decreasing length-scale. Influenced by similar scaling found for the properties of the water that the phytoplankton inhabit, ‘universal' theories have been proposed that simultaneously explain the variability seen from meters to hundreds of kilometers. However, data on the distribution of phytoplankton alone has proved insufficient to differentiate between the many causal mechanisms that have been suggested. Here we present novel observations from a cruise in the North Atlantic in which fluorescence (proxy <b>for</b> <b>phytoplankton),</b> nitrate and temperature were measured simultaneously at scales from 10 m to 100 km {{for the first time in}} the open ocean.

On six out of ten sampling days, statistically significant differences were revealed in the P:B ratios between stations. This result {{is consistent with the}} concept of contemporaneous disequilibrium which emphasizes the spatial component of the heterogeneity of the phytoplankton habitat, Interest in the productivity:biomass (I’: B) ratio for organisms is of two main kinds. There are workers, typified by Margalef (1963) and Dickie (1972)) who regard the P:B ratio, when scaled according to the lifetime of the organism, as a statistic of key importance in theoretical food-chain analysis. And there are others, such as Moiseev (1969)) for whom the P:B ratio is simply a convenient practical tool for the estimation of yield from biomass estimates. For any given organism or group of or-ganisms, a proper appreciation of either the theoretical significance or the practical utility of P:B can only be made in the light of knowledge not only of its mean value, but also of its variance, skewness and other higher moments of distribution in space, and its constancy in time.
