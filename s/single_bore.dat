Four shafts were sunk alongside the tunnel to aid construction, later ventilation and entrance shafts. The two riverside shafts, red brick with stone dressings, had iron spiral staircases as pedestrian entrances. They are {{closed to the public}} (the roofs were damaged during World War II, and the iron staircases became dangerous), and the only entrances are the portals (the bases of the staircases can still be seen in the tunnel). Pedestrian and cycle access is permitted, but the distances involved for pedestrians increased significantly when the spiral staircases closed. Shaft number 1 houses a WWII vintage London Underground flood gate which protected the line running through Brunel’s Thames Tunnel.|$|E

This paper analyzes the variation of stress, strain, deformation and deflection of the pile body by finite element numerical simulation of <b>single</b> <b>bored</b> concrete pile under vertical load together with horizontal load. Based on the existing research results, conclusions {{could be that the}} vertical load can increase horizontal bearing capacity of the pile in sandy soils, but horizontal bearing capacity of the pile in clayey soils is more complicated. Hope that the simulation can provide some references for the design of pile foundation...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} serious tunnel {{accidents}} have put tunnel safety {{on the public}} agenda. Concerns have been directed towards the safety of both road and rail tunnels. The choice of tunnel concept for double tracked rail lines has been given much attention. Two alternative tunnel concepts are discussed in a safety perspective in this paper: 1. <b>Single</b> <b>bored</b> tunnel, i. e two parallel tracks in the same tube with escape ways to open air through the tunnel portals or through intervening cross cuts. 2. Parallel twin bored tunnels, i. e two parallel tubes with one track in each with intervening connections between the two tubes equipped with fire doors or smoke traps. The risk and safety arguments for various concepts are examined and pros and cons {{for each of the}} concepts are discussed. An investigation of known tunnel and metro fires is used to assess how the choice of tunnel concept may have influenced the outcome of the accidents...|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of Lion Rock Tunnel started in January 1962. The tunnel was opened on 14 November 1967, as a 1.43 km dual-one <b>single</b> <b>bore</b> tunnel. This tunnel {{is often described}} as a by-product of the Plover Cove Scheme, which was a project to build a water supply tunnel through the range of hills separating New Kowloon {{and the rest of the}} New Territories. The Tunnel was designed by Young Au Young, a civil engineer from Shunde.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{global warming}} and climate change has been known as the main driving force of the extreme floods in urban area. Therefore, the flood and traffic problem should be solved {{simultaneously}} in the mega cities. The multi-functional tunnel with the road and stormwater bypass is suggested {{as one of the}} solutions. A <b>single</b> <b>bored</b> tunnel feasible by TBM machine has the double-deck road tunnel and stormwater bypass underneath. In the multi-functional tunnel, the shape of the stormwater bypass is usually not circular. Therefore, the friction loss in the non-circular pipe should be evaluated for the accurate design. In this study, hydraulic experiment was set and the friction loss coefficients were evaluated using 6 different Reynolds numbers. As the result, the difference between measured and computed friction loss coefficients become substantial when the Reynolds number is decreased less than 2, 000 for the laminar flow. When the stormwater pipe using the non-circular shape is designed, the different friction loss coefficients should be applied for the accurate calculation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrilling Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) induces {{different}} material defects like delamination, burnt matrix material, {{rough bore}} channel surfaces, fibre pull-out and uncut fibres. Intensive {{research has been}} conducted to analyse the amount of defects caused, describing the surface and subsurface defects introduced by machining operations [1, 2]. Additionally, the mechanical strength of rivet joints has been analysed intensively [3]. However, the mechanical performance of rivet joints includes many influencing factors as different materials prepared with various machining processes are being joined. The presented study introduces five newly developed test rigs to analyse the mechanical performance of <b>single</b> <b>bores</b> in relation to different drilling and loading conditions. The setups are designed to focus either on the mechanical strength of the bore channel or the drill entrance or exit. The developed test rigs expand the capability to describe the workpiece quality after a drilling operation. The test rigs facilitate an efficient quality evaluation of drilling processes as well as the development of adapted drilling tools...|$|R

50|$|It is {{the only}} {{underwater}} vehicle tunnel currently in operation in the state, as the Baytown Tunnel was replaced in 1995 by a bridge. The tunnel consists of a <b>single</b> <b>bore,</b> 895 meters (2,909 feet) in length, with a six-percent roadway grade outward from the center towards each exit. Forced transverse ventilation is potentially provided by three automatic high-speed Westinghouse Sturtevant blower fans located in a tower at the north entrance. These fans are designed to keep the air free from high-levels of carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|When the S&HR {{was opened}} in November 1863, {{it was a}} single track throughout. However, all {{infrastructure}} was made wide enough to accommodate twin tracks throughout apart from the Dinmore Tunnel which, owing to the uncertain rock strata, was left as a <b>single</b> <b>bore.</b> The engineer, Mr Pollard, recommended that if the line were to be doubled, then a second tunnel should be constructed. When the S&HR became a joint line of the London & North Western and the Great Western and West Midland Railways, they pursued the second tunnel option.|$|E
