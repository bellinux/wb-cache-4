2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.|$|E
5000|$|Some localities have unusual tidal characteristics, such as Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, {{where the}} amplitudes {{of the main}} <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> {{constituents}} are almost identical. At neap tides the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> is virtually absent, resulting in the phenomenon known as a [...] "dodge tide"—a day-long period of slack water—occurring twice a month; this effect is accentuated near the equinoxes when the diurnal component also vanishes, resulting {{in a period of}} 2-3 days of slack water.|$|E
50|$|A {{tidal marsh}} {{is a type}} of marsh that is found along rivers, coasts and {{estuaries}} of which the flooding characteristics are determined by the tidal movement of the adjacent estuary, sea or ocean. Tidal wetlands experience many overlapping persistent cycles, including day-night temperature fluctuations, diurnal <b>tides,</b> <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides,</b> spring-neap tides, seasonal vegetation growth and decay, decadal El Niño-Southern Oscillation climate variations, and centennial to millennial trends in sea level and climate. They are also impacted by transient disturbances such as hurricanes, floods, storms, and upland fires.|$|R
25|$|Land {{masses and}} ocean basins act as {{barriers}} against water moving freely around the globe, and their varied {{shapes and sizes}} affect the size of tidal frequencies.

40|$|The {{phase of}} <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> (M 2 and S 2) propagates {{clockwise}} {{in the central}} part of the Gulf of Thailand, although that of the diurnal tides (K 1, O 1 and P 1) is counterclock-wise. The mechanism of clockwise phase propagation of <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> at the Gulf of Thailand in the northern hemisphere is examined using a simple numerical model. The natural oscillation period of the whole Gulf of Thailand is near the semi-diurnal period and the direction of its phase propagation is clockwise, mainly due to the propagation direction of the large amplitude part of the incoming semi-diurnal tidal wave from the South China Sea.

40|$|For over 2 -years we have {{collected}} GPS data similar to 40 km upstream of the grounding line on Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Here we examine deviations from mean downstream flow. Although {{the record is}} incomplete during winter, there is clear modulation of flow at semi-diurnal, diurnal, two-weekly, semi-annual, and annual ocean tidal frequencies. This is the first observation of ice stream flow variations over such a long time-period, and such {{a wide range of}} frequencies. The ice stream flows fastest at equinoxes when there are two <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> of equal magnitude, and slowest at solstices when one of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> has lower amplitude.

Antarctic krill are {{a key component of}} the diet of Adélie penguins inhabiting the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), yet our understanding of the variability of krill distribution patterns within nearshore penguin feeding grounds is limited. A recent study of the foraging patterns of penguins breeding in the northern WAP suggests that tidal phase plays a role in foraging distance. We used acoustics to examine biomass and aggregation structure of krill in the penguin foraging grounds off Palmer Station during diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> Nearshore, integrated krill biomass during diurnal tides was significantly higher than during <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> Krill aggregations were also shallower, closer together, and larger in dimension during diurnal tides. Conversely, krill aggregations had higher volumetric biomass and abundance during <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> Further offshore, {{at the head of the}} Palmer Deep canyon, krill aggregations were similar to those observed nearshore during diurnal tides (i. e., shallow, close together, and large in dimension). Since krill aggregation structure strongly influences availability as a potential prey source, we suggest that foraging behavior of Adélie penguins in this region is strongly linked to the variability in nearshore krill aggregation structure as well as biomass...|$|R

The area {{encompasses}} 1,000 islands, 15000 mi of shoreline and thousands of coves and bays. While the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska provides some protection from the Pacific Ocean weather, much of the area experiences strong <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> which can create extreme 30 ft differences between high and low tide, so careful piloting is necessary in many places in order to not collide with underwater obstructions.|$|R

Water temperature in San Salvador can range from 23⁰C to 29⁰C depending on the location and time of year.

5000|$|Another {{physical}} {{limitation is}} the energy {{available in the}} tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ (exajoule). Note {{this is only a}} tiny fraction of the total rotational energy of the Earth. Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much.|$|E

This London Stone marked the upstream limit of the City's rights. The official role of a London Corporation stone of 1285 beside Staines Bridge was set out with a grant of associated privileges in a charter of Edward I.

Agreement with observed {{features of the}} temperature structure, static stability and zonal wind field is good, such {{as the presence of}} a cold polar collar, diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> At the resolution used (96 longitudes × 96 latitudes), a fully developed superrotation is obtained both when the simulation is initialised from rest and from an atmosphere already in superrotation, though winds are still weak below the clouds (roughly half the observed values). The atmospheric waves {{play a crucial role in}} the angular momentum budget of the Venus’s atmospheric circulation. In the upper cloud, the vertical angular momentum is transported by the diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> Above the cloud base (approximately 1 bar), equatorward transport of angular momentum is done by polar barotropic and mid- to high-latitude baroclinic waves present in the cloud region, with frequencies between 5 and 20 cycles per Venus day (periods between 6 and 23 Earth days). In the middle cloud, just above the convective layer, a Kelvin type wave (period around 7. 3 Ed) is present at the equator, as well as a low-latitude Rossby-gravity type wave (period around 16 Ed). Below the clouds, large-scale mid- to high-latitude gravity waves develop and play a significant role in the angular momentum balance...|$|R
30|$|The two exposed coastal sites {{included}} in this study are euhaline. The rivers Nerbioi and Bidasoa have the highest flows along the Basque coast (26 – 36  m 3  s− 1, annual mean), whereas the river Oiartzun has a much lower annual flow (4.8  m 3  s− 1). The Basque estuaries have <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides,</b> with tidal amplitudes that can vary between 1  m in neap tides, to more than 4.5  m in spring tides (Valencia et al. 2004). As such, although they present some characteristics of macrotidal estuaries, they can be considered as generally mesotidal estuaries (Hayes 1975).|$|R
50|$|A tide {{clock is}} a {{specially}} designed clock that keeps track of the Moon's apparent motion around the Earth. Along many coastlines, the Moon contributes the major part (67%) of the combined lunar and solar tides. The exact interval between tides {{is influenced by the}} position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, as well as the specific location on Earth where the tide is being measured. Due to the Moon's orbital prograde motion, it takes a particular point on the Earth (on average) 24 hours and 50.5 minutes to rotate under the Moon, so the time between high lunar tides fluctuates between 12 and 13 hours. A tide clock is divided into two roughly 6-hour tidal periods that shows the average length of time between high and low tides in a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> region, such as most areas of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{tidal regime}} at the {{entrance}} to Pelorus Sound is typical of New Zealand coastal locations, i.e. there is a <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> modulated on a spring-neap cycle, generated by the superposition of M2 (lunar, semi-diurnal) and S2 (solar, semi-diurnal) tidal constituents. Other tidal constituents, notably N2 (semi-diurnal, generated by the ellipticity of the moon’s orbit), introduce further modulation, meaning that the spring-neap cycle is not exactly repeated. The tidal range varies between 1.0 and 1.3 m at neap and 2.1 and 2.4 m at spring. (These values are calculated from a sea level time series, July 1997 - February 1998, at Pelorus Sound entrance.) The propagation of this tidal signal into Pelorus Sound has not been well described, but models and measurements both suggest that the tidal range within the sound is somewhat larger (by 10-20%) than {{at the entrance}}. Because the sound is long, and in places narrow, the tidal currents are fairly strong.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the time}} of Laplace (1799), {{scientists}} had been puzzled as to why pressure variations measured at the Earth's surface associated with the semi-diurnal solar tide dominate those of the diurnal tide in amplitude, when intuitively one would expect the diurnal (daily) passage of the sun to dominate. Lord Kelvin (1882) had proposed the so-called [...] "resonance" [...] theory, wherein the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> would be [...] "selected" [...] over the diurnal oscillation if the atmosphere was somehow able to oscillate freely at a period of very close to 12 hours, {{in the same way}} that overtones are selected on a vibrating string. By the second half of the twentieth century, however, observations had failed to confirm this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis was proposed that something must instead suppress the diurnal tide. In 1961, Manfred Siebert suggested that absorption of solar insolation by tropospheric water vapour might account for the reduction of the diurnal tide. However, he failed to include a role for stratospheric ozone. This was rectified in 1963 by the Australian physicist Stuart Thomas Butler and his student K.A. Small who showed that stratospheric ozone absorbs an even greater part of the solar insolation.|$|E

30|$|Non-volcanic tremors {{and slow}} slip events in {{subduction}} zones {{have been found}} to be triggered by small external stress disturbances, as demonstrated by the synchronization of temporal variations in tremor rate with diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides.</b> Therefore, long-term variations in tremor rate might be predicted by amplitude modulations of diurnal and <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides</b> at decadal time scales. Given that tremors and slow slips are shear slip on the plate boundary, their long-term variations must be associated with fluctuations in plate subduction speed below the seismogenic zone. In previous work, we showed a good correlation between long-term seismicity and empirically calculated tremor rate based on observed tidal levels in the Nankai region, western Japan. Here, we present an improved method of modeling long-term slip rate fluctuation based on the calculation of Coulomb stress due to ocean and solid earth tides on the plate interface. We also include the effects of non-tidal ocean variations, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Kuroshio Current, employing an ocean model developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency. We apply the method to the Tokai district, where the effects of the Kuroshio Current are large, and demonstrate the importance of considering non-tidal effects. Our calculated slip rate fluctuations could amount to 1  mm/year in decadal scales, and periods with faster rates partly corresponded to variations in seismicity. Slow slip events in the study region weakly corresponded to times of higher stress.|$|R

The suspended sediment concentration wad further deduced from the acoustic backscatter intensity.

A striking feature of the data set is the large fluctuations in all turbulence properties and suspended sediment concentration during the tidal cycle. This feature has been rarely documented...|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} Earth tides first became established in 1909,primarily to explain nutations, {{but are also}} used in Earth rotation predictions. The <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> (one maximum every 12 or so hours) is primarily lunar (only S2 is purely solar) and gives rise to sectorial deformations which rise and fall {{at the same time}} along the same longitude.Sectorial variations of vertical and east-west displacements are maximum at the equator and vanish at the poles. There are two cycles along each latitude, the bulges opposite one another, and the depressions similarly opposed.The diurnal tide is lunisolar, and gives rise to tesseral deformations. The vertical and east-west movement is maximum at 45° latitude and is zero on the equator and at the poles.Tesseral variation have one cycle per latitude, one bulge and one depression; the bulges are opposed (antipodal), that is to say {{the western part of the}} northern hemisphere and the eastern part of the southern hemisphere, for example, and similarly the depressions are opposed, the eastern part of the northern hemisphere and the western part of the southern hemisphere, in this case.Finally, fortnightly and semi-annual tides have zonal deformations (constant along a circle of latitude), as the Moon or Sun gravitation is directed alternately away from the northern and southern hemispheres due to tilt. There is zero vertical displacement at 35°16' latitude.|$|E

Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point.

High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch.

40|$|Doodson {{proposed}} a minimum criterion {{to predict the}} occurrence of double high (or double low) waters when a higher-frequency tidal harmonic {{is added to the}} <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide.</b> If the phasing of the harmonic is optimal, the condition for a double high water can be written b n 2 ∕ a [*]>[*] 1 where b is the amplitude of the higher harmonic, a is the amplitude of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide,</b> and n is the ratio of their frequencies. Here we expand this criterion to allow for (i)  a phase difference ϕ between the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> and the harmonic and (ii)  the fact that the double high water will disappear in the event that b ∕ a becomes large enough for the higher harmonic to be the dominant component of the tide. This can happen, for example, at places or times where the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> is very small. The revised parameter is b r 2 ∕ a, where r is a number generally less than n, although equal to n when ϕ [*]=[*] 0. The theory predicts that a double high tide will form when this parameter exceeds 1 and then disappear when it exceeds a value of order n 2 and the higher harmonic becomes dominant. We test these predictions against observations at Port Ellen in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. For most of the data set, the largest harmonic of the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> is the sixth diurnal component, for which n [*]=[*] 3. The principal lunar and solar semi-diurnal tides are about equal at Port Ellen and so the <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> becomes very small twice a month at neap tides (here defined as the smallest fortnightly tidal range). A double high water forms when b r 2 ∕ a first exceeds a minimum value of about 1. 5 as neap tides are approached and then disappears as b r 2 ∕ a then exceeds a second limiting value of about 10 at neap tides in agreement with the revised criterion...|$|E

Planetary waves seem to propagate into the thermosphere, thus modulating the E-region ionospheric dynamo by enhancing the amplitudes of <b>semi-diurnal</b> <b>tides,</b> and in turn, this modulates vertical plasma drifts and plasma density in the F-region ionosphere.
