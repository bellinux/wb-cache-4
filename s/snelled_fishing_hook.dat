2500|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>hook</b> or fishhook is {{a device}} for {{catching}} fish either by impaling {{them in the}} mouth or, more rarely, by snagging {{the body of the}} <b>fish.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the <b>fish</b> <b>hook</b> was chosen by Forbes {{as one of the top}} twenty tools in the history of man. <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of <b>fish</b> <b>hooks</b> in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the <b>fish</b> <b>hook.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. <b>Fish</b> <b>hooks</b> are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing).|$|R

Although the ingestion of <b>fish</b> <b>hooks</b> {{is known to}} be a source of mortality in multiple vertebrate groups, the prevalence of hook ingestion by freshwater turtles has not been well studied. We trapped turtles from five rivers in the southeastern United States and used radiographs to examine over 600 individuals of four species. Depending on the species, sex, and age class, 0 - 33 % of turtles contained ingested <b>fish</b> <b>hooks.</b> For some species, larger turtles were more likely to contain a <b>fish</b> <b>hook</b> than smaller individuals. Freshwater turtle demography suggests that even small increases in adult mortality may lead to population declines. If our study areas are representative of other aquatic systems that receive fishing pressure, this work likely identifies a potential conflict between a widespread, common recreational activity (i. e., fishing) and an imperiled taxonomic group...|$|R
