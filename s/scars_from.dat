5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} {{in one study}} that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|The visible <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> {{the impacts}} {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the Great Red Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the Great Red Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E

5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that ale, in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the ale. The spots on the Moon were seen as <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> the ale’s bites. While ale devoured the Sun or the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if ale succeeded in devouring the Moon, the Sun would die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> orca attacks.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the several}} bearers of the One Ring, three {{were still alive}} {{following}} the Ring's destruction, the hobbits Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo, having borne the Ring longest of the three, had reached a very advanced age for a hobbit. Frodo suffered both physical and psychological <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> his strenuous quest to destroy the Ring. Samwise, having only briefly kept the Ring, was affected the least and simply carried on a normal life following the Ring's destruction.|$|E

5000|$|FUE {{harvesting}} of grafts causes [...] "pit" [...] scarring, small, round, {{and typically}} white scars in the patient's donor {{area where the}} grafts have been removed. FUE <b>scarring</b> differs <b>from</b> <b>scarring</b> <b>from</b> strip harvesting in that the latter procedure produces a linear scar in the donor area where the strip of skin was removed. Both the pit <b>scarring</b> <b>from</b> FUE and linear <b>scar</b> <b>from</b> strip harvesting are often hard to detect when hair in the donor area is at a normal length and the extraction is performed by a skilled surgeon. While {{the outcome of the}} healing process, and thus the appearance of scar tissue, depends on several variables (including the type of extraction, the skill of the surgeon, and, in strip harvesting, the method of wound closure), in both FUE and FUT short cropped hair or a shaved head will typically reveal some scarring.|$|R
25|$|Captain William E. Fairbairn and Sergeant Eric A.

In Half-Blood Prince, she attempts to heal Bill of his <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> Greyback's attack without much success, and bursts into tears when she hears of Dumbledore's death. In Deathly Hallows, she and Filch oversee the evacuation of Hogwarts before the battle. She is later seen tending to the injured fighters.|$|E
25|$|While fire is {{a primary}} {{component}} of many art exhibits and events, materials must be burned on a burn platform. From 1990 through 1999, burning was allowed to take place directly {{on the surface of}} the playa, but this left burn scars (fired pinkish clay-like playa surface). When it was finally determined that they did not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, in 2000, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection. When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott & Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that Burn <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were finally eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.|$|E

One girl, Mai, the most beautiful girl in the village, befriended him because she thought he was pitiful. After Maimai became beautiful from the spring water, he murdered everyone from his village and killed Mai because he felt ugly in her presence. He is Princess Yuri's younger brother, and has the same soul symbol as she has. Soul Symbol: Beauty. Similarly to Maora from The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, his physical appearance is drastically different dressing as a girl: he has a girly round eye shape and a delicate feminine neck as opposed to his masculine appearance.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the power}} {{relationships}} at work, slave women in the United States were {{at high risk for}} rape and sexual abuse. Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and some died resisting. Others carried psychological and physical <b>scars</b> <b>from</b> the attacks. Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal Southern culture which treated black women as property or chattel. Southern culture strongly policed against sexual relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of racial purity but, by the late 18th century, the many mixed-race slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken advantage of slave women. Wealthy planter widowers, notably such as John Wayles and his son-in-law Thomas Jefferson, took slave women as concubines; each had six children with his partner: Elizabeth Hemings and her daughter Sally Hemings (the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife), respectively. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble, wives of planters, wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades before the Civil War. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or other relatives. As a result of centuries of slavery and such relationships, DNA {{studies have shown that the}} vast majority of African Americans also have historic European ancestry, generally through paternal lines.|$|E
