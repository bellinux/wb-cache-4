2500|$|The WAAS was jointly {{developed}} by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{as part of the}} [...] (DOT-VNTSC-RSPA-95-1/DOD-4650.5), beginning in 1994, to provide performance comparable to category 1 instrument landing system (ILS) for all aircraft possessing the appropriately certified equipment. Without WAAS, ionospheric disturbances, clock drift, and <b>satellite</b> <b>orbit</b> errors create too much error and uncertainty in the GPS signal to meet the requirements for a precision approach (see GPS sources of error). A precision approach includes altitude information and provides course guidance, distance from the runway, and elevation information at all points along the approach, usually down to lower altitudes and weather minimums than non-precision approaches.|$|E
2500|$|CERTO - Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography Experiment (1996-18/NRL) instrumentation, {{developed}} by NRL's Plasma Physics Division, {{consists of a}} stable radio beacon transmitter on the satellite and a chain of receivers on the ground. Radio transmissions from the CERTO beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere. The CERTO measurement technique provides images of the ionosphere with 10km vertical and horizontal resolution. In addition, ionospheric irregularities of 1km or less in size can be determined by fluctuations in the CERTO radio waves. [...] CERTO {{can also be used}} to calibrate the ionospheric densities obtained using the EUV instruments such as HIRAAS, GIMI, and EUVIP on ARGOS. The CERTO radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the <b>satellite</b> <b>orbit.</b> The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately. CERTO principal investigator, Dr. Paul Bernhardt notes that the NRL instruments on ARGOS will be the first demonstration combining EUV and radio sensors for enhanced imaging of the ionosphere.|$|E

The general case is that the <b>satellite's</b> <b>orbit</b> is tilted; it spends half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern. If the orbit swung between 20° north latitude and 20° south latitude, then its orbital inclination would be 20°.|$|R
