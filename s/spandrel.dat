5|$|According {{to various}} reports, Hezbollah is armed with {{anti-tank}} guided missiles, namely, the Russian-made AT-3 Sagger, AT-4 Spigot, AT-5 <b>Spandrel,</b> AT-13 Saxhorn-2 'Metis-M', АТ-14 Spriggan 'Kornet'; Iranian-made Ra'ad (version of AT-3 Sagger), Towsan (version of AT-5 <b>Spandrel),</b> Toophan (version of BGM-71 TOW); and European-made MILAN missiles. These weapons {{have been used}} against IDF soldiers, causing many of the deaths during the 2006 Lebanon War. A small number of Saeghe-2s (Iranian-made version of M47 Dragon) were also used in the war.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spandrel</b> {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces {{off-site}} at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The <b>spandrel</b> plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|In {{each corner}} of the chapel is a {{triangular}} pendentive filling {{the space between the}} walls and the arch of the vault and forming the <b>spandrel</b> above the windows nearest the corners. On these curving shapes Michelangelo has painted four scenes from Biblical stories that are associated with the salvation of Israel by four great male and female heroes of the Jews: Moses, Esther, David and Judith.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of nonlinear fi nite element analyses conducted to model the behavior of L-shaped, precast, prestressed concrete <b>spandrels</b> constructed with open web reinforcement. The fi nite element model was calibrated using experi-mental results from recent tests of slender, L-shaped, precast, prestressed concrete <b>spandrels.</b> Detailed correlative studies between analytical and experi-mental results are presented, demonstrating the capability of the fi nite element program to describe the observed experimental behavior. The feasibility of using open web reinforcement in compact, L-shaped, precast, prestressed concrete <b>spandrels</b> to achieve a more construction-friendly reinforcement scheme is also examined. Five differ-ent web reinforcement confi gurations for the com-pact <b>spandrels</b> were studied in order to evaluate the contribution of closed stirrups to the spandrels’ shear-torsion behavior. The behavior, ultimate load-carrying capacity, and mode of failure of both the slender and compact L-shaped precast, prestressed concrete <b>spandrels</b> are presented. For loading values near the ultimate, the out-of-plane bending behavior of compact, L-shaped, precast, prestressed concrete <b>spandrels</b> is strongly infl uenced by the web-reinforcement confi guration. Results from the analysis show that for long-span, compact <b>spandrels,</b> open web rein-forcement can be used effectively to resist torsional forces throughout the member...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} and widely cited papers in biology is [...] "The <b>Spandrels</b> of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". It {{is based on an}} analogy between the beautifully decorated <b>spandrels</b> spaced around the domes in the basilica, which sit on four arches (technically, the structures are pendentives rather than <b>spandrels),</b> and various biological traits and features. The authors, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, argue that the <b>spandrels</b> are the inevitable spaces that exist when a dome is placed above arches rather than design elements and that many biological traits are similarly the side effects of functional traits rather than adaptive traits in themselves.|$|R
50|$|The bridge uses dressed-stone for {{the arch}} rings, and has coursed-rubble <b>spandrels</b> and wing walls. It is built from red sandstone, and faced with ashlar dressings. The <b>spandrels</b> are hollow {{to reduce the}} load on the arches, an {{innovation}} by Thomas Telford.|$|R
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right <b>spandrel</b> has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Next to the {{two smaller}} archways are carved medallions, one {{flanking}} each <b>spandrel.</b> The medallions closest to Sansom Street represent early American coins, a Pine Tree coin from Massachusetts and Grandi Copper coin from Connecticut. The medallions closest to the Walnut Street side represent the first American coin issued by Congress and the Eye Coin from Vermont. Two medallions on the Walnut Street side depict {{both sides of the}} Lafayette Medal. Only one medallion decorates the Samson Street side, depicting another early coin from Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the <b>spandrel</b> walls and wing walls could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spandrels</b> usually provide {{pressure}} {{along the}} upper {{edge of the}} conoids. In the Henry VII Chapel, these <b>spandrels</b> are replaced with hanging pendants. The pendants still provide the compression necessary to support the conoids and add complexity to the aesthetics of the room.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} pushover analysis of in-plane loaded unreinforced masonry walls is presented. An “equivalent frame” approach is adopted for the inelastic analysis of the walls, which are modeled by means of vertical piers and horizontal deformable beams (masonry <b>spandrels)</b> interconnected with rigid links. A two steps procedure is adopted: in Step I, ultimate bending moment-shear force strength domains of the masonry <b>spandrels</b> are derived {{by means of a}} heterogeneous upper bound FE limit analysis. Suitable static and kinematic boundary conditions are imposed on <b>spandrels</b> to account for the complex interaction of internal forces and deformed shapes of the <b>spandrels</b> at failure. Results are finally stored in a database. In Step II, <b>spandrels</b> failure surfaces are implemented in an equivalent frame, where <b>spandrels</b> are modeled through elastic Timoshenko beams and nodal plastic hinges with finite ductility. The piers are modeled in a similar manner, but their shear and bending moment capacity are estimated according to the Italian Design Code. A full scale three storey three bay masonry wall subjected to seismic excitation is analyzed in order to test the reliability of the procedure proposed when compared with alternative approaches based on (i) standard equivalent frames and (ii) complex 2 D nonlinear heterogeneous FE analyses...|$|R

5|$|The niches in {{the lowest}} zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell {{identifies}} Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the <b>spandrel</b> of the door.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{contains}} information {{relating to}} the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items from the various buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of Paget's disease of bone. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of moulded pointed arches with springer blocks, voussoirs and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate capitals and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one <b>spandrel</b> is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each <b>spandrel</b> the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

25|$|This type of bridge {{comprises}} an arch {{where the}} deck is completely above the arch. The {{area between the}} arch and the deck {{is known as the}} <b>spandrel.</b> If the <b>spandrel</b> is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone arch bridge, the bridge is called a closed-spandrel deck arch bridge. If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the arch, the bridge is known as an open-spandrel deck arch bridge. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel arch bridge. Finally, if the arch supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} arch, the bridge is called a cathedral arch bridge.|$|E
25|$|Between the paired, central bays is an articulate, full-relief, {{feminine}} bust sculpture {{occupying the}} <b>spandrel</b> area. Plaster ornaments {{composed of two}} small, circular medallions flanking a larger, central one decorate the areas between bays 1-2 and 3-4.|$|E

Above each arch, a decorative <b>spandrel</b> panel contains glazed mosaic tiles in intricate Moorish patterns. Within each bay, a horizontal band stretching between the concrete piers separates the <b>spandrel</b> area from the parapet above. The parapet is completely solid above the central bay, whereas the parapets of the flanking bays are articulated with open, semi-circular concrete forms. At this level, the concrete piers are decorated with vertical rectangular panels of glazed multi-colored mosaic tiles.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, he {{recommended}} that the extrados of the barrel of an arch of great obliquity be formed into rusticated steps so as to provide a horizontal bed for the <b>spandrel</b> walls in order to overcome their tendency to slide off the arch barrel.|$|E
25|$|In August, however, {{there were}} {{problems}} with the Derwent Aqueduct which required considerable modification. The <b>spandrel</b> walls had parted due to the horizontal forces imposed by the canal, and a longitudinal split had opened up in the arch. In his report to the canal committee, Jessop gave his opinion {{that the use of}} Crich lime, being unusually pure, had delayed the setting of the mortar. Later writers, with the benefit of engineering knowledge acquired after Jessop's time, have suggested that the <b>spandrel</b> walls were simply too slender for the forces imposed. At any rate, the arch was partly dismantled and steel tie bars and lateral reinforcing arches were installed, together with external buttresses. This Jessop did at his own expense.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spandrels</b> {{can also}} {{occur in the}} {{construction}} of domes and are typical in grand architecture from the medieval period onwards. Where a dome needed to rest on a square or rectangular base, the dome was raised above the level of the supporting pillars, with three-dimensional <b>spandrels</b> called pendentives taking the weight of the dome and concentrating it onto the pillars.|$|R
