40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} the Flemish {{biomonitoring}} programs, we describe the associations between internal exposure to organochlorine pollutants and to cadmium (measured in 2004 - 2005 for adults aged 50 - 65 years) and self-reported health status obtained through a questionnaire in November 2011. Dioxin-like activity in serum <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with risk of cancer for women. After adjustment for confounders and covariates, the odds ratio for an exposure equal to the 90 th percentile was 2. 4 times higher than for an exposure equal to the 10 th percentile. For {{both men and women}} dioxin-like activity and serum hexachlorobenzene (HCB) <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with risk of diabetes and of hypertension. Detailed analysis suggested that an increase in BMI might be part of the mechanism through which HCB contributes to diabetes and hypertension. Serum dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) concentration <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with diabetes and hypertension in men, but not in women. Serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 118 <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with diabetes in both men and women, and after adjustment for correlated exposures, also with hypertension in men. Urinary cadmium concentrations <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>association</b> with hypertension. Urinary cadmium concentrations were (in 2004 - 2005) significantly higher in persons who felt in less than good health (in 2011) than in persons who felt in very good health. After adjustment for correlated exposures (to HCB, p,p'-DDE and PCB 118) marker PCBs <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>association</b> with diabetes and hypertension. Serum p,p'-DDE <b>showed</b> in men <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> negative <b>association</b> with risk of diseases based on atheromata. Our findings suggest that exposure to pollutants can lead to an important increase in the risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension.

40|$|HIF- 1 is a {{heterodimer}} {{consisting of}} the HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 1 beta subunits, and HIF- 1 alpha is the unique oxygen regulated subunit that determines HIF- 1 activity. HIF- 1 alpha upgrades many gene products which include the glucose transporter protein 1 (Glut- 1). Immunohistochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody specific for HIF- 1 alpha indicate that the overexpression of HIF- 1 alpha occurs in the most common forms of human cancer, including bladder cancer. The expression of Glut- 1 in human bladder cancer is associated with poor prognosis and a low survival rate. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to compare the expression of both HIF- 1 alpha and Glut- 1 with clinicopathological characteristics in superficial and invasive human bladder cancer (all invasive bladder cancer patients received radical radiotherapy).

40|$|Abstract Background Modulation of {{the immune}} system is one of the {{principal}} roles of Vitamin D, for which the effects are exerted via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Importantly, variants in the VDR gene have been susceptible in the past to raise the risk of asthma in several populations. These effects of VDR allelic markers remain speculative in the Chinese Han population. Results A case-control study of 1090 individuals including 567 asthmatic patients was realized on five SNPs within the VDR gene. Only rs 7975232 (ApaI) marker <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> with asthma (P = 0. 009). Haplotype analysis of the five VDR polymorphisms <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> with asthma (global-p value = 0. 012). Conclusion Although the susceptibility of VDR gene variants with asthma could not be confirmed for all SNPs tested in this study, the significant association obtained for rs 7975232 provides evidence for a previously unknown report about the Chinese Han population and may raise the susceptibility of VDR to be a candidate gene for asthma. </p...|$|E

Results Out of 708 women, 237 (33 %) had a false-positive result; none of the factors <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association.</b> Vaginal bleeding increased the proportion of positive fetal fibronectin (fFN) results, but {{was significantly associated with}} a lower risk of false positive test results (odds ratio [OR], 0. 22; 95 % confidence intervals [CI], 0. 12 - 0. 39).

40|$|Background/Aims. Women after {{menopause}} have increased insulin resistance and visceral fat, which {{may increase the}} prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD in women has not been clearly defined. In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors for NAFLD in women. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Women who underwent abdominal ultrasonography and blood sampling for routine health check-ups were recruited. Results. Among 1, 423 subjects, 695 women (48. 9 %) were in a menopausal state. The prevalence of NAFLD was higher in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women (27. 2 % versus 14. 4 %, P< 0. 001). In premenopausal women, low HDL-cholesterol, central obesity, and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> with the increased risk of NAFLD in multivariate analysis. In postmenopausal women, the presence of diabetes, triglyceridemia, and central obesity <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> with the risk of NAFLD.

Our findings showed different metabolic factors for NAFLD in pre- and postmenopausal women. However, the key issues are the same: central obesity and insulin resistance. These results reemphasize the importance of metabolic factors irrespective of menopausal status in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in women...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: It is {{uncertain}} whether homocysteine and the metabolic syndrome or its components are related {{in the general}} population, as studies investigating the association between homocysteine levels and insulin resistance have shown conflicting results. Methods: In an ancillary study to the Persian Gulf Healthy Heart Study, a cohort study of Iranian men and women aged ≥ 25 yr, {{a random sample of}} 1754 subjects were evaluated for the association of plasma homocysteine levels and the metabolic syndrome using National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) -Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) -III criteria. Total homocysteine levels and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Subjects with lower HDL-cholesterol and higher blood pressure showed significantly higher homocysteine levels (p= 0. 001 and p< 0. 0001; respectively). There {{was no significant difference in}} serum levels of homocysteine between subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.
