40|$|The Bronze Age of Scandinavia (1750 - 500 BC) is {{characterized}} by the sudden appearance of bronze objects in Scandinavia, the sudden mass appearance of amber in Mycenaean graves, and the beginning of bedrock carvings of huge ships.

40|$|A cultivation-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} determine the in vitro antagonistic potential of soil bacteria towards Rhizoctonia solani AG 3 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Foln 3). Four composite soil samples were collected from four agricultural sites with previous documentation of disease suppression, located in France (FR), the Netherlands (NL), <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE)</b> and the United Kingdom (UK). Similarly, two sites from Germany (Berlin, G-BR; and Braunschweig, G-BS) without documentation of disease suppression were sampled. Total bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions from the composite soil samples onto R 2 A, AGS and King's B media. A total of 1, 788 isolates (approximately 100 isolates per medium and site) was screened for antifungal activity, and in vitro antagonists (327 isolates) were found amongst the dominant culturable bacteria isolated from all six soils. The overall proportion of antagonists and the number of isolates with inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum were highest in three of the suppressive soils (FR, NL and SE). Characterization of antagonistic bacteria revealed a high phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Siderophore and protease activity were the most prominent phenotypic traits amongst the antagonists. The composition and diversity of antagonists in each soil was site-specific. Nevertheless, none of the antimicrobial traits of bacteria potentially contributing to soil suppressiveness analyzed in this study could be regarded as specific to a given site.

40|$|Ukraine (UA) faces broad {{needs for}} energy {{security}} enhancement, energy diversification, revitalization of agriculture, {{and improvements in}} the state of the environment. UA has large biomass-for-bioenergy potential, which can be leveraged to contribute to local/regional energy self-sufficiency, rural development and diversification, and environmental improvement via fossil fuel substitution with local and more sustainable biofuels. However, the manner in which biomass energy utilization is emerging is poorly documented and its organizational basis is not well understood. This work focuses on bioenergy from agricultural waste as an early emergent area. It applies cross-case analysis to nine straw-fired installations in UA. Analysis yields three straw-based frameworks for organization and action, including small-scale local heat production, small-scale local straw production for municipal fuel provision, and medium-scale straw combustion for district heating (DH). The UA context is then compared to more advanced agro-bioenergy sectors in <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE)</b> and Denmark (DK) to delineate crucial factors for the growth of UA's embryonic sector. The study finds that evolution of individual business entrepreneurship qualities and knowledge dissemination are key parameters to move the sector forward at small to medium scale, while stable and targeted incentive based systems, national government support, and collective bioenergy stakeholder action are required for advance to medium and large scales. Barriers to the expansion of bioenergy in UA include low access to technology and funding, and a lack of knowledge on bioenergy funding schemes, and bioenergy in general.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{investigate}} whether practising midwives are adequately prepared to integrate genetic information into their practice. DESIGN: a cross-sectional, postal, structured questionnaire survey was sent to practising midwives. SETTING: practising midwives from the Netherlands (NL), <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE)</b> and the United Kingdom (UK). PARTICIPANTS: 1021 replies were received, achieving {{a response rate of}} 62 %. FINDINGS: 79 % (799 / 1015) of midwives reported attending courses with some 'genetic content' during their initial training. Sixty-eight per cent (533 / 784) judged this to have been useful for clinical practice. Variation was seen between countries in the amount of genetic content in post-registration training (SE 87 %, NL 44 %, UK 17 %) and most was considered useful. Questions assessing clinical activity identified a current need for genetic knowledge. Midwives described low levels of self-reported confidence both in overtly genetic procedures and in everyday tasks that were underpinned by genetic knowledge. For eight of the 12 procedures, fewer than 20 % of midwives considered themselves to be confident. Differences were apparent between countries. Midwives identified psychosocial, screening and risk assessment aspects of genetic education as being important to them, rather than technical aspects or genetic science. CONCLUSIONS: given the low reported confidence with genetic issues in clinical practice, it is essential that this is addressed in terms of the amount, content and targeting of genetic education. This is especially important to ensure the success of national antenatal and baby screening programmes. The {{results of this study suggest}} that midwives would welcome further training in genetics, addressing genetic topics most relevant to their clinical practice. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The four Nordic countries: Denmark (DK), Finland (FIN), Norway (NO) and <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE),</b> {{all have}} {{national}} databases in which mainly records of treated animals are maintained. Recently, the completeness of locomotor disorder records in these databases has been evaluated using farmers’ recordings {{as a reference}} level. The objective {{of the present study}} was to see how previous estimates of completeness figures are affected by the criteria determining whether a recording in the database is to be judged correct. These demands included date of diagnosis and disease classification. In contrast with the previous study, a period of time between the date of disease recording in the database and by the farmer was allowed. Further, the calculations were brought to bear on individual locomotor diagnoses instead of a common locomotor disease complex code. Methods Randomly selected dairy herds (≥ 15 cows) were invited to participate. During two 2 -month periods in 2008 the farmers recorded the diseases they observed on the farm and their recordings constituted a farmer database (FD). These recordings were compared to disease recordings in the National Databases (ND). Earlier calculations of completeness for locomotor complex cases assuming an exact match on date were compared with ± 7 [*]day and ± 30 [*]day discrepancies calculated in this study. Results The farmers in DK, FIN, NO and SE recorded 426, 147, 97 and 193 locomotor disorders, respectively. When a window of ± 7 [*]days was allowed there was a relative increase in completeness figures lying in the range of 24 – 100 %. Further increases were minor, or non-existent, when the window was expanded to ± 30 [*]days. The same trend was seen for individual diagnoses. Conclusion In all four of the Nordic countries a common pattern can be observed: a further increase in completeness occurs when individual locomotor diagnoses recorded by the farmer are permitted to match any locomotor diagnosis recorded in the ND. Completeness increased when both time span and different diagnoses within the locomotor complex were allowed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Demographic change {{requires}} {{an increase in}} labour force participation. This applies partic- ularly to those groups which have had relatively low participation rates {{in the past and}} those with family obligations such as child rearing or care for the elderly. With many companies already reporting difficulties in recruiting or retaining qualified staff, policies which aim to reconcile work and family life more effectively have become more attractive. Implementing work-life balance policies may therefore be considered a significant factor in the enhance- ment of corporate competitiveness and national prosperity. Governments together with the social partners at the national, sectoral and company levels must tackle the challenge of ensuring the competitiveness of companies while granting women and men equal partici- pation in work and family life. The European Company Survey on the Reconciliation of Work and Family Life 2010 provides a detailed description and analysis of family-friendly policies implemented by the firms in six European countries – Germany (DE), the United Kingdom (UK), France (FR), Italy (IT), <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE)</b> and Poland (PL). These six countries account for approximately 63 % of the popu- lation and 68 % of the GDP in the EU- 27. In autumn 2009, senior executives and the heads of human resources departments in over 5, 000 companies were interviewed about how important they consider the issue of family-friendliness and the policies they have offered in their firms. In addition, they reported on their main motives for, and the most significant obstacles to, the implementation of work-life balance measures. The European Company Survey also allows an assessment of the institutional basis, such as statutory provisions, collective and works agreements, on which the policies adopted are ultimately based. It should be borne in mind, however, that the results do not allow a thorough evaluation of specific governmental programmes. Finally, the survey focuses on the impact of the economic crisis on the willingness of companies in the six countries to implement or maintain family-friendly policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{and analyses}} {{the way that}} Se reported on the world between 1938 — 1945. Comparative analysis {{is the most important}} technique to describe Se’s type of journalism. Se is compared to the American picture magazine Life, the British picture magazine Picture Post, and the Swedish edition of the German pictorial Signal. Se is also compared with its Swedish competitors, for example, Liv, Folket i Bild and Vi. Throughout the dissertation Se is compared with its chief competitor Vecko-Journalen. Vecko-Journalen is, next to Se, the most important periodical in this study. The main question is if, and then how, Se’s way of reporting differed from other periodicals of the time. The editorial program of Se was presented in its début issue: ”SE wants to see in pictures. ” That is the key sentence in its editorial program. To be able to present the events of the world in pictures Se had to develop a new way of reporting. That way may be described as showing. Instead of telling its readers about the world in lengthy articles, the editorial staff tried to show the world in pictures, in layout inspired by newsreels and motion picture. The staff relied upon the reader’s ability to understand or read a movie, or a newsreel’s rapid flow of news pictures. There is no doubt that Se’s way to show the world to its readers differed from other Swedish magazines. The picture magazine differed in various ways. Se had its roots in American and British press, not in first hand in German and in Danish press as its forerunners. Se’s layout was clearly movie inspired, and the connection between captions, picture and layout was closer than in its competitors. Se broadened the content for a general interest mass audience magazine published by a commercial house, by including critical social picture stories, and strongly political editorials. Se tried to be a voice of, and for the young generation, and for the people outside the big cities. Se published more photographs, bigger photographs and more dramatic photographs than any other periodical in <b>Sweden.</b> <b>Se</b> introduced photojournalism as an editorial format for an entire magazine in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|The carbon {{footprint}} (CF) of milk production was analysed {{at the farm}} gate for two contrasting production systems; an outdoor pasture grazing system in New Zealand (NZ) and a mainly indoor housing system with pronounced use of concentrate feed in <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE).</b> The method used {{is based on the}} conceptual framework of lifecycle assessment (LCA), but only for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. National average data were used to model the dairy system in each country. Collection of inventory data and calculations of emissions were harmonised to the greatest extent possible for the two systems. The calculated CF for 1 Â kg of energy corrected milk (ECM), including related by-products (surplus calves and culled cows), was 1. 00 Â kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) for NZ and 1. 16 Â kg CO 2 e for SE. Methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide emissions from application of nitrogen (as fertiliser and as excreta dropped directly on the field) were the main contributors to the CF in both countries. The most important parameters to consider when calculating the GHG emissions were dry matter intake (DMI), emission factor (EF) for methane from enteric fermentation, amount of nitrogen applied and EF for direct nitrous oxide emissions from soils. By changing one parameter at a time within 'reasonable' limits (i. e. no extreme values assumed), the impact on the total CF was assessed and showed changes of up to 15 %. In addition, the uncertainty in CF estimates due to uncertainty in EF for methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide emissions (from soil and due to ammonia volatilisation) were analysed through Monte Carlo simulation. This resulted in an uncertainty distribution corresponding to 0. 60 - 1. 52 Â kg CO 2 e kg- 1 ECM for NZ and 0. 83 - 1. 56 Â kg CO 2 e kg- 1 ECM for SE (in the prediction interval 2. 5 - 97. 5 %). Hence, the variation within the systems based on the main EF is relatively large compared with the difference in CF between the countries.

40|$|In this thesis, I combine {{molecular}} analyses, common-garden {{and field}} experiments {{to examine how}} evolutionary and ecological processes influence patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of the declining, insect-pollinated, self-incompatible, perennial herb Primula farinosa. More specifically I examined 1) whether genetic diversity at neutral marker loci was related to habitat fragmentation and habitat stability, 2) whether floral display and flowering time were more strongly differentiated among populations than were putatively neutral marker loci, 3) whether adaptive population differentiation could be detected on a local spatial scale, and 4) whether floral display differentially affected male and female reproductive success. Genetic diversity at neutral marker loci was lower within fragmented populations on the Swedish mainland than within the more densely occurring populations on the island Öland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden.</b> On Öland, fluctuations in population size were more pronounced on thin than on deep soils, but genetic diversity {{was not related to}} soil depth. Among-population genetic differentiation in scape length and flowering time was stronger than that of neutral marker loci, which is consistent with divergent selection acting on these traits. Water availability should influence the length of the growing season and thus the time available for fruit maturation, but flowering time in a common-garden experiment was not related to estimates of water availability at sites of origin. In a reciprocal transplant experiment conducted among four populations separated by up to a few kilometres and growing in environment differing in water availability and grazing intensity, no evidence of local adaption was observed. Finally, in a field experiment, interactions with pollinators and antagonists differentially affected selection on floral display through male and female function. Taken together, the results indicate that habitat connectivity and environmental heterogeneity contribute to high neutral and adaptive genetic variation in Primula farinosa on the island Öland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> and illustrate that effects on both male and female reproductive success need to be considered to understand fully the evolution of floral display...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe derive {{the angular}} {{correction}} {{that has to}} be applied to borehole fracture intensities to recover the actual three-dimensional distribution when the fracture networks have a length distribution. We assume that the fracture intensity is calculated from the fractures that fully transect the core. Because of the length distribution, the classical Terzaghi correction, which involves the cosine of fracture dip, is no longer valid. Solutions have been calculated in the specific case of fractal fracture networks with power law length distribution. We show that the Terzaghi correction may significantly overestimate the frequency of fractures subparallel to the borehole. The correction procedure proposed here was tested on a fracture database recorded at a study site for a repository of spent nuclear fuel located in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> with three outcrop maps and three boreholes. A consistency between the dip distributions of outcrops and boreholes was achieved when applying the angular correcting term calculated with the power law length distribution deduced from outcrop maps...|$|R

Box 325 S- 751 05 Uppsala, <b>Sweden</b> parosh@docs. uu. <b>se</b> Karlis Cerans Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science University of Latvia karlis@cclu. lv Abstract We {{prove that}} the {{simulation}} preorder is decidable for the class of one-counter nets. A one-counter net consists of a finite-state machine operating on a variable (counter) which ranges over the natural numbers. Each transition can increase or decrease {{the value of the}} counter. A transition may not be performed if this implies that the value of the counter becomes negative. The class of one-counter nets is computationally equivalent to the class of Petri nets with one unbounded place, and to the class of pushdown automata where the stack alphabet is restricted to one symbol. To our knowledge, this is the first result in the literature which gives a positive answer to the decidability of simulation preorder between pairs of processes in a class whose elements are neither finit [...] ...|$|R
