40|$|One major {{purpose of}} federal and state {{regulation}} of banks is to ensure that institutions maintain safe-and-sound business practices. The main tool used to achieve this goal is bank supervision in general—and bank safety-and-soundness examinations in particular. Regulators conduct on-site examinations to ensure that bank operations are consistent with <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> <b>practices.</b> When on-site examinations identify unsafe, unsound, or illegal <b>banking</b> <b>practices,</b> regulators use a variety of supervisory enforcement actions to require institutions to take corrective measures. These enforcement actions are intended to accomplish several things, including: bringing about alterations in the practices and behavior that caused the problems, stabilizing the institutions, and averting potential losses to the deposit insurance fund. Violations of enforcement agreements are a serious matter—noncompliance often carries heavy penalties, including the termination of deposit insurance. This article investigates the effects of bank examinations and enforcement actions on the behavior of problem banks.

40|$|In most {{developing}} countries, {{access to}} financial services by {{all segments of}} the population, including low-income people, {{is a matter of}} growing concern. Many governments have responded positively to this concern by embarking on financial system reform. They have attempted to match people?s demand for adequate financial services with the government?s responsibility for macroeconomic stability and a sound financial infrastructure. This endeavor includes: – deregulating the interest rate (or profit-sharing) regime; – adjusting the legal environment and create appropriate legal forms for MFIs; – transforming financial institutions into profitable intermediaries between savers and investors; – providing opportunities for local people to establish their own local financial institutions; – encouraging <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> <b>practices.</b> However, these noble objectives have not been always pursued with the necessary vigor. This, at least, is the chief lesson from the Asian financial crisis, which is rooted in: – hazardous, politically instigated lending; – inadequate internal resource mobilization and unhedged external debts; and, above all, – inadequate regulation and supervision of financial institutions. As a result of soaring inflation rates, many poor people have lost their savings and, due to the illiquidity of financial institutions, their access to credit has been curtailed. The devasting effects of the recent financial crisis in East and Southeast Asia have lent additional emphasis to the crucial question of how to promote and prudentially regulate viable financial institutions with sustainable financial services with an outreach to all segments of the population including low-income people, in order to prevent such a financial crisis in other countries.

40|$|Expanding the {{microfinance}} {{market can}} promote {{economic growth and}} reduce poverty in many countries. But expanding this market is advantageous only if the increased activity is sustainable. The author draws lessons from five Indonesian microfinance initiatives in rural areas and proposes ways for governments and donors to support the microfinance sector. Those programs demonstrate that microfinance initiatives can provide a valuable service to low-income people at a temporary, affordable cost to governments of donors. Incentives for customers and staff are key features of successful microfinance operations {{that enable them to}} operate with low subsidies or on a self-sustaining basis. Programs should also charge adequate real interest rates, aggressively pursue repayment, and achieve a significant volume of business. To accelerate progress toward self-sustainability, programs can track the subsidies they receive, and their supporters can impose hard budget constraints and declining subvention support. Government-owned microfinance initiatives are vulnerable to political pressures that undermine their commitment to <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> <b>practices.</b> Granting these institutions autonomous status, imposing hard budget constraints, and privatizing them when they are financially sustainable, can reduce their susceptibility to political influences. Alternatively, governments and donors could support the sector through temporary subsidies to private sector initiatives to help them defray start-up costs. Supervision can be improved if a country's microfinance industry, assisted by its central bank, establishes industrywide standards. Microfinance institutions could contract for supervision services from commercial banks. The central bank could monitor supervisors to ensure that they exercise due diligence. This study finds that institutions can efficiently reach clients in remote areas through subdistrict-based units and field staff. They need not rely on group lending techniques, savings requirements, or intermediary organizations between banks and borrowers to boost efficiency. Initiatives can serve female borrowers without targeted marketing if loan products meet women's needs and are accessible to them. Governments could increase the usefulness of microfinance to agriculture by encouraging state-owned microfinance institutions to develop and pilot-test loan products that meet smallholders'needs.

At the same time, central banks’ responses to the crisis have taken monetary policy into unknown territory.

It specifically focuses on the European Central Bank’s much-debated intervention in certain peripheral bond markets, particularly Greece. The second section is more normative and lays the foundations for a social science perspective of how to manage modern central banks, an approach that draws on a variety of disciplines including economics, governance theory and management. This starts with a definition of the new doctrine and its underlying philosophy, followed by an identification of <b>sound</b> central <b>banking</b> <b>practices</b> (revolving around a few key concepts, notably inflation and financial stability). The missions and objectives of these practices are then defined (along with a choice of indicators), culminating in an exploration of which strategies and tools might be used in both normal and turbulent times. Lastly, a few concrete rules of governance are offered, built on the triptych of central banks’ independence, accountability and composition, with specific focus placed on the process for selecting governors fit to handle the new role that modern central banks are destined to assume in developed countries...|$|R
