25|$|A {{large number}} of {{psychological}} studies recruit college <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> for reasons of convenience, and the studies on the social sharing of emotion were no exception. For this reason, the question was raised of whether the level of education {{plays a role in}} these sharing behaviors. A 1998 study addressed this question by analyzing data from a cross-sectional study of girls in elementary school, middle school, high school, girls pursuing an undergraduate education in college, and girls pursuing a master's degree. Despite possible reasons to believe that education might increase the capacity to and likelihood of sharing behaviors, no differences were found.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Suriya was {{the brand}} {{ambassador}} of Tanker Foundation and {{acted in a}} short film on AIDS awareness. In 2008, Suriya began the Agaram Foundation, working to help children who {{drop out of school}} early in Tamil Nadu. Suriya revealed that he was inspired to begin the movement {{as a result of his}} father's own organisation, Sivakumar Educational Trust, which had been operating similar benefits on a smaller scale since the 1980s. With the Ministry of Education in Tamil Nadu, he created a short commercial video outlining child poverty, labour and lack of education, titled Herova? Zerova?. The film was written and produced by Sivakumar and also starred Vijay, Madhavan and Jyothika. Agaram sponsored 159 underprevileged students in 2010 for their higher education in various disciplines, and has continued to provide free seats and accommodation for pupils. With the firm belief that the educated mind can not only eliminate social evils but also aid in the socio-economic upbringing of society, Agaram Foundation works towards providing appropriate learning opportunities to the rural populace who do not otherwise have access to quality education.

25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E
500|$|Vocational programs, {{known as}} Career and College Tech Prep classes, are {{available}} at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact, which includes the Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Stow-Munroe Falls, Tallmadge, and Woodridge school districts. [...] The compact, established in 1969, combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the programs that are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building. [...] There are 25 programs, six of which are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits. [...] The remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed to give students training and work experience. [...] College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include programs in athletic healthcare and fitness, manufacturing and engineering, landscape horticulture, and teaching. [...] Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business-related programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, construction and remodeling, cosmetology, electronics, health technology, marketing, and out-of-school internships. [...] Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation, culinary arts, theater arts, automotive repair and technology, banking and finance, and early childhood educational aide training. [...] Each program also has co-curricular component, meaning they have both in-class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student's overall grade. [...] One example is the Roosevelt chapter of DECA, {{which is part of the}} marketing education program.

500|$|In 1961, {{the main}} {{gymnasium}} (referred to as [...] "The Garden") was completed. The football stadium {{was constructed in}} 1962 {{which was one of}} the largest stadiums in western Kansas at the time. Two years later, Garden City finally experienced unification as Garden City District No. 1 became Unified School District No. 457. During this same year, the football stadium was renamed [...] "Memorial Stadium". As interest in athletics grew throughout Garden City, so did the athletic departments. Cross-country was introduced in 1966 and the men's basketball team won their first state championship. Eight trailers were also purchased for use in the remedial reading program. Two years later, GCHS experienced major renovations and expansion as the J.D. Adams Vocational Building was constructed and other high school remodeling was completed. The population of Garden City at this time was 14,745. The following year, an agreement was signed between the JUCO and the district relative to the exchange of the former junior college site for senior high vocational building space and other specified district facilities used by the college. The wrestling and debate teams each won their first state titles in 1971. Restrooms facilities were also constructed during this year. The men's basketball team advanced to the state championship the following year. In 1974, math requirements for graduation increased to 1½ credits which became effective with the 1978 graduating class. An addition to the music department was completed in September 1975, allowing more <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a wide variety of musical activities and programs. Garden City would win its first state championship in men's golf in 1977 and progress continued throughout the rest of the decade. The practice gym and locker rooms were added in 1981. In 1984, an idea was conceived among administrators and board members of the school district to recognize past graduates of GCHS who had gone on to distinguish themselves through outstanding accomplishments. This idea was brought into action the following spring, when the first members of the Garden City High School Hall of Fame were inducted. The Buffalo athletics programs struggled throughout the rest of the decade, failing to win a single state championship.|$|E
