40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{collapse}} of the Warsaw pact have resulted in a change of operational theatre for the naval forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In particular, the focus of Anti Submarine Warfare forces has shifted from tracking Soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine in the deep waters of the Atlantic ocean to hunting smaller and quieter Diesel electric submarines in coastal water. In most scenarios, towed array sonars are the best sensor to detect, classify and localise submarines. The long passive towed array sonars used during the Cold war are more difficult to use in coastal waters and are being replaced by most Navies by Low Frequency Active Sonars (LFAS) using a <b>towed</b> source and <b>shorter</b> <b>towed</b> receiving array. These <b>shorter</b> <b>towed</b> arrays can be used in both active and passive modes. In passive mode, their reduced size offer limited performance compared to their longer equivalent. In active mode, they can detect submarines at long ranges in shallow waters but are plagued by false alarms caused by echoes from features of the seafloor. This thesis deals with algorithms improving Detection, Classification and Localisation for towed sonar arrays, with a specific focus on LFAS sonars. In Chapter 2, we derive, analyse and apply to measured data a method for improving detection performance with <b>short</b> passive <b>towed</b> arrays. An important issue in detection of quiet acoustic source with <b>short</b> <b>towed</b> arrays is the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bearing resolution for targets emitting low frequency signals. One of the techniques believed to improve these characteristics is Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS). The method is based on the artificial enlargement of a sonar array by coherently integrating acoustic snapshots at different antenna positions. We first derive theoretical measures of performance of passive SAS and report on its application in combination with other signal-processing algorithms. Its theoretical performance is compared with that of the frequently used incoherent integration. The used passive SAS algorithm is the method known as Extended Towed Array Measurement (ETAM) or the overlap correlator. It is based on the correlation of data snapshots on overlapping hydrophones. Correlation is a key issue in this method and since it is affected by noisy targets, some gain can be expected from noise cancellation. The influence on the performance of ETAM of a method of tow ship noise cancelling at hydrophone level (Inverse Beam Forming, IBF) is analysed. This approach increases ETAM performance by removing a loud and highly correlated noise source, the tow ship, and thus enhancing the other targets in the beam pattern. The results of the algorithms applied to two experimental datasets show that they bring an improvement close to theoretical expectations. Port starboard discrimination and the successful combination of IBF with ETAM make this approach innovative. In Chapter 3, methods for improving the localisation of a source with a <b>short</b> <b>towed</b> array are analysed and applied to data, both simulated and measured at sea. Localisation performance with sonar towed array is related to the array length. The knowledge of the position of a given acoustic source gives a critical tactical advantage to a ship. There are a limited number of ways to estimate the range of a source with a towed passive sonar, most requiring the towing platform to execute a manoeuvre. These manoeuvres are undesirable as they take a lot of time, cause bending of the towed array and can even put the towing platform in harm’s way. We present a number of source position estimation methods for both broadband and narrowband sources suitable for <b>short</b> <b>towed</b> arrays. Recursive methods based on the extended Kalman filter are first examined. A new method based on the integration of time delay of arrival measurements along the sonar path is described. We derive theoretical performance indicators and show that this method gives the possibility to estimate the position and speed of a source without a manoeuvre. In Chapter 4, the Classification performance of a broadband waveform is analysed and measured on data collected at sea. Like any long-range active sonar system, LFAS produces a large amount of unwanted sea bottom echoes or clutter. These echoes give rise to false alarms that increase the computational load of target trackers and jeopardise the correct classification of each echo. The number of false alarms due to clutter can be reduced either through echo classification techniques or through Doppler filtering provided the targets of interest are in motion. Much research has been carried out on waveform investigation for the efficient use of bandwidth capabilities of modern sonar transmitters. Among the quantity of waveforms, Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) pulses have emerged as exhibiting cross-correlation properties relevant to Doppler filtering while maintaining a range resolution comparable to Frequency Modulated (FM) pulses. We have successfully applied a false alarm reduction technique using contacts obtained with an FM pulse subsequently processed by Doppler filtering with a BPSK pulse. The Doppler classification performance for this pulse is evaluated on an experimental dataset and a few limitations of BPSK are identified. Aircraft Transport and OperationAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Matched Field Processing (MFP) for range/depth source {{localisation}} {{has been}} applied successfully to vertical arrays of hydrophones for more than 10 years. However, these arrays are awkward to deploy. On the other hand, horizontal towed arrays offer little or no vertical aperture, making range and depth localisation an inspiring challenge. This shortcoming, combined with the frequent problem of environmental mismatch and hostile conditions of shallow water (increased noise levels and interfering sources) results in severe degradation of the MFP ambiguity surfaces, thus preventing source localisation. This paper reports on our research effort {{for the application of}} MFP to <b>short</b> <b>towed</b> arrays (32 λ at 2 kHz). A realistic scenario has been simulated, involving a target source and additional interfering noise sources. A normal mode model is used for the modelling, and environmental mismatch is introduced.

A multiple target tracker is then used to distinguish sidelobes from actual target detections over a series of snapshots. Application of this method on simulated data shows encouraging results...|$|R

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{the estimation}} of horizontal wave numbers in a far field, range independent, shallow water environment is developed. The algorithm consists of an optimal subspace estimation component along with a maximum likelihood component. Optimal subspace estimators are extended to incorporate the forward/backward method and solutions obtained via this improved formulation are subsequently iteratively refined by maximizing a compressed likelihood function of horizontal wave numbers only. Previously developed 2 ̆ 2 fast 2 ̆ 2 maximum likelihood estimators in conjunction with legacy gradient-based methods {{as well as a}} variety of matrix pencil algorithms are shown in this thesis to perform poorly in crowded signal environments. The algorithm proposed in this thesis proves to be an efficient wave number estimation algorithm which works well in difficult crowded signal environments, and it is shown to have significantly improved performance.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionThe recent fatal {{events with}} regard to the rise in the atmospheric pollutants levels have suggested that the reason of their occurrence be more identified. The long-term and short-term effects on the environment caused by pollutants that reached unacceptable level are apparent; existence of pollutatnts has led to short-term effects such as appearance and aggravation of cancer and respiratory‚ optic and lung diseases. The sequence of long-term effects is seen on DNA‚ intelligence and physiology. The air pollution results in water and soil pollution. Of course, aquatics and plants are under the influence of these pollutions. Men are not safe from them because they enter man’s food chain too. The statistical model represented in this research can estimate the acceptable rate of surface- ozone by measuring the climatic data of synoptic meteorology of Isfahan Station and evaluating surface pollution rate of station of the Environment Protection Agency. This research shows that equations that profited from two variables including square sunshine and square carbon monoxide concentration could explain % 35 of concentration changes in surface- ozone during a day. Even though multivariable regression models can explain dramatical concentration changes in surface– ozone and protector concentration, practical use of these models is limited because of numerous entrance variables. Ozone {{as one of the most}} significant secondary pollutants not only influences general health but also has a considerable effect on agriculture. Surface – ozone is in ppm or ppb and it comprises the number of ozone molecules per million and per billion of air molecule. 2 - Theoretical basis As regards exceptional importance and poisonous state of ozone special in agriculture, it is essential to measure the rate of this gas for quantitative and qualitative survey of garden products and birds and livestock’s health. In general pollutants threat stable development and environment. Furthermore, because its rate is higher than acceptable level, it disrupts man’s daily activities. So, it is necessary to study this process. To display a statistical model is the purpose of this study so that surface- ozone rates can be acceptably estimated using atmospheric factors. The main question is this: can an appropriate estimate of surface- ozone rates be determined using a statistical model? It is assumed in this study that climatic factors of land surface play remarkable role in surface- ozone forming. Statistical models using Excel and Spss Software have been used to regionalize pollutant rates. At first, necessary entrance data were adapted from Isfahan Meteorology Station. Data include: A) Temperature and soil moisture. B) Atmospheric factors including: air temperature, atmospheric humidity, sunshine, wind velocity and precipitation. C) Land surface data of pollutants adapted from the Environment Protection Agency including: surface-ozone, so 2, Nox. Then, using these data and specific model, a relationship was found to estimate surface concentration. This study has been done in Isfahan. Climatic data and air pollution and atmospheric pollutants data have been taken from measuring station of air quality in five centers of city (Laleh Square, Bozorgmehr Square, Azadi Square). 3 – DiscussionData of daily mean temperature during statistical course is 16. 7 c. Median, variance and standard deviation are 17. 9, 95. 2 and 9. 8, respectively. Minimum and maximum temperatures are - 6. 6 and 33. 4 ◦ centigrade. Based on skewness test and Kolmogorov – Smirnov Test frequency distribution of temperature data is normal. Mean dew-point temperature is - 1. 9 during studying course. This factor also has a normal curve like temperature. But Kolmogorov- Smirnov Test shows a contrary result. Range of dew-point temperature is between - 25. 9 to 14. 2. Standard deviation is 5. 7 ْ◦ centigrade that is lower than standard deviation of temperature (10. 9 ْ◦ centigrade). Mean dew–point temperature, median and standard deviation are - 2, - 1. 4 and 5. 2. Both above mentioned tests show that the frequency distribution is normal. Average of hourly ozone concentration data is 31. 4 ppb and median is 27 ppb. Mode as the most abundant in this statistical sample is 10. 1 ppb. Three above mentioned statistics are not the same. So, frequency distribution curve of hourly ozone concentration is not normal. Furthermore, because Mod<Med<Mean so a positive skewness diagram is expected. Standard deviation of date equals 19 / 4 ppb. The high rate of standard deviation illustrates that observations distribution is around mean. To assess correlation of daily date, based on Pearson Method, the most correlation seen between ozone and atmospheric factors in sea level pressure equals 0 / 135 and level of 850 milibar equals 0 / 134 and cloudiness equals 0 / 117. The level of 850 milibar is measured directly based on sea level pressure. This explains its high correlation with ozone. It seems hard to explain positive relationship between ozone and cloudiness physically. Any of temperature-humidity factors and factors such as sunshine hours and radiation do not show determined correlation with ozone. To find stronger relationship, some atmospheric parameters entered and measured daily, were used. 3 -hour date and ozone also were measured daily and collectively 18 atmospheric factors as variable were achieved. After assessment of correlation of daily date, it is shown that the most correlation between ozone and atmospheric factors is seen in sea level pressure and level of 850 mb as negative relationship and with cloudiness as a positive relationship. 4 – ConclusionThe study done in this research shows that in 3 -hour scale of atmospheric factors, temperature and wet-bulb temperature had the most correlation. It means tha temperature and humidity are positively effective on ozone forming. Beside, pressure level of station shows negative relationship with ozone. Negative correlation between ozone and pressure factors is unexpected since this relationship shows increasing ozone concentration in instable atmosphere (presence of low pressure system). Increasing temperature causes thermal low pressure growth so it can be resulted that direct and positive effect of temperature on increase of surface-ozone is more obvious than its indirect role decreasing surface pressure in lessening of ozone concentration. Particularly, two round-the-clock pressure changes and ozone curves are exactly contrary curves. Beside, results assessed from model about happening of sea level pressure illustrate that it can not play a role in point analysis of model and using this factor is not helpful to improve the equation. These studies shows that the regression equation measured out of atmospheric factors of synoptic stations can not singly estimate ozone concentration. These explain just some parts of ozone changes. Whereas beside ozone data, five more pollutant gases have been measured. For the next step these data in tow 3 -hour and daily scales were considered beside atmospheric factors as predictor ozone variable. Significant correlation between ozone and Noxs represent that ozone rate is increased by inflation components in Nox s concentration. Surface – ozone forming caused by these components in presence of sunshine is a remarkable point because high level of them is available in Isfahan. Here, significant correlation was not seen between ozone and carbon monoxide, but for the next step and special daily scale, a notable correlation is proved between them. Dominated pollutant in Isfahan is carbon monoxide so it has direct and remarkable effect on ozone forming. In <b>short,</b> equation profited <b>tow</b> variables including square sun shine and square carbon monoxide concentration could explain 30 percent of daily ozone concentration changes. It sounds that because of numerous entrance variables, regression models and complicated functions models are not practically helpful; however, they are fairly working to explain surface-ozone changes and predictor ozone concentration. 5 – Suggestions-To form pollutant evaluation network - To form general data base -To compose national standard of acceptable pollutant level -To inform public about human-induced pollutant;Key words: Secondary pollutants, statistical models, ozone level, RegionalizationRefrencesThe book of statistics of environmental protect organization. 2005.

It recognizes the fundamental importance of mature-fruit feeding to spider-monkey foraging strategy and discusses implications of diet to social behaviour, Prom a conservational point of view. this study in essential in emphasizing the extreme vulnerability of the spider monkey to both hunting and habitat destruction, and in providing detailed information on its habitat choice and dietary requirements. so urgently needed in order to assess in a responsible way the mite of areas to protect and the potential of already preposed protected areas. The spider monkey may serve an an important 'indicator' species, reflecting the degree of disturbance of Amazonian tropical rain forests, 1, 2, 3, Among the eight Surinam monkey species, Atelesp. paniscus is the most restricted in habitat. In the Voltzberg region. it occurs exclusively in high forest (92. 6 %), infrequently enters edge habitats (14. 9 %) and is found primarily in the upper levels of the canopy and in emergents (72, 3 %), The understory is rarely used (0. 8 %), and the lower extreme of its vertical range appears to be 12 meters. Among the seven major forest types available in the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg region, spider monkeys are observed only in high rain forest. mountain savanna forest, pine. swamp forest and riverbank high forest. 4. A total of 207 food plant species are used, of which 68. 1 % trees. Most important families, providing the monkeys with food, are Moraceae and Mimosaceae regarding both the number of food species and the percentage of total feeding records. Atelesp. paniscus is mainly frugivorous. feeding on 171 species of fruit, 33 species of flower and 28 species of leaf. Mature fruit makes up 96 % of the total number of fruit feeding records. The occasional feeding on insects (termites and caterpillars) definitively has been ascertained. The average annual food intake in 82. 9 % fruits. 6, 4 % flowers, 7. 9 % flush leaves, 1. 7 % bark and 1. 0 % miscellaneous (e. g., rotten palmsheaths, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, honey, insects). The monthly variation in food choice shows a strong correlation with the phenology. During the first part of the long dry season (July - September), a period of low fruit supply. the monkey compensates its diet with relatively high percen tages of both flowers and flush leaves, while during the long wet season (March - June) fruit abundance causes very low percentages of both flowers and flush leaves in the diet. The percentages are strongly determined individually by its supply in relation to the ecological change, but ripe fruits always are preferred above all. Young seeds play a minor overall role in the diet, except during the period May - June, By ingesting large quantities of young needs# rich in protein and fat, during the peak of the long wet season the monkeys seem to stock up on energy for the coming months of food scarcity (July - October). Ateles appeared to play an important role as dispersal agent for may plant species, and for none species it seemed to be the only disperser. Endozoochorical seed dispersal by spider monkeys took place in 138 plant species (accounting for 93, 5 % of total fruit feeding records), seed dropping was recorded in 10 species (2, 7 %) and seed predation in 23 species 3. 7 %). Ateles belongs to the category of 'specialized frugivores', who derive all or most of their supplies of carbohydrate, lipid and protein from fruits. Large-seeded, nutritious fruits &sea to have coevolved with specialized frugivores an their principal dispersal agents, resulting in a greater quality of dispersal than can be aeon in small-seeded, low nutritious fruits dispersed by a wide array of both 'opportunistic' and 'specialized' fruit-eating animals. This coevolutionary pattern (the high nutritive content of the flesh in large-seeded fruits) way be demon strated in families such as Palmae, Burseraceae. Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae, Loxaniaceael Capparaceae, Sapotaceae and Meliaceae, all producing important fruits for spider monkeys. Among 166 plant species producing edible fruits. used by the spider monkeys in the Voltzberg region, about 80 % in nutritious and large-seeded. Low-nutritious, small-seeded fruits (especially berries and figs), making up only 20 %, were exploited only incidentally on the way from one nutritious fruit source to another, and almost never appeared to influence the daily foraging routes nor ware revisited regularly. These species often produce mass-ripened fruit crops on which the monkeys cannot depend much, The fruiting seasons of the former category, however, in general last relatively long because of wore or lens asynchronous fruit-maturing within and between indivi duals of the species, apparently mince the small number of specialized dispersal agents way be easily overloaded. The competition between these plant species for the high-quality dispersal offered by a small number of dispersers may have evolved in elongated and displaced, but broadly overlapping fruiting seasons as required for the existence of specialized frugivores. 5, Foraging behaviour in spider monkeys in differing strikingly with the seasons. During the long wet season, when fruit is abundant, activity budgets are increased resulting in large day ranges (with a maximum of 5. 000 meters), prolonged feeding times, short resting times and many food sources (especially mature fruits) exploited daily. Foraging often takes place in relatively large subgroups breaking up and reassembling regularly,, the subparties using partly different food sources but follow ing about similar itineraries. During the long dry season, when fruit supply is low and a food scarcity or even a food shortage way exist. activity budgets are lowered to a minimum. resulting in short day ranges (with a minimum of 500 meters), prolonged resting times and <b>short</b> feeding times (<b>tow</b> relatively long feeding bouts), few food sources exploited daily and diet composition differing in much higher percentages of flowers and flush leaves. Finally, mean subgroup size is decreased strongly. Spider monkeys live in medium-sized groups fragmenting into widely dis persed subgroups of varying composition. Daily itineraries and activity patterns of a subgroup mostly are determined by a so-called dominant (usually aged) female with or without offspring, or sometimes by two dominant females alternately. These females appear to possess the beet knowledge of certain parts of the group's range, the so-called core areas, and are capable of preplanning an economic foraging route for the day along an much as 8 to 30 different food sources. By checking regularly potential food sources on their stage of maturing and using a highly developed spatial and temporal memory, these females are able to incorporate these food sources in their foraging routes just after becoming available. The interval between subsequent visits to a particular food source appears to be species specific. depending on the rate of fruit maturing. In some species the last stage of maturing in going fast, offering the monkeys every day enough ripe fruits to feed on together. Many species, however, are exploited in a 2 days cycle. some in a 5 - 8 days cycle or even more. Spider monkeys appear to select for variety. using on average about 14 different food items daily. making up about a quarter of the average monthly number of food items used, Among these. 3 or 4 food items are most important considering the amount of feeding time and the estimated total weight of food ingested, 6, A group of Atelesp. paniscus usually consists of 15 - 20 individuals. although they way never be observed all together at the same place. A group fragments into several subgroups of varying composition, a female with offspring of an age ranging from 0 to about 5 years being the only persistent bond. Sex ratio of adult males to females is 1 : 2 (- 3). The adult males of a group appear to defend a territory with clearcut boundaries, while fema les sometimes visit neighbouring groups and even may emigrate. Spider-monkey social system is characterized by its flexible grouping behaviour and seems to be coevolved with the species food specialism concerning mainly nutritious. large-seeded fruits. The supply of this type of food is varying strongly with the seasons and maturing within and between individual fruiting plants. in general. is rather slow and asynchronous. Moreover, individual mature fruits of this type are short ly available to the monkey. After becoming mature. most fruits moon drop to the ground or when dehiscent, become available to birds. For more than three large-sized spider monkeys these food plants seldom offer enough to feed on together and to make the visit worthwhile in terms of energy expenditure, Consequently, subgroups consisting of three or lens indi viduals are encountered most often throughout the year. However, the high density of particular food plants fruiting during the long wet season, makes it possible for spider monkeys to forage in much larger sub groups, often containing two dominant females and ranging in size up to 9 individuals, using simultaneously about the same itineraries, but ex ploiting partly different food sources. As a result. during this season intragroup social interactions are more frequent. During the following long dry season. when nutritious fruits are scarce and some years even a severe food shortage may exist, the mean subgroup size decreases strongly. in particular effectuated so by the splitting of dominant-female core areas, which show almost no overlap anymore. Non-dominant females and males still may join subgroups led by a dominant female to share ecological knowledge of food sources. but they do so less frequently. Day ranges drop strikingly and the animals are more silent, both factors contributing to the lower chance of encounter. Activity budgets are decreased, in particular in males and non-dominant females. The better knowledge of available food in dominant females may favour them especially during the long dry season. This may be a reason that dominant females seem more successful in rearing offspring than non-dominant females, and perhaps that mortality in adult males seems higher considering the sex ratio. At the end of the long dry season. when preferred fruit in still low in supply, the relatively frequent feeding on flush leaves and flowers. again, sustains foraging in larger subgroups, because of the great amount of food offered at the same time and by mostly large-crowned, flushing or blooming food plants. Adult males do have core areas, which are larger than dominant-female core areas and even may, combine those of two dominant females. They cooperate in territorial defense patrols and long distance agonism in case of boundary conflicts. In this way, spider-monkey males seem to be able to defend wore females than they should in a social system with cohesive bisexual groups, like in many other primates. Spider-monkey social system in unusual among primates and only shown striking similarities with that of the chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes). Both species are largely frugivorous, and show a loose, unstable social structure within distinguishable groups. Subgroup size varies seasonally in relation to food supply and most commonly is small. Individual adults occupy 'core areas' and show capacity for and continual use of a detailed, high developed spatial memory. Also dominance behaviour and sexual behaviour show remarkable similarities between both species. 7. The annual home range of the spider-monkey study group in the Voltzberg study area covered 255 hectares, of which 220 hectares offered suitable habitat, Day range size ranged between 500 and 5. 000 meters, depending on the subgroup size and composition, the weather, the season and the distribution of particular important food sources. In the Voltzberg region, Atelesp. paniscus occurs at a density of 7, 1 individuals per km 2 , or 8. 2 individuals per km 2 when only suitable habitat is considered. Biomass is ranging between 0. 4 and 0. 5 kg/ha, depending on the home range figure choosen. Ateles does not show polyspecific associations with other sympatric primate species. Some short-term associations observed were due to chance or should probably be regarded as companionship. Associations with terrestrial birds and mammals, however, are frequently observed and way be advantageous for one or both of the participant species. The terrestrial animals focus on the noisy foraging spider monkeys to obtain nutritious fruits and/or seeds immediately after dropping, while alarm calls emitted by fleeing terrestrial animals way benefit the spider monkeys, warning them against possible intruders coming into the area. 8. Spider monkeys are extremely vulnerable to hunting and habitat destruction. All over their range they disappear in the face of human entrance. showing little or no adaptability to human intrusion. Emphasizing the important role of specialized frugivores, like spider monkeys, an dispersal agents for many rain forest plants, and the balance between seed disperser. and seed- and seedling predators as they interact with fruits. having a strong impact on structure and composition of primeval tropical rain forest. a suggestion is made to combine interests of both conservationists and exploiters of rain forest treasures in conservational projects, like that of a responsible exploiting of buffer zones surrounding national parks and nature reserves, by increasing density of particular commercially valuable and edible fruit producing trees, and sustaining restricted game cropping of terrestrial seed predators and herbivores, like agoutis, acouchis, peccaries, deer and tapirs...|$|R
