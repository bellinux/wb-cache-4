40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of a proposed High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) was conducted {{in the fall of}} 1995 at the NASA Langley Research Center. This configuration, known as the Industry Reference-H (Ref. -H), was designed by the Boeing Aircraft Company as part of their work in the High Speed Research program. It included a conventional tail, a cranked-arrow wing, four mixed-flow turbofan engines, and capacity for transporting approximately 300 passengers. The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate and quantify operational aspects of the Reference-H configuration from a pilot's perspective with the additional goal of identifying design strengths as well as any potential configuration deficiencies. This study was aimed at evaluating the Ref. -H configuration at many points of the aircraft's envelope to determine the <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> to accomplish typical mission profiles as well as emergency or envelope-limit conditions. Pilot-provided Cooper-Harper ratings and comments constituted the primary vehicle evaluation metric.

30|$|In {{order to}} execute <b>the</b> algorithm, each <b>vehicle</b> {{is assumed to}} {{maintain}} and update the two sets Γ(t) and the Λ(t) that contain <b>the</b> IDs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2 r-stable neighbors. At any time, {{there should be a}} vehicle whose speed is the slowest among its 2 r-stable neighbors, and as a result, the Λ(t) list maintained by this <b>vehicle</b> is empty. <b>The</b> pseudo code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm is shown in Algorithms 1 - 3. The algorithm basically requires that <b>the</b> slowest <b>vehicle</b> or <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> whose Λ(t) members belong to other clusters originates the cluster formation process. This <b>vehicle</b> is called <b>the</b> cluster originating <b>vehicle</b> (COV). Line 3 in Algorithm 1, shows that COV sends the Initiate Cluster(CIDtmp) with its ID as a temporary cluster ID to all Γ(t). Then, as shown in Algorithm 2, all Γ(t) non-clustered members react upon receiving this message by setting their cluster ID temporarily to be <b>the</b> ID <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COV as shown in line 3. Vehicles start calculating their suitability to become a CH as shown in line 4. Then, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> calculates Twait before announcing its eligibility to become a cluster-head as shown in line 5. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> waits for Twait that is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>suitability</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> <b>The</b> higher the suitability value, the less <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> Twait. This can be seen in lines 6 through 15. If <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> receives a Form Cluster(CHid) message from any other vehicle that belongs to Γ(t) before its waiting time, Twait, expires, then <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> determines that there are other vehicles belong to Γ(t) that are more suitable to win the CH role.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{consumers}} {{all over the}} world have been showing an incremental interest in vehicular technology. <b>The</b> world’s leading <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers have been and are still engaged in continuous competitions to present for today’s sophisticated drivers, vehicles that gratify their demands. This has lead to an outstanding advancement and development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicular manufacturing industry and has primarily contributed to <b>the</b> augmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenty first century’s vehicle with an appealing and intelligent personality. Particularly, <b>the</b> marriage <b>of</b> information technology to the transport infrastructure gave birth to a novel communication paradigm known as Vehicular Networking. More precisely, being equipped with computerized modules and wireless communication devices, <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> today’s <b>vehicles</b> qualify to act as typical mobile network nodes that are able to communicate with each other. In addition, these vehicles can as well communicate with other wireless units such as routers, access points, base stations and data posts that are arbitrarily deployed at fixed locations along roadways. These fixed units are referred to as Stationary Roadside Units (SRUs). As a result, ephemeral and self-organized networks can be formed. Such networks are known as Vehicular Networks and constitute <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latitudinarian Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) that embraces a wide variety of applications including but not limited to: traffic management, passenger and road safety, environment monitoring and road surveillance, hot-spot guidance, on the fly Internet access, remote region connectivity, information sharing and dissemination, peer-to-peer services and so forth. This thesis presents an in-depth investigation on <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> exploiting mobile vehicles to establish connectivity between isolated SRUs. A network of intercommunicating SRUs is referred to as an Intermittently Connected Roadside Communication Network (ICRCN). While inter-vehicular communication as well as vehicle-to-SRU communication has been widely studied in the open literature, the inter-SRU communication has received very little attention. In this thesis, not only do we focus on inter-SRU connectivity establishment through the transport infrastructure but also on <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> achieving delay-minimal data delivery from a source SRU to a destination SRU in. This delivery process is highly dependent on the vehicular traffic behaviour and more precisely on <b>the</b> arrival times <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> to <b>the</b> source SRU as well as these vehicles’ speeds. Vehicle arrival times and speeds are, in turn, highly random and are not available a priori. Under such conditions, <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delay-minimal data delivery objective becomes remarkably challenging. This is especially true since, upon <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> <b>the</b> source SRU acts on <b>the</b> spur <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment and evaluates <b>the</b> <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arriving <b>vehicles.</b> Data bundles are only released to those <b>vehicles</b> that contribute <b>the</b> most to <b>the</b> minimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average bundle end-to-end delivery delays. Throughout this thesis, several schemes are developed for this purpose. These schemes differ in their enclosed vehicle selection criterion as well as the adopted bundle release mechanism. Queueing models are developed for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> capturing and describing the source SRU’s behaviour as well as <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> its buffer and the experienced average bundle queueing delay under each of theses schemes. In addition, several mathematical frameworks are established for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> average bundle transit delay. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the developed models and mathematical analyses...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reentry dynamics <b>of</b> {{a high-performance}} lifting atmospheric entry vehicle through numerical simulation tools. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle,</b> named SHARP, {{is currently being}} developed by the Thermal Protection Materials and Systems branch of NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this project is to provide insight into trajectory tradeoffs and vehicle dynamics using simulation tools that are powerful, flexible, user-friendly and inexpensive. Implemented Using MATLAB and SIMULINK, these tools are developed with an eye towards further use in <b>the</b> conceptual design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SHARP <b>vehicle's</b> trajectory and flight control systems. A trajectory simulator is used to quantify <b>the</b> entry capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> subject to various operational constraints. Using an aerodynamic database computed by NASA and a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth, the simulator generates <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> trajectory in three-dimensional space based on aerodynamic angle inputs. Requirements for entry along the SHARP aerothermal performance constraint are evaluated for different control strategies. Effect of vehicle mass on entry parameters is investigated, and the cross range capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> is evaluated. Trajectory results are presented and interpreted. A six degree of freedom simulator builds on the trajectory simulator and provides attitude simulation for future entry controls development. A Newtonian aerodynamic model including control surfaces and a mass model are developed. A visualization tool for interpreting simulation results is described. Control surfaces are roughly sized. A simple controller is developed to fly <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> along its aerothermal performance constraint using aerodynamic flaps for control. This end-to-end demonstration proves <b>the</b> <b>suitability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6 -DOF simulator for future flight control system development.
