40|$|Wind erosion {{is defined}} as the {{movement}} of soil particles resulting from strong turbulent winds. The movement of soil particles can be categorized as suspension, saltation, or <b>surface</b> <b>creep.</b> Fine soil particles can be suspended in the atmosphere and carried for great distances. Particles too large to be suspended move in a jumping action along the soil surface, known as saltation.

50|$|Saltation is {{downwind}} {{movement of}} particles {{in a series}} of jumps or skips. Saltation normally lifts sand-size particles no more than one centimeter above the ground and proceeds at one-half to one-third the speed of the wind.

The grain may also hit larger grains that are too heavy to hop, but that slowly creep forward as they are pushed by saltating grains. <b>Surface</b> <b>creep</b> accounts for as much as 25 percent of grain movement in a desert.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method for}} {{improving}} the mechanical characteristics of the ground is thermal treatment of potentially unstable hillsides made up of clayey materials. Historically, unstable clayey slopes along railways were hardened by lighting of wood or coal fires within holes dug into the slope. In large diameter holes (from 200 to 400 mm.), about 0.8-1.2m. apart and horizontally interconnected, burners were introduced to form cylinders of hardened clay. The temperatures reached were around 800 °C. These clay cylinders worked like piles giving greater shear strength to the <b>creep</b> <b>surface.</b> This system was useful for <b>surface</b> <b>creep,</b> {{as in the case}} of an embankment. In other cases the depth of the holes or the amount of fuel necessary led to either the exclusion of this technique or made the effort ineffective.|$|R

Detailed creep studies were carried out on 316 LN SS at 823 K, 873 K and 923 K at stress levels ranging from 140 to 300 MPa. The longest rupture life in this study was 32, 500 hours. Creep strength was found to increase substantially with increase in nitrogen content. Metallographic studies were performed on creep tested specimens to understand the {{influence of}} nitrogen content on the evolution of creep damage. The extent of internal and <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> damage decreased drastically with increase in nitrogen content. Area fraction of internal creep damage was measured and it was observed to decrease significantly with increase in nitrogen content. The steel containing the highest nitrogen content showed a negligible amount of creep damage irrespective of the stress level. Hence, increasing the nitrogen content increases the resistance to creep damage formation leading to improved rupture life. The extent of internal and <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> damage decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing stress.

40|$|We have {{determined}} precise hypocentral locations for over 3, 600 aftershocks {{that occurred in}} the Yuha Desert region following the 4 April 2010 M w 7. 2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake until 14 June 2010 through a series of absolute and relative relocation procedures with algorithms including hpoinverse, velest and hypoDD. Location errors were reduced to ~ 20 m horizontally and ~ 80 m vertically. The locations reveal a complex pattern of faulting with en echelon fault segments trending in toward the northwest, approximately parallel to the North American-Pacific plate boundary and en echelon, conjugate features trending to the northeast. The relocated seismicity is highly correlated with the mapped faults showing triggered surface slip in response to the EMC mainshock. Aftershocks are located between depths of 2 km and 11 km, consistent with previous studies of seismogenic thickness in the region. Three-dimensional analysis reveals individual and intersecting fault planes between 5 km and 10 km in the along-strike and along-dip directions. These fault planes remain distinct structures at depth, indicative of conjugate faulting, and do not appear to coalesce onto a through-going fault segment. Measurements of surface displacement along the Laguna Salada-West and East (LS-W and LS-E, respectively) branches reveal no triggered <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> on either branch following the EMC mainshock. Approximately 2 mm of triggered <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> was observed on the LS-W in response to the 14 June 2010 M 5. 7 Ocotillo earthquake, however no creep was measured along the LS-E. Relocated seismicity shows that aftershock activity occurs along the LS-E, however not along the LS-W in the time period between these earthquakes. The area east of the LS-W was seismically active following the EMC mainshock, however; no systematic migration patterns were observed. Aftershock activity abruptly shuts off in this area following the Ocotillo earthquake.

40|$|The San Andreas fault {{system of}} California {{comprises}} dominantly right-lateral strike-slip faults and forms {{part of the}} Pacific-North American plate boundary. This fault system has been studied extensively using geological and geophysical methods since it was first brought into prominence by the 1906 M = 8 (^ 1) (_ 4) San Francisco earthquake. Observations of surface deformation thought to define an earthquake deformation cycle have been inferred from terrestrial and space-based geodetic methods. The observed relative motion in these networks has also been used to constrain the distribution of motion across the plate boundary. Sites in three profiles extending across the fault system in the San Francisco bay region were measured up to 7 times between March 1990 and February 1993 using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The data were processed using the Bernese V 3. 2 software. The GPS data were combined with trilateration and VLBI data to create a spatially dense sample of the deformation field in the region. Approximately 35 ± 3 mm/yr of fault-parallel (N 33 ºW) shear is distributed across a deforming zone that increases in width northwards from 60 to 100 km and in style from fault-concentrated deformation {{in the south to}} near-linear trends in the north. No systematic convergence upon the fault is observed. Both two- and three-dimensional models of dislocations in an elastic half-space were used to model the deformation and to investigate the effects of structural complexities such as a low-rigidity fault zone, the depth to which <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> extends, geometrical complexities of the fault system and along-strike variations in slip rate. The models produce a remarkably close fit to the deformation despite such a rheologically simple Earth structure. Approximately half of the observed deformation is accommodated along faults to the east of the San Andreas fault. A zone of concentrated deformation across the San Andreas fault zone in the north of the region {{may be the result of}} a 1 - 2 km wide low-rigidity fault zone there. <b>Surface</b> <b>creep</b> rates, although highly variable, appear to increase to the south. An increase in depth of the <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> zone to the south may also accompany this. The variations in slip rate at depth along strike are consistent with connectivity between the major faults of the system. Quasi-steady slip on discrete fault planes or shear zones may occur down to 2 - 3 times the seismogenic depth and deformation rates are probably almost constant throughout much of the earthquake cycle. The present earthquake potential calculated from the estimated slip rates indicate that several fault segments may have an earthquake potential equivalent in magnitude to the "characteristic" earthquake assumed for that segment. The estimates of relative motion indicate that deformation across the San Andreas fault system, plus that observed to the east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, can account for all of the Pacific-North American plate motion rate...|$|R

We generated maps of satellite line-of-sight velocity using five ascending Advanced Land Observing Satellite tracks and one descending Envisat track covering the NAF between 31. 2 degrees E and 34. 3 degrees E. The line-of-sight velocity reveals discontinuities of up to similar to 5 mm/yr across the Ismetpasa segment of the NAF, implying <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> {{at a rate of}} similar to 9 mm/yr; this is a large fraction of the inferred slip rate of the NAF (21 - 25 mm/yr). The lateral extent of significant <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> is about 75 km. We model the inferred surface velocity and shallow fault creep using numerical simulations of spontaneous earthquake sequences that incorporate laboratory-derived rate and state friction. Our results indicate that frictional behavior in the Ismetpasa segment is velocity strengthening at shallow depths and transitions to velocity weakening at a depth of 3 - 6 km. The inferred depth extent of shallow fault creep is 5. 5 - 7 km, suggesting that the deeper locked portion of the partially creeping segment is characterized by a higher stressing rate, smaller events, and shorter recurrence interval. We also reproduce surface velocity in a locked segment of the NAF by fault models with velocity-weakening conditions at shallow depth. Our results imply that frictional behavior in a shallow portion of major active faults with little or no shallow creep is mostly velocity weakening. Citation: Kaneko, Y., Y. Fialko, D. T.

In the first season, IWEh in the bare land ranged from 99. 9 (W) to 109. 8 (NE) {{with a mean of}} 104. 4 tons/ha/day and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 3. 9 %. Furthermore, IWEh ranged from 2. 1 (Nov.) to 260 tons/ha/day (Sept.) with a CV of 93. 4 %. The variation due to direction was much lower than the monthly values; due to the higher monthly variability of wind erosivity. The overall means of IWEh and IWEV in the first season were 2. 25 - and 1. 90 -fold those in the second season, respectively. This effect was attributed to the higher wind erosivity in the first season. In bare lands, the overall mean IWEh was 2. 42 - and 2. 04 -fold the corresponding IWEV values in the first and second seasons, respectively. This was attributed to the fact that horizontal traps measure cumulative wind erosion by saltation, <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> and suspension, whereas vertical traps measure soil erosion by saltation only. The result may also explain the higher variation of measurements made by horizontal as compared to vertical traps. In the cultivated fields, the reverse trend was found. The ratio IWEv/ IWEh of the overall mean values was 3. 2 and 2. 7 in the first and second seasons, respectively. This is because, in addition to reducing wind erosivity, lucerne obstructed soil particles transport to the traps, more so by <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> than saltation. The impact of lucerne cover on soil erosion was colossal. The IWEh in the bare lands were 522 - and 220. 5 -fold that of the cultivated fields in the two successive seasons.

The surface environment of Venus is simulated as closely as practicable using the Venus Wind Tunnel and to determine threshold wind speeds, particle flux, particle velocities, and the characteristics of various aeolian bedforms. Despite the relatively low wind speeds on Venus, the flux of windblown material on Venus is potentially high. A high fraction of material is transported as <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> by rolling, estimates yield rates up to 100 kg per cm lane width per year depending upon the availability of material and wind frequency, suggesting that the formation of lowland plains by aeolian processes and the burial of various landforms such as impact craters could occur on short geological time-scales. Wind tunnel simulations demonstrate that aeolian processes may be very effective in modifying the surface through erosion and deposited and may have an important influence on {{the composition of the}} atmosphere...|$|R

The most hazardous of all, the NAF {{is known as a}} 1200 -km-long dextral strike-slip fault zone that initiates at Karlıova Junction, lies along the Black Sea coast until it divides into several branches near Adapazarı (Şengör et al. 2005). Occurrence of large earthquakes along the NAF is known to be periodical with centennial cycles (Parsons et al. 2000), where the major earthquakes have the tendency to migrate to the west with a progressive failure mechanism (Stein et al. 1997). Seismicity along the NAF naturally does not show homogeneous characteristics due to complex geology and geodynamic state of the Anatolia. Many segments can be interpreted as seismic gaps (Ergintav et al. 2014), while the <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> (Çakır et al. 2005) or microseismic activity (Örgülü 2011) is also valid explanations for release of stress. Karaş et al. (2017) showed that even in small distances within the same segment of the NAF, structures of faults might show drastically different characteristics, thus leading to heterogeneous rheological environments.|$|R
