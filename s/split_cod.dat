The table is notched to {{facilitate}} {{the removal of the}} cod's head, and a small piece of wood is nailed on to brace the <b>split</b> <b>cod</b> when “raising the soundbone” (removing the spine). A hole in the wall and another in the floor serve to dispose of offal, heads and other rejected fish parts. The store was built with assistance from the Fisheries Heritage Program...|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} {{challenging}} task of achieving effective voice communication over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), we {{introduce a new}} multiple description (MD) speech coder based on the AMR-WB standard. The MD <b>coder</b> <b>splits</b> the bitstream of the AMR-WB coder into two redundant sub-streams by directly selecting overlapping subsets of encoded data generated for each frame. The sub-streams are transmitted on different network paths. When both sub-streams arrive at the decoder, an output identical to that of AMR-WB is recovered. If only one substream arrives at the decoder, degraded but still acceptable speech quality is obtained. The performance of the multiple description coding system is tested for MANETS with a network simulator and an informal listening test. The results demonstrate that this approach makes effective use of the channel capacity and provides reliable end-toend connections for voice communication in MANETs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Predation is a {{powerful}} agent in the ecology and evolution of predator and prey. Prey may select multiple habitats whereby different genotypes prefer different habitats. If the predator is also habitat-specific the prey may evolve different habitat occupancy. Drastic changes can occur in {{the relation of the}} predator to the evolved prey. Fisheries exert powerful predation and can be a potent evolutionary force. Fisheries-induced selection can lead to phenotypic changes that influence the collapse and recovery of the fishery. However, heritability of the phenotypic traits involved and selection intensities are low suggesting that fisheries-induced evolution occurs at moderate rates at decadal time scales. The Pantophysin I (Pan I) locus in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), representing an ancient balanced polymorphism predating the <b>split</b> of <b>cod</b> and its sister species, is under an unusual mix of balancing and directional selection including current selective sweeps. Here we show that Pan I alleles are highly correlated with depth with a gradient of 0. 44 % allele frequency change per meter. AA fish are shallow-water and BB deep-water adapted in accordance with behavioral studies using data storage tags showing habitat selection by Pan I genotype. AB fish are somewhat intermediate although closer to AA. Furthermore, using a sampling design covering space and time we detect intense habitat-specific fisheries-induced selection against the shallow-water adapted fish with an average 8 % allele frequency change per year within year class. Genotypic fitness estimates (0. 08, 0. 27, 1. 00 of AA, AB, and BB respectively) predict rapid disappearance of shallow-water adapted fish. Ecological and evolutionar...|$|R
40|$|Nimphius, S, Callaghan, SJ, Spiteri, T, and Lockie, RG. Change of {{direction}} deficit: A more isolated measure of change {{of direction}} performance than total 505 time. J Strength Cond Res 30 (11) : 3024 - 3032, 2016 - Most change of direction (COD) tests use total time to evaluate COD performance. This {{makes it difficult}} to identify COD ability because the majority of time is a function of linear running. The COD deficit has been proposed as a practical measure to isolate COD ability independent of sprint speed. This study evaluated relationships between sprint time, 505 time, and COD deficit, and whether the COD deficit identified a different and more isolated measure of COD ability compared with 505 time. Seventeen cricketers performed the 505 for both left and right sides and 30 -m sprint tests (with 10 -m <b>split</b> time). The <b>COD</b> deficit for both sides was calculated as the difference between average 505 and 10 -m time. Correlations were calculated between all variables (p ≤ 0. 05). To compare 505 time and COD deficit, z-scores were calculated; the difference in these scores was evaluated for each subject. The COD deficit correlated to 505 (r 0. 74 - 0. 81) but not sprint time (r - 0. 11 to 0. 10). In contrast, 505 time did correlate with sprint time (r 0. 52 - 0. 70). Five of 17 subjects were classified differently for COD ability when comparing standardized scores for 505 time vs. COD deficit. Most subjects (88 - 94...|$|R
