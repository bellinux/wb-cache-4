In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the genetic coding problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group. In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small [...] "adaptor molecules" [...] that would hydrogen bond to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids.

We examined effects of predation risk on relationships between growth and <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> in Enallagma aspersum and Ischnura verticalis damselfly larvae that differ in this trade-off. In laboratory and field experiments, both species had similar growth and mortality rates and similar concentrations of <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> {{in the absence of}} mortality threats. However, in the presence of dragonfly predators Ischnura larvae had higher mortality rates and grew faster than Enallagma larvae. Consistent with the difference in growth rate, Enallagma's total protein concentrations decreased under predation risk while those of Ischnura did not. Glucose and glycogen concentrations were not affected, while triglyceride concentrations were lower under predation risk in Enallagma but not in Ischnura. Species differences at the physiological level to the presence of mortality threats may be crucial to understanding patterns in metamorphic and post-metamorphic traits. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{physiological}} costs of rapid growth. We successfully generated compensatory growth to time stress and transient food stress in the damsefly Lestes viridis and studied the physiological correlates of the resulting reduced {{ability to cope with}} starvation. We found evidence for both mechanisms proposed to underlie the physiological trade-off: compensatory growth was associated with (1) a higher metabolic rate, as indicated by a higher oxygen consumption and a faster depletion of energy <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> (glycogen and triglycerides), and (2) a smaller investment in energy storage. The former may also explain why <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> after emergence were negatively affected by time stress and food stress, despite the successful compensation before emergence. These deferred physiological costs of rapid growth have the potential to couple larval stresses to adult fitness irrespective of age and size at emergence, and they may partly explain why many animals do not show their maximum achievable growth rate. status: publishe...|$|R

Protein enzymes may have come to replace RNA-based ribozymes as biocatalysts because their greater abundance and diversity of monomers makes them more versatile.

Nitrogen fixation is an energy-demanding process requiring tight control of metabolism and redox state. It is of great interest to understand the bacteroid differentiation process and the roles of energy <b>storage</b> <b>molecules,</b> such as glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), in maintaining the Rhizobium-legume symbioses. Traditional biochemical assays for checking phenotypic changes of mutants require a large volume of starting materials, which is difficult for unculturable, terminally differentiated bacteroids.

This work demonstrates the application of single-cell Raman spectra (SCRS) to differentiate Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae wild-type and mutants under different conditions. We found symbiotically differentiated bacteroids and free-living bacteria differed primarily at a Raman biomarker, cytochrome c, corresponding to a bacteroid-specific terminal oxidase. We demonstrated that, for the first time, SCRS were able to link phenotypic changes and specific genetic mutants, in this case, single and double mutations in synthesis of carbon <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).

40|$|Microalgae have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} context of renewable fuel production, due to their ability to produce in high quantities carbon <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> such as lipids and carbohydrates. Despite significant research effort over the last decade, the production yields remain low and need to be optimized. For that, a thorough understanding of carbon storage metabolism is necessary. This paper develops a constrained metabolic model based on the dFBA framework to represent the dynamics of carbon storage in microalgae under a diurnal light cycle. The main assumption here is that microalgae adapt their metabolism in order to optimize their production of functional biomass (proteins, membrane lipids, DNA, RNA) over a diurnal cycle. A generic metabolic network comprised of 160 reactions representing the main carbon and nitrogen pathways of microalgae is used to characterize the metabolism. The optimization problem is simplified by exploiting the right kernel of the stoichiometric matrix, and transformed into a linear program by discretizing the differential equations using a classical collocation technique. Several constraints are investigated. The results suggest that the experimentally observed strategy of accumulation of carbon <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> during the day, followed by their depletion during the night may indeed be the optimal one. However, a constraint on the maximal synthesis rate of functional biomass must be added for consistency with the biological observations...|$|R

5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into <b>storage</b> <b>molecules</b> such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|R

This dissertation prepares and analyzes new heterocyclic rings with a view toward their application for hydrogen storage or pharmaceutical uses. 	Previous studies of ethylene diaminoborane have shown its potential as a hydrogen <b>storage</b> <b>molecule.</b> Using a different purification method from the published literature, a sample of ethylene diaminoborane having a slight impurity was achieved. Analysis of the impurity verified that it is [B 3 H 8]¯ anion, and its effect on the properties of ethylene diaminoborane, such as dehydrogenation, was investigated. The resulting end product upon dehydrogenation of ethylene diaminoborane was characterized as polymers of its heterocycle rings. 	Ethylene diaminoborane is a derivative of ammonia borane, a widely studied hydrogen <b>storage</b> <b>molecule.</b> Two molecules of ammonia borane can isomerize to form diammoniate of diborane. By tethering the two molecules of ammonia borane and allowing isomerization to happen in the gas phase, different charged heterocycles can form.

Using established experience with hydrogen bonding between base pairs, a new heterocycle structure has been designed and synthesized. This molecule was designed to bind to a specific secondary structure, known as i-motif, of single-stranded DNA, which might possibly be found in oncogenes.

Interestingly, after increasing the total solids of sweet whey from the original level of 5 % to 20 - 30 % (w/w), the two probiotic strains had higher final biomass production, instead of being inhibited by the high osmolality. The survival of the probiotics after spray drying was simultaneously improved, as well as during 6 months storage at 4 ºC.
