5000|$|Hughes joined Altec Lansing in May 2002 {{to serve}} as senior {{engineering}} manager in the professional audio division. This included both component-level and overall product engineering for the installation market {{as well as for}} touring systems. While at Altec, Hughes was granted two patents. The first was a patent for the optimum spacing of driver elements in a line array, using a minimum of drivers. This technology, marketed as [...] "InConcert", was at the core of Altec's compact computer speaker system FX 6021, a satellite and subwoofer system which used the patented process for its two satellite speakers, each containing six drivers mounted vertically. The two center drivers covered the frequency range from 150 hertz up to 20 kHz, the next two drivers above and below covered up to 6 kHz, and the top and bottom drivers covered up to 1 kHz. This allowed for good sounding results with six drivers mounted on a columnar surface that could physically accommodate eight or nine. Hughes' third patent, his second with Altec, was a patent for a dipole and monopole surround <b>sound</b> <b>speaker</b> system which used indirectly aimed drivers added {{to the top of the}} usual front left and front right loudspeakers. Altec brought the technology to market as the GT 5051R—a 3.1 system which included a center speaker and a subwoofer. The front left and right speakers bounced surround information off of the walls and ceiling for customers who did not want to clutter their listening space with a pair of rear speakers.|$|E

The goal of this particular set of experiments is to examine if one can use a laser beam to detect a conversation in an office through use of laser light reflection off a window. The experiments use a Michelson interferometer {{where one of the}} mirrors is representative of an office window. The vibrations of the “office window” due to sounds reflecting from it can then be used to detect sound. There are two different experiments we examined.

40|$|Currently, the ITU {{standard}} surround <b>sound</b> <b>speaker</b> {{arrangement is}} based on an irregular 5 speaker array. However, this may change to an irregular 7 speaker array (as is now the standard on computer hardware) or more in the future. The Ambisonic system, pioneered by Micheal Gerzon, among others, in the late 1960 ’s, is very well suited to situations where the end system speaker configuration is not fixed in terms of number or position while also offering a simple way (via energy and velocity vector analysis) of quantifying the performance of such systems. However, while the derivation of the decoders is well documented for regular speaker arrangements [1], optimising the decoders for irregular layouts is not a simple task, where optimisation requires the solution of a set of non linear simultaneous equations, complicated further by the fact that multiple solutions are possible [2]. Craven [3] extended the system to use higher order circular harmonics and presented a 4 th order Ambisonic decoder (9 input channels), although the derivation method used was not presented. In this paper a semi-automated decoder optimisation system using heuristic methods will be presented that will be shown to be robust enough to generate higher order Ambisonic decoders based on the energy and velocity vector parameters. This method is then analytically compared to Craven’s decoder using both energy/velocity vector and head related transfer function based methods...|$|E
40|$|Biometrics {{recognition}} systems {{implemented in}} a realworld environment {{often have to}} be content with adverse biometrics signal acquisition which can vary greatly in this environment. This includes acoustic noise that can contaminate speech signals or artifacts that can alter heart sound signals. In order to overcome these recognition errors, researchers {{all over the world}} apply various methods such as normalization, feature extraction, classification to address this issue. Recently, combining biometrics modalities has proven to be an effective strategy to improve the performance of biometrics systems. The approach in this paper is based on biometrics recognition which used the heart sound signal as a feature that can't be easily copied The Mel- Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used as a feature vector and vector quantization (VQ) is used as the matching model algorithm. A simple yet highly reliable method is introduced for biometric applications. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the Heart <b>Sound</b> <b>Speaker</b> identification (HS-SI) model is 81. 9 % while (S-SI) the rate for the Speech Speaker Independent model is 99. 3 % for a 21 client, 40 imposter database. Heart sound- speaker verification (HS-SV) provides an average EER of 17. 8 % while the average EER for the speech speaker verification model (S-SV) is 3. 39 %. In order to reach a higher security level an alternative to the above approach, which is based on multimodal and a fusion technique, is implemented into the system. The best performance of the work is based on simple-sum score fusion with a pricewise-linear normalization technique which provides an EER of 0. 69 %...|$|E

40|$|Described herein is a {{practical}} experiment in the spontaneous composition of music through real-time interaction between a human composer-performer and a semi-autonomous network of computer processes. A software system called The Duoquadragintapus was devised for this purpose, and used in performance to create and record musical variants of the same name, bounded by the resources and behaviors of generative processes allocated to the system by its author, who also occupies the role of composer-performer when the system is active. The Duoquadragintapus includes pre-composed music that can be incorporated at the whim of its human collaborator, {{as well as a}} number of independent processes designed to transform material derived from live instrumental performance and navigate relationships between live input and pre-rendered output. The human performer has two responsibilities: first, as an improvising instrumentalist, providing raw material for real-time software processes, the functioning of which remain independent of his control during performance; secondly, as a software engineer and composer, determining the boundaries of the system prior to performance and selecting when and how many of the computer system's various process classes are allowed manifest instances during performance. In this version of the The Duoquadragintapus, the performer uses a fretless electric guitar as an input instrument, and music is output through a battery of 32 percussion-playing robots and a 5. 1 surround <b>sound</b> <b>speaker</b> array (though the system can easily be adapted to accommodate other types of input and output). High-level system control originates in MIDI information from the guitar and from a footswitch controller. The major components of the system include signal processing of audio from the guitar, factor oracle generation of accompaniment harmonies, factor oracle selection of pre-composed audio snippets generated via sonification of L-systems, phrase detection and rhythmic interpolation of phrases, a "lockstep" mode in which percussion robots mirror the rhythms played by the guitarist, and pre-scored control of performance variables such as changes in probabilities governing factor oracle traversal, choices for accompaniment voicing, and changes in ownership of parameter control from human to computer...|$|E
40|$|Many virtual environments like {{interactive}} computer games, {{educational software}} or training simulations {{make use of}} speech to convey important information to the user. These applications typically present a combination of background music, sound effects, ambient sounds and dialog simultaneously to create a rich auditory environment. Since interactive virtual environments allow users to roam freely among different sound producing objects, sound designers do not always have exact control over what sounds a user will perceive at any given time. This dissertation investigates factors that influence the perception of speech in virtual environments under adverse listening conditions. A virtual environment was created to study hearing performance under different audio-visual conditions. The two main areas of investigation were the contribution of "spatial unmasking" and lip animation to speech perception. Spatial unmasking refers to the hearing benefit achieved when the target sound and masking sound are presented from different locations. Both auditory and visual factors influencing speech perception were considered. The capability of modern sound hardware to produce a spatial release from masking using real-time 3 D sound spatialization was compared with the pre-computed method of creating spatialized sound. It was found that spatial unmasking could be achieved when using a modern consumer 3 D sound card and either a headphone or surround <b>sound</b> <b>speaker</b> display. Surprisingly, masking was less effective when using real-time sound spatialization and subjects achieved better hearing performance than when the pre-computed method was used. Most research on the spatial unmasking of speech has been conducted in pure auditory environments. The influence of an additional visual cue was first investigated to determine whether this provided any benefit. No difference in hearing performance was observed when visible objects were presented at the same location as the auditory stimuli. Because of inherent limitations of display devices, the auditory and visual environments are often not perfectly aligned, causing a sound-producing object to be seen at a different location from where it is heard. The influence of audio-visual integration between the conflicting spatial information was investigated to see whether it had any influence on the spatial unmasking of speech in noise. No significant difference in speech perception was found regardless of whether visual stimuli {{was presented at the}} correct location matching the auditory position, at a spatially disparate location from the auditory source. Lastly the influence of rudimentary lip animation on speech perception was investigated. The results showed that correct lip animations significantly contribute to speech perception. It was also found that incorrect lip animation could result in worse performance than when no lip animation is used at all. The main conclusions from this research are: That the 3 D sound capabilities of modern sound hardware can and should be used in virtual environments to present speech; Perfectly align auditory and visual environments are not very important for speech perception; Even rudimentary lip animation can enhance speech perception in virtual environments...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a trans-disciplinary and trans-historical {{investigation}} into civilian and battlefield contexts in which speaker systems have been utilised by the military-industrial and military-entertainment complexes to apply pressure to mass social groupings and the individuated body. Drawing on authors such as historian/sociologist Michel Foucault, economist Jacques Attali, philosopher Michel Serres, political geographer/urban planner Edward Soja, musician/sonic theorist Steve Goodman, and cultural theorist/urbanist Paul Virilio, this study engages {{a wide range of}} texts to orchestrate its arguments. Conducting new strains of viral theory that resonate with architectural, neurological, and political significance, this research provides new and original analysis about the composition of waveformed geography. Ultimately, this study listens {{to the ways in which}} the past and current utilisation of sonic, infrasonic, and ultrasonic frequencies as weapons, apparatus for psychological manipulation, and instruments of physiological influence, by industrial, civilian, entertainment, and military organisations, predict future techniques of sociospatialised organisation. In chapter one it is argued that since the inception of wired radio speaker systems into U. S. industrial factories in 1922, the development of sonic strategies based primarily on the scoring of architectonic spatiality, cycles of repetition, and the enveloping dynamics of surround sound can be traced to the sonic torture occurring in Guantanamo Bay during the first decade of the twenty-first century. Exploring the use of surround <b>sound</b> <b>speaker</b> techniques by the FBI during the Waco Siege in Texas, this argument is developed in chapter two. In chapter three it is further contended that the acoustic techniques utilised in the Guantanamo torture cells represent the final modality and the logical conclusion of these strategies that have evolved between civilian and military contexts over the past 80 years. In chapter four, the speaker system instrumentality of the HSS ultrasonic beam - occurring post Guantanamo - comes to symbolise an epistemic shift in the application of waveformed pressure; the dynamics of directional ultrasound technology signalling the orchestration of a new set of frequency-based relations between the transmitter and the receiver, the speaker system and architectural context, and the civilian and war torn environment. The concluding proposition of the study submits that a waveformed cartography - mapping the soundscape's territorialisation by the military-entertainment complex - needs to be composed and arranged so that forms of recording, amplification, and resistance can be made coherent. Given the new set of non-sound politics announced by the HSS, this philosophy of frequency-based mapping will have to re-evaluate the taxonomy and indexical nature of spatial relations. This discipline will be a waveformed psychogeography; a frequency-based modality that heuristically charts the spatial concerns of the neural environment as well as the environs of the material and the built. As a field of research it will have a wide-ranging remit to explore the spatial, psychological, physiological, social, economic, and sexual effects that waveforms have upon our subjectivity. Its methodology - as suggested through the structuring of this study - will be multi-disciplined and multi-channelled. It will create new forms of knowledge about LRADs, iPods, Mosquitos, I ntonarumori, loudhailers, and Sequential Arc Discharge Acoustic Generators - the meta-network of speaker systems through which rhythms and cadences of power are transmitted, connected, and modulated...|$|E
