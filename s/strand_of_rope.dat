40|$|These {{works are}} an {{invitation}} to be present, contemplative, and engage, in the moment. I&rsquo;m interested {{in the notion of}} art being accessible, open and inclusive a possible expression of where one is going rather than where one has been, a breaking with the past, and a chance to explore the unknown, in the present. In an increasingly cerebral world to feel, is almost a luxury and often times an unwelcome one so it seems that a conflict arises between the mind and the heart and this quality of equanimity, becomes increasingly important in life and art. To me the works have been a success if the viewer leaves having genuinely paused in some way, and engaged perhaps stood in an empty space and wondered what was there, taken the time, and perhaps is aware of that sensation of being present. Using the whole space is also important in creating a sense of being immersed, having the works situated at various heights around the room the viewer is lead to bend and engage physically to explore in a more intimate way, also using the light or lack of it to reflect stillness, in the silence of the space. Looking close enough to reveal continuity, in the making, a strength and delicacy of production, and a fragility, that if tampered with would instantly change shape and fall apart, then revealing the impermanence, and illusion that placement provides. Also with the works at various heights around the room it provides a rhythm and continuity of practice, revealing the relationship that each piece has individually to the space and collectively to each other. In doing these repetitive tasks the works grew, in an attempt to explore one-pointedness and consciously bring the meditative process to life through the making of the objects was for me, offering a pathway. In using the Pali names, I was looking to connect the simple English names to the story that language reveals in its purity, Pali being the language before Sanskrit and used in the time of Buddha. I was very pleased to find such relevance and beauty reflected in the basic interpretations such as in &lsquo;Guna&rsquo; meaning a string or cord, my research involved searching through and looking for the Pali equivalent in language to reveal the story of the works in a meditative sense. Yathabhuta which means&rsquo; as it is &lsquo;which to me embodies the acceptance, of the way things are at any given moment and in that moment provides an opening. &lsquo;Guna&rsquo; also meaning a <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> a constituent part of anything, it later came to mean a quality of something, a good quality and later again, &lsquo;you&rsquo;. This makes it possible to date different texts when the word comes up repeatedly in various sutras This also leads me to indigenous Australian Aboriginal culture and the importance of string in ceremony and dally life. The notion of continuous thread, works in progress and ordinary daily life...|$|E

50|$|The {{benefit of}} a common {{whipping}} is that no tools are necessary and the rope {{does not need to}} be unlayed.

50|$|The top is used {{to prevent}} the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> {{twisting}} together prematurely, which {{would lead to the}} rope being loose, allowing it to untwist.

The short upper lip of her large mouth displayed her teeth in an habitual smile, which was in turn so flatly contradicted by every other line of her careworn face that it seemed gratuitously artificial. Her figure was hidden by a shapeless garment that partook equally of the shawl, cloak, and wrapper.|$|R
50|$|A coiled coil is a {{structural}} motif in proteins in which 2-7 alpha-helices are coiled together like the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> (dimers and trimers {{are the most}} common types).

5000|$|Robert Benjamin Lewis held three United States patents, {{making him}} one of the few nineteenth century African American inventors who were able to patent their inventions or {{improvements}} to existing manufacturing processes. In his application for a United States Patent dated April 11, 1836, Lewis stated that “I, Robert Benjamin Lewis of Hallowell, in the county of Kennebec, and state of Maine, have invented a new and useful machine for the picking of oakum and hair.” “Oakum” is defined as “loosely twisted hemp or jute fiber impregnated with tar or a tar derivative.” During the days of the sailing ship, hemp ropes were used as rigging on board. Although coated with pine tar and varnish, the coating would eventually wear out and the rigging would have to be replaced. Since little was wasted, the old rope would be recycled by unraveling the strands until the rope itself was reduced to single threads and then loosely rewound, resulting in “oakum,” which was used to caulk the seams of wooden ships in order to make them watertight. “Picking oakum”—the actual business in unraveling the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> so that they could be prepared for caulking—was a tedious, sticky job generally delegated to those workers lowest in the pecking order. The machine would do the work of the picker—essentially teeth on a cylinder turned by a crank would separate the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the old <b>rope</b> to produce oakum. The patent was awarded on June 25, 1836 [...] The “hair picker” became a mainstay of Maine shipyards, the original design being reworked and refined over the years.|$|R

The iron wire was about two feet long, the continuation to the galvanometer being copper.|$|R
