5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008, MnDOT closed 86 waysides around the state under the {{justification}} that they no longer served a transportation <b>safety</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Two organizations, the Friends of Washington County and the Friends of the St. Croix Boom Site, led a successful campaign to reopen the site. [...] In 2010 MnDOT transferred management of the property to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. [...] In 2014 the two Friends organizations helped gather public input on proposed improvements to the site. [...] Possible additions included an information kiosk, picnic shelters, and an enclosure for the portable toilets, all styled after the Boom Site's logging-era structures.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) <b>safety</b> <b>function</b> which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E

It starts from an ergonomic basis with the purpose of integrating the human functioning modes in this assessment. From such a perspective, it is aimed at: - Defining the drivers needs in safety, and especially the most crucial ones; - Evaluating the capacity of underway <b>safety</b> <b>functions</b> to fulfil these needs (ex ante approach); - Defining the contextual constraints that these functions should take into account in order to maximise their potential safety benefits. It is based on an In-depth study of a wide sample of accident cases (involving 432 drivers) weighted as regard as European statistical data. This study makes use of WP 5 ("Human Factors") methodological results to analyse the potential safety effectiveness of the most promising <b>safety</b> <b>functions</b> defined by WP 6 of the TRACE project. The results underline the relative capacity of the functions to compensate for the drivers' needs and contextual constraints found in accidents.
