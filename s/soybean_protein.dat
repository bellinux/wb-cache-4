40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{water-soluble}} protein fraction of jojoba meal on growth and relative organ weight in rats were tested. Trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) was measured in the untreated water-soluble jojoba proteins and in preparations after dry-heating (100 degrees C, 2 h) or methanol extraction (Soxhlet, 6 h). TIA {{was found in the}} jojoba protein fraction and could not be destroyed by dry-heating or methanol extraction of the jojoba proteins. In the first feeding experiment, growth performance and relative organ weight were compared of young rats fed ad libitum a diet containing either 18 % <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> (C), 6 % <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> (P 6), or 6 % <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> supplemented with 12 % jojoba proteins (JJ) or 12 % toasted jojoba proteins (JJT). In a second 3 week experiment, growth and relative organ weight of young rats receiving a diet containing 6 % <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> supplemented with 12 % methanol-extracted jojoba proteins (JJM) were compared for rats pair-fed with JJM with a diet containing 18 % <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> (PF). Although food intakes of C, JJ, and JJT rats were similar and P 6 rats ate more than C rats, PG, JJ, and JJT rats showed growth retardation compared to C rats. JJM rats and PF rats showed a similar growth. The pancreas was hypertrophied in JJ and JJT rats, compared to C rats, and in JJM rats, compared to PF rats. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was hypertrophied in P 6, JJ, and JJT rats but normal in the JJM group. Jojoba proteins induce growth retardation. This is accompanied by pancreatic and BAT hypertrophy. As trypsin inhibition does not change but growth does ameliorate and BAT hypertrophy is abolished after methanol extraction, trypsin inhibition has no major influence on growth in the present experiments, while BAT hypertrophy is accompanied by growth reduction. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe hypocholesterolemic {{effect of}} {{isolated}} <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins</b> and fenofibrate in rats was compared. Forty-five rats {{were divided into}} five groups: standard (STD; casein), high cholesterol (HC; STD plus 1 % cholesterol/ 0. 5 % cholic acid), HC+β-conglycinin, HC+glycinin and HC+fenofibrate. The proteins and the drug were administered by gavage for 28 days. The proteins decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerol (TG) in the plasma of the rats fed HC diet, to values very close to those fed on fenofibrate. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the plasma were increased by the β-conglycinin, glycinin and fenofibrate groups. The largest TC reduction in the liver was observed in the fenofibrate group; in contrast, the β-conglycinin and glycinin groups exhibited reduced the levels of hepatic TG and TC. Based on these data, {{it could be suggested}} that the oral daily administration of isolated <b>soybean</b> <b>proteins,</b> in the range of 2. 75 % of the protein ingested daily, can promote a reduction in TC and TG in the plasma of rats fed hypercholesterolemic diets...|$|R

50|$|Gelation {{occurs when}} the <b>soybean</b> <b>protein</b> {{subunits}} dissociate, denature then aggregate therefore the protein composition of glycinin and β-conglycinin will determine the gel strength of the final tofu product. Since glycinin and β -conglycinin have different enthalpy of denaturation the gelation mechanisms also differ therefore gelation occurs at two different temperatures, {{it is possible for}} a gel to form at a lower temperature (75 degrees C) if the <b>soybean</b> <b>protein</b> contained a higher composition of the β-conglycinin then glycinin. A study that analyzed isolated proteins different gelation mechanism showed the isolated glycinin formed a coarse gel network with a pore size of 2-3 μm.

It is hypothesized β-conglycinin heat induced gels form as randomly aggregated assembly of clusters that randomly form a gel with a finer dispersed network with a pore size of 0.5-0.6 μm.

50|$|The {{whiteness}} of tofu is ultimately {{determined by the}} soybean variety, <b>soybean</b> <b>protein</b> composition and degree of aggregation of the tofu gel network. The yellowish beige color of soybeans {{is due to the}} color compounds including anthocyanin, isoflavones and polyphenol compounds therefore the soybean variety used can predict the color of the final tofu product. Ways to reduce the yellow color include reducing isoflavone content by changing the pH of the soymilk solution used in the production of tofu so that they precipitate out and are removed during the extraction of okara. The opacity of tofu gel and off-white color typical of standard uncooked firm tofu is due to the scattering of light by the colloidal particles of the tofu. The addition of higher levels of calcium salts and high protein content contributes to forming a denser and more aggregated gel network which disperses more light resulting a tofu with a whiter gel appearance.|$|E

The biochemical composition of soybean molasses and the obtained subfractions were analyzed in detail: Protein, fat, and ash were quantified according to standard methods.
