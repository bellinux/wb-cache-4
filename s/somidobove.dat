40|$|Data on 89 {{multiparous}} Holstein cows {{were used}} to investigate {{the interaction between the}} genetic and nongenetic potentiai of cows and the administration of recombinant bovine somatotropin @ST) on milk yield and composition. Somatotropin was administered to treated cows (n = 50) in a slow-release formulation (<b>Somidobove,</b> Eli Lilly, 640 mg). Untreated cows (n = 39) did not receive any excipient injection. Data on milk yield and composition traits were analysed considering, simultaneously, regressions on cows’s estimated breeding value (EBV) and cows’s environmental ability (CEA) across and within treatment groups. CM was computed for each cow as the deviation of EBV from mature equivalent milk yield and composition. Data analysis provided some evidence of a possible EBV by rbST treatment interaction. Regression coefficients of milk yield on EBV were consistently lower for treated than for untreated cows, although statistical significance was found for fat yield only (P < 0. 05). Results suggest that cows with lower EBV tend to respond better to rbST than cows of higher genetic merit when feed quality is not limiting yield. An implication of this is that, in order to maximize the return from the use of rbST, only cows of low breeding merit should receive rbST treatment, provided that feeding regime is suitabl...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{time-dependent}} model to account for the effects of recombinant bST in a slow-release formulation on short-term (between two consecutive injections) and long-term (baseline of the lactation curve) response of milk yield and composition. Observations on milk yield (n = 8234) and on milk composition (n = 1509) of 196 Holstein Friesian cows were recorded over 1 yr of trial. Treated cows were injected with <b>somidobove</b> at 3 - or 4 -wk intervals. Data were analyzed according to a model that included effect of treatment, parity, interaction, and the random effect of cow; two time-dependent covariables, obtained by the splitting of DIM, were included in the model to account for the effects of bST on short- and long-term responses of milk traits. Cyclical variations of milk yield, protein, and SCC content in the interval between two consecutive injections were detected. Recombinant bST administration also influenced the persistency of milk yield and protein content. Treatment of cows at 3 - and 4 -wk intervals increased yield by 20. 6 and 12. 6 % over those of untreated cows. Nearly 60 % of this increment was due to the short-term effect of bST. Milk composition response to bST was less noticeable...|$|E
40|$|Milk production, plasma bovine {{somatotropin}} (bST) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were measured in dairy cows following a single subcutaneous injection of a slowly released preparation of either recombinant enterokinase linker bST (somidobove: 640 mg) or recombinant methionyl bST (sometribove: 500 mg). There was a 3 - 7 -fold increase in plasma bST concentrations {{during the first}} three postinjection hours in cows treated with both sometribove (from 3. 4 +/- 0. 8 to 11. 2 +/- 3. 0 ng ml(- 1)) or <b>somidobove</b> (from 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 to 17. 5 +/- 2. 6 ng ml(- 1)). In the next 8 days the bST concentration in the bST-treated cows varied, but was still significantly increased above the controls. In the following days, the concentrations of bST did not differ from the controls. Plasma concentrations of IGF-I increased nearly 2 -fold as early as 24 h following recombinant bST administration and then continued to rise so that by 48 h postinjection they were nearly four times higher (control 16. 2, bST-treated 61. 7 ng ml(- 1)). From 48 h after sometribove injection, IGF-I concentrations remained at a plateau (varying between 60. 4 and 85. 7 ng ml-l) till day 11. Then it decreased slowly, but still remained higher on day 14 than those in placebo-treated cows (44. 4 +/- 17. 8 ng ml(- 1) in bST-treated animals; 12. 2 +/- 7. 5 ng ml(- 1) in the controls). Although IGF-I level was increasing in all bST-treated animals, the absolute IGF-I increase was not related to the increase in milk production. status: publishe...|$|E
