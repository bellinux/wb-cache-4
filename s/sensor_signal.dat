50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the main}} problem with any narrow-band O2 sensor is that the ECM only detects that the mixture is slightly richer or leaner than the stoichiometric ratio. The ECM does not measure the operating air-fuel ratio outside the stoichiometric range. In effect it only detects that the mixture is richer or leaner than stoichiometry. An O2 sensor voltage that goes lower than 450 mV will cause a widening of injector pulse and vice versa.

50|$|One {{approach}} to achieving long-term glucose sensing is {{to measure and}} compensate for the changing local oxygen concentration.

A number of different affinity assays have been investigated, with fluorescent assays proving most common. MEMS technology has recently allowed for smaller and more convenient alternatives to fluorescent detection, via measurement of viscosity.

Another possible reason for failure was inadequate preheating of catalysis beds for the pulsing rocket thrusters.

40|$|A {{new method}} for real time {{classification}} of volatile chemical substance traces is presented. The method {{is based on}} electrochemical signals of an array of semiconductor gas sensors. In these <b>sensor</b> <b>signals</b> characteristic patterns of different substances are hidden. There are non-linear correlative relationships between the measured <b>sensor</b> <b>signals</b> and the chemical substances which are treated using two methods derived from statistical learning theory (Support Vector Machine - SVM, Maximum Likelihood Estimation - MLE) {{for the detection of}} the substance characteristics in the <b>sensor</b> <b>signals.</b> A key criterion for the presented pattern recognition is a newly developed type of features, which is specially adapted to the low frequency <b>signals</b> of semiconductor <b>sensors.</b> The presented features are based on the evaluation of the range of the transient response in the <b>sensor</b> <b>signals</b> in the frequency domain. To derive the new features, both real measurement data and synthetic generated signals were used. In the experiments the focus was set on the creation of reproducible <b>sensor</b> <b>signals</b> to get characteristic signal patterns. Synthetic signals were derived from a Gaussian Plume Model. With the new features, training data sets were calculated using the classification methods SVM and MLE. With these training data sets new sensor measurements may be assigned to the substances which are to be sought. The advantage of the presented method is that no feature reduction is needed and no loss of information occurs in the learning process. The classification results based on the new features have been compared with the classification based on a conventional method for feature extraction. It was proved that the recognition rate of the substances used with the new feature type is higher. The substance classification is primarily limited by the sensitivity of the semiconductor sensors, because sufficiently large <b>sensor</b> <b>signals</b> must have been provided to obtain appropriate substance patterns. At the present stage of development the method presented is suitable for the classification of substance groups, such as nitro aromatics or alcohols, but not for specific substances...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{areas of}} failure on this {{transmission}} include damage to plastic internals due to fluid over-temperature conditions, internal fluid pressure leaks from torn piston diaphragms, worn piston bores for solenoids in aluminum valve body, {{and the resulting}} worn clutches and bands. Occasionally, the plastic speedometer drive gear will break and fall off of the differential carrier and the speedometer will stop working. To repair this, the transmission must be removed and the differential disassembled far enough to replace the plastic gear. With age, the resistance in the wiring and/or electrical terminals between the valve body and transmission controller can increase. The additional resistance may prevent the computer from reading the faint pulses from the transmission speed sensors.

5000|$|Another {{component}} of an [...] "intelligent" [...] aircraft structure {{is the ability}} to sense and diagnose potential threats to its structural integrity. This differs from conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) by the fact that Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [...] uses sensors that are permanently bonded or embedded in the structure. Composite materials, which are highly susceptible to hidden internal flaws which may occur during manufacturing and processing of the material or while the structure is subjected to service loads, require a substantial amount of inspection and defect monitoring at regular intervals. Thus, the increasing use of composite materials for aircraft primary structure aircraft components increases substantially their life cycle cost. According to some estimates, over 25% of the life cycle cost of an aircraft or aerospace structure, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production costs, can be attributed to operation and support, involving inspection and maintenance. With sensing technology reducing in cost, size and weight, and <b>sensor</b> <b>signal</b> processing power continuously increasing, a variety of approaches have been developed allowing integration of such sensing options onto or into structural components.|$|E
