5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by <b>softening</b> <b>plant</b> cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E

50|$|Water <b>softening</b> <b>plants</b> were {{installed}} at Helidon and Murphy's Creek, to soften water using lime. This was {{to prevent a}} buildup of scale in locomotive boilers that would shorten the life of boilers. A sand box (shed) was also provided to store sand which had been previously dried in a furnace, as an aid for traction on slippery rails on steep grades and sharp curves of the Main Range section. The sand shed was to replenish a reservoir situated atop the boiler barrel of locomotives (sand dome), and was activated by a lever in the engine cab. Water was pumped from the nearby creek into the storage tank by a steam pump, operated from a stationary boiler.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of base exchange {{which has been}} {{known for a long time}} was first applied by Way (50) in 1850 to the adsorption of cations by soils. However, the discovery of the exchangeability of bases is usually credited to Eichorn (12). Half a century passed before this reaction was put to practical purposes, when in 1906 Gans (16) patented the first commercial application for the use of zeolites in water soften-ing. Since then the development of zeolites has progressed to the point where the use of these inorganic base exchangers is world-wide in scope. Not only are zeolites applied to the softening of industrial waters for laundry, textile, boiler feed, and other purposes, but they are likewise used in domestic and other small-scale water <b>softening</b> <b>plants.</b> In 1938 200, 000 zeolite softeners were in operation throughout the United States (37).

5000|$|Specialist sources {{agree that}} the date the shed opened is unknown. It first appears on an OS map {{published}} in 1888, where {{it seems to have}} had six [...] "roads" [...] (tracks), though all later maps show three tracks under the same general layout. Another source, with local knowledge, states that the shed had six tracks. It had a coaling stage, a turntable and a water tank.

5000|$|The first {{engine shed}} at Lowestoft was a two-road brick {{structure}} {{on the north}} side of the station with a turntable on a separate spur. It lay close to Denmark Road on the site of what was later the goods shed. The shed could only accommodate four locomotives and attracted complaints from local residents due to the smoke from the locomotives. New four-road sheds were built in 1882 at a cost of £5,650 on the north shore of Lake Lothing beyond what later became Coke Ovens Junction. The sheds were fine and ornate in the style of those at Yarmouth Vauxhall and [...] with extravagant brick detail and a vast iron water tank supported by tall vaulting running the width of the shed. The turntable was first on a single spur alongside the yard but later was enlarged to 65 ft and repositioned at the western boundary of the yard.

40|$|Nano{{filtration}} {{has become}} a key filtration process, especially for applications which involve softening, iron removal or organic removal from low salinity feed waters. The unique ability of NF membranes to selectively remove problem compounds or ions, while retaining some hardness is a desirable property for many municipal applications. Recently, new regulations and hybrid plant designs have made it necessary to further improve the properties of NF membranes. One NF family of membranes recently developed and used in large-scale plants is the low fouling ESNA 1 -LF series. These membranes {{have been shown to}} have unique properties, including a smooth surface and more neutral surface charge, which minimizes organic fouling. Additionally, the hardness rejection of this membrane can be tailored to optimum levels for different applications. This membrane series is being used on the 40, 000 m 3 /d Deerfield Beach and the 152, 000 m 3 /d Boca Raton NF plants. These membranes successfully treat water with hardness around 250 mg/L and TOC in the range of 10 - 20 mg/L, producing product water suitable for blending and improving water from chemical <b>softening</b> <b>plants.</b> Operational performance of these plants is presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGlass fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) composite pipes {{are finding}} its increased applications in variety of engineering {{applications such as}} water <b>softening</b> <b>plants,</b> desalination plants, paper mill industry, marine water treatments. However, the users of FRP are facing difficulties to machine it, because of fiber de-lamination, fiber pull out, short tool life, matrix de-bonding and formation of powder like chips. The present investigation focuses {{on the effect of}} process parameters for surface roughness of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite pipes. Experiments were conducted based on the high speed turning centre (CNC) using poly-crystalline diamond (PCD) tool. The process parameters considered were cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, and work piece type (E-Glass mat and E-Glass woven specimen). Both pipes are fabricated using the filament winding process. The pipe consists of 70 percent epoxy polyester resin and 30 percent glass fiber. A comparative study has been undergone between the E-Glass woven and E-Glass mat fiber reinforced composite material. The mechanical properties were also conducted as per ASTM standards. Based on the results, it was observed that good machinability was obtained at lower cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut for mat fiber reinforced GFRP pipe and at high cutting speed, lower feed rate, depth of cut for mat fiber reinforced GFRP pipe...|$|R

Arguments for and against it continued with the Board voting to delay building until 1938 and further delayed by World War II.In 1929, the Hazen water tower, Des Moines only water tower, 110 feet high was constructed of concrete and steel, holding 2 million gallons of water. In 1931, the benefit of fluoride in preventing tooth decay opened a controversy for three decades.Between 1933 and 1935, during the Great Depression, about 3500 men could not pay their water bills, and Denman offered them work often for several days, laying water mains, grade park roads, inspect hydrants. Seven thousand plantings of trees and shrubs were made yearly from seedlings grown in the greenhouse.In 1942, DMWW bought 650 acres of farmland southwest of Des Moines to build an emergency reservoir, the Dale Maffitt Reservoir, which was opened for fishing in 1948. In 1945, another flood and in 1947 a record-breaking flood occurred.

5000|$|Another Act of Parliament was {{obtained}} in 1915, and a Board of Trade Order to temporarily increase charges {{for the water}} supplied in 1919. In 1921, they obtained a further Act, which authorised the construction of wells and boreholes, together with a filtration plant and a <b>softening</b> <b>plant</b> on land they already owned in Cheam. From the works, a new pipeline led to a service reservoir {{on the east side}} of Cheam Warren. It included clauses to allow them to alter and vary the charges made, without the need for further Parliamentary sanction, thus fomalising the Order of 1919, to raise additional capital, and to alter any of the provisions of all of the previous Acts and Orders which governed their operation. The main purpose of an Act obtained in 1929 was to restructure the way in which the company was financed, and to allow them to raise additional capital. They also wanted to increase the amount of water they could abstract from the Cheam wells, by removing a provision of their 1921 Act. Other changes included a provision to collect water rates in advance, to allow them to supply water to [...] "caravans, shacks, huts, tents" [...] and other similar structures, and to charge for water by volume when it was supplied to certain types of building.|$|E
50|$|Host {{plants for}} the swede midge include cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, {{kohlrabi}} {{and a number}} of wild plants in the brassica family including shepherd’s purse, field penny-cress, field peppergrass and yellow rocket. When a seedling or young plant is attacked, the larvae conglomerate and secrete saliva which <b>softens</b> the <b>plant</b> cuticle and epidermis, sucking in the resulting fluid. On a leaf stalk, this damages the tissues and results in the formation of a corky gall. The undamaged side of the stalk continues to grow normally which results in twisting and distortion. The growing point can be completely killed and secondary bacterial infections can occur. If the infection occurs in the flowering stage of cauliflower, it causes a stunted, multi-branched, tuft-like appearance of the flower-head.|$|R

40|$|At {{the water}} {{treatment}} plant in Dunedin, Florida, reverse osmosis membranes remove the hardness from groundwater sources. Reverse osmosis membranes remove salts, pathogens, and organics from the feed water but can create an aggressive permeate. The membranes strip most ions {{in the process and}} the resulting permeate, if not subjected to blending on post treatment, has a tendency to leach metals from lead and copper pipes in the distribution networks. To prevent such problems, the permeate needs to be blended with partially treated raw water or to be chemically treated to re-mineralize and add alkalinity back into the water. In the last decade nanofiltration treatment has gained an increasing foothold in the water treatment industry especially as a water softener. Although nanofiltration membranes also have a high removal rate for organics and pathogens, the separation process is more selective towards multivalent ions (e. g., Ca²?, and Mg²?) than monovalent (e. g., Na?) ions. Most membrane <b>softening</b> <b>plants</b> blend minimally treated raw water with the membrane permeate as a means to reduce the aggressiveness of the water. However, blending can cause issues with disinfection byproducts and pathogen re-introduction. With nanofiltration membranes, fewer mono-valent ions are rejected which creates a more stable permeate and can reduce the blended water ratio. Since it is unlikely that most plants that use membrane filtration for water softening will be able to stop blending entirely, any improvement or sustainability of water quality at a reduced blend ratio should be viewed favorably within the water treatment industry. The study evaluates three nanofiltration membranes: TFC-SR, NF- 90, and ESNA 1 -LF in relation to the reverse osmosis TFC-S RO membrane currently in use at Dunedin. Water flux and salt rejection of the permeate water were compared using solutions of NaCl, MgSO 4 and CaCl 2. Since the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) {{is one of the main}} tests of the blended finished water and is used to judge water quality prior to its release into the distribution system, this study created a 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 100 % blend ratio for each membrane to compare and contrast the change in the LSI. The TFC-SR membrane showed the most promise in lowering the blend ratio while improving the aggressiveness of the finished water by showing a lower rejection for divalent ions. The TFC-SR membrane also showed an improvement in the LSI relative to the other membranes over the total range of blend ratios...|$|R
