Tales from the morgue… (A look at some of the stories that made the news ‘back-in-the-day’ with Clifford Stanley) Wedding of the year ANOTHER strange ‘wedding’ …. an all men affair… sent the down-town Charlestown area into a furore on Friday night as thousands blocked the traffic to get a glimpse of the ‘yellow tie’ men. The cutting of the three-tier cake was carried out without police intervention, unlike the last time when they were arrested and charged. The ‘bride’ and ‘groom’ kissed afterwards. Most of the notable characters, including ‘Anna’, ‘Miss Tiger Bay’, ‘Miss Ann’s Grove’, ‘Miss Bougala’, ‘Lady Cross Street’, ‘Countess of Berbice’, ‘Princess Desiree’, ‘Lady Ivlor’, ‘The Princess Royal of Essequibo’ and ‘Miss Hadfield Street’ were in attendance as bridesmaids. They displayed the latest fashions in headwear, shoes and dresses, causing spectators to gasp as they wended their way up to the reception hall on Russell Street. The ‘bride’ wore white chantilly lace over <b>slipper</b> <b>satin.</b> ‘Her’ headdress was a coronet of seed pearls. ‘She’ was bedecked with diamante necklace and earrings to match. The wedding portrait was taken at Lees Photo Studio of High Street, where mounted Police were called out to control the huge crowd which was gathered there. Later, two platoons of riot squad men were rushed to the wedding reception area to ease a traffic jam. (Guiana Graphic: Page One, July 12, 1959) Editor’s Note: Does anyone know whether any of these ‘girls’ are still alive? If so, do drop us a line...|$|E

40|$|My work {{is about}} discovery: an {{exploration}} of colors, patterns and the language of paint. By working from objects of femininity such as makeup and clothing, I’m investigating how illusion functions in society {{as well as how}} functions in the simplistic sense of handling paint. I am intrigued by how paint can be manipulated to create a reality that only exists on the surface of a painting. I am fascinated with the appeal of beauty and illusion. While some are absolutely disgusted with society’s standards of a woman’s obligation towards her appearance, others find it a magnificent treat to play with makeup, clothes, and jewelry. I have deliberately chosen to work with colors and patterns that evoke a sense of playfulness. My paintings and drawings salute the nature of dress up, reflecting the delight one finds sequined <b>slippers,</b> <b>satin</b> dresses, and gold high-heeled shoes...|$|R
