The following month saw the last KC-135 depart and after 41 years, Loring AFB officially closed on 30 September 1994.|$|E

5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened.

Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said <b>so</b> <b>did</b> not know what they were talking about.|$|E

5|$|As {{political}} awareness among the black majority {{on the island}} spread, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> {{the need}} for new {{aircraft}} and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955. The B-36's were not actually equipped to perform aerial refueling, so the planes supported other units until the arrival of the B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E

5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> the visibility of LGBT fans. At least {{as early as the}} 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> the relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which {{were to be}} remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

She remained in the French Navy's inventory until 1922, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942.

He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
