DZ 417 G alloy with different element <b>V</b> <b>contents</b> was smelted, then tested the mechanical properties and observed microstructure. The results show that {{with the increase of}} element <b>V</b> <b>content,</b> the morphology of rod type M 23 C 6 carbides turned into block-type MC carbides, the size of carbides became bigger, and the amount of carbides decrased, but the dispersion degree of carbide in the matrix was increased. The alloy tensile strength and plastic properties were increased at high temperature with the increment of <b>V</b> <b>content.</b> There were finer dimple structures on the tensile rupture fracture surface of the alloy with high element V than the alloy with low element V under the high temperature conditions. The results of creep rupture life tests show that with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content</b> the creep rupture life increased at the test condition of 760 ℃, 725 MPa. The creep rupture life is 90 h of the alloy with 0. 62 % <b>V</b> element <b>content,</b> and the creep rupture life increased to more than 245 h when the element <b>V</b> <b>content</b> increased to 0. 96 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substitution}} of V for Co {{on the structure}} and magnetic properties of Nd 2 Co 17 xVx compounds (x 0; 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2) has been investigated by means of XRD and magnetic measurements. It is found that all compounds with x from 0 to 2 are almost single phase with the Th 2 Zn 17 -type of structure. The lattice constants a; c and the unit-cell volume V show a tendency to increase with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content.</b> The Curie temperature decreases linearly with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content</b> {{at a rate of}} 240 K per V atom substituted in Nd 2 Co 17. A spin reorientation is observed in all compounds investigated and the spin-reorientation temperature Tsr changes from 147 K for x 0 to 474 K for x 1 : 0 and is almost independent of the <b>V</b> <b>content</b> above x 1 : 0 : The saturation magnetization Ms of Nd 2 Co 17 xVx compounds and the Co moment mCo in these compounds decreases monotonically with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content.</b> r 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{ground state}} {{properties}} of β and ω phases in Ti-(0 – 30  at%) V alloys were calculated, and subsequently thermodynamics and energy barriers of the displacive β to ω transition were investigated by first-principles. The {{results show that}} the lattice parameters of β and ω phases decreases with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content</b> in Ti-V alloys. The principal lattice strains for the β to ω transition are highly compositional dependent, and the volume variation decreases with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content.</b> The mechanical stability of the ω phase increases initially at the <b>V</b> <b>content</b> around 10  at% and then decreases with increasing <b>V</b> <b>content.</b> Based on the quasiharmonic Debye model, a metastable diffusionless phase diagram has been established, showing that the ω phase is thermodynamically more stable than the β phase at room temperature, anticipating a spontaneous transition from β to ω phases in Ti-V alloys. The calculations of energy pathways indicate that there is an energy barrier during the displacive β to ω transition in Ti-V alloys at temperatures from 100 to 500  K, but not at 0  K...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} TaVN {{composite}} films with different <b>V</b> <b>contents</b> were fabricated by magnetron sputtering technique. The microstructures, mechanical properties, friction properties at different temperatures were investigated by X-ray diffraction, nano-indentation, CSM high-temperature ball-on-disc tribo-meter, respectively. The {{results show that}} the microstructure of TaVN films has fcc structure. With <b>V</b> <b>content</b> increasing, the preferential orientation changes from (111) to (200), and the hardness increases to a peak value (32. 3 GPa) and then decreases. At room temperature, the friction coefficient of TaVN films decreases as <b>V</b> <b>content</b> increases, which {{may be related to the}} formation of V 2 O 5. When the temperatures increase from room temperature to 800 ¡æ, the friction coefficient increases and then decreases. The friction mechanisms of TaVN composite films and TaN film at high temperature are compared based on the crystal chemistry theory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOwing {{to their}} bcc {{structures}} {{and the low}} lattice misfit with MgO, FeV alloys are interesting for MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions. We use vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance to measure the magnetization, anisotropy, exchange stiffness, and damping of epitaxial FeV/MgO thin alloys of various <b>V</b> <b>contents.</b> The low magnetization, very high exchange stiffness (23 pJ/m) and very low effective damping (< 0. 0026) of the alloy with 20 % <b>V</b> <b>content</b> makes it an interesting candidate for spin torque applications. The ultralow damping {{is consistent with a}} spin-orbit origin, which sheds light on the possible strategies to reduce the damping in alloys...|$|R
