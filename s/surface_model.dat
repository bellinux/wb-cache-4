The original model can still be glimpsed briefly in the first film. Over Christmas 2001 the crew proceeded to reanimate all the previous shots accordingly within two months. Another problem was that the crew realized that the cast performed better in the versions of the film with Serkis. In the end, the CG Gollum was often animated on top of these scenes and Serkis would be painted out. Due to Gollum not being human, shots such as him crawling down a sheer cliff were shot with no live reference. Serkis also did motion-capture for the character which would drive the body of the model, whilst animators did all fingers and facial animation. Gino Acevedo supervised realistic skin tones, which for the first time used subsurface scattering shader, taking four hours per frame to render. Render time refers to the amount of time it took the computer to process the image into a usable format; it does not include the amount of time it took the texture artists to [...] "draw" [...] the frame. The hair dynamics of CG Gollum in The Two Towers were generated using Maya Cloth. Because of its technical limitations, Weta subsequently moved to the Syflex system for The Return of the King.|$|E

Surface extraction suffers from various effects of medical imaging, segmentation, and surface extraction techniques which cause visual disturbing surface artifacts (e. g. stairs, plateaus).

40|$|AbstractA {{software}} tool for earth <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> {{of climate change}} through high-accuracy and high-speed methods are presented here. Environmental variables including temperature, rainfall and soil property constitute critical driving factors of ecosystem modeling. However, {{there are a couple}} of challenges behind modeling environmental factors including heterogeneity of multiple data sets. To handle compatibility between heterogeneous data sets, the modeling process need to represent environmental data in grid cells with earth <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> However, there are error problems in classical methods of <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> Furthermore, there is still limited experience in developing multi-scale <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> tool of climate change for ecosystem modeling. High-accuracy and high-speed methods for <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> (HASM) were used to solve error problems, improve the accuracy of spatial distribution simulation of environmental variables and handling muti-scale information. However, HASM which is more theoretically perfect and more complicated than other classical methods of <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> This tool decompose the HASM modeling process into several components including HASM initial field, HASM optimistic controller and HASM iterative solver. HASM can opt remote sensing images or existing short precision grid data for initial field and can also simulate filed when lacking of initial fields. HASM optimistic controller need to get knowledge from environmental database to generate controlling condition rulers ensuring modeling more reasonable and more precision. HASM iterative solver is responsible for solution of HASM by means of integration of various solve methods which we have developed. Rather than linking environmental data with these modeling components, a supermatic <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> approach ensuring effective information exchange components is also designed for HASM. This software is easily applied to the development of ecosystem <b>modeling</b> integrated with <b>surface</b> <b>modeling.</b> This study from this integration is also helpful for future researches that aim to integrate <b>surface</b> <b>modeling</b> and ecosystem modeling...|$|R

Since the early 1960 s, people have started to use computers to support the design of curves and surfaces. The increasing computing power and the increasing potential of graphical hardware {{in the last decade}} has opened many new possibilities for Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). Especially the field of curve and <b>surface</b> <b>modelling</b> is rapidly evolving. This is reflected in the recently started series called'Geometric Design Publications'that contains several books on curve and <b>surface</b> <b>modelling.</b> The most important applications of curve and <b>surface</b> <b>modelling</b> are found in industrial design, for instance in the automobile, aerospace and shipbuilding industries. An often encountered application is the interpolation and approximation of data with B-splines and Bézier curves and surfaces or other representation schemes. Another related application is variational curve and <b>surface</b> <b>modelling,</b> where one is looking for smooth curves and surfaces that satisfy a number of geometric constraints...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of digital <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> from stereo imagery is a well-understood procedure that {{is central to}} digital photogrammetric processing. Recently, however, attention {{has focused on the}} {{creation of}} <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> from high resolution satellite imagery, which is not quite so straightforward due to the specific attributes of spaceborne imaging systems, and the fact that some data suppliers do not release details of the sensor and camera models. This paper describes a matching procedure for creating digital <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> (DSMs) from stereo imagery acquired by the high resolution Ikonos satellite. Central to this matching procedure are the geometric constraints that are commonly used to reduce the search space and hence constrain the matching solution. Results are presented of the use of two different geometric constraints (one image space constraint, and one object space constraint) applied to two very different Ikonos stereopairs. A range of digital <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> were created, which, when compared to reference data, showed height differences of less than a few metres. Furthermore, visual evaluation of the resulting <b>surface</b> <b>models</b> showed that both geometric constraints yielded a good representation of the true surface. 1...|$|R
