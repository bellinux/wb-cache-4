During the day, the family thinks <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>lazy</b> because she sits around doing nothing ("She sits, and sits, and sits, and sits. And that's what makes a Gumbie Cat...") but {{when they go to}} sleep, she goes to work, forcing the mice to learn music, crocheting, and tatting. She even thinks the cockroaches need employment to counter their destructive habits, and so she created a beetles tattoo, teaching them how to tap dance. She is also very protective of the kittens and she will not let any of them touch Grizabella when she shows up. In the end, she finally touches and accept Grizabella back into the tribe.|$|E

Unlike the rest of the family, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>lazy,</b> conceited, insulting, and selfish, but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring. She started dating Kyle in season 2. As of season three, she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work. Later that same season, she begins an online clothing business, selling her self-designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents' house.

Up until she turned 21, a running gag on the show was Mike, Vanessa, and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy's hand, usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse.|$|E
50|$|At {{one point}} Amos becomes very angry with his wife, {{who has taken}} money from him. He climbs Mt. Monadnock and does not leave until he gets an answer from God. Eventually he {{receives}} his answer and climbs back down, then forgives his wife as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> sorry for stealing his money. She had done it {{to keep him from}} helping a woman named Lois who needed help to keep her children from being taken away. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>lazy</b> and would not support her children, but Amos had pity on her.

50|$|After {{becoming}} a widow, she grew {{more and more}} eccentric. She went to bed in the morning, {{got up in the}} evening, ate breakfast at night, and drove around in a carriage through the streets, in the courtyard, or wandered around the corridors of the sleeping castle with a light. An anecdote illustrates this: in 1843, a palace guard saw the Queen fully dressed on the palace balcony {{in the middle of the}} night. When he came home to his wife, he told her that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lazy</b> in comparison to the Queen, who had gotten up hours before sunrise. He thought the Queen Dowager was up earlier than anyone else in town, but in fact, she had not yet gone to bed‚Äîshe would eventually get up from bed at three or four in the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Anna {{moves to}} a city and goes {{to work at a}} {{confectionery}} factory. Anna's income improves, but this does not change her views on life - <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still <b>lazy,</b> indifferent to the surrounding world and people, and does not strive to further expand her horizons. Anna becomes a classical example of the petty bourgeois; a self-centered woman whose whole existence is reduced to the purpose of accumulating material wealth and the creation of personal comfort.|$|R
50|$|Rachel {{discovers that}} when she is fifteen, she may be allowed to train for {{something}} else; this excites her, and she vows to send Hilary to the Royal Ballet School {{as soon as she}} can. In the meantime she works hard in her own dancing, but she is still disliked by her aunt as she is not enthusiastic and even her best efforts do not make her, though competent, a good dancer. Dulcie, meanwhile, gains a license to work as soon as she is twelve and immediately stars in a continuous line of pantomime, television and musicals. This gives her an air of unbearable conceit, and she goes through a phase of thinking nobody can dance, act or sing better than she can. Rachel soon follows, and is very much the opposite; she hates being onstage and is happy to be an understudy, and detests her uncomfortable Wonder uniform. Hilary gains a job as Dulcie's understudy, and it is clear that she rivals Dulcie as both an actress and dancer and outshines her completely in comedic value. This begins to scare Dulcie, who wonders if her position as a star is as stable as she believed. However, Hilary is unlike Dulcie in that although she loves dancing, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>lazy</b> and dislikes putting great effort into anything.|$|E
40|$|Advisors: Eui-Kyung Shin. Committee members: Joseph Flynn; Robert T. Self. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} constructed {{image of a}} female teacher protagonist as seen in Hollywood school films. School films of the previous century mostly depicted either a male super hero teacher or a helpless, scared educator girl. The former is unattainable, the later is undesirable. However more recently, school films are presenting a completely different image of a female teacher that is neither heroic nor naive; rather, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>lazy,</b> unhappy, and completely disheartened with her profession. For {{the purposes of this}} study, three films: Won't Back Down (2012), Larry Crowne (2011), and Bad Teacher (2011) were divided into a five act structure based on the syntactic patterns present in school films: 1) establishing character at school, 2) establishing character at home, 3) teaching examples prior to change, 4) teaching examples after change, and 5) conclusion/suggestion of a new life. The characterization of each protagonist within the five acts was abstracted using James Phelan's (1989) concepts of character dimension and character function. Elements of mise-en-scene (setting, costume/makeup, lighting, staging and performance) were added to Phelan's concept of character dimension to layer a visual analysis on top of the plot progression. Screen captures from the five acts of each film provide the mise-en-scene for analysis and evidence of mimetic, synthetic, and thematic components of characterization. Given theoretical frameworks of both narratology and feminist/post-feminist theory, thematic coding reveals five themes in Hollywood's modern depiction of a female teacher: 1) Low Enthusiasm with Even Lower Expectations, 2) Without an Incentive, Students are Insignificant, 3) Boyfriend/Husband/Father Knows Best, 4) the Only Real Advancement is in Attitude, and 5) Feminism is Flexible. The conclusion of this dissertation provides a comparison between the characterization of Nona Alberts of Won't Back Down, Mercedes Tainot of Larry Crowne, and Elizabeth Halsey of Bad Teacher and the masculinized teacher heroes who fought for the rights of their students in earlier school films.

60|$|That never-ending question, whether {{what became}} the Colonel's {{daughter}} became the clergyman's wife, would crop up under endless forms. Rosamond, in all opinions, was good-natured and easy, and always for pardon and toleration to an extent that the Compton code could not understand. She could not bear that anybody should be punished or shut out of anything; while {{there was no denying}} that, now the first novelty <b>was</b> passing, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very <b>lazy</b> as to her parochial work, and that where her feelings <b>were</b> not stirred <b>she</b> <b>was</b> of little use.|$|R

Obsessed with boys, fashion, and shopping, 14-year-old Jeri regards Teena's youthful innocence with disdain, and the two frequently bicker over household habits such as bathroom access. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as a stereotypical dumb blonde, the character most often oblivious to Teena's sarcastic barbs. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> also <b>lazy,</b> preferring to sleep in until noon on weekends and arguing often with her mother about the messy state of her bedroom.

5000|$|Hillenbrand {{experienced}} the sudden onset of a then unknown sickness at 19. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{a sophomore at}} Kenyon College. Up until the devastating symptoms struck, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> an avid tennis player, cycled in the nearby country and played football on the quad. One day driving back to school from spring break, she became violently ill. Three days later, she could hardly sit {{up in bed and}} had {{to drop out of school}} soon after because she could not make the walk to classes. She shuttled from doctor to doctor for a year before being diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome at Johns Hopkins. <b>She</b> said it <b>was</b> the most hellish year of her life. Because the name of her illness does not represent the extent of the disease, in 2011 Hillenbrand said of her diagnosis:This is why I talk about it. You can‚Äôt look at me and say I‚Äôm lazy or that this is someone who wants to avoid working. The average person who has this disease, before they got it, we <b>were</b> not <b>lazy</b> people; it‚Äôs very typical that people were Type A and hard, hard workers. I was that kind of person. I was working my tail off in college and loving it. It‚Äôs exasperating because of the name, which is condescending and so grossly misleading. Fatigue is what we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb.Unfortunately, Hillenbrand's family and friends did not understand her sickness and pulled away, leaving Hillenbrand to battle a terrifying unknown disease on her own. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> met with ridicule and told <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lazy</b> during the first ten years of her sickness.
