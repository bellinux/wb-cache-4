40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the ability of}} a new policy to reduce bycatch of red snapper by the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Mexico: Fractional License (FL) as proposed by Townsend (1992). The policy is evaluated both theoretically and using a simulation model. FL program represents a promising approach to effort reduction and the related problem of bycatch. A 40 percent FL rate, which could obtain a stock effect similar to the current required bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) policy, would reduce real effort by 21 percent. Our simulation finds that a FL program results in positive effects both to the producer surplus of the <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels</b> and to the stock effects of red snapper fishery, while BRDs decrease the producer surplus of <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|E

An assumption that the TED regulations resulted in decreased production aggravated this condition and the change in Ending Net Worth and Net Present Value of Ending Net Worth before and after a TED was placed in the net was significant at the 5 percent level. However, the difference in the Internal Rate of Return for the TED and non-TED simulations was not significant unless the TED caused a substantial change in catch.

S. southeastern region and associated fishing practices are provided in relation to an environmentally sound and economically driven approach to resource conservation. Beginning in 1992, fishery observers were placed aboard commercial vessels in the southeastern shrimp fishery. From 1993 through 1995 the program expanded to include reef fish vessels in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), and during 2004 and 2005 skimmer trawl vessels in coastal Louisiana. Data from 27, 868 tows were collected aboard <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels.</b> Total catch rates in kilograms per hour were 30. 8 in the Gulf, and 27. 7 in the southeastern Atlantic. In the Gulf, finfish comprised 65 % of the total weight, with penaeid shrimp at 16 %, nonpenaeid shrimp crustaceans at 13 %, non-crustacean invertebrates at 4 %, and debris at 1 %. In the southeastern Atlantic, finfish accounted for 47 %, with penaeid shrimp at 24 %, invertebrates at 18 %, crustaceans at 8 %, and debris at 3 %. In the Gulf, finfish catch rates by weight were significantly higher in Alabama/Mississippi and Louisiana as compared with Texas and Florida. Shrimp catchper- unit-effort (CPUE) was significantly higher off Texas. For all states areas, higher shrimp catch rates occurred in nearshore waters. Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) CPUE was significantly higher off Texas in offshore waters during September through December. Assessment of the directed commercial reef fish fishery revealed relatively low release mortality. Based on surface release observations of under-sized target and unwanted species, the majority of fish were released alive with release mortality ranging from approximately 2 % to 5 % for all gear types. Five hundred forty-eight sea turtle captures were documented aboard commercial <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels</b> from 1992 through 2005. Ratio estimation reflected higher catch rates in nets not equipped with turtle excluder devices (TEDs).

The effort in the last years was low due to high cost of oil and low marketing prize of <b>shrimp.</b> <b>Vessels</b> were around 17 in 2005 against 50 in 2004. In 2006 and 2007 there were even fewer vessels fishing for shrimp due to economic reasons. Nominal catch was 32 000 tons in 2005 as compared to 45 500 tons in 2004. The catch in 2007 is only 5 700 tons to 1 September. Noting the lack of reports on catch this figure might increase considerably.

Major {{factors that influence}} dolphin distribution, critical for conservation concerns, are still poorly understood even for the bottlenose dolphin, the best-studied cetacean. To establish the environmental conditions that best predict occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and high feeding densities in Galveston Bay, I conducted a total of 367 boat surveys in five locations of the estuary, totaling 3, 814. 77 km of search effort. I counted groups of dolphins and measured surface water temperature, salinity, turbidity, total number of boats, <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels,</b> and number of seabirds. Using geospatial tools, these data [...] along with location, distance to the Gulf of Mexico and water depth [...] were analyzed on a 500 - m resolution grid. Temporal factors at daily and seasonal scales were also examined. Occurrence was modeled using a Generalized Additive Model and core feeding densities (i. e., feeding densities above 2 SD of the mean) were modeled with a Generalized Linear Model. A total of 1, 802 dolphins in 262 groups were detected, 56. 87 % of which were feeding. I found that all factors except warm/cold seasons and turbidity were useful to predict dolphin distribution, which was related non-linearly to most predictors. Fewer variables were relevant in predicting core feeding densities. These were, in decreasing order of relevance, distance to the Gulf of Mexico, surface water temperature, depth, number of boats, and warm/cold seasons. Feeding was highly clustered and the main core areas, less than approximately 3 km 2 wide, were stable across time of day and season. The majority of the occurrences (86. 2 %) and feeding groups (94 %) were situated in two bay locations - Galveston Ship Channel (GSC) and Bolivar Roads (BRD) - that amounted to only one- fifth of the surveyed area. Compared to conditions in GSC and BRD when no dolphins were sighted, feeding cores weredeeper and more seabirds were observed.

40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. In the fall of 2013, a NIOSH contractor conducted dock side surveys to identify three of the most common drum winches used on Gulf of Mexico side-trawl <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels.</b> The survey identified particular main-winches for guarding: the McElroy/Catchot 505, and 503 and the Stroudsburg 515 1 / 2 T winches. NIOSH engineers designed standardized stationary guarding for each identified main-winch and built initial prototype guards for each model to be sea-tested. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners to test the guard designs on each type of winch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet is diverse, both geographically and culturally. NIOSH sought to find boat owners from the various cultural groups to collaborate with the winch-guard testing. Three working side-trawl shrimp boats were chosen as test vessels operating out of Dulac, LA, Port Arthur, TX and Chauvin, LA. NIOSH has completed initial designs for stationary-winch guards for three of the most commonly used models of winches currently used by the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested winch guard design plans will also be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites.

40|$|Due to the {{technological}} improvements {{of the last}} two decades, it is possible for innovations to follow each other rapidly. However, not all innovations are useful ones, and a lot of producers often {{do not know how to}} market their new products. Diffusion theory, started by Gabriel Tarde (1903), first proposed the S-shaped diffusion curve. After this research few investigations followed until 1943. In this year Bryce Ryan and Neal Gross published their study about innovation diffusion. This led to an enormous overflow of publications. Later, Rogers (2003) contributed additional research and many others followed him. ^ When an individual or a company comes up with a new idea, they want this idea to be adopted by all potential users as soon as possible. This spreading of an innovation is called diffusion. According to Rogers (1995) diffusion is: “The process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system”. Therefore, an innovator should spread this message by multiple channels to inform as many people as possible who could be interested in this new idea. When this is done properly, one is able to follow the adoption process and can determine if the innovation is rejected or adopted. So, diffusion is the adoption process of the population. ^ Fisheries bycatch is considered the most serious global threat to marine species, particularly sea turtles. During the past 20 years, the use of different types of fishing gear, especially pelagic longlines (Carranza et al. 2006, Pradhan 2 ̆ 6 Leung 2006, Swimmer et al 2005), have reduced the population of sea turtles and other marine fauna (Peckham et al 2007, Bugoni et al 2008, Alfaro Shingueto et al 2010) due mainly to bycatch (Broderick et al 2006). As a result these species have become subject to intensive conservation efforts. ^ One of our research questions when examining circle hooks was: which factors influence an individual to try a new fishing gear device? Considerable research indicates that attitudes towards an adoption of change are influenced by a number of community and individual level variables (Rogers 2003). Adoption research methods attempt to predict behavior regarding innovations as perceived by potential adopters by assessing acceptability of innovations (Tango-Lowy 2 ̆ 6 Robertson 2002). This technology was introduced to reduce the consequences of fisheries bycatch. ^ In order to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in commercial fisheries, NOAA has been studying the efficacy of Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRD) such as circle hooks (CH). Alongside other international agencies, NOAA has supported training and outreach efforts to spread knowledge of proper baiting and hooking techniques since the mid- 90 s. The circle hook NOAA advocates is less likely to be swallowed by sea turtles, reducing the risk of drowning. ^ As a consequence of those findings, the circle hook was introduced in Latin America to replace traditional J-shaped hooks with the purpose of reducing sea turtle bycatch. To see the effects of this BRD on sea turtles in the artisanal long line fisheries of Ecuador, a joint venture project started in 2003 amongst the following agencies: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC); the World Wild Fund (WWF); the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC); NOAA; the Ocean Conservancy; the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC); and the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Foundation of Japan (OFCF Japan). In addition to the support of these agencies, this program received support from the Ecuadorian government and local organizations, such as: the Undersecretariat of Fishery Resources (SRP); the “Programa Nacional de Observadores Pesqueros de Ecuador” (PROBECUADOR); the “Asociación de Exportadores de Pesca Blanca” (ASOEXPEBLA); the “Federación Nacional de Cooperativas de Pescadores en el Ecuador” (FENACOPEC); the “Escuela de Pesca del Pacífico Oriental” (EPESPO) of Manta; and the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL). All gave their support and participated in different activities, especially training workshops that educated local fishermen concerning circle hooks and trained fishermen in their use. This program grew to become a region-wide bycatch network and the largest regional artisanal fisheries conservation program in Latin America. ^ In order to understand the factors influencing an individual to try a new fishing gear, this study augments existing literature on adoption and diffusion, providing evidence of the importance of learning from individual perceptions regarding the adoption of new technologies. The goals of this study are to determine whether the initiative to promote circle hooks and turtle exclusion devices as turtle conservation tools is well perceived by fishers, and also to learn from them if they significantly reduce or do not reduce the capture and mortality of sea turtles. ^ Although this study has focused on potential issues related to adoption and diffusion of two bycatch reduction devices, there is no doubt that these fishing technologies can be successfully applied as a partial solution to the problem of sea turtle bycatch. Nevertheless, it is through the recognition of potential sociocultural factors and taking steps toward their solution that we can facilitate successful technology transfer wherever and whenever it is needed. ^ The first chapter attempts to identify perceptions of fishers in the transfer technology that affect an individual’s willingness to accept an innovation. Rogers’ theoretical framework forms the basis for adoption research and is used to structure a wide variety of studies such as; organizational culture conflict (Reeves-Ellington 1998), resistance to increase regulations in the shrimp fishery (Johnson et al 1998), and coastal development programs (Aswani 2 ̆ 6 Weiant 2004; Pollnac 2 ̆ 6 Pomeroy 2005). Innovation attributes are the perceived properties of an innovation that influence a potential adopters’ decision (Rogers 2003). Adoption research assesses perception of innovation attributes by potential adopters to better explain adoption practices or how to better design innovations for project participants. In the context of this study, relationships of the factors of attitudes toward fishing, future perspective and perceptions of recovery activities with willingness to participate, were investigated. ^ This approach examines individual perceptions and experience with the transfer technology of circle hooks and how fishers affect acceptance of this innovation. Rogers (2003) suggests that adoption of innovations is more likely if a need exists or it is arises among the members of a community. This approach examines individual perceptions and experience with the transfer technology of circle hooks and how fishers affect acceptance of an innovation in general. Rogers (2003) suggests that adoption of innovations is more likely if a need exists or arises. Future perspective is an individual characteristic that can be an indicator of willingness to adopt an innovation (Rogers 2003). The study area is six villages in the Ecuadorian coast that have knowledge of the existence of this new BRD. ^ Although the effort to transfer circle hook technology has occurred in Ecuador since 2004, there is no doubt that its diffusion process has been slow in most of the fishing towns in this study. Survey results indicate that circle hook adoption in Ecuador is low; only 64 out of 272 informants (23 percent) indicated that they used circle hooks on their boats. Adoption is not easy, especially when the Ecuadorian fishers have spent many years fishing with J hooks. They have time yet to learn and/ or develop adequate techniques to operate with circle hooks, so we can hope that with more time we will see improvements in their catch rates with circle hooks in the future. ^ Chapter two examines the unintended consequences of technology transfer; specifically, circle hooks in fisheries as a conservation initiative that was intended to curb the accidental capture of sea turtles in Ecuadorian longline fisheries. However, results from this study indicate that BRD can have unintended consequences on other species, specifically sharks. The hypothesis of this study is that the presence of an Ecuadorian shark fishery is a consequence of the most recent Government regulation on sharks coupled with a lucrative international shark fin market may create incentives to misuse this technology and target sharks. ^ The goal of this analysis is to determine to what extent the promotion of circle hooks as a turtle conservation tool has led to the unintended consequence of circle hooks, which are highly effective in capturing large species such as tuna and swordfish, being used to exploit a regulation that allows fishers to keep any shark caught as bycatch. Ironically, the very device being promoted to conserve the sea turtles is being exploited to catch shark, a regulated species. This study concludes that fishers purposefully use circle hooks rather than j-hooks as a “work around” to catch regulated shark species as bycatch and within the regulations, keep them. ^ The lucrative trade in shark fins and the incidental established shark fishery in Ecuador provide an incentive to use the circle hook to target sharks. There is no easy solution to this problem. Ecuador, and those at the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), are in the unenviable position of trying to decide with uncertain science whether to promote a hook that may save sea turtles but put sharks at risk. ^ Finally, chapter three evaluates fishermen’s perceptions regarding the use of the Turtle Excluder Devices (TED), and if this BRD ensures conservation of sea turtles to assure better fisheries management. Actions and decisions regarding any new regulation must be taken with regards to not only scientific information, but also the welfare of all stakeholders involved in one specific fishery. Decisions should not favor one fishery sector or group. Decisions should attempt to favor all the stakeholders as well as the marine resources. ^ Bycatch reduction is a result of the use of more selective fishing gears such as trawl nets equipped with TEDs. Although this device was, in some way, imposed by the US to enforce its use by the Ecuadorian <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels</b> and to avoid any ban on shrimp exportation, results of this study indicate that 82...|$|E

40|$|Human {{activity}} has been impacting marine ecosystems for millennia, and fishing {{is most often}} seen {{as the cause of}} overexploitation and depletion of marine biological resources (Myers and Worm 2003, Salomon 2009). There is a wealth of recent studies illustrating how our perception of pristine conditions in the seas and oceans has shifted over generations. This is referred to as ‘Shifting Baselines’. A wide range of evidence about (pre) historical reference conditions and early baselines has increased the awareness on the limitations associated with the current scientific methods to determine appropriate reference conditions against which current targets for conservation and management are set, in particular for fisheries (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008). It is acknowledged that environmental reference conditions and targets must strive to integrate all available and relevant data and information for improved assessments, including incorporating historical data into conservation and management frameworks (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008, McClenachan et al. 2012). Historical data can contribute in explaining underlying cause-effect relations in changes in the ecosystems, potentially reveal information and knowledge from past conditions (Jackson et al. 2001), and help defining reference conditions and achievable targets for environmental management today. The present thesis focuses on quantitative data to extend the timeframe of current analyses on fisheries (landings, fleet dynamics, spatial dynamics, indexes of productivity of the fleet and impact of fishing) and on the reconstruction of historical timeseries to expand our knowledge on historical references for the Belgian sea fisheries. In achieving this, it intends to counter the concept of 'Shifting Baselines' applied to the Belgian Sea fisheries. The ‘Historical Fisheries Database’ (HiFiDatabase) is a product of this thesis. It {{is the result of a}} thorough search, rescue, inventory, standardization and integration of data for Belgium’s sea fisheries that were not available before in the public domain or were not available before in the appropriate format for redistribution. It is documented and stored in the Marine Data Archive of Flanders Marine Institute and is freely available for end-users. It contains a unique and substantial collection of time series with standardized species names, reporting units, fishing areas and ports of landing (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010 b). It is a ‘living’ product in the sense that new, relevant, quality-controlled time-series can be added as they are discovered or produced. Considering the relative size of the fleet, the short coastline and the limited number of fish auctions and fishing ports in Belgium, it is fair to say that the present reconstruction of Belgian sea fisheries depicts a relatively complete picture of historical volume, value and composition of landings, fleet dynamics, fishing effort and spatial dynamics. The project and its methodology offer a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The reconstructed time-series indicate that, since the onset of systematic reporting mechanisms in Belgium in 1929, landings reported by the Belgian sea fisheries both in foreign and in Belgian ports amounted to 3. 3 million tonnes (t). After a maximum of 80, 000 t in 1947, annual landings declined steadily to only 26 % of this peak by 2008 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010 a). The most important species over the observed period in terms of landings were cod (17 % of all landings) and herring (16 %), closely followed by plaice (14 %), sole (8 %), whiting (6 %) and rays (6 %). In terms of economic value and based on values corrected for inflation, sole (31 %) and cod (15 %) were the most valuable, closely followed by plaice (11 %), brown shrimp (5 %), rays (5 %) and turbot (3 %). Near to 73 % of all landings originated from 5 of the 31 fishing areas. Twenty percent of all landings originated from the ‘coastal waters’, while these waters contributed nearly 60 % of all landed pelagic species and 55 % of all landed ‘molluscs and crustaceans’. The North Sea (south) and the Iceland Sea were next in importance with 17 % and 16 % of all landings respectively. The eastern and western part of the central North Sea, contributed each with approximately 10 % of the total landings (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010 a). The Belgian fisheries have followed a development of 3 major successive exploitation phases in which 3 major target species or target species groups were exploited until events or processes triggered a transition to a new phase: a ‘herring’ period between 1929 and 1950, a ‘cod’ (and other gadoid and roundfish) period between 1950 and 1980 and a period marked by plaice/sole between 1980 and 2000 (and after). This successive exploitation of targeted species was also associated with exploited fishing grounds, successively the Coastal waters for herring, the Icelandic Sea for cod, the North Sea south and the North Sea central (east and west) for sole/plaice, later also complemented by the ‘western waters’ (English Channel, Bristol Channel, Irish Sea) for the flatfish fisheries. To understand and interpret the trends in landings and changes in target species (groups), it is crucial to look at trends and changes in the fishing fleet and the fishing sector inserted in a wider socio-economic and political context. In the present thesis work, a reconstruction was made of the fleet size (from 1830), tonnage (from 1842) and engine power (kW from 1912) of the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. The time-series show a 85 % decrease in fleet size and a 5 % decrease in overall engine power (kW) since WWII. This decrease was compensated by a 10 -fold increase in average tonnage (GT) per vessel and a 6 -fold increase in average engine power (kW) per vessel. In only 10 years time after WWII, the fleet size decreased from approximately 550 to 450 vessels in 1955 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). Between 1955 and 1970 major structural changes took place in the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. These changes were driven first by the shift in the main fishing activities towards Icelandic waters in the 1950 s and in the early 1960 s by the governmental subsidies for the purchase of new steel hulled medium-sized motor trawlers and the introduction of the beam-trawl (Poppe 1977, Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). This led to less but more powerful vessels: between 1960 and 1975 the fleet size declined from 430 to approximately 250 vessels (- 42 %). The decline in fleet size was exacerbated when Iceland demarcated its territorial waters from 12 nm to 50 nm in 1972 and when the presence of Belgian fishermen within the declared 200 nm EEZ of Icelandic waters became subject to a ‘phase-out’ in 1975 (Lescrauwaet et al. under review). As a consequence of the loss of the Icelandic waters towards 1980, Belgian vessels shifted their activities again towards the central part of the North Sea (Omey 1982) and - to a lesser extent - towards the English Channel, Bristol Channel, South and West Ireland and the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards specific programmes were oriented to the decommissioning of ships with the aim to reduce fleet capacity. In 2012, the Belgian commercial sea fishing fleet counted 86 ships, with a total engine capacity of 49, 135 kW and gross tonnage of 15, 326 GT (Roegiers et al. 2013). The reconstructed time-series suggest that total landings decreased with total fleet size and with total fishing effort. At the level of the Belgian fleet, the total number of days spent at sea decreased from approximately 91, 800 days in 1938 to 15, 100 days in 2010 (- 84 %). The landings (kg) per vessel per day at sea or per day fishing have doubled between 1938 and 2010. The time-series shows at least 4 successive events: a first event (1939 - 1945) marked by WWII and the increased landings of herring in coastal waters. The exceptionally high landings per unit of effort are partly explained by the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the North Sea during WWII combined with the effects of two strong year classes. The second period is situated in 1951 - 1955 and coincides with the steep increase in landings from Icelandic waters. Thirdly, an increase in landings is observed between 1960 and 1967, which coincides with the state subsidies to introduce the beam trawl firstly in <b>shrimp</b> <b>vessels</b> (1959 - 1960) and later for flatfish fisheries. A final conspicuous event concerns the period of increased levels of landings per vessel per day between 1977 and 1986. After standardization as landings per unit of installed power (LPUP) to account for the average increase (x 6) of engine power per vessel, the landings have decreased by 74 % from an average 1, 3 t /installed kW in 1944 - 1947 to 0, 38 t /installed kW in 2009 - 2010. Interestingly, the average price of landings (all species, all areas, all fisheries aggregated) is negatively correlated with the decreasing fishing effort and decrease in overall landings. This suggests that the Belgian sea fisheries compensated for the losses by targeting species that achieve better market prices. Although the LPUP are illustrative of the changes in the productivity of fisheries, they cannot be interpreted as a proxy of change in biomass of commercial fish stocks, because the Belgian fisheries have targeted different species and fishing areas over time. Trend analysis to study change in fish stocks must be conducted at the level of different métiers or fisheries, taking into account issues such as specificity and selectivity of gear, environmental conditions in the targeted fishing area, seasonality of fishing and behavior of target species. In the present thesis, a closer look was taken at the impact of sea fisheries. In a first part, a quantitative approach was taken to reconstruct total removals by Belgian sea fisheries by including the unreported and misreported landings of commercial and recreational fishing, as well as an estimation of discards. The methodology applied in this reconstruction can serve as a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The results are useful to inform current policy issues and societal challenges. This reconstruction covers 6 fisheries with historical or current importance for Belgium (Lescrauwaet et al. 2013). Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5. 2 million t or 42 % higher than the 3. 7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3. 5 % (0. 2 million t) and 26 % (1. 3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. During the WWII, the Belgian fisheries benefited a 10 -fold increase in catches and 5 -fold increase in LPUE of North Sea ‘Downs’ herring. In the present thesis, these increased catches were explained by the combined effects of a major increase in catch power after WWI, the effects of the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the central part of the North Sea and by the effects of strong pre-WWII year classes (Lescrauwaet et al. revised manuscript under review). A third subchapter focused on the otter trawl fishery in Icelandic waters targeting cod. This fishery was of great economic importance in Belgium but decreased with the ‘cod wars’ (1958 and 1972) coming finally to a complete end in 1996. While the decline in total landings from Icelandic waters started after Iceland expanded its EEZ in 1958, the fishing effort of the Belgian fleet continued to increase until a peak was reached in 1963. The results show that the decline in the Iceland cod stock was visible at different levels; the decrease in the proportional importance of cod in the overall landings, the 75 % decrease in the LPUE (1946 - 1983), the decline in the proportion of ‘large’ fishes, and finally the decline or shift in the definition of a ‘large’ specimen. As a result of this thesis, unique data are presented on the trends in volume and composition of landings for the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS). The waters of the BNS are considered as the most important fishing area in terms of source of food for local population, but also as the most stable provider of food. The BNS and in particular the ecosystem of shallow underwater sandbanks is also important as (post) spawning and nursery area (Leloup and Gilis 1961, Gilis 1961, Leloup and Gilis 1965, Rabaut et. al 2007). The HiFiDatabase broadens the historical view on fisheries and serves as a basis for a range of potential research, management applications, and in support of policy-making. In particular, the time-series provide unique historical reference conditions of fishing in the Belgian part of the North Sea and a potential baseline for fisheries management in territorial waters or for the coastal fisheries. The latter is useful in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Habitat Directive and the proposal for Maritime Spatial Planning on the Belgian part of the North Sea. Finally in the present thesis work, important efforts were dedicated to approach the history of fisheries from different disciplines of work. The results underline the importance of collecting economic data, inventorying historical archives and historical legislation, historical economy and politics, in order to improve the interpretation and analysis of results. As advocated by the current integrated policies for the marine environment, both the challenge of the task and the richness of the results rely on a multidisciplinary approach...|$|E

Each gear type was alternately rigged on the port and starboard sides of a commercial <b>shrimping</b> <b>vessel</b> and the catch was sampled according to criteria established by the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program The objective {{of the study was}} to determine if modifying skimmer trawl nets’ by decreasing the vertical height of the net would lower bycatch rates, yet maintain shrimp catch. Total shrimp catch in the low profile net was significantly lower than that in the control net (- 32. 9 %, p = 0. 0001), and significantly lower for brown shrimp (Penaeus aziecus) by - 39. 1 % (p = 0. 0001), but pink shrimp(P. duorarum) catches were not significantly different (- 17. 1 %, p 0. 1934). In the sample, weight of finfish biomass to total catch biomass excluding debris was similar (47. 5 % finfish in the low profile net and 44. 8 % finfish in the high profile net). The low profile net was not effective in reduction of bycatch under most conditions. Because of increased catch rates of brown shrimp by the high profile net, results suggest that shrimpers may find it advantageous to utilize a high profile skimmer net during the brown and pink shrimp seasons, rather than a low profile net. Also, the low profile net may be advantageous to fishermen under conditions of: (1) high wind, (2) shrimping in areas where tight turns are mandated, (3) presence of large amounts of floating debris, and (4) shallow water.

Trawl samples were collected from <b>shrimping</b> <b>vessels</b> throughout the Matagorda Bay System during the 1997 and 1998 Spring and Fall inshore commercial food shrimp seasons. These samples were used to estimate the level of incidental harvest associated with the inshore shrimp fishery, characterize the composition of this bycatch, and identify temporal relationships of constituent species. Monthly mean bycatch biomass levels ranged from 3. 32 (December 1998) to 8. 71 kg (August 1998) and were highest during summer months. Percent contribution of bycatch biomass to total monthly biomass exceeded 50 % during May - September 1997 and July - October 1998. Bycatch:shrimp biomass ratios across seasons ranged from 1. 03 : 1 to 1. 68 : 1. Seasonal abundance ratios for bycatch:shrimp were < 1 : 1 and increased between Spring and Fall of both years. Finfish:shrimp biomass and abundance ratios were as much as 9 times larger than those for invertebrates:shrimp. A total of 108 species (82 finfish, 26 invertebrate) comprised bycatch characterization samples taken, 23 of which have commercial or recreational value. Twenty-two species were dominant (contributing [] 5 % of a monthly total), with the top five species (in terms of biomass and abundance) - blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) - being important components in other commercial fisheries or recreationally valuable. Assemblages of dominant bycatch constituents (biomass and abundance) varied monthly. Changes in species composition probably resulted from factors such as species specific life history patterns, trawling location, and shrimping techniques. Dominant bycatch species identified in the current study have been documented as bycatch throughout other inshore areas. The majority of individuals taken as bycatch were juveniles, with commercially- and recreationally-important constituents typically smaller than their legally harvestable size limits...|$|R
40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. NIOSH has developed a prototype system that will allow a victim of a try-net winch entanglement to shut off electrical power via a bumper switch. Bumper switches mounted to the winch frame provide an alternate method to turn off the electric winch. The prototype auxiliary-stop circuit is not an emergency-stop device that will arrest the momentum of the drum, but an alternate device to de-energize the winch motor. NIOSH believes that the auxiliary-stop circuit control is a feasible and cost-effective interim safety measure until a more comprehensive retrofit that will immediately stop the drum can be implemented. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners from various cultural groups to collaborate with the auxiliary-stop testing. Three prototype systems were installed on the F/V Daytin and Destin of Dulac, LA, the F/V Lucky CJ of Port Arthur, TX and the F/V Miss Opal of Brownsville, TX. Feedback from the fishermen will be used to refine the prototype design to make it robust enough to reliably withstand the harsh fishing environment. Researchers and industry collaborators will also strive to make the auxiliary-stop circuit compatible with most electrical systems used on side-trawl <b>shrimping</b> <b>vessels</b> fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Upon the successful completion of the field-testing, NIOSH will seek partners to promote this system to shrimp fishermen. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested auxiliary-stop design plans will be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites.

40|$|The {{ocean is}} one of Earth's most {{valuable}} natural resources. From regulating the climate to providing a source of food, the ocean has an interrelated economic, ecological and social importance. The economic, environmental and cultural history of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) are all intrinsically linked to the Atlantic Ocean and its resources. Protection of the coastal and ocean environments was not only important to the province’s past but is also widely recognized as vitally important {{for the future of}} the province. In June of 2011 the provincial Government of Newfoundland and Labrador introduced a Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework (Government of NL, 2011 a). The framework is designed to recognize the diversity of various stakeholders who rely on healthy coastal and ocean areas and to work together to provide long-term sustainable use of resources. One of the goals of the policy framework is to guide the coordination of provincial coastal and ocean policy in relation to priority issues identified for the province, with increased collaboration between governments, stakeholders, and communities (Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2010). This research paper asks the question: how might the province’s new coastal and oceans management strategy and policy framework be used to address major coastal and oceans problems? To answer this question, the paper applies the policy framework to an emerging crisis in one of the province’s most important fisheries – the northern shrimp fisheries. Despite fundamental social-ecological transformations in recent decades, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador continues to rely heavily on the ocean for the fishery resources it provides. Following the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992, and the subsequent moratoria on cod and other groundfish fisheries that put tens of thousands of people in the province out of work, many harvesters and processors in coastal communities in the province turned to increasingly lucrative and abundant crab and shrimp as a new means of income and industry (Foley et al. 2013). However, due to a number of reasons, including an increase in cod numbers and rising ocean temperatures, northern shrimp stocks are in decline (Lilly et al, 2000). This decline led the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), the federal agency responsible for fish allocations, to make cut backs on the shrimp quota in recent years. These quota reductions are impacting the inshore fishery, which supports the shore based and community-based processing plants where workers produce cooked and peeled shrimp, much more negatively than the offshore fishery, which produces frozen shell on <b>shrimp</b> onboard offshore <b>vessels</b> for sale into global markets (Keenan and Carruthers, 2015). The allocation of higher quota reductions in the inshore sector than the offshore sector in ocean areas close to the province has led to intense and highly 4 politicized disagreements and distraught feelings from local rural communities that depend on the fishery for their livelihoods. The purpose of this research paper is to apply the province’s Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework to the province’s northern shrimp fishery. The paper uses the framework as an analytical approach to explore potential ways to practically address and overcome the multi-faceted social, environmental, and political issues the province’s northern shrimp fishery, particularly the inshore sector, is currently facing. The policy framework is designed to address specific coastal and ocean issues, some of which can be related to the shrimp fishery. The issues are divided into six objectives: Healthy Marine Environments, Social, Cultural, and Economic Sustainability, Coastal Land Use, Competing Needs and Interests, Coastal and Marine Infrastructure, and Climate Change. This paper begins by examining the Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy that the province has developed to protect the ocean and coastline. This includes analyzing the goals, principles, tools, and departments involved in the strategy. Following this, the paper introduces the history and current issues facing the shrimp fishery in the province, specifically focusing on the decline in the resource and recent allocation changes and controversies. The policy framework is then applied to key issues in the fishery using some of the strategy objectives outlined above. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the NL Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework can be potentially applied to coastal management challenges, such as at the shrimp fishery, to promote solutions...|$|R
