Each task has to be validated (via code walk-through/fresh eyes) by a third person who is not writing the actual code. The database developer should not be able to execute anything in production without an independent review of the documentation/code for the work that is being performed. Typically, the role of the developer is to pass code to a DBA; however, given the cutbacks that have resulted from the economic downturn, a DBA might not be readily available. If a DBA is not involved, it is important, at minimum, for a peer to conduct a code review. This ensures that the role of the developer is clearly separate.|$|E

The concept of handoff, {{along with the}} vertical <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks,</b> enables software development teams {{to work on a}} continuous basis on the project. This notion is made possible through efficient knowledge representation, as the process of handoff essentially entails all work completed to be transferred from one site to the next. Data management {{is one of the key}} parameters that defines the success of this business model and is achieved through leveraging of specific tools, models, and concepts.

40|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} advancements {{in the field}} of network theory, very few studies have taken weights in the interactions into consideration that emerge naturally in all real world systems. Using random matrix analysis of a weighted social network, we demonstrate the profound impact of weights in interactions on emerging structural properties. The analysis reveals that randomness existing in particular time frame affects the decisions of individuals rendering them more freedom of choice in situations of financial security. While the structural organization of networks remain same throughout all datasets, random matrix theory provides insight into interaction pattern of individual of the society in situations of crisis. It has also been contemplated that individual accountability in terms of weighted interactions remains as a key to success unless <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> comes into play.

We contrast these measures to the commonly used time-share and Likert scale measures, which assume all tasks are interchangeable. Using Guttman scaling, we test the unidimensionality <b>of</b> this <b>task</b> hierarchy. Using odds ratios, we measure relationships between specific tasks, and using logistic regression, we see differences in correlates of husbands’ participation by task and interrelationships among tasks that persist, controlling for gender ideology and socioeconomic factors.

5000|$|Stephanie Coontz, a {{professor}} of family history at Evergreen State College, noted {{that one of the}} factors contributing to the gender inequality in the United States is that most men still expect women and men to assume traditional gender roles in the households and for women to carry out a larger share of the housework. This has been confirmed by a number of other studies; for example Makiko Fuwa from University of California, Irvine noted that while there has been movement towards greater equality, [...] "in 1995 American women still spent nearly twice as much time on housework than men" [...] and there is also a <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> household <b>tasks.</b> This gendered division of household labor creates {{what is known as the}} second shift or double burden, where working women in a heterosexual couple with a working partner spend significally more time on childcare and household chores.|$|R
40|$|In the United States the {{philosophy}} of Just-in-Time (JIT) has been chiefly applied to manufacturing. Other non-manufacturing organizations such as hospitals and insurance companies have adopted various aspects of JIT but in a limited fashion. Organizations have not yet {{taken advantage of the}} principles of JIT in administrative functions. It is inappropriate to adopt one philosophy for manufacturing, one for marketing, one for finance, etc. An organization 2 ̆ 7 s underlying philosophy should be applicable to all aspects of the company and not separated according to functional areas. Organizations today tend to be overly segmented such that a great deal of duplication and conflicting efforts occur. JIT can arrest the progressive <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> organizational <b>tasks</b> and functions <b>of</b> stimulating and maintaining a high level of wholeness. ^ This study explores the hypothesis that the embodiment of JIT principles can be utilized effectively in the administrative area to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency. To achieve this an examination of JIT manufacturing principles was undertaken in order to identify those principles that can be utilized in an administration setting. A conceptual model was then developed and implemented within two divisions of a Fortune 500 company. The implementation phase consisted of training all employees involved, as well as monitoring their progress. Results of their efforts were then measured, examined, and analyzed. ^ The results indicate that the principles of JIT can be successfully applied to administrative functions. Approximately 95...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the use of}} digital technology {{in the design and}} construction of a geodesic dome built in a student workshop as the bearing structure for an artificial sky lighting installation. Digital tools were used for the whole process from preliminary to detailed design, fabrication and assembly, in order to allow the investigation and precise representation of the geodesic geometry. However, limited possibilities, in combination with the intrinsic nature of the geometry, which allowed <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks,</b> did not permit a full exploration of the potential of the digital continuum at that time, even though taking advantage of digital technologies, the process maintained some of its linear characteristics. A couple of years after the successful completion of the installation, the project is “revisited” in retrospect, and the design process is “reengineered” considering the design potential of recent advances in digital technology. In this work in progress, an attempt is made to work with an inclusive model that contains geometric, structural, material and manufacturing input and constraints and can inform design, fabrication and assembly processes, allowing for dynamic manipulation and control of parameters at any given time, thus, reconfiguring in real time the design, as well as the related processes...|$|E
40|$|Networked {{collaborative}} {{virtual environment}} (NCVE) allows users from diverse locations {{to work together}} via virtual workspaces. It is a complex environment requiring coordination amongst team members who are physically invisible and have loose-tie team relationships. To enhance team coordination, roles have been utilized to manage the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> among users. Research shows that role transition is {{a key factor in}} a successful business process. It acts as a medium for a team to resolve conflict amongst its members. If the changes in roles are not managed effectively, the collaborative works can be disrupted and impose undue pressure on users. However, most studies in managing dynamic groups for NCVE are more inclined to resolve domain specific role transition issues. Furthermore, most existing role-transitions in NCVE must be dealt with manually by external entities to the NCVE system, which are solely done through human intervention. As a result, role transitions are hardly matched or coped with. Hence, this research explores the feasibility of having a socio-technical approach in managing role transitions that can be embedded in NCVE systems to assist both users and computer automation in managing role-transition. This research begins by conducting a case study, which is aimed at observing real-life scenarios in a call center environment. Using a goal directed approach; the real-life scenarios are illustrated through four personas in eleven scenarios where they are further analyzed with abstract scenes analysis method to produce early findings. The findings are used as a basis to identify the dynamic behavior of roles and provisions of role transition through observation and exploration of the extensive possibilities of a Monopoly game. As a result, a new role transition structure is modeled. Next, the model is transformed into a set of language constructs via Baun-naun-form (BNF) to become a major extension to an existing scripting language named JACIE. Lastly, the language constructs are applied to a call center application to test their functionalities. This research has contributed to a flexible role transition management in the sociotechnical approach in two ways: modeling and language constructs. The model supports a range of role transition management designs that are not bound by any specific domain. The language constructs enable programmers to develop prototypes of NCVE applications rapidly whilst hiding the complexity of technical details. In summary, this research shows that it is feasible to embed a role-transition manager into NCVE systems and it is applicable to a wider domain of applications as opposed to the current domain specific approach...|$|E
