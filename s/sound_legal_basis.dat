Overall, voting was assessed positively {{by a large}} majority of IEOM observers, although it was at times disorganized and chaotic in a considerable number of precincts. Organizational and procedural shortcomings were observed, especially with regard to inconsistent application of inking procedures intended as a safeguard against multiple voting. Observers also reported a limited number of serious violations, including ballot box stuffing. The vote count and tabulation was evaluated less positively. Many PECs had problems completing the results protocols, which were often not posted for public scrutiny. IEOM observers reported cases of tampering with voter lists, results and protocols. The tabulation process at DEC level was slow and often chaotic. Some PEC protocols given to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM differed from those provided by DECs, and many PEC protocols were incomplete or inconsistent. A significant number of PECs reported unusually high turnout in the last three hours of voting, and several DECs reported a turnout considerably higher than the national average.Only a limited number of official complaints were filed during the pre-electoral period, almost all against the ruling party and its candidate. Although courts generally carried out open hearings in a professional and thorough manner, some complaints were ruled inadmissible without <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> and some written judgments did not set out sufficient reasoning. In addition, the CEC and courts tended to stretch the law beyond reasonable interpretation and without regard to its spirit in favour of the ruling party candidate and public officials.

5000|$|First, we {{adhere to}} the holding of Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. that a patentee, when selling a {{patented}} article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser, does not by that sale give the buyer, or downstream buyers, the resale/reuse authority that has been expressly denied. Such resale or reuse, when contrary to the known, lawful limits on the authority conferred {{at the time of}} the original sale, remains unauthorized and therefore remains infringing conduct under the terms of § 271. Under Supreme Court precedent, a patentee may preserve its § 271 rights through such restrictions when licensing others to make and sell patented articles; Mallinckrodt held that there is no <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for denying the same ability to the patentee that makes and sells the articles itself. We find Mallinckrodt’s principle to remain sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc[...] [...] [...]Second, we {{adhere to the}} holding of Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Comm’n, that a U.S. patentee, merely by selling or authorizing the sale of a U.S.-patented article abroad, does not authorize the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States, which are infringing acts in the absence of patentee-conferred authority. Jazz Photo’s no-exhaustion ruling recognizes that foreign markets under foreign sovereign control are not equivalent to the U.S. markets under U.S. control in which a U.S. patentee’s sale presumptively exhausts its rights in the article sold. A buyer may still rely on a foreign sale as a defense to infringement, but only by establishing an express or implied license—a defense separate from exhaustion, as Quanta holds—based on patentee communications or other circumstances of the sale. We conclude that Jazz Photo’s no-exhaustion principle remains sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in which the Court did not address patent law or whether a foreign sale should be viewed as conferring authority to engage in otherwise-infringing domestic acts. Kirtsaeng is a copyright case holding that 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) entitles owners of copyrighted articles to take certain acts “without the authority” of the copyright holder. There is no counterpart to that provision in the Patent Act, under which a foreign sale is properly treated as neither conclusively nor even presumptively exhausting the U.S. patentee’s rights in the United States.|$|E

40|$|It’s {{likely that}} last week’s {{decision}} {{is based on}} an overly optimistic assessment of conditions in source countries, writes Savitri Taylor in Inside Story ON 9 APRIL the immigration minister, Chris Evans, and his colleagues Stephen Smith and Brendan O’Connor issued a joint media release announcing “Changes to Australia’s Immigration Processing System. ” The takeaway message came in the very first sentence: “Effective immediately, the Australian government has today introduced a suspension of the processing of new asylum applications from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. ” Following this statement came 2144 words (yes, I counted) of elaboration and justification, and since the announcement thousands more words have been written by way of commentary. Many lawyers have questioned whether the suspension is consistent with domestic law as it stands and have raised the possibility of a legal challenge. But Julian Burnside cut {{to the heart of the}} matter when he pointed out that, in the domestic sphere, the passage of legislation is all that is required to provide a <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for implementation of the new policy. There is no doubt that any necessary validating legislation would get the support of the Coalition in the Senate and would therefore pass. The question I wish to consider here is whether the government’s new policy is internationally lawful. This is quite distinct from the question of domestic lawfulness because it is a principle of customary international law that a state cannot defend a claim that it has breached its international legal obligations by saying that its conduct was permitted or even mandated under its domestic law. And in order to assess international lawfulness we need to drill down into the details of the policy and its justification [...] . Read the full articl...|$|E
40|$|The legal {{power to}} declare war has {{traditionally}} {{been a part of}} a prerogative to be exercised solely on advice that passed from the King to the Governor-General no later than 1942. In 2003, the Governor- General was not involved in the decision by the Prime Minister and Cabinet to commit Australian troops to the invasion of Iraq. The authors explore the alternative legal means by which Australia can go to war — means the government in fact used in 2003 — and the constitutional basis of those means. While the prerogative power can be regulated and/or devolved by legislation, and just possibly by practice, there {{does not seem to be}} a <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to assert that the power has been devolved to any other person. It appears that in 2003 the Defence Minister used his legal powers under the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) (as amended in 1975) to give instructions to the service head(s). A powerful argument could be made that the relevant sections of the Defence Act were not intended to be used for the decision to go to war, and that such instructions are for peacetime or in bello decisions. If so, the power to make war remains within the prerogative to be exercised on advice. Interviews with the then Governor-General indicate that Prime Minister Howard had planned to take the matter to the Federal Executive Council ‘for noting’, but did not do so after the Governor-General sought the views of the then Attorney-General about relevant issues of international law. The exchange raises many issues, but those of interest concern the kinds of questions the Governor-General could and should ask about proposed international action and whether they in any way mirror the assurances that are uncontroversially required for domestic action. In 2003, the Governor-General’s scrutiny was the only independent scrutiny available because the legality of the decision to go to war was not a matter that could be determined in the High Court, and the federal government had taken action in March 2002 that effectively prevented the matter coming before the International Court of Justice...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to reveal the ideal {{structure}} and the measures public organizations need to take with respect to the child pornography problem on the Internet, measuring the perception level of the personnel employed by public institutions, and having consulted to the opinions of specialists. Among the participants of this study were General Directorate of Security Department of Cyber Crimes, Ministry of Family and Social Policies, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Health. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in order to obtain information from participants for this study. A questionnaire was submitted in an in person interview setting to the participants who were working in government institutions. In order to meet reliability and validity requirements of the survey,, expert opinion was obtained as a means to provide the measurement validity and reliability with necessary corrections made based on the feedback provided. Expert opinion was obtained and analyzed using the analysis software and the findings were evaluated and interpreted. The results showed that research population was rather young with high education levels, well-versed in national regulations, they possess the knowledge of digital citizenship, however, analyses showed that they were not informed about technical issues such as international acts related to child pornography, online child pornography, Darknet, p 2 p networks and hash databases. The findings showed that the reason behind the lack of awareness on some of these phenomena, when the participants' level of education was found to be rather higher, was the inherent problems in the education system and the insufficiency of the curriculum. Qualitative and quantitative methods used in this study and literature review conducted suggested that the lack of education with respect to 'digital citizenship' is a problem to be eliminated in Turkey where several ministries are responsible for the fight against child pornography. Another conclusion of this study is that there is a pressing need to establish and umbrella institution which needs to be supported with a national child pornography image database to be used in order to uncover IP addresses and other data belonging to criminals who share, post, sell or view such images online. In other words, a national analysis software is essential in the fight against child pornography not to mention the need for a <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for proceedings in this regard...|$|E

40|$|S v Mshumpa {{dealt with}} the very {{controversial}} issue of third party foetal violence that terminates prenatal life. The decision of the Eastern Cape Division emphasised that, until live birth, a foetus is not a legal subject with constitutional rights. As {{a result of its}} position in the law, a foetus cannot be the victim of criminal conduct. The court refused to develop the common law crime of murder to include a foetus and referred this issue to the legislature to address. Concerns raised by the research task relate to the most effective method of law reform and the implications of law reform for well established legal principles concerning legal subjectivity, vestment of constitutional rights and female reproductive rights. In order to avoid these concerns, the introduction of a statutory crime is determined as the preferred method for law reform. The aim of the study is to develop a suitably defined statutory crime, with definitional elements that conform to the Constitution and criminal law principles. Before embarking on the mission of exploring possible grounds that justify law reform, the research first examines the extent of inability of the law to impose criminal liability in cases of third party violence that terminates prenatal life. Aspects that are specifically investigated include the common law crime of murder, contravention of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, attempting the impossible and the common law crime of abortion. A further purpose of this examination is to determine the reasons why foetal interests are not taken into account. Appreciating the lack of criminal remedy, private law principles are considered in order to determine whether there are any principles available to supplement the deficiencies in criminal law. This research found that the value of dignity established by the founding principles of the Constitution and applied in the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act demonstrates that the state has an interest in prenatal life. The value of dignity serves as the foundation for law reform. Having established the existence of a <b>sound</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> which justifies law reform, the research requires an investigation into foreign jurisdictions where the crime of third party foetal violence exists {{as a result of a}} state interest in foetal life. The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether the crime is effectively implemented. The United States of America is the selected country to study because third party foetal violence receives attention at both state and federal level. The research found that the implementation of foetal homicide laws in the United States infringes on female reproductive rights and to a certain extent, the foetal homicide laws also grants a foetus legal subjectivity. The United States fails to effectively implement the crime of third party foetal violence in line with its own established legal principles. The research benefits from the study conducted on the United States in that the United States demonstrates the definitional elements the proposed crime should contain in order for the statutory crime to be harmonious with established constitutional and criminal law principles. The study concludes with the recommendation that a statutory crime be developed in the context of female reproductive rights rather than considering the foetus as the victim of crime. The statutory crime is a response to unauthorised third party violence that terminates a woman’s pregnancy. The definitional elements include foetal viability for purposes of causation and will only be applicable to intentional conduct. The value of dignity in relation to prenatal life serves as a support structure for the driving force of female reproductive rights. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
