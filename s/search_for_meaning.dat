5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's <b>Search</b> <b>for</b> <b>Meaning</b> (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in the sky. Early {{evidence for}} humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes {{by reference to}} astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
25|$|Schnitker and Emmons {{theorized that}} the {{understanding}} of religion as a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God {{and a sense of}} purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> is also weaved into social communities.|$|E
40|$|Meaning in {{life has}} been {{identified}} as an important element of well-being. Recently attention has been directed to examining the differences between having meaning in life and <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life. Theory has speculated that if an individual is <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life, he/she may be distressed. Researchers of late have begun to focus on the process of <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life {{to gain a better understanding}} of the individual differences which may exist. Interest has also been directed towards exploring whether any moderators of the possible negative effects of the searching process may exist. This research investigated the hypothesised negative link between high levels of <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life and subjective well-being and the positive moderating effects of presence of meaning in life while also exploring the influence of the demographic variables which were treated as control variables. From an exploratory stance further analysis examined the hypothesised positive moderating effects of self-actualisation, self-efficacy and achievement motives on the relationship between <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> and subjective well-being. One study (n = 500) was conducted to assess the hypothesized relationships. The study confirmed the negative relationship between high levels of <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life and subjective well-being and positive moderating effects that presence of meaning in life and self-actualisation have on happiness scores when individuals are <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life. Self-efficacy and achievement motives were shown to have no significant moderating effects on <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life and subjective wellbeing. Overall the results suggest that individuals who record high levels of <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> in life are protected from the negative outcomes of this process by holding high levels of presence of meaning in life and self-actualisation. 19 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning.</b>|$|E

It was given good reviews by both Filipino and American {{magazines}} and newspapers; Variety magazine's reviewer noted that [...] "Performances are solid, and former child actress Panganiban is impressive {{as a young woman}} who finds herself with a vocation she never asked for.... Guillen's helming is slick and confident, and the HD-sourced photography and other technical credits are of good quality", and the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that [...] "Gorgeously crafted, 'Santa Santita's' strength lies in its illuminating take on man's neverending <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning,</b> and in the thoughtful, truthful characterization of its leads".|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} critic David Danow, {{the labyrinth of}} the novel's title refers to [...] "a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography... that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end"—in this case, the General's own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling {{back and forth from}} one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness; instead, it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a spectre of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the labyrinth built to imprison the minotaur in Greek mythology, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In Danow's view, [...] "The Labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> and resolution to the vicissitudes of life".|$|E

In January 2007, Fun Home was an official selection of the Angoulême International Comics Festival. In the same month, the Anglophone Studies department of the Université François Rabelais, Tours sponsored an academic conference on Bechdel's work, with presentations in Paris and Tours. At this conference, papers were presented examining Fun Home from several perspectives: as containing [...] "trajectories" [...] filled with paradoxical tension; as a text interacting with images as a paratext; and as a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> using drag as a metaphor. These papers and others on Bechdel and her work were later published in the peer-reviewed journal GRAAT (Groupe de Recherches Anglo-Américaines de Tours, or Tours Anglo-American Research Group).|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} {{throughout}} the novel involves the natural human propensity to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>meaning</b> with the constant risk of apophenia. Followers of the seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are {{revealed to be}} victims of apophenia as the clips are just edited surveillance camera footage. Likewise, Cayce's mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after Cayce's father disappears. Science fiction critic Thomas Wagner underscores the desire for meaning, or pattern recognition, using a comparison between the film clips and Cayce's search for her father after the attacks: he very randomness and ineffability of the clips {{flies in the face}} of our natural human tendency towards pattern recognition ... he subculture that surrounds [...] "following the footage" ... an effective plot device for underscoring the novel's post-9/11 themes: to wit, the uncertainty of the fabric of day-to-day life people began to feel following that event … [...] as people don't like uncertainty, don't like knowing that there's something we can't comprehend. And if we can't fit something into an existing pattern, then by golly we'll come up with one. Within the marketing world, Cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel, but rather a paragon of the system. Inescapably within the system, she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns. The review in The Village Voice calls this search [...] "a survival tactic within the context of no context—dowsing for meaning, and sometimes settling for the illusion of meaning".|$|E
