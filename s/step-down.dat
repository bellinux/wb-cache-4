5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated <b>step-down</b> maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the Santa Fe {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 <b>step-down</b> and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopter}} {{operations were}} {{taken over by}} Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of <b>step-down</b> approach. This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} <b>step-down</b> transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Mutually coupled {{inductors}} can equivalently {{be represented}} by a T-circuit of inductors as shown. If the coupling is strong and the inductors are of unequal values then the series inductor on the <b>step-down</b> side may take on a negative value.|$|E
25|$|In this circuit, two whole, 12 pulse bridges {{that are}} series-{{connected}}, are connected in parallel. For this one, the “Inter-Phase Transformer” is eliminated because the emf {{produced by the}} bridges is the same. The <b>step-down</b> transformer, like in the twelve pulse circuit, is also complex, along with the thrystor valves and their interconnecting busbars.|$|E
25|$|In this circuit, the two bridges are fed from {{separate}} windings of {{the step}} down transformer. To improve harmonic cancellation, {{they have a}} 30° phase shift between them. Since the two bridges are connected in parallel, a specialised “Inter-Phase Transformer” is required to balance the differences in their emf. Also, this system requires a complex, multi-winding, <b>step-down</b> transformer.|$|E
25|$|The {{order for}} {{additional}} cars {{was placed in}} March 1955 for 10 68-seat <b>step-down</b> coaches (delivered between December 1955 and January 1956 and numbered 528 - 537), 25 72-seat Hi-Level coaches (delivered between January and April 1956 numbered 700–724), six 60-seat bar – lounge – news stand which also had a 26-seat lounge in the lower level (delivered between May and June 1956) and six 80-seat dining cars (delivered between June and August 1956 numbered 650–655). With these cars delivered the Santa Fe re-equipped the El Capitan, the only coach train operated between Chicago and Los Angeles and also having some of the Hi-Level coaches being assigned to the Chicago - Galveston, Texas Texas Chief. An additional 12 <b>step-down</b> coaches, numbered 538 - 549, and 12 convertible coaches, numbered 725 - 736, which were ordered in November 1962 and delivered between December 1963 and April 1964.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a simple}} {{connection}} between two six-pulse thyristor bridges. The de-icer function can be achieved with only a two-winding <b>step-down</b> transformer. Unlike the other two, this circuit can simple controller because the two thyristor bridges can be triggered directly in parallel. As a result, this circuit produces {{a broader range of}} harmonic currents and voltages.|$|E
25|$|While the 1953 senior Hudsons {{continued}} to be based upon the 1948 <b>step-down</b> design, these cars looked sleeker than the smaller, slab-sided Jet models. Unlike the Nash Rambler, which offered premium body styles such as a station wagon, hardtop, and convertible, the Jet was available only in sedan form. Although the Hudson Jet had an advantage by being well appointed, it was priced higher than base-level full-sized Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth sedans.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that for}} declaratives or wh-questions {{with a final}} decline, the decline is located as a <b>step-down</b> to the {{syllable}} after the last prominently stressed syllable, or as a down-glide on the last syllable itself if it is prominently stressed. But for final rising pitch on yes–no questions, the rise always occurs as an upward step to the last stressed syllable, and the high (3) pitch is retained {{through the rest of}} the sentence.|$|E
25|$|On December 26, 2004, at Final Battle 2004, Shelley and Strong were {{defeated}} by CM Punk and Steve Corino. Following the match, Aries, feeling that Shelley was spending {{far too much}} time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling than he was leading Generation Next, came to the ring and demanded that Shelley <b>step–down</b> as the leader. Before Shelley could give an answer, he was attacked by Aries and Strong and kicked out of Generation Next, turning him into a fan favorite in the process.|$|E
25|$|Touchdown PCR (<b>Step-down</b> PCR): {{a variant}} of PCR that aims to reduce nonspecific {{background}} by gradually lowering the annealing temperature as PCR cycling progresses. The annealing temperature at the initial cycles is usually a few degrees (3–5°C) above the Tm of the primers used, while at the later cycles, it is a few degrees (3–5°C) below the primer Tm. The higher temperatures give greater specificity for primer binding, and the lower temperatures permit more efficient amplification from the specific products formed during the initial cycles.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, for the 1954 model year, {{the model}} {{underwent}} a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling {{because of the}} way the <b>step-down</b> frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.|$|E
25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a <b>step-down</b> transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency <b>step-down</b> like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} {{discussions on the}} {{necessity}} to withdraw notes of higher denominations such as the 1000 and 500 banknotes, considering their role in perpetuating unaccounted money. This move was taken to further curb the problem of fake currency circulation. While noting that the withdrawal of high denomination notes can {{lead to an increase}} in printing costs for RBI, there was an opinion that these costs should be weighed against the misuse of high-value notes. On 8 November 2016 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series, with a detailed <b>step-down</b> program. This program would stop all usage of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes by 11 November 2016. Citizens with valid identification will have until 30 December 2016 to exchange the notes for lower tender at any bank or post office, and until 31 March 2017 to exchange them at designated RBI offices by filling in a declaration form.|$|E
500|$|A typical train {{comprised}} two <b>step-down</b> coaches, five standard coaches, a lounge, and {{a dining}} car. The Hi-Level cars {{continued in service}} after the Santa Fe combined the El Capitan and Super Chief in 1958. The Santa Fe also converted six single-level baggage cars to baggage-dormitories ( [...] 3477–3482), with a spoiler at one end to create a visual transition. The cars dated from the 1938 version of the El Capitan.|$|E
500|$|The {{mechanical}} {{analogy of}} a transformer {{is a simple}} machine such as a pulley or a lever. [...] The force applied to the load can be greater or less than the input force {{depending on whether the}} mechanical advantage of the machine is greater or less than unity respectively. [...] Mechanical advantage is analogous to transformer turns ratio in the impedance analogy. [...] A mechanical advantage greater than unity is analogous to a step-up transformer and less than unity is analogous to a <b>step-down</b> transformer.|$|E
500|$|Les Roberts {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review for The Plain Dealer and wrote, [...] "Much of Innes' narration is East London slang, generously laced with profanities and hard for Americans to grasp. But Banks' tough-guy prose is irresistible." [...] Writing for Electric City, James Crane suggested readers read The Maltese Falcon before beginning Banks' book, {{and said the}} story is a <b>step-down</b> from Guy Noir and Sin City. Crane wrote, [...] "I enjoy the hard-boiled style... It certainly isn't a new formula, though Ray Banks does follow it well." ...|$|E
500|$|The 61 coaches {{could carry}} either 68 or 72 passengers, half again {{more than the}} 44 of {{comparable}} single-level long-distance coaches. This increased capacity permitted the Santa Fe to run the El Capitan with fewer cars, while increasing {{the total number of}} passengers carried. The 68-seat coaches featured [...] "step down" [...] stairs at one end to permit access to standard-height equipment; that space was given over to four additional seats on the 72-seat coaches. The prototypes also featured <b>step-down</b> stairs, but carried one fewer passenger. In the prototypes the upper level had no restrooms; in response to passenger feedback, Budd added a restroom to the upper level in the production models. The prototypes also included a [...] "step up" [...] from the aisle to the coach seats; in the production cars, the seats rested flush with the aisle. Each coach weighed [...]|$|E
500|$|Lewis' {{first term}} as MP {{was a short}} one, as Diefenbaker's {{minority}} government was defeated in the April 8, 1963, general election. Lewis lost in Forest Hill, as his support among its Jewish community evaporated {{and returned to the}} Liberals, who were seen as best able to contain the Social Credit Party, which was perceived to be anti-Semitic. [...] This was only a temporary set-back. [...] With Diefenbaker in opposition (and unlikely to resurrect the coalition in Quebec that gave him his majority in 1958) and Social Credit a diminished force, Lewis returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 general election. [...] He was re-elected in the 1968 election, and became the NDP leader in the House of Commons after Douglas lost his seat. At the 1969 Winnipeg National Convention, Douglas announced that he intended to <b>step-down</b> as leader by 1971, which meant that Lewis became the de facto leader in the interim.|$|E

2500|$|With the two Hi-Level prototypes {{in service}} and proving {{to not only}} {{meet the needs of}} line but also being popular with {{passengers}} who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the Santa Fe again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars, this time in five different configurations: <b>Step-down</b> coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a <b>step-down</b> car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the end door at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining cars and lounge cars (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the Big Dome lounge cars that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype Hi-Level cars were built. (The Hi-Level lounge cars are the only Hi-Level cars that remain in use by Amtrak.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hornet, {{introduced}} for the 1951 model year, {{was based}} on Hudson's [...] "step-down" [...] design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore.

2500|$|In September 2015, it was {{reported}} that the school had seen a [...] "revolt" [...] against Richard Pleming, the headmaster, from pupils and parents who accused him of using [...] "draconian methods". In October 2016 it was announced that Pleming would step down from his position as Headmaster in January, less than three years into his rule. The move attracted particular attention given that the unusual decision was taken for Pleming to <b>step-down</b> midway through the year and before the end of his contract. The school's Second Master, Andrew Turner, was elevated to fill the position of headmaster {{until the end of the}} academic year, with Pleming continuing to work at the school fulfilling his teaching duties unto the expiration of his contact.|$|E
2500|$|Constant-voltage speaker systems {{refer to}} {{networks}} of loudspeakers which {{are connected to}} an audio amplifier using step-up and <b>step-down</b> transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only {{in the sense that}} at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems. [...] In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100V.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{hospital}} {{facility was}} constructed at {{the location of}} the current main campus in 1937. The facility has undergone many expansions and remodelling projects over the years. These include the building of the nine-story [...] "Swann" [...] building in 1967, the [...] "Street" [...] building in 1972, and the [...] "Arnold" [...] building in 1975. A $40 million, 60,000-square-foot addition {{to the front of the}} Swann building was opened in 2008, adding new surgical facilities, a new cardiac <b>step-down</b> unit and a cardiac rehabilitation center to the Bostick Heart Center as well as a new lobby and improved access to the Cassidy Cancer Center. The 2008 addition followed the completion of a 112,000-square-foot, 300-space parking garage in November 2006; the foundation of the garage was built to support two additional levels (for a total of 5 levels) which may be added in the future.|$|E
2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a <b>step-down</b> transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E
2500|$|In America, George Westinghouse who {{had become}} {{interested}} in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with <b>step-down.</b> In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. [...] A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration {{until late in the}} schedule. [...] Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000hp, 250 rpm, 25Hz, two phase generators.|$|E
