5|$|According to some sources, <b>Serbian</b> king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the <b>Serbian</b> prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but {{he noticed that the}} <b>Serbian</b> prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Serbian</b> Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade {{would have to be}} evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the <b>Serbian</b> interior.|$|E

5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early <b>Serbian</b> historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in <b>Serbian</b> scholarship, is that despot Michael is {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century <b>Serbian</b> noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in the portraits are uncommon for this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century <b>Serbian</b> architecture. It has also been revealed that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the <b>Serbian</b> Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the <b>Serbian</b> ruler alone, {{as he had}} free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held out under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside <b>Serbian</b> control.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the šajkača was the {{standard}} hat worn by <b>Serbian</b> Chetnik irregulars in the Axis-occupied Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was also worn by <b>Serbian</b> Partisans. After the war, it {{was replaced by}} the Titovka cap in the armed forces of communist Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 18 November, the Austro-Hungarians moved into {{position}} {{to carry out a}} further assault, which began the following morning. The Austro-Hungarians' main goal was to break through the defenses of the <b>Serbian</b> 2nd Army, concentrated primarily around Lazarevac, and to drive the <b>Serbian</b> 1st Army back towards the town of Gornji Milanovac while simultaneously assaulting <b>Serbian</b> positions around the villages of Čovka and Vrače Brdo which threatened the Austro-Hungarian flank. The Austro-Hungarians gained a foothold at Vrače Brdo by the evening of 19 November, and seized higher ground from the Serbs further to the south. The <b>Serbian</b> 1st Army was forced to retreat the following day, giving the Austro-Hungarians the ability to advance down the main routes leading to Kragujevac. Potiorek believed it was possible that Putnik was trying to lure the Austro-Hungarians deeper into Serbia for the purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks, but correctly assessed that the <b>Serbian</b> Army was in no position to carry out such an attack.|$|E

5|$|Dušan's {{death was}} {{followed}} by the stirring of separatist activity in the <b>Serbian</b> Empire. The south-western territories, including Epirus, Thessaly, and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357. However, the core of the state (the western lands, including Zeta and Travunia with the upper Drina Valley; the central <b>Serbian</b> lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš. Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš' authority even in the part of the state that remained <b>Serbian.</b> Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain. <b>Serbian</b> lords also fought each other for territory and influence.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his <b>Serbian</b> neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into <b>Serbian</b> territory and reached Hvosno in Kosovo. After attempting to conquer the fortress of Ždrelo near Peć to no avail and burning the Žiča monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains. Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in <b>Serbian</b> forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube {{to the safety of}} his Tatar suzerains.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{the socialist}} period, the United States was a haven for many <b>Serbian</b> anti-communists living outside Yugoslavia.

5|$|In addition, White Eagles paramilitaries {{arrived in}} Borovo Selo in mid-April {{at the request}} of Borovo Selo militia {{commander}} Vukašin Šoškoćanin.
