40|$|Noether gauge {{symmetry}} for F(R) {{theory of}} gravity has been explored recently. The fallacy is that, even after <b>setting</b> <b>gauge</b> to vanish, {{the form of}} F(R) ∝ R^n (where n ≠ 1, is arbitrary) obtained in the process, has been claimed to be an outcome of gauge Noether symmetry. On the contrary, earlier works proved that any nonlinear form other than F(R) ∝ R^ 3 / 2 is obscure. Here, we show that, <b>setting</b> <b>gauge</b> term zero, Noether equations are satisfied only for n = 2, which again does not satisfy the field equations. Thus, as noticed earlier, the only admissible form that Noether symmetry is F(R) ∝ R^ 3 / 2. Noether symmetry with non-zero gauge has also been studied explicitly here, {{to show that it}} does not produce anything new. Comment: 9 pages, To appear in Astrophysics Space Scienc...|$|R
40|$|A gauge field model, which {{simultaneously}} has strict local gauge symmetry {{and contains}} massive general gauge bosons, {{is discussed in}} this paper. The model has SU(N) gauge symmetry.

40|$|For the four-dimensional SU(N) Euclidean Yang-Mills {{theory in}} the Landau gauge, we present two <b>sets</b> of <b>gauge</b> field {{configurations}} that satisfy the Euclidean equations of motion. These configurations generate four-dimensional chromo-field flux sheets whose spatial cross sections are three-dimensional chromo-field flux tubes. In lattice simulations, they may be detected as center vortices. The first <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations generates chromo-electric flux tubes that should contribute to a chromo-electric flux tube between two static color charges. The string tension for two static color charges in representation r then naturally satisfies the Casimir scaling. Applying a gauge transformation to this <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations, we can transform them into those in the maximal Abelian gauge. These transformed configurations generate chromo-electric flux tubes that should contribute to those observed between two static quarks in lattice simulations performed in the maximal Abelian <b>gauge.</b> The second <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations generates chromo-magnetic flux tubes. When rotated in a plane that includes the temporal-axis and is perpendicular to the flux tube axis, the rotated gauge field configuration generates a chromo-electric flux tube and should contribute to the chromo-electric flux tubes observed in lattice simulations in the Landau gauge. We also argue that when regulated on a lattice, any of the flux sheet gauge field configuration with a finite flux sheet thickness {{is located on the}} Gribov horizon in the infinite lattice volume limit. We thus suggest that these <b>sets</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations contribute significantly to the low energy properties of QCD, particularly the quark confinement. Comment: 31 pages.

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular recommender system technologies, and utilizes the known preferences of a group of users to predict the unknown preference of a new user. However, the existing CF techniques has the drawback that it requires the entire existing data be maintained and analyzed repeatedly whenever new user ratings are added. To avoid such a problem, Eigentaste, a CF approach based on the principal component analysis (PCA), has been proposed. However, Eigentaste requires that each user rate every item in the so called <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> for executing PCA, which may not be always feasible in practice. Developed in this article is an iterative PCA approach in which no <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is required, and singular value decomposition is employed for estimating missing ratings and dimensionality reduction. Principal component values for users in reduced dimension are used for clustering users. Then, the proposed approach is compared to Eigentaste in terms of the mean absolute error of prediction using the Jester, MovieLens, and EachMovie data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, even without a <b>gauge</b> <b>set,</b> performs slightly better than Eigentaste regardless of the data set and clustering method employed, implying that it can be used as a useful alternative when defining a <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is neither possible nor practical...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of air flowrate by a Borda nozzle {{has been the}} subject of a project of international norm proposed by Great-Britain, on the basis of Kinghorn and Mc Hugh works. The device consists in two <b>sets</b> of pressure <b>gauges.</b> The calculation of flowrate requires two coefficients which are function of the geometry of the nozzle. The present work displays an anomaly in the range of wall relative thicknesses between 2. 6 and 3. 7 %, range not studied by Kinghorn and Mc Hugh. New values are proposed for the coefficient of wall thickness up to 4 %. They allow to keep the accuracy indicated in the norm project. Moreover the present work indicates that the second <b>set</b> of pressure <b>gauges</b> can be suppressed.
