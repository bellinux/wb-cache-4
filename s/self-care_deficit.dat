5000|$|Dorothea Elizabeth Orem (July 15, 1914 [...] - [...] June 22, 2007), born in Baltimore, Maryland, was {{a nursing}} theorist and {{creator of the}} <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> nursing theory, {{also known as the}} Orem model of nursing.|$|E
5000|$|The nursing {{theory is}} based upon the {{philosophy}} that all [...] "patients wish to care for themselves". They can recover more quickly and holistically if they are allowed to perform their own self-cares {{to the best of their}} ability. Orem's <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> nursing theory emphasized on establishing the nursing perspectives regarding human and practice.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> nursing {{theory was}} {{developed}} by Dorothea Orem between 1959 and 2001. The positively viewed theory explores the use professional care and an orientation towards resources. [...] Under Orem's model self-care has limits when its possibilities have been exhausted therefore making professional care legitimate. These deficits in self-care are seen as shaping the best role a nurse may provide. There are two phases in Orem's self-care; the investigative and decision-making phase and the production phase.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{the term}} care partner has increased, {{particularly}} in the chronic disease literature; however, the concept has not been well defined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this concept analysis was to define and assist nurses to better understand the concept of care partner. METHODS: The method by Walker and Avant was used for this literature-based concept analysis. DISCUSSION: Care partnering includes providing assistance to an individual with a health condition to meet their <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits,</b> the commitment to a care partner relationship, and the recognition that people with <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits</b> are care partners contributing to their own care. CONCLUSION: Emphasizing the care partner dyad in nursing may contribute to improved patient care outcomes both in the acute and chronic settings. It is recommended that nurses view the person with the condition as a contributor and partner in their own care {{in the context of a}} larger care partnership...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{descriptive}} study that aimed {{to identify the}} <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits</b> of institutionalized elderly women. It was carried out during the second semester 2009, {{in a nursing home}} in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil. For data collection we used a semi-structured interview schedule, focusing on conditioning factors and self-care requirements, applied to 24 elderly women. The results show that the main reasons that led to the institutionalization were: absence of relatives, unavailability of children to provide care and need to live in a peaceful environment, without conflicts. <b>Self-care</b> <b>deficits</b> were related to the following factors: hydration, elimination, sleep and rest, health maintenance, social interaction, adaptation to the institutional environment and to changes in the life cycle, control of chronic health problems. From the self-care demands and/or needs identified, the supportive educative system of Orem will subsidize the nursing interventions that aim to engage the elderly women in self-care actions...|$|R
50|$|The <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> nursing {{theory is}} a grand nursing theory that was {{developed}} between 1959 and 2001 by Dorothea Orem. The theory is {{also referred to as}} the Orem's Model of Nursing. This theory originates from the totality paradigm based on human beings being able to adapt to one’s environment.  It is widely used in nursing literature and has displayed improved quality of care based on results from various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the nursing discipline. It is particularly used in rehabilitation and primary care settings, where the patient is encouraged to be as independent as possible.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Dependence Scale {{measures}} {{the amount of}} assistance patients with dementia require in performing daily activities. Validity and reliability of this scale have been demonstrated, but the progression throughout long periods in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) has not previously been examined. Objective: To determine the longitudinal course of patient dependence in a cohort of prospectively followed AD patients. Methods: Two hundred thirty AD patients enrolled in the Predictors Study were followed up prospectively at 6 -month intervals {{for an average of}} 6. 5 visits. The Dependence Scale was administered to a caregiver, and patients were assessed with the modified Mini-Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale. Dependence level and the additive sum of the Dependence Scale items were considered for analysis. Results: Generalized estimating equations to regression analyses were used to determine that both Dependence Scale scores and dependence level significantly decline with time. By covarying mMMSE scores and <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits</b> factor scores of the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, generalized estimating equations analysis also demonstrated that change in patient dependence was independent of global cognitive decline and other measures of activities of daily living, respectively.

Over a period of 8 weeks, a representative sample of 108 community nurses and 49 community nursing auxiliaries at 47 different locations paid a total number of 215 preventive home visits to elderly people. Clients' characteristics, the nature of care delivered by the nurse, and the length of the home visit were recorded for each home visit. The results suggested that community nurses and nursing auxiliaries spent very little time on preventive home visits.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{construct}} of thriving as an integration of nutritional (manifested in weight), psychosocial, and lifestyle concerns of childbearing {{within the context of}} Orem’s <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> theory. Provisional definitions of thriving in pregnancy and postpartum are proposed. Preliminary dimensions of thriving in postpartum are based on factor analysis of weight, lifestyle, and psychosocial data from 145 women after childbirth. Four dimensions emerged: psychosocial distress, lifestyle patterns, a weight factor, and a body image factor. Although the dimension-ality of postpartal thriving reported is preliminary, it provides a beginning foundation for assessment and interven-tion for postpartal women. The holistic nature of nursing requires that nurses strive to develop concepts and theories that integrate the multiple levels and domains of human health phenomena. Nursing conceptual mod-els, such as Orem’s (1995) <b>self-care</b> <b>deficit</b> theory, partially fulfill this need. Also needed are related midlevel inte-grative clinical concepts that link con-ceptual models with the phenomena of concern in nursing practice.

This paper is a report of a study to {{identify}} the changes in poststroke {{quality of life}} and other clinical issues among older Chinese adults from 1 month to 6 months after stroke and the predictors of poststroke quality of life at 6 months. Background. Stroke survivors are known to suffer from prolonged and multiple impairments leading to a compromised quality of life, but few studies report early predictors for quality of life among older Chinese adults after active rehabilitation has been undertaken during the first 6 months after stroke. Method. A total of 214 patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke were interviewed by a research nurse at 1 month and 188 patients were interviewed again 6 months after hospital admission for stroke. Assessment of quality of life was done using the Modified Rankin Scale for Quality of Life. Changes in and relationships between quality of life and variables in five domains were explored: bio-anatomical, physical, emotional, cognitive, communicative and social support. The data were collected in 2004 - 2005. Results. Quality of life among two-thirds of participants was unchanged or lower when scores at 1 month and 6 months after stroke were compared. Length of hospital stay after admission for stroke and other 1 -month factors - level of worry over current health, cognitive and <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits</b> - were identified as having independent effects on quality of life at 6 months. Conclusion. Clinicians need to observe for early signs of mild cognitive impairments and emotional needs of stroke survivors, as well as to consider longer-term interventions to enhance poststroke quality of life. © 2009 The Authors.

The aim of this paper was to assess cognitive deficits and the level of self-care ability in elderly patients with HF, and to determine if a relationship exists between cognitive <b>deficits</b> and <b>self-care.</b> Materials and methods: The study included 270 elderly patients (mean age: 72. 5 years) with HF. We used the Mini Mental State Examination Scale (MMSE) to evaluate cognitive functioning, and the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale, revised into a nine-item scale (EHFScBS- 9), to evaluate self-care behaviors. Associations between the variables were examined using multiple regression analysis. Results: Lower scores in both MMSE and EHFScBS- 9 questionnaires were correlated with older age, living alone, lower education, longer duration of illness, higher number of rehospitalizations, as well as lower left ventricular ejection fraction and higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. The multiple regression analysis was used for evaluation of the impact of the following predictors: MMSE score, age, duration of illness, ejection fraction, number of hospitalizations, sex, residence, education, relationship status, and NYHA class on EHFScBS- 9 score. Conclusions: Elderly patients with HF may have worse self-care behaviors because of their cognitive deficits. Age was the strongest predictor of worse MMSE scores. Multidisciplinary health teams should pay attention to the special needs of elderly patients who live with their illness for many years and have no social support because of living alone.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to teach nurses, who work in this institution, to understand the Orem?s model so that {{they knew how to}} prepare individual nursing plans according to it. So far, these anamneses of senior citizens have been prepared according to the Gordon?s model. Since Orem dealt with <b>self-care</b> <b>deficits,</b> which are found in senior citizens most frequently, it was worth considering testing the model in everyday practice. Three objectives were set, in which I tried to find the fitness of the Orem?s model for the care of senior citizens in terms of finding out about their independence and nursing care, to find out whether this model is more appropriate for the nursing care of senior citizens than the current Gordon?s model and to find out how nurses work with the new model. Four research questions were formulated based on these set objectives and they were answered. The Orem?s model is suitable for the determination of self-reliance of senior citizens. The applied Orem?s model is more suitable for the nursing care of senior citizens than the current Gordon?s model. Nurses and the senior citizens from the Centre of Social Services Staroměstská find the Orem?s model more suitable. In conclusion, all the set objectives have been met. The research group consisted of 8 respondents. Of these, nurses were one half and senior citizens from the Centre of Social Services Staroměstská were the other. All their responses were recorded using a dictaphone. For this thesis, the qualitative method and data collection were employed through processing of individual anamneses using the Orem?s and Gordon?s models. Observation sheets were used when filling these anamneses, both for the nurses and the senior citizens. The observation of the nurses was direct, non-participating and hidden and the observation of the senior citizens was direct, participating and ostensible. Moreover, data collection was carried out in the nurses using standardized interviews and using standardized interviews with the senior citizens too...|$|R
