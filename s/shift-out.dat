40|$|BACKGROUND: Linear {{acceleration}} generally {{gives rise}} to translation perception. Centripetal acceleration during centrifugation, however, has never been reported giving rise to a radial, inward translation perception. OBJECTIVE: To study whether centrifugation can induce a radial translation perception {{in the absence of}} visual cues. METHODS: To that end, we exposed 12 subjects to a centripetal acceleration with eyes closed. To avoid confounding with angular motion perception, subjects were fist rotated on-axis, and were shifted out fast and slow only after rotation sensation had vanished. They were asked for translation direction and velocity right after the <b>shift-out,</b> as well as after about 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. RESULTS: Independent of fast or slow <b>shift-out,</b> the vast statistically significant majority of trials yielded an inward radial translation perception, which velocity was constant after 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that during centrifugation, an inward radial translation perception does exist in humans, which perception reaches a constant, non-zero value during constant rotation, lasting for at least one minute. These results can be understood by high-pass filtering of otolith afferents to make a distinction between inertial and gravitational acceleration, followed by a mere integration over time to reach a constant velocity perception...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Power {{consumption}} during at-speed scan-based testing can {{be significantly}} higher than that during normal functional mode in both shift and capture phases, which can cause circuits ’ reliability concerns during manufacturing test. This paper proposes a novel X-filling technique, namely “iFill”, to address the above issue, by analyzing the impact of X-bits on switching activities of the circuit nodes in the two different phases. In addition, different from prior-filling methods for shift-power reduction that can only reduce shift-in power, our method is able to cut down power consumptions in both shift-in and <b>shift-out</b> processes. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can guarantee the power safety in both shift and capture phases during at-speed scan-based testing.

Experimental results from three fifteen-node test networks, obtained using a tool for optical network optimisation, modelling and design (NOMaD), illustrate the interesting dynamic behaviour of the adaptation algorithm.

Some analytical data obtained by using the proposed framework are presented to show the difficulty of generating test patterns that meet given limits for shift-in, <b>shift-out</b> and capture power, simultaneously. To relax the difficulty, this paper also describes a heuristic procedure using a cone analysis that definitely derives scan tests with low shift-in power and that reduces the search space during test generation.

Our structure, named differential scan path (DiSP), divides the internal state of the scan path in two sections. During the <b>shift-out</b> operation, only subtraction of the two sections is provided. Inferring the internal state from this subtraction requires much guesswork that increases exponen-tially with scan path length while the resulting fault coverage is only marginally altered. Subtraction does not preserve parity, thus avoiding attacks using parity information. The structure is simple, needs little area and does not require unlocking keys. Through implementing the DiSP in an elliptic curve crypto-graphic coprocessor, we demonstrate how easily it can be inte-grated into existing design tools. Simulations show that test effectiveness is preserved and that the internal state is effec-tively hidden. Postprint (published version...|$|E

These driver circuits have been characterized and tested for data rates up to 8 Gb/s. The bit error rate for one of these drivers has been measured up to 7 Gbls for a (Z 3 l- 1) bit long pseudo-random bit sequence (PPRBS). In order to match the data rate of Josephson circuits to slower room temperature electronics, we {{have developed}} clock-controlled shift registers which allow shift-in and <b>shift-out</b> of data at different frequencies.

40|$|Overtesting induces {{unnecessary}} yield loss. Untestable faults have {{no effect}} on normal functions of circuits. However, in scan testing, untestable faults may be detected through scan chains. Detected untestable faults cause overtesting. Untestable faults consist of uncontrollable faults, unobservable faults, and uncontrollable and unobservable faults. Uncontrollable faults may be detected under invalid states through scan chains by shift-in operations. Unobservable faults cannot be observed at primary outputs, but their effects may be propagated to scan flip-flops. Thus, unobservable faults may be detected through scan chains by <b>shift-out</b> operations. Several methods {{to reduce the number of}} detected untestable faults were recently proposed. These methods identify invalid states and generate test patterns avoiding invalid states. As the result, the number of detected uncontrollable faults was reduced. However, they cannot reduce the number of detected unobservable faults. In this paper, both uncontrollable and unobservable faults are identified using a multi-cycle capture test generation method. We evaluate the relationship between the numbers of untestable faults and the number of time expansions for ISCAS’ 89 benchmark circuits, and also evaluate factors that untestable faults are identified...|$|E
40|$|Low-density parity-check (LDPC) {{codes are}} {{a class of}} easily decodable error-correcting codes. Published {{parallel}} LDPC decoders demonstrate high throughput and low energy-per-bit but {{require a lot of}} silicon area. Decoders based on digit-online arithmetic (processing several bits per fundamental operation) process messages in a digit-serial fashion, reducing the area requirements, and can process multiple frames in frame-interlaced fashion. Implementations on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are usually power- and area-hungry, but provide flexibility compared with application-specific integrated circuit implementations. With the penetration of mobile devices in the electronics industry the power considerations have become increasingly important. The power consumption of a digit-online decoder depends on various factors, like input log-likelihood ratio (LLR) bit precision, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum number of iterations. The design is implemented on an Altera Stratix IV GX EP 4 SGX 230 FPGA, which comes on an Altera DE 4 Development and Education Board. In this work, both parallel and digit-online block LDPC decoder implementations on FPGAs for WiMAX 576 -bit, rate- 3 / 4 codes are studied, and power measurements from the DE 4 board are reported. Various components of the system include a random-data generator, WiMAX Encoder, <b>shift-out</b> register, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) generator, channel LLR buffer, WiMAX Decoder and bit-error rate (BER) Calculator. The random-data generator outputs pseudo-random bit patterns through an implemented linear-feedback shift register (LFSR). Digit-online decoders with input LLR precisions ranging from 6 to 13 bits and parallel decoders with input LLR precisions ranging from 3 to 6 bits are synthesized in a Stratix IV FPGA. The digit-online decoders can be clocked at higher frequency for higher LLR precisions. A digit-online decoder can be used to decode two frames simultaneously in frame-interlaced mode. For the 6 -bit implementation of digit-online decoder in single-frame mode, the minimum throughput achieved is 740 Mb/s at low SNRs. For the case of 11 -bit LLR digit-online decoder in frame-interlaced mode, the minimum throughput achieved is 1363 Mb/s. Detailed analysis such as effect of SNR and LLR precision on decoder power is presented. Also, the effect of changing LLR precision on max clock frequency and logic utilization on the parallel and the digit-online decoders is studied. Alongside, power per iteration for a 6 -bit LLR input digit-online decoder is also reported...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 22 - 27). Spatial memory decline {{has been}} well documented in older humans and animals. The decline has been reported to stem from age-related changes in various brain regions including the hippocampus. Recent studies have revealed that the hippocampus is important for the detection of metric and topological changes in the allocentric relationship among stimuli. However, little is known about age-related differences in the ability to detect these changes. In the current study, 25 young (6 month) and 22 aged (24 month) Fischer- 344 /Brown- Norway rats were tested on a paradigm designed to assess object-place memory for metric and topological changes using an exploratory-based, novelty detection task. Performance on this task {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the hippocampus. Metric changes were made by altering the distance between two objects, while topological changes were made by changing the object configuration. The metric task involved four 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval between Sessions 1, 2, and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval between Sessions 3 and 4. Prior to testing, two different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in an open field. Sessions 1 - 3 allowed for habituation to the two objects. During Session 4, the objects were shifted in to a 38 cm separation for the first metric test and shifted out to 98 cm separation for the second test. The topological task involved five 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval after Sessions 1 and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval after Sessions 2 and 4. Prior to testing, four different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in a square formation in an open field. Sessions 1 and 2 allowed for habituation to the four objects. During Sessions 3 and 4, two of the objects were transposed. During Session 5, the remaining two objects were transposed. There was a 48 -hr separation between metric and topological tests. Object exploration was recorded during all sessions and analyzed for age differences. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the metric task, two separate 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVAs were run for each condition, shift-in and <b>shift-out,</b> with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Session (1 - 4) as a within group variable. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the topological task, a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Location (Front Switch, Back Switch) as a within group variable. Young rats spent significantly more time exploring displaced objects during the metric task compared to aged rats when the objects were shifted in. During the topological task, young rats spent significantly more time exploring objects when the front two objects were transposed compared to aged rats. The results of this study suggest that age-related changes in the hippocampus impair memory for metric and topological spatial representations. Impairments in the detection of metric and topological spatial change may be useful indicators of age-related memory decline...|$|E
