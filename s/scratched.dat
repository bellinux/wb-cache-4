5|$|The {{hardness}} of diamond {{contributes to}} its suitability as a gemstone. Because {{it can only}} be <b>scratched</b> by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well.

5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or <b>scratched</b> by an infected rat.|$|E
40|$|Variation in the <b>scratch</b> {{behaviour}} of polymers with {{incorporation of}} different types and amounts of fillers was investigated {{both in terms of}} <b>scratch</b> visibility and <b>scratch</b> hardness. <b>Scratch</b> tests were carried out by a microscratch tester. The effect of fillers on the <b>scratch</b> deformation mode and hence on <b>scratch</b> visibility was evaluated by examining recorded penetration depth and acoustic emission traces together with optical microscope images of the groove left on the surface. <b>Scratch</b> hardness was determined by using a recently proposed <b>scratch</b> model. Adequacy of the model to interpret the local phenomenon induced by addition of fillers was questioned. It was demonstrated that incorporation of hard fillers can enhance the <b>scratch</b> hardness of polymers as well as their basic mechanical properties but leads to an increase in <b>scratch</b> visibility due to a change in <b>scratch</b> deformation mode from ductile ploughing to a brittle failure with crack formation. On the contrary, addition of soft fillers causes a reduction in <b>scratch</b> hardness but it also reduces <b>scratch</b> visibility since it improves the recovery characteristics of the polymer...|$|R

5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be <b>scratched</b> with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E

Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of the <b>scratching</b> speed, the <b>scratching</b> depth and the face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At the same <b>scratching</b> depth, the normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different <b>scratching</b> directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions.

30|$|Surface <b>scratches</b> {{of various}} {{features}} were artificially generated and damaged with UV laser. The effect of <b>scratches</b> on laser damage was investigated there. It is {{found that the}} morphologies vary from <b>scratches</b> depending on the orientation of <b>scratches</b> relative to crystals. That in 90 ° direction is full of micro-cracks while the <b>scratch</b> in 0 °direction contains few micro-cracks. The causes are the anisotropy of KDP. All the laser damage thresholds of <b>scratches</b> are much lower than <b>scratch</b> free surface, but no obvious dependence of the LIDT on the <b>scratch</b> morphology is found. Moreover, the numerical simulation of light intensity shows that cross-section shape of <b>scratches</b> also influences the local electrical field of incident laser light. <b>Scratches</b> with smaller width-to-depth ratio enhance laser light intensity more significantly and more harmful to the improvement of laser damage threshold of KDP. The {{results suggest that the}} mechanical <b>scratches</b> must be avoided to achieve high-quality surface of strong resistance to UV laser pulses, especially those with smaller width-to-depth ratios.|$|R

The adequacy of the model to explain deformation recovery and pile-up characteristics of the material in the <b>scratch</b> test was questioned by comparing the predictions of the model with residual profile measurements.

5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or <b>scratched,</b> the resulting shavings catch fire.

Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E

5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are <b>scratched</b> or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E
