40|$|Malignant {{transformation}} of ameloblastomas arising from an odontogenic cyst or de novo is well-recognized. Malignancies in ameloblastomas may involve metastasis or a local dysplastic {{change in the}} tissue. The latter are classified as ameloblastic carcinomas. A 75 -year-old male presented with a mandibular cystic swelling, with no evidence of metastasis. Dysplastic ameloblastic cells with spindle-cell transformation were seen arising from a cystic lining with features of a unicystic ameloblastoma. Immunohistochemically the lesion stained positive with cytokeratin 8, 19 and alpha smooth muscle actin, but was negative for vimentin. A diagnosis of <b>spindle-cell</b> ameloblastic <b>carcinoma</b> was made. <b>Spindle-cell</b> ameloblastic <b>carcinomas</b> are rare {{and this is the}} second case arising from a unicystic ameloblastoma reported in literature.

We reported a case of SpCC, stage IV disease that was initially diagnosed as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, but deeper sections revealed few clusters of epithelioid clear cells. Although the tumour showed biphasic appearances on haematoxylin and eosin, it exhibited poor protein expression with most sarcoma markers being negative except for focal vimentin positivity. The CEA and CK 7 were positive only in the epithelioid clear cell clusters while CD 68 positive was also focally positive in the spindle-cell component.

40|$|Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBCs) are {{basal-like}} tumors {{that frequently}} express {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) via an unknown underlying genetic mechanism. In this study, the EGFR/CEP 7 gene copy number in 17 MBCs with chondroid, squamous, and spindle-cell differentiation showing EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. All cases had a balanced EGFR/CEP 7 ratio. EGFR gene amplification was not observed in any case. Monosomy was found in 25 % and polysomy in 12. 5 % of carcinomas with chondroid differentiation. All <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and 50 % of squamous carcinomas showed trisomy. Comparison with CEP 7 copy number revealed aneusomy of chromosome 7, as opposed to increases or decreases specific to the EGFR gene or 7 p. Although no direct correlation between EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry and aneusomy was observed, cases with a score of 3 + showed a higher frequency of EGFR gene copy gain. In the absence of EGFR amplification, chromosome 7 aneusomy might be a useful criterion for the determination of potential candidates for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|The tracheas of 63 male Syrian golden hamsters {{were exposed}} once each week for 12 weeks to a flowing stream of 0. 5 % N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 4. 5) with a {{specially}} designed intratracheal cannula. The animals were killed when moribund or 6 months after the final exposure, and the respiratory tracts were examined grossly, histologically, and ultrastructurally for tumor formation. A total of 13 neoplasms {{was found in the}} larynx or trachea. Six were papillomas, 3 were carcinomas, and 4 were diagnosed as <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The average time of observation of the various tumor types was 33, 31, and 21 weeks, respectively. The spindle cell carcinomas contained an exophytic portion protruding into the tracheal or laryngeal lumen and an infiltrating portion growing circumferentially between the intact mucosa and the cartilage rings or plates. They were composed of sheets of elongated and spindle-shaped cells. Ultrastructurally, the cells contained bundles of tonofilaments and keratohyalin, and were connected by numerous desmosomes. These findings are consistent with a squamous origin of the tumor cells and a diagnosis of spindle cell carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several {{immunohistochemical}} markers {{have been}} used to demonstrate the presence of myoepi-thelial cells in order to determine their role in the histogenesis of mammary tumors. p 63, a recently characterized p 53 homologue, is consistently expressed in myoepithelial cells of the human breast; however, no assessment of its immunoreactivity has been reported so far in canine mammary tissues. We investigated p 63 immunohis-tochemical expression, as a novel myoepithelial cell nuclear marker, in 81 samples of normal (n 2), hyper-plastic (n 11), and neoplastic (n 68) canine mammary tissues. Myoepithelial phenotype was confirmed by using complementary monoclonal antibodies: alpha-smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin 14, cytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3, and vimentin. p 63 expression was observed in 91. 4 % (74 / 81) of the samples evaluated. Normal mammary glands, mammary hyperplasias, and benign tumors showed 100 % immunoreactivity, with p 63 expression re-stricted to myoepithelial cell nuclei. In general, benign mixed tumors showed a basal cell compartment im-munoreactive to p 63, with a gradual decrease of its expression during myoepithelial transformation. p 63 ex-pression was found in 72 % of malignant tumors, allowing myoepithelial or basal cell identification in <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (2 / 2), tubulopapillary carcinomas (8 / 9), solid carcinomas (7 / 10), and carcinosarcomas (1 / 3). The osteosarcoma analyzed was p 63 negative. In our series, stromal components were consistently nonreactive to p 63. In conclusion, the present study reveals p 63 as a sensitive and highly specific marker of myoepithelia...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterized}} a new mammary {{tumor cell}} line, F 311, previously estab-lished in vitro from a clonal subpopulation of the BALB/c transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma M 3, moderately metastatic to lung. The F 31 I cell {{line has been}} passaged> 50 times. It has grown as elongated cells adherent {{to the bottom of}} the flask. Cytogenetic studies showed that F 3 II cultures were nearly triploid. Tumor cells expressed fibronectin and showed high levels of cell-surface urokinase, a key protease in invasion and metas-tasis. F 3 II cells grew as poorly differentiated, <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> tu-mors (sarcomatoid carcinomas) with a prominent local invasiveness, a high angiogenic response, and a 90 - 100 % incidence of lung metastases when inoculated S. C. into syngeneic mice. Ultrastructural and immunocyto-chemical analysis revealed characteristic features of carcinomas. Our data suggest that F 3 II is less differentiated and more aggressive than the original tumor line, supporting the notion that mammary carcinomas are heteroge-neous neoplasms and contain subpopulations with diverse biologic behav-ior. The F 3 II mouse mammary sarcomatoid carcinoma line is a suitable model to examine antiinvasive, antiangiogenic, and antimetastatic agents. 0 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Using {{high-throughput}} gene-expression profiling technology, {{we can now}} gain {{a better}} understanding of the complex biology that is taking place in cancer cells. This complexity is largely dictated by the abnormal genetic makeup of the cancer cells. This abnormal genetic makeup can have profound effects on cellular activities such as cell growth, cell survival and other regulatory processes. Based on the pattern of gene expression, or molecular signatures of the tumours, we can distinguish or subclassify different types of cancers according to their cell of origin, behaviour, and the way they respond to therapeutic agents and radiation. These approaches will lead to better molecular subclassification of tumours, the basis of personalized medicine. We have, to date, done whole-genome microarray gene-expression profiling on several hundreds of kidney tumours. We adopt a combined bioinformatic approach, based on an integrative analysis of the gene-expression data. These data are used to identify both cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular pathways that are deregulated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For example, we have identified the deregulation of the VHL-hypoxia pathway in clear-cell RCC, as previously known, and the c-Myc pathway in aggressive papillary RCC. Besides the more common clear-cell, papillary and chromophobe RCCs, we are currently characterizing the molecular signatures of rarer forms of renal neoplasia such as carcinoma of the collecting ducts, mixed epithelial and stromal tumours, chromosome Xp 11 translocations associated with papillary RCC, renal medullary carcinoma, mucinous tubular and <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> and a group of unclassified tumours. Continued development and improvement in the field of molecular profiling will better characterize cancer and provide more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of drug response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that apoptosis can prevent and control growth of neoplastic cells. Previous studies in-vitro {{have shown that the}} pro-apoptotic P 2 X 7 receptor regulates growth of epithelial cells. The specific objective {{of the present study was}} to understand to what degree the P 2 X 7 system controls development and growth of skin cancer in vivo, and what cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in the P 2 X 7 action. Methods Skin neoplasias in mice (papillomas, followed by squamous <b>spindle-cell</b> <b>carcinomas)</b> were induced by local application of DMBA/TPA. Experiments in-vitro utilized cultured epidermal keratinocytes generated from wild-type or from P 2 X 7 -null mice. Assays involved protein immunostaining and Western blots; mRNA real-time qPCR; and apoptosis (evaluated in situ by TUNEL and quantified in cultured keratinocytes as solubilized DNA or by ELISA). Changes in cytosolic calcium or in ethidium bromide influx (P 2 X 7 pore formation) were determined by confocal laser microscopy. Results (a) Co-application on the skin of the P 2 X 7 specific agonist BzATP inhibited formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papillomas and carcinomas. At the completion of study (week 28) the proportion of living animals with cancers in the DMBA/TPA group was 100 % compared to 43 % in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. (b) In the normal skin BzATP affected mainly P 2 X 7 -receptor – expressing proliferating keratinocytes, where it augmented apoptosis without evoking inflammatory changes. (c) In BzATP-treated mice the degree of apoptosis was lesser in cancer than in normal or papilloma keratinocytes. (d) Levels of P 2 X 7 receptor, protein and mRNA were 4 – 5 fold lower in cancer tissues than in normal mouse tissues. (e) In cultured mouse keratinocytes BzATP induced apoptosis, formation of pores in the plasma membrane, and facilitated prolonged calcium influx. (f) The BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore-formation and augmented calcium influx had similar dose-dependence for BzATP. (g) Pore formation and the augmented calcium influx were depended on the expression of the P 2 X 7 receptor, while the BzATP-induced apoptosis depended on calcium influx. (h) The BzATP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by co-treatment with inhibitors of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3, but not of caspase- 8. Conclusion (a) P 2 X 7 -dependent apoptosis is an important mechanism that controls the development and progression of epidermal neoplasia in the mouse. (b) The P 2 X 7 -dependent apoptosis is mediated by calcium influx via P 2 X 7 pores, and involves the caspase- 9 (mitochondrial) pathway. (c) The diminished pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP in mouse cancer keratinocytes is possibly the result of low expression of the P 2 X 7 receptor. (d) Activation of P 2 X 7 -dependent apoptosis, e. g. with BzATP could be a novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modality for papillomas and epithelial cancers in vivo. </p...|$|R

Nasal tumors were first {{detected}} after 621 days' exposure at 12 ppm with an incidence of 11 % in males and 4. 4 % in females. No nasal tumors were found at 1 ppm in rats exposed for 24 months. The nasal tumors, mostly epidermoid carcinomas, were derived from the respiratory epithelium and nasal glands, both of which revealed squamous metaplasia or dysplasia in the anterior nasal cavity. Most nasal tumors were confined to the anterior nasal cavity and occasionally invaded the dorsonasal bones and posterior nasal cavity. The undifferentiated glandular cells appear to differentiate to neoplastic squamous cells, because the ultrastructure of epidermoid carcinoma revealed traits of glandular cell differentiation in the neoplastic squamous cells. The features of glandular cell differentiation in the neoplastic squamous cells were intercellular or intracellular glandular lumens, secretory vesicles, mucus droplets, and intermediate cells showing both glandular and squamous differentiation. Squamous cells in the well-differentiated epidermoid carcinomas revealed abundant tonofibrils, desmosomes, glycogen particulates, and interdigitated cytoplasmic processes. These markers of squamous-cell differentiation were markedly reduced in the undifferentiated epidermoid <b>carcinomas.</b> The <b>spindle-cell</b> squamous <b>carcinoma</b> showed both squamous and fibroblastic-like differentiations.
