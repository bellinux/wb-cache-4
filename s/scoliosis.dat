5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b> In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal <b>scoliosis</b> looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Bolt {{reveals that}} he has {{suffered}} from <b>scoliosis,</b> a condition that has curved his spine {{to the right and}} has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.|$|E
5|$|Gasol {{canceled}} {{his original}} plans {{to observe a}} surgery when he came down with a low-grade fever {{the day before the}} operation, not wishing to risk infecting anyone at the hospital. He was able to reschedule his observation for June 2010, witnessing Skaggs lead a team operating on a 13-year-old girl from Colorado with <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe <b>scoliosis</b> of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. An object {{that appeared to be}} an arrowhead was found under the spine and the skull had severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset <b>scoliosis.</b> Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, <b>scoliosis,</b> and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, <b>scoliosis</b> (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had <b>scoliosis.</b> A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for <b>scoliosis,</b> muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> {{can appear}} at {{different}} ages. Infantile idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> that appear from the birth to 3 years old, account for 0.5% of idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b> Juvenile idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> that appear from the 4 to 10 years old, account for 10.5% of idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b> Adolescent idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> that appear {{after the age}} of 10 years, account for 89% of idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b> From these statistics, it seems that individuals are at highest risk of developing idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> during adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Congenital and {{idiopathic}} <b>scoliosis</b> {{that develops}} {{before the age}} of 10 is referred to as early onset <b>scoliosis</b> (EOS). <b>Scoliosis</b> that develops after 10 is referred to as adolescent idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{idiopathic}} <b>scoliosis</b> {{accounts for}} 80–90% of <b>scoliosis</b> cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of erector spinae motor map location in the motor cortex {{may be involved in}} this disease. Besides, idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, intervertebral disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic <b>scoliosis,</b> although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{candidate}} gene {{studies have found}} associations between idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> and genes mediating bone formation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue structure. Several genome-wide studies have {{identified a number of}} loci as significantly linked to idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b> In 2006 idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene (encoding for Matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> were identified through a genome-wide association study.|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> {{represents}} {{a majority of}} cases, but its causes are largely unknown. Results of recent studies indicate potential heritability of the disorder. About 38% of variance in <b>scoliosis</b> risk is due to genetic factors, and 62% {{is due to the}} environment. The genetics are likely complex however, given the inconsistent inheritance and discordance among monozygotic twins. The specific genes that contribute to development of <b>scoliosis</b> have not been conclusively identified. At least one gene, CHD7, has been associated with the idiopathic form of <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When <b>scoliosis</b> is suspected, {{weight-bearing}} full-spine AP/coronal (front-back view) and lateral/sagittal (side view) X-rays {{are usually}} taken {{to assess the}} <b>scoliosis</b> curves and the kyphosis and lordosis, as these can also be affected in individuals with <b>scoliosis.</b> Full-length standing spine X-rays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the <b>scoliosis,</b> and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at three- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, MRI investigation is warranted {{to look at the}} spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>scoliosis</b> due to neuropathic and myopathic {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} a loss of muscular support for the spinal column so that the spinal column is pulled in abnormal directions. Some conditions which may cause secondary <b>scoliosis</b> include muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord trauma, and myotonia. <b>Scoliosis</b> often presents itself, or worsens, during an adolescent's growth spurt and is more often diagnosed in females than males.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{angle is}} a common measure to {{classify}} <b>scoliosis.</b> The greater the angle, the more serious is the disease but the smaller {{is the number of}} patients. One to three out of every hundred people have idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> curves greater than 10° with an equal proportion of boys and girls. One to three out of every thousand people have idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> curves greater than 30° with a ratio of eight girls for every one boy.|$|E
25|$|People who {{initially}} present with <b>scoliosis</b> are examined {{to determine whether}} the deformity has an underlying cause. During a physical examination, the following are assessed to exclude the possibility of underlying condition more serious than simple <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monitoring for <b>scoliosis</b> is also important, since {{weakness}} of the trunk muscles can lead to deviations in spinal alignment, with resultant compromise of respiratory function. Many patients with congenital myopathies may eventually require surgical treatment of <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Scoliosis</b> is also {{classified}} {{according to}} the region(s) they affect. The vertebral column can be deformed at the thoracic level, at the lumbar level or at both. In the lumbar region, <b>scoliosis</b> induces perturbations to standing balance. The thoracic region is the location that most impacts movement strategies. <b>Scoliosis</b> impedes on {{the movement of the}} ribs, places the respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage and displaces the various organs of the thoracic cavity.|$|E
25|$|Because scoliotic {{people have}} higher joint laxity {{compared}} to non-scoliotic people, they are drawn toward gymnastics but {{the practice of}} gymnastics for less than 20 hours training per week does not cause <b>scoliosis.</b> Based on populations that had more than 20 hours training per week, idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> has been observed among 10% of tennis players, 16% of young swimmers and 24% in professional ballet companies. The exposure {{of the body to}} high repetitive mechanical constraints may influence the occurrence of idiopathic <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Scoliosis</b> affects 2–3% of the United States population, {{which is}} {{equivalent}} to about 5 to 9 million cases. A <b>scoliosis</b> spinal column's curve of 10° or less affects 1.5% to 3% of individuals. The age of onset is usually between 10 years and 15 years (can occur at a younger age) in children and adolescents, making up to 85% of those diagnosed. This is seen {{to be due to}} rapid growth spurts occurring at puberty when spinal development is most relenting to genetic and environmental influences. Because female adolescents undergo growth spurts before postural musculoskeletal maturity, <b>scoliosis</b> is more prevalent among females. Although fewer cases are present today using Cobb angle analysis for diagnosis, <b>scoliosis</b> remains a prevailing condition, appearing in otherwise healthy children. Incidence of idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> (IS) stops after puberty when skeletal maturity is reached, however, further curvature may proceed during late adulthood due to vertebral osteoporosis and weakened musculature.|$|E
25|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} <b>scoliosis</b> (AIS) has {{no clear}} causal agent, and is generally {{believed to be}} multifactorial. The prevalence of <b>scoliosis</b> is 1% to 2% among adolescents, however the likelihood of progression among adolescents with a Cobb angle of less than 20° is about 10% to 20%.|$|E
25|$|Kyphoscoliosis, a {{combination}} of kyphosis and <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Scoliosis</b> braces {{are usually}} comfortable, {{especially}} when well designed and well fitted, also after the 7- to 10-day break-in period. A well fitted and functioning <b>scoliosis</b> brace provides comfort {{when it is}} supporting the deformity and redirecting the body into a more corrected and normal physiological position.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scoliosis</b> is {{abnormal}} {{curvature of}} the spine.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{idiopathic}} <b>scoliosis</b> {{also depends}} upon {{the severity of the}} curvature, the spine’s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild <b>scoliosis</b> (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated with exercise. Moderately severe <b>scoliosis</b> (30–45 degrees) in a child who is still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.|$|E
25|$|The patient’s age at {{presentation}} of <b>scoliosis,</b> the remaining growth, the menarche {{status and the}} magnitude of the curve are used to foresee the idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> curve progression. However, the relative importance of each factor and how they may interact is not clearly defined. The earlier the <b>scoliosis</b> appears, the more likely it will progress. Though it is recommended that idiopathic scoliotic people should practice a sport for aerobic exercise and development of a positive body image, practice of a sport at a competitive level is to be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{secondary}} <b>scoliosis</b> is the degenerative <b>scoliosis</b> which develops {{later in life}} secondary to degenerative (may {{or may not be}} associated with aging) changes. This is a type of deformity that starts and progresses because of the collapse of the vertebral column in an asymmetrical manner.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{longitudinal}} studies {{reveal that the}} most common form of the condition, late-onset idiopathic <b>scoliosis,</b> causes little physical impairment other than back pain and cosmetic concerns, even when untreated, with mortality rates similar to the general population. Older beliefs that untreated idiopathic <b>scoliosis</b> necessarily progresses into severe (cardiopulmonary) disability by old age have been refuted by later studies.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{indicated}} by the Society on <b>Scoliosis</b> Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) at 45 degrees to 50 degrees and by the <b>Scoliosis</b> Research Society (SRS) at a Cobb angle of 45 degrees. SOSORT uses the 45-degree to 50-degree threshold {{as a result of}} the well-documented, plus or minus five degrees measurement error that can occur while measuring Cobb angles.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{coordination}} may be present. Those affected {{appear to}} have higher rates of <b>scoliosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{skeletal}} abnormalities, such as <b>scoliosis</b> (sometimes {{caused by}} spina bifida) {{might be possible}} contributors as well.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimated}} 65% of <b>scoliosis</b> {{cases are}} idiopathic, about 15% are congenital and about 10% are secondary to a neuromuscular disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scoliosis</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as a biomechanical deformity, the progression of which depends on asymmetric forces otherwise known as the Heuter-Volkmann law.|$|E
