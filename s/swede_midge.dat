5000|$|Adult <b>swede</b> <b>midges</b> are yellowish-brown {{and up to}} 2 mm long, {{and live}} {{for up to three}} days. During this time the female lays about one hundred eggs in several batches on the leaves of {{suitable}} host plants. The eggs need moisture to hatch and the larvae emerge in between one and ten days at [...] respectively. They feed for between one and three weeks, again depending on temperature, and produce a gall. When fully grown they descend to the soil and either pupate in an oval cocoon at a depth of about 5 cm or, in adverse weather conditions, become dormant in a globular cocoon buried deeper in the soil. The adults emerge one and a half to seven weeks after pupation and there are several generations each year.|$|R
50|$|Host {{plants for}} the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> include cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, {{kohlrabi}} {{and a number}} of wild plants in the brassica family including shepherd’s purse, field penny-cress, field peppergrass and yellow rocket. When a seedling or young plant is attacked, the larvae conglomerate and secrete saliva which softens the plant cuticle and epidermis, sucking in the resulting fluid. On a leaf stalk, this damages the tissues and results in the formation of a corky gall. The undamaged side of the stalk continues to grow normally which results in twisting and distortion. The growing point can be completely killed and secondary bacterial infections can occur. If the infection occurs in the flowering stage of cauliflower, it causes a stunted, multi-branched, tuft-like appearance of the flower-head.|$|E

40|$|In Quebec, the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii), a newly {{invasive}} pest, {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in 2003. During a two year study (2004 - 2005) I studied the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> the presence of natural enemies and tested entomopathogenic nematodes for its control. Results showed that the overwintering generation of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> emerged during the second half of June. Based on adult captures and abundance of larvae in the field, there were three to four overlapping generations. Late transplants were more heavily attacked by the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> and broccoli and cauliflower were the most susceptible crops. No parasitoids were found in the experimental sites during either year of the study and two polyphagous coccinellid predators (Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata) were field-collected for further evaluation under laboratory conditions. Although these two coccinellid species fed on <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae in plastic containers, further experiments demonstrated that H. axyridis was not able to prey on <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae on infested broccoli plants. The susceptibility of <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae to three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) was also evaluated in laboratory assays. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was the only species that caused significant mortality to <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae and, at a concentration of 1000 IJs/larva, caused 90 - 100 % mortality in loam, sandy loam, clay and muck soil. This is the first study describing the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> in Quebec.

40|$|With the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii) as {{our main}} model species, we study {{two types of}} {{olfactory}} cues that are of importance for gall midges: 1) the pheromones emitted by the female to attract the male; 2) and the host plant volatiles that the females use when finding a host for oviposition. We found that both the blend of compounds and the enantioisomeric form are important for male attraction in the wind tunnel and in the field. For pheromone reception, the gall midges use the sensillum type that display sexual dimorphism, male <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> use the gall midge specific sensilla circumfila while the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) use s. trichodea. In a detailed study of the female host finding behavior, we found that olfactory cues are important for the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> host selection. However, this "first impression" can be modulated by later plant characters, such as the physical defense of the host plant, or which host plants are available. By using the electrophysiological technique GC-EAD, we compared the response of 12 gall midge species, including the <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> to a blend of 45 plant volatiles to explore the relative impact of host plant chemistry, life-history strategies and the midge phylogeny on the gall midge host plant recognition system. ...|$|E

40|$|Early {{detection}} of pest infestation {{is a prerequisite}} for sustainable crop protection. However, many pest species are difficult to detect and thus infestation is diagnosed from damage observed on the respective crop. This diagnosis is often made too late for implementation of crop protection measures, and serious crop losses may result. The <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> Contarinia nasturtii Kieffer, is a major pest of Brassica L. (Brassicaceae) vegetables in Europe that has recently invaded North America. With its small size and short adult life-span, and the cryptic lifestyle of the larvae feeding at the growing points of its host plants, it is usually detected only after damage has already occurred. Furthermore, because field-trapped specimens are rarely fully intact, it is extremely difficult to identify. Therefore, we developed a species-specific molecular diagnostic method that enables reliable identification of <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> from various sources such as alcohol or sticky glue traps. The method enables large-scale screening of field-trapped specimens and is used to evaluate the attractiveness and specificity of pheromone traps that are currently under developmen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{exclusion}} fences on the colonization of broccoli and kohlrabi by the <b>Swede</b> <b>midge,</b> Contarinia nasturtii (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). The <b>Swede</b> <b>midge</b> Contarinia nasturtii (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) {{is an important}} and wide spread pest in Europe. In Swiss organic vegetable production only the expensive product “Audienz“ (active matter: Spinosad) is permitted. In addition, netting the entire crop surface can exclude the Swede midges from crops, {{but it has a}} negative influence on the microclimatic conditions and the labour and capital cost are often too high. Since it is known, that several vegetable key pest species spread within the crop or only a few centimetres above it, the use of vertical exclusion fences has been developed in Canada. The objective of our study was to exclude C. nasturtii from the crops by using a similar, but cheaper prototype of exclusion fence. The studies were undertaken on two fields (broccoli and kohlrabi) and the effect of the fences (fenced in area: 15 x 20 m for broccoli, 7. 5 x 20 m for kohlrabi; height of fences: 1. 4 m with a 0. 25 m overhang; 4 replications each field) was compared with an untreated control and with a treatment of „Audienz“ (3 applications, 0. 5 l/ha). At harvest the damages were assessed by classifying the symptoms of 100 plants per treatment and replication in three (kohlrabi) or four (broccoli) categories. Inside the fences 100 plants near the fence and 100 plants in the centre were visually controlled. The exclusion fences significantly reduced the damages caused by the <b>Swede</b> <b>midge.</b> The treatment of “Audienz“ reduced the damages, too, but in the broccoli trial, “Audienz“ had a significantly lower effect than the fences. The effectiveness of “Audienz” with 36. 4...|$|E
40|$|Monoculture {{agriculture}} {{has developed}} {{as a result of}} the Western agricultural growth model, which emphasizes reduced on-farm labor and maximum yield. As a result soil health, which is reliant on a diversity of soil-dwelling organisms, is compromised, pest problems are intensified, and biodiversity is lost when vast land areas are devoted to simplified vegetation schemes. There has been a tremendous rise in interest in alternative cropping schemes. The traditional practice of intercropping has received renewed interest as the emphasis on agricultural growth shifts from a purely development-based model to one of conservation and enhanced biodiversity. Although intercropping has shown promising results in controlling specialist herbivorous insects, how intercropping works is not known. Theories that explain the underlying mechanism of intercropping success include chemical repellency and physical masking. We tested these two theories by creating a simulated intercropping system in mesocosm cages in a laboratory environment. We tested twenty intercrops that varied in their vegetation type, size, and phylogenetic distance for their ability to repel an insect pest that recently invaded into North America, the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii), from its host plant, Brassica oleracea. We found that different non-host plant treatments significantly influenced larval abundance, which indicates that C. nasturtii responded to some aspect of the varying plant combinations. We found that phylogenetic distance did not influence larval densities. Additionally, non-host plant height and leaf area of non-host plants did not influence larval densities. We found that vegetation type significantly affected larval densities. Brassica oleracea planted in combination with groundcover non-host plants had the fewest number of larvae, followed by B. oleracea planted in combination with vegetables. The highest number of larvae was found on B. oleracea plants planted in combination with herb non-host plants. Our research did not support a chemical repellency or visual masking theory of intercrop success...|$|E
