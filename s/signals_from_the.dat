5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 {{separated from the}} upper stage of the Dnepr into a low Earth orbit. The first <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> satellite were detected by a ground station at the Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.|$|E
5|$|During the encounter, <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{spacecraft}} required 246minutes {{to reach}} Earth. Hence, {{for the most}} part, Voyager 2 mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium-254 {{was used}} as the {{calibration}} marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer ("alpha-scattering surface analyzer") of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> marker and the studied lighter elements of the lunar surface.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{cellular}} {{interactions that}} control the differentiation of dorsal cell types from neural progenitors have been examined in neural plate explants. Certain genes that are expressed in the dorsal neural tube are initially expressed uniformly within the neural plate and appear to achieve their dorsal restriction through a Sonic hedgehog (SHH) -mediated repressive <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> notochord. The acquisition of definitive dorsal cell fates, however, requires a contact-dependent <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> epidermal ectoderm. BMP 4 and BMP 7 are expressed in the epidermal ectoderm, and both proteins mimic its inductive activity. BMP 4 and a related gene, DSL 1, are subsequently expressed by cells in the dorsal neural tube. The differentiation of dorsal cell types, therefore, appears to be initiated at the neural plate stage and to involve the opponent activities of a BMP-mediated dorsalizing <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> epidermal ectoderm and a SHH-mediated ventralizing <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> notochord...|$|R

5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver 2 was {{composed}} by Kurt Harland, of American band Information Society, and Jim Hedges. Harland and Hedges had already collaborated on Soul Reaver, but Hedges {{had not previously}} contributed compositions. The adaptive audio framework from the previous game returned; depending on <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game in certain situations—such as combat, puzzles, danger or suspense—the game's soundtrack actively changes. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{vagus nerve}} and from nerves {{arising from the}} sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} role of EFS as a CAS-family member function is transmission of integrin-initiated <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extracellular matrix to downstream effectors, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in motility and invasion. The SH3 domain {{is a point of}} contact with polyproline sequences on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). or the related kinase PTK2B, also known as RAFTK/Pyk2/CAKβ. Typically, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of CAS proteins by FAK or PTK2B creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of a SRC-family protein, which then hyper-phosphorylates the substrate domain, allowing the CAS protein to function as a scaffold for other proteins including CRK proteins and C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1. PTP-PEST, a soluble protein tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in mice both during embryonic development and in adult tissues, opposes FAK and PTK2B activity, as it dephosphorylates PTK2B, FAK and CAS family members, among other proteins. The PTP-PEST proline-rich sequence 332PPKPPR337 has been shown to interact directly with the SH3 domain of members of EFS and another CAS protein, NEDD9.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning}} of 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E

5|$|Kurt Harland {{composed}} most of {{the music}} for Soul Reaver; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to change based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires {{was associated with a}} slow, thumping theme to convey a sense of working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. <b>Signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
