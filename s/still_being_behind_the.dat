50|$|In 1959, the Empire {{installed}} new 70mm projectors {{and a new}} {{screen in}} front of the proscenium to show Ben-Hur, which ran for 76 weeks. Following this, in 1961 the Empire was closed for extensive internal reconstruction to a design by Architect George Coles; almost all the original ornate plasterwork was removed with only two small sections remaining, hidden behind false walls and ceilings--one section <b>still</b> <b>being</b> hidden <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> IMAX auditorium side wall.|$|R
40|$|The old picture environment, {{introduced}} by Leslie Lamport into the L ATEX kernel almost 20 years ago, {{appears to be}} neglected {{in favor of more}} modern and powerful L ATEX packages that eliminate all drawbacks of the original environment. Nevertheless it is <b>still</b> <b>being</b> used <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes by a number of other packages. Lamport announced an extension in 1994 that should have removed all the limitations of the original environment; in 2003 the first version of this extension appeared; in 2004 the first stable version was released; in 2009 it was actually expanded with new functionality. Nowadays the picture environment can perform like most simple drawing programs, but it has special features that make it invaluable...|$|R
50|$|In {{gridiron}} football, ineligible receiver downfield is {{a penalty}} {{that is called}} when a forward pass is thrown and an ineligible receiver is beyond {{the line of scrimmage}} without blocking an opponent {{at the time of the}} pass. An exception is on screen plays where the ineligible player is allowed to cross the line of scrimmage to go out and block because the ball is <b>still</b> <b>being</b> caught <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> line of scrimmage. This exception, however, does not apply to the NFL. A member of the offensive team considered an eligible receiver by the rules of the game, in most leagues, are the running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. Ineligible receivers include the center, offensive guards, and offensive tackles.|$|R
30|$|In the experiments, we {{used the}} P 220 UWB radar of Time Domain Company as the {{detection}} tool, and it worked in monostatic mode wherein the waveform pulses were transmitted from a single omnidirectional antenna and scattered waveforms were acquired by a collocated omnidirectional antenna. In the project, the P 220 UWB radar was working with a center frequency of 4.3  GHz. In this project, data were collected at three different locations with different types of walls which were brick wall and gypsum wall. The radar parameters were the same and were as follows: hardware integration[*]=[*] 512, software integration[*]=[*] 2, pulse repetition frequency 9.6  MHz, step size 13 bin, and window size 10  ft. The echo signals were collected at two statuses: no person <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wall and a <b>still</b> human <b>being</b> standing <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
5000|$|Prime Minister Lukšić, {{then the}} {{youngest}} {{prime minister in}} the world, faced a double challenge: modernizing society and implementing reforms, while maintaining the political stability {{of the country and}} respecting traditions set by previous governments at the same time. As a result, regardless of his statements that his decisions were independent of the former President and Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, many still regarded the latter as a figurehead, and argued that the country was <b>still</b> <b>being</b> run from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes by Milo Djukanovic. Lukšić responded to the question from Reuters news agency, in his first interview to the foreign media after his confirmation as Prime Minister, saying, [...] "I am in charge. I will always, when I find it necessary, consult with many people ... But I would not accept doing this job if I had to bear all the responsibility and if the decisions were made somewhere else." [...] Lukšić's political credo was to govern by clear, precise and applicable rules, with the objective of leaving less room for discretionary decision making and corruption. While he said, [...] "Montenegrin society has relied throughout its entire history on strong personalities", his main aim was to create trust in political institutions instead. One of his top priorities was to achieve Montenegro's membership of the European Union as soon as possible. To speed up this process he demanded changes in values in society, and more individual initiatives than state interference. In his inaugural speech, he stated, [...] "The Government cannot and should not be the solution to all of society's problems and shortcomings; it should be accountable and efficient in carrying out its constitutional and statutory obligations. I will require everyone to be accountable for his part in the task, so that we all individually and jointly contribute to Montenegro’s overall development." ...|$|R
