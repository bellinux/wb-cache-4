40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of positron technology the efficiency of positron utilization is less than 1 %. The low efficiency is primarily due to positron destruction during moderation. Emitted positrons must be filtered through a moderator material to restrict the re-emitted positrons to a useable and defined energy range. The quantum mechanical nature of solidified hydrogen holds the potential to increase the moderator efficiency an order of magnitude over solid neon-the current leader in moderator efficiency. However the characteristics of solid hydrogen as a positron moderator have never been investigated. This paper discusses the design of an experimental cryostat to create solid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>targets</b> for positron beam studies. The design is constrained by the sublimation pressure of the solid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>target</b> exceeding the vacuum pressure of the positron accelerator, and the ability to control hydrogen crystal growth and quality.

A liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>target</b> was used to produce Ξ- hyperons via the reaction K- + p → K+ +Ξ-.

40|$|Ion-ion {{collisions}} at relativistic energies {{have been}} shown recently to be a promising technique {{for the production of}} hypernuclei. In this article, we further investigate the production of light Λ hypernuclei by use of a hybrid dynamical model, cascade-coalescence followed by Fermi breakup. The predictions are then compared with the available experimental data. The dependence of the production cross section upon the beam energy, beam mass number as well as different projectile-target combinations is investigated. In particular, we evaluate the yields and signal-over-background ratio in the invariant-mass spectrum for carbon projectiles impinging on <b>hydrogen</b> and carbon <b>targets</b> and various coincidence conditions in the experiment using the theoretical calculation as an input. It is found that comparing with carbon <b>target,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>target</b> also leads to sizable hypernuclear yields, even for exotic species, and the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>target</b> could improve significantly signal-over-background ratio in some hypernuclear invariant mass studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 2. 5 m long liquid <b>hydrogen</b> <b>target</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for the COMPASS experiment at CERN to investigate the nucleon spin structure via the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) process.
