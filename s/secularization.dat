5|$|From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was {{on several}} {{occasions}} the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being {{responsible for most of}} the reforms associated with Cuza's reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu became involved in the scandal involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza's <b>secularization</b> of the monastery estates. In 1863, <b>secularization</b> was imposed by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which came together with the universal abolition of corvées.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{missions}} {{were actually}} located along the Santa Ana River or within the watershed, the river basin was nearly depleted of native people because the Spanish {{forced them to}} work at nearby missions, including Mission San Gabriel Arcangel and Mission San Luis Rey. The affected tribes were usually renamed after the missions, resulting in tribal names such as Gabrieliño and Luiseño. Difficult working and living conditions and European diseases such as smallpox killed much of the native population during the roughly 50-year-long Mission Period. The <b>Secularization</b> Act of 1833, passed by the newly independent country of Mexico, eventually brought {{an end to the}} Mission Period. The post-Mission Period native population was almost entirely devastated. The population was very little, their native religions were nearly lost, and most of their land had been taken by Spanish settlers. Although the Mexican government's original intention with the <b>Secularization</b> Act was to provide the Native Americans with their own land and property, most of the provisions made by the act never actually happened. Spanish settlers continued to press into the remaining tribal lands, and eventually, the tribes were forced into the surrounding desert lands or into the high mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, <b>secularization,</b> law, sexuality and deviance. As all spheres {{of human activity}} {{are affected by the}} interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, education, social capital and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.|$|E
5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by battening onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. The scars of the Viking raids had healed, but the <b>secularization</b> of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|Ygnacio {{then moved}} to the Monterey Presidio and {{was in charge of}} the <b>secularization</b> of Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Francisco de Asís. He became a trusted officer, enough to be left in charge of the Presidio in José Figueroa's absence. For his service to the Mexican Army, del Valle {{received}} the Rancho El Tejon land grant in 1843. During this time, he married Maria de Los Angeles in 1842, who died in childbirth five years later.|$|E
5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and <b>secularization</b> of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the <b>secularization</b> of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals {{were opposed to}} the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and <b>secularization.</b> The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political groups would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E
5|$|The Order's landmeister and gebietiger, {{as well as}} {{the owners}} of Livonian estates, were all lesser nobles who guarded their {{privileges}} and influence by preventing the creation of a higher, more powerful noble class. Only the archbishopric of Riga successfully overcame resistance of the lesser nobles. Wilhelm von Brandenburg was appointed as archbishop of Riga and Christoph von Mecklenburg as his coadjutor, {{with the help of his}} brother Albert (Albrecht) of Brandenburg–Ansbach, the former Prussian hochmeister who had secularised the southern Teutonic Order state and in 1525 established himself as duke in Prussia. Wilhelm and Christoph were to pursue Albert's interests in Livonia, among which was the establishment of a hereditary Livonian duchy styled after the Prussian model. At the same time the Order agitated for its re-establishment ("Rekuperation") in Prussia, opposed <b>secularization</b> and creation of a hereditary duchy.|$|E
5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased <b>secularization</b> of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). <b>Secularization</b> has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E
5|$|Other powers {{aspiring}} to the Livonian Baltic access responded by partitioning the Livonian state, which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, {{and soon the}} Danes and Swedes had occupied {{other parts of the}} country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians now sought a union with the Polish–Lithuanian state. Gotthard Kettler, the new Grand Master, met in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish king. The Union of Vilnius called for <b>secularization</b> of the Brothers of the Sword Order and incorporation of the newly established Duchy of Livonia into the Rzeczpospolita ("Republic") as an autonomous entity. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was also created as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. Sigismund II obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers, which had led to grueling wars with Russia (1558–1570 and 1577–1582) and heavy struggles also concerning the fundamental issues of control of the Baltic trade and freedom of navigation.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute. The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of <b>secularization</b> of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E
25|$|The first hypothesis, <b>secularization,</b> {{holds that}} science and {{technology}} will {{take the place of}} religion. <b>Secularization</b> supports the separation of religion from politics, ethics, and psychology. Taking this position even further, Taylor explains that <b>secularization</b> denies transcendence, divinity, and rationality in religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|As the Mexican {{republic}} matured, {{calls for}} the <b>secularization</b> ("disestablishment") of the missions increased.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the <b>secularization</b> hypothesis. His argument hinges {{on the premise that}} religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding <b>secularization</b> {{due to a lack of}} need for religion. However, religion continues in the third world where social and economic insecurity are rampant. The overall effect is expected to be a growing cultural disparity.|$|E
25|$|The Crimean Karaites' {{emancipation}} in the Russian Empire caused {{cultural assimilation}} followed by <b>secularization.</b> This process {{continued in the}} USSR {{when most of the}} kenesas were closed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the advice}} of her learned correspondents, Catherine {{introduced}} a number of changes, ranging from the vast <b>secularization</b> of monastic properties to the domestic reform which envisioned more rational planning for the Russian towns.|$|E
25|$|Mexico gained {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, but the civil and religious institutions of Alta California remained {{much the same}} until the 1830s, when the <b>secularization</b> of the missions converted most of the mission pasture lands into private land grant ranchos.|$|E
25|$|The capital {{attracts the}} largest {{proportion}} of non-Catholic migrants from other countries. Increased <b>secularization</b> in Ireland has prompted {{a drop in}} regular Catholic church attendance in Dublin from over 90 percent in the mid-1970s down to 14 percent according to a 2011 survey.|$|E
25|$|Governor José Figueroa (who {{took office}} in 1833) {{initially}} attempted to keep the mission system intact, but the Mexican Congress passed An Act for the <b>Secularization</b> of the Missions of California on August 17, 1833 when liberal Valentín Gómez Farías was in office.|$|E
25|$|After the Mexican War of Independence (1821) and {{subsequent}} <b>secularization</b> ("disestablishment") of the missions (1834), Mexican land grant transactions increased {{the spread of}} the rancho system. The land grants and ranchos established mapping and land-ownership patterns that are still recognizable in present-day California and New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{familiar}} starting-point, {{a classical}} model of <b>secularization,</b> argues that religious faith becomes less plausible and religious practice more difficult in advanced industrial and urbanized societies. The breakdown or {{disruption of traditional}} communities and norms of behavior; the spread of a scientific world-view diminishing {{the scope of the}} supernatural and the role of God; increasing material affluence promoting self-reliance and this-worldly optimism; and greater awareness and toleration of different creeds and ideas, encouraging religious pluralism and eviscerating commitment to a particular faith, all form components of the case for <b>secularization.</b> Applied to the British churches in general by Steve Bruce and to Methodism in particular by Robert Currie, this model traces decline back to the Victorian era and charts in the twentieth century a steady ebbing of the sea of faith.|$|E
25|$|Olbian {{monetary}} art {{between the}} last third of the 5th century BC and the final quarter of the 4th century BC is characterized by a phenomenon typical of the Hellenistic era: <b>secularization,</b> promotion of aesthetic principles and the spread of an archaistic style enhancing the sacred nature of the image depicted.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{significant}} <b>secularization</b> since 20th century, {{notably in}} laicist France, Estonia and Czech Republic. Currently, distribution of theism in Europe is very heterogeneous, {{with more than}} 95% in Poland, and less than 20% in the Czech Republic and Estonia. The 2005 Eurobarometer poll found that 52% of EU citizens believe in God.|$|E
25|$|Not {{to be left}} out, the German {{areas to}} the west of the Rhine had already gone through a process of {{separation}} of church and state in line with a radical <b>secularization</b> after annexation by revolutionary and Napoleonic France in 1794. After their return to Germany in 1814, many if not most of the changes were kept in place.|$|E
25|$|Francis remarks how {{religion}} has become privatized and purely personal through the <b>secularization</b> of society (EG 64). In this atmosphere one's devotional life can fall into sentimentality, bringing personal comfort without encounter with others or an evangelizing spirit (EG 78). He criticizes people who promote such privatized devotion while neglecting {{the formation of}} the laity toward the advancement of society (EG 74).|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Sweden {{departed}} from its neutrality {{and laid the}} foundations of its later overseas empire. In {{the last year of}} Gustav's life, 1560, the ancient Livonian Order, had by the <b>secularization</b> of the latter order into the dukedom of Prussia, 1525, had become isolated between hostile Slavonians. The situation became critical in 1558–1560, when floods of Muscovites poured over the land, threatening the whole province with destruction.|$|E
25|$|The Kurdish ethnonationalist {{movement}} that emerged following World War I {{and end of}} the Ottoman empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical <b>secularization</b> which the strongly Muslim Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.|$|E
25|$|Challenges to the <b>secularization</b> {{hypothesis}} led {{to significant}} revisions, {{resulting in the}} religious transformation hypothesis. This perspective holds that general trends towards individualism and social disintegration will produce changes in religion, making religious practice more individualized and spiritually focused. This in turn is expected to produce more spiritual seeking, although not exclusive to religious institutions. Eclecticism, which draws from multiple religious/spiritual systems and New Age movements are also predicted to result.|$|E
25|$|In European {{countries}} which were most profoundly {{influenced by the}} Reformation, Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion. These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, it {{remains one of the}} most popular religions. Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing <b>secularization.</b> Over the last several decades, religious practice has been declining as <b>secularization</b> has increased. According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 12% of the EU population. According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 17.8%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010. Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15% of all Europeans in 2009, while Noll claims that less than 12% of them lived in Europe in 2010.|$|E
25|$|This {{model of}} a secularist state protects the {{religious}} institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims {{to protect the public}} power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of <b>secularization</b> of public discourse.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1960s, a <b>secularization</b> {{movement}} {{changed the}} nature of the college. Concurrent with dwindling financial support from the United Presbyterian Church, the college removed the Church Synod’s role in nominating and confirming trustees, thus opening the door for the cultivation of new trustees with stronger business acumen and financial resources than those during the college’s earlier days. The college did otherwise maintain its covenant relationship with the Church.|$|E
25|$|The Arroyo Seco region can be {{considered}} by historical accounts as the birthplace of Pasadena. After the 1820s <b>secularization</b> of the Missions, the broad area {{to the east of}} the Arroyo was the Mexican land grant of Rancho San Pascual, present-day Pasadena, California. Manuel Garfias was the grantee of the Rancho and its longest early resident. His adobe house was on the east ridge of the Arroyo, in present-day South Pasadena.|$|E
25|$|The Mission {{entered a}} long period of gradual decline after Mexican <b>secularization</b> act of 1833. Though {{numerous}} restoration efforts in the intervening periods have reconstructed many of the original structures. The old mission church remains in use as a chapel of Saint Joseph Catholic Church, a parish of the Diocese of Oakland. The museum also features a visitor center, museum, and slide show telling the history of the mission.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Atatürk's reforms {{follow the}} Ottoman Empire's Tanzimât period, meaning reorganization, {{that began in}} 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876, {{as well as the}} various efforts of <b>secularization,</b> democratization, and {{modernization}} during the Second Constitutional Era from 1908 to 1913. Another set of social, economic, and administrative reforms set forward under the accession of Turkey to the European Union which was made on 14 April 1987.|$|E
