Ant-Man comes out this summer and will have come and gone before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time we can put little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s happening now, it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

Eventually, more legislation, changing styles, and continued education stopped the killing of birds for hat decoration and clothing.|$|R
