5|$|In 1781, Kempelen {{was ordered}} by Emperor Joseph II to {{reconstruct}} the Turk and deliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife.

5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding. This experiment was <b>so</b> <b>successful,</b> 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The 1907 Tour de France {{incorporated}} 14 stages, {{which was}} one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included. The mountain stages in 1906 had been <b>so</b> <b>successful,</b> according to the organiser Henri Desgrange, that the western Alps {{were included in the}} race for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) {{will lay}} {{eggs in a}} willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> brood parasitism is rare. Parasitism by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) has also been reported.|$|E

50|$|The {{new version}} of the cloture rule {{requiring}} three-fifths (60%) rather than two-thirds (66.7%) approval, which has remained in place since 1975, makes it considerably easier for the Senate majority to invoke cloture. Even <b>so,</b> a <b>successful</b> cloture motion is uncommon.|$|R
5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only}} a vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the island}} rebuilt from the 1900 storm, {{legitimate}} business interests attempted {{to expand the}} economy by rebuilding tourism and further diversifying from shipping. Important non-entertainment businesses included insurance, hotels, banks, shipping, and commercial fishing.Obadele-Starks (2000), p. 4. The medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals of the University of Texas Medical Branch were a stable sector on the island throughout the 20th century. The Moody family built one of the largest hotel empires in the U.S., and their American National Insurance Company (ANICO) was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that it actually grew—tremendously—during the Depression.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{was founded}} in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece of {{equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It proved <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that, as they grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E

Mayer, upon his return from a European trip, decreed that both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's contract option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|H.M.S. Pinafore was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that Carte soon {{sent two}} {{additional}} companies out to {{tour in the}} provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. This was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Following the defeat, Capua {{and several other}} Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E

A Muslim force {{seized the}} fortress known in Arabic as Qastaliasali (probably Castelluccio on the island's northern coast), but were driven {{away by a}} Byzantine counter-attack. The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, raided the Aeolian Islands and seized a number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris. In the meantime, another cavalry raid was dispatched against the region of Etna and was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the price for Byzantine captives plummeted.|$|E
5|$|Modern Swedish (Swedish: nysvenska) {{begins with}} the advent of the {{printing}} press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible, a translation deemed <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.|$|E
5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank engines in 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the engines in use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s.|$|E
60|$|The {{experiment}} was <b>so</b> far <b>successful</b> that Maitland left the queer bare slit {{of a place}} called his bedroom (formed, like many Oxford bedrooms, by a partition added to the large single room of old times), and moved into the weirdly aesthetic study, decorated in the Early William Morris manner.|$|R

5|$|The {{tactic of}} {{continuous}} forward patrolling was <b>so</b> <b>successful</b> that the advancing force's every move {{was known to}} the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were {{within striking distance of}} Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.|$|E
