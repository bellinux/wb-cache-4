5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E
25|$|According to Nelson, {{conditions}} at the Virginia prison were <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> that the warden, an idealistic Quaker from Maine, believed the prisoners, {{many of whom had}} been arrested on trivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as laborers to private contractors. (He subsequently changed his mind about this and became an opponent of the convict labor system.) Nelson asserts that a steam drill race at the Big Bend Tunnel would have been impossible because railroad records do not indicate a steam drill being used there.|$|E

25|$|This {{extraordinary}} instrument, a prehistoric-looking {{combination of}} horn and harp created by Gaston, produces a sound <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> and loud that it causes physical destruction all around and panics animals and even fighter jet pilots. Like {{the voice of}} the bard Cacofonix in Asterix, it horrifies everyone except its originator. The first time the instrument appears, the plucking of just one string causes the floor to collapse. Gaston has also created at least one other instrument in the same vein, and an electric version of the Gaffophone. Fantasio has tried several times {{to get rid of the}} Gaffophone, without success.|$|E
25|$|For those, such as Nwokolo, {{who escaped}} from Ibadan and Western Nigeria, the {{experience}} was <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> that twenty-one specialist doctors mainly from Ibadan and Lagos met and resolved to eatablish a University Teaching Hospital in Enugu. At the meeting were doctors: Nwokolo, Onuaguluchi, Udekwu, Nwako, Nwachukwu, Eziashi, Ikeme, Udeh, Ogan, Uche, Okoro, Kaine, Udeozor, Okafor, Njoku-Obi, Ifekwunigwe, and others. Multiple long planning meetings were held at Nwokolo‟s private residence. Through Dr. Nlogha Okeke plus permanent secretary and chief secretary to the government: chief Onyegbula, approval was rapidly obtained from the military governor: Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu to open a teaching hospital with Enugu General Hospital as base. Ojukwu also approved swift establishment of the faculty of medicine, headed by professor Kodilinye, while Nwokolo became the first {{head of the department}} of medicine and associate dean of medicine at the new medical school.|$|E

60|$|And <b>so</b> a <b>terrible</b> unrest pervaded {{the whole}} {{household}} after {{the receipt of}} Jaspar Bellew's note.

500|$|The Merrimac {{drove her}} spur against the Monitor, which {{received}} the awful shock motionless and unhurt. [...] Now {{they were so}} close that the guns fired into each others' mouths: at length the Confederate got a wound which made her hail the others to tow her into Norfolk. [...] After <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> a conflict for several hours against heavy artillery, the Monitor showed only a few dinges and scratches. [...] The Merrimac's spur scarcely marked her side.|$|E

[...] Two balls from the Monitor entered her adversary's cuirass; as soon as the wind cleared away the smoke the Monitor was seen running round Merrimac, looking for a vulnerable point, the vessels being about 35 yards apart ...|$|E
500|$|The {{seasonal}} {{changes in}} the Columbia's flow, high in summer and low in winter, affected Celilo Falls dramatically. Lewis and Clark reached Celilo Falls in the late autumn when the water was relatively low, turning the falls into a major barrier. In contrast, when David Thompson passed Celilo Falls in July 1811, the high water obscured the falls and made his passage through the Columbia Gorge relatively easy. Modeste Demers wrote about the seasonal change in 1839: [...] "One may be astonished to learn that these chutes, <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> at low water, are smooth and still at very high water, which does not happen every year. Then it is that, instead of fearing them, the voyageurs hasten to approach them, to light their pipes and rest." [...] More difficult was the Long Narrows, or Big Dalles, ten miles below Celilo Falls. This section of the river was impassable during high water. During the autumn low water they were passable but with unloaded boats only, and even then the passage was very dangerous. [...] "They are never passed without dread," [...] wrote François Blanchet in 1839. Narcissa Whitman asserted in 1836 that over one hundred [...] "white lives" [...] had been lost at the Dalles.|$|E

500|$|By mid-1858 the {{problems}} with the Thames had been building for several years. In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was <b>so</b> <b>terrible.</b> The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: ...|$|E

2500|$|A 10th-century Vita sancti Aegidii recounts that, as Giles was celebrating Mass {{to pardon}} the Emperor Charlemagne's sins, an angel {{deposited}} upon the altar a letter outlining a sin <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> Charlemagne had never dared confess it. Several Latin and French texts, including the Legenda Aurea {{refer to this}} hidden [...] "sin of Charlemagne".

2500|$|Though many {{considered}} Ludwig peculiar, {{the question}} of clinical insanity remains unresolved. The prominent German brain researcher Heinz Häfner has disagreed with the contention that there was clear evidence for Ludwig's insanity. Others believe he may have suffered {{from the effects of}} chloroform used in an effort to control chronic toothache rather than any psychological disorder. His cousin and friend, Empress Elisabeth held that, [...] "The King was not mad; he was just an eccentric living in a world of dreams. They might have treated him more gently, and thus perhaps spared him <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Poona (1885), [...] The year 1791-92, though locally {{a year of}} plenty, was <b>so</b> <b>terrible</b> a year {{of famine}} {{in other parts of}} India that the rupee price of grain rose to twelve pounds (6 shers). [...] In the next year, 1792-93, no rain fell till October, some people left the country and others died from want. [...] The {{distress}} {{is said to have been}} very great. [...] The Peshwa's government brought grain from the Nizam's country and distributed it at Poona. The rupee price of grain stood at eight pounds (4 shers) in Poona for four months and in the west of the district for twelve months.|$|E

[...] When Bentreshyt became pregnant she told the High Priest who the father was.
