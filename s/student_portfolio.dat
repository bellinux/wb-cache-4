Various forms of student assessments have been employed in modern classrooms in accordance with varying theoretical perspectives on what “meaningful learning ” consists of. Authentic assessments have often been considered productive tools for increasing student engagement, learning, and confidence.

40|$|<b>Student</b> <b>portfolios</b> are {{increasingly}} used for assessing student competences in higher education, but results about {{the construct validity}} of portfolio assessment are mixed. A prerequisite for construct validity is that the portfolio assessment is based on relevant portfolio content. Assessment criteria, are often used to enhance this condition. This study aims to identify whether assessment criteria can improve content, argumentation and communication during teacher moderation while judging <b>student</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Six teachers scored 32 <b>student</b> <b>portfolios</b> in dyads with and without assessment criteria. Their judgement processes were qualitatively analysed. Results indicated that the quality of their judgement processes was low, since teachers based their judgements mainly on their own personal opinion and less on evidence found in the portfolio. Teachers barely paid attention to quality checks and easily agreed with each other. When teachers used assessment criteria, the quality of their judgements slightly improved. They based their judgements more on relevant evidence, used less personal experiences and more often checked the quality of their judgement processes. It is concluded that the quality of teacher portfolio judgement is low, and that the use of assessment criteria can enhance its qualit...|$|R

The purposes of this study were to examine the state and problems in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment, as well as to propose guidelines for solving the problems. A sequential mixed method design was employed. Questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data from two hundred and forty-two elementary school teachers on the state and problems in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment. A focus group interview was conducted to collect qualitative data from three experts on the guidelines for solving problems in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment in elementary schools. Descriptive statistics, content analysis, and analytic induction were employed to analyze the data. Results indicated that, overall, teachers implemented five main steps of the <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment in a medium level. The common problems in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment were (a) a lack of knowledge and deep understanding of teachers in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment, (b) a poor attention and cooperation of students in creating the portfolios, and (c) a lack of materials and budgets to support teachers in implementing <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment.

40|$|The {{idea for}} the {{creation}} of an electronic <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) grew from a desire to provide students with greater evidence of their achievements than could be displayed by an academic transcript alone. Concerns were raised that exiting students were themselves not familiar with the full complement of skills they had developed throughout their university career, a lack of awareness which would have clear implications for a successful transition to graduate employment. Electronic portfolios typically encourage reflective processes, metacognitive connections across the full range of student experiences and student-centred learning, enabling students to understand their overall learning experience beyond the confines of individual units and assessment marking grids. As such, they enable a holistic view of the individual’s current skill sets and areas for further development, and of how student experiences relate to their future professional roles. The QUT <b>Student</b> <b>Portfolio</b> was introduced university-wide in 2004. Since that time, the Portfolio has been implemented in multiple Schools and Faculties. The range of applications for the Portfolio has far exceeded the original vision for the tool. This paper will provide an overview of the QUT <b>Student</b> <b>Portfolio</b> project, and will highlight the innovative and multiple applications of the tool to date...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect {{information}} from Baccalaureate College II administrators, to determine whether portfolios were used at each institution and whether portfolios were included in these institutions 2 ̆ 7 overall assessment plans. Specific questions related to the acceptability of planned portfolio assessment for accreditation were also raised. Secondarily, for those institutions where portfolios were used for classroom assessment, student outcome assessment or both, information about the mechanics of construction, management, and evaluation of student portfolios was collected. Three hundred ninety-five administrators from all Baccalaureate Colleges II responded in the first round of the study, with 202 indicating use of student portfolios at their institutions. One hundred six responded to the second round survey, regarding <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment practices for classroom and for institutional accountability purposes. These results indicated that student portfolios were being used by approximately 50 percent of the population. Administrators reported a variety of contents and construction, management and evaluation strategies. Administrators also reported an overall positive response from accreditors, administrators, faculty and students. Administrators cited the ability to view learning developmentally/longitudinally and the increased power of portfolios, as compared to single measures of student achievement as the two most important driving forces towards using student portfolios. The labor intensity required of faculty and storage and management were identified as the two biggest drawbacks to using student portfolios. There were very limited effects of mandatory assessment and student assessment portfolios on graduations rates. Finally there was no significant difference in the budgetary allowances for assessment between those institutions which reported using <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment information and those which reported non-use of <b>student</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment information for institutional accountability decisions.
