40|$|Non-motor {{symptoms}} are now commonly recognized in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and can include dysautonomia. Impairment of cardiovascular autonomic function can occur at any stage of PD but is typically prevalent {{in advanced stages}} or related to (anti-parkinsonian) drugs and can result in atypical blood pressure (BP) readings and related symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension (OH) and supine hypertension. OH is usually diagnosed with a head-up-tilt test (HUT) or an (active) standing test (also known as <b>Schellong</b> <b>test)</b> in the laboratory, but 24 hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) in a home setting may have several advantages, such as providing an overview of symptoms in daily life alongside pathophysiology as well as assessment of treatment interventions. This, however, is only possible if ABPM is administrated correctly and an autonomic protocol (including a diary) is followed. which {{will be discussed in}} this review. A 24 hr ABPM does not only allow the detection of OH, if it is present, but also the assessment of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction during and after various daily stimuli, such as postprandial and alcohol dependent hypotension, as well as exercise and drug induced hypotension. Furthermore, information about the circadian rhythm of BP and heart rate (HR) can be obtained and establish whether or not a patient has a fall of BP at night (i. e. ‘dipper’ vs. non-‘dipper’). The information about nocturnal BP may also allow the investigation or detection of disorders such as sleep dysfunction, nocturnal movement disorders and obstructive sleep apnea, which are common in PD. Additionally, a 24 hr ABPM should be conducted to examine the effectiveness of OH therapy. This review will outline the methodology of 24 hr ABPM in PD, summarize findings of such studies in PD and briefly consider common daily stimuli that might affect 24 Hr ABPM...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal {{variations}} in blood pressure, {{heart rate and}} pressure rate product were analyzed in 68 hospitalized diabetics (male 42, female 26) and 33 hospitalized controls (male 21, female 12) to investigate the influence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy on hemodynamics. The severity of autonomic damage was assessed by measuring the variabilities in R-R intervals of 100 consecutive heart beats in ECGs during quiet and deep breathing in the supine position and with the <b>Schellong</b> <b>test.</b> According to the results, the diabetics were divided into three groups: Normal ANS (31 patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy), Abnormal PS (27 patients with parasympathetic damage alone) and Abnormal PS+S (10 patients with both parasympathetic and sympathetic damage). The blood pressure and heart rate of all subjects were recorded for 24 hours under near-basal conditions using an ambulatory blood pressure recording device (Pressurometer® Ⅱ, Del Mar Avionics, USA). The patterns of diurnal variations and the diurnal variabilities in blood pressure, heart rate and pressure rate product were analyzed in 22 control, 21 normal ANS, 20 abnormal PS and 10 abnormal PS+S patients. The effects of atropine sulfate (2. 0 mg daily, p. o.) were also studied in 11 control, 10 normal ANS and 11 abnormal PS patients {{to determine the effect}} of parasympathetic nerve damage on the variations. Hourly mean heart rates during the daytime and mean 24 -hour heart rates were not different among the groups. However, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was a significant reduction in the diurnal variation in heart rates, with greater mean night heart rates and greater hourly minimum mean heart rates. On the other hand, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was {{a significant increase in the}} diurnal variation in the systolic blood pressure. However, diastolic blood pressure varied to the same extent regardless of the severity of autonomic nerve damage. The diabetics with autonomic neuropathy had significantly greater hourly mean and mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pressure rate product. The diurnal variation in the pressure rate product was similar to the heart rate results. Indices of the diurnal {{variations in}} heart rate and systolic blood pressure in controls and normal ANS patients approached those of abnormal PS patients after atropine sulfate administration. This result suggests that damage to the cardiac parasympathetic nerve plays a major role in the changes in the diurnal variations in heart rate and systolic blood pressure observed in diabetics...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} patients with Parkinson's disease who showed loss or decrease of nocturnal blood pressure fall (nondipper patients) as a marker of autonomic dysfunction. Presence or absence of orthostatic hypotension was considered to investigate whether alterations in circadian blood pressure pattern are associated with posture-related dysregulation of blood pressure. Methods. 40 patients with Parkinson's disease underwent 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring. 21 patients were diagnosed with arterial hypertension and received anti-hypertensive drugs. Nondipper patients were defined as having nocturnal decrease of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than 10 %. Presence or absence of orthostatic hypotension was determined by <b>Schellong's</b> <b>test.</b> Results. We identified 35 nondipper patients (88 %). Nondipping was detected in 20 patients with orthostatic hypotension (95 %) and in 15 patients without orthostatic hypotension (79 %). 18 patients with hypertensive and 22 patients with normal blood pressure values were detected. Conclusions. In conclusion 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring showed a high prevalence of nondipping in 40 patients with Parkinson's disease with and without orthostatic hypotension independent of coexisting arterial hypertension and antihypertensive treatment. 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring may be useful to identify non-dipping as a marker of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease...|$|R
