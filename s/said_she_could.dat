25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably good eye contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E
500|$|At {{his first}} {{departure}} from 10 Downing Street in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield {{in her own}} right in lieu of a peerage for himself. Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer. [...] She died on 15 December. [...] Urged by a clergyman to turn her thoughts to Jesus Christ in her final days, she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not: [...] "You know Dizzy is my J.C."

Carmella returns for two episodes in March 2011. Blair <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not resist the return, which acts as a catalyst in Rebecca Robinson's (Jane Hall) departure. Blair felt it fitting because both Carmella and Oliver have history with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and want to [...] "protect Rebecca and watch out for her best interests".|$|E

On February 22, 2016, Billboard reported that the video cost an estimated $12 million, {{making it one of}} the most-expensive music videos ever made. About $8 million was used to buy airtime, with the remainder spent on production.|$|E
500|$|In The Bling Ring (2013), Watson {{stars as}} Nicki. The film {{is based on}} the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a {{television}} personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played [...] "exaggerated versions of themselves" [...] and Watson memorably dropped the [...] "f-bomb". She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not pass up the opportunity to make her first comedy and [...] "work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now".|$|E

500|$|Gillard came {{to office}} in the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. Government receipts fell during the international downturn and the Rudd Government had employed pump priming expenditure. Upon taking over as leader of the Labor Party on 24 June 2010, Gillard <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "assure" [...] Australians that the Federal Budget would be in surplus in 2013. The Government continued to promise this outcome until December 2012. Gillard initially ruled out a [...] "carbon tax" [...] but said that she would build community consensus for a price on carbon and open negotiations with the mining industry for a re-vamped mining profits tax. Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the Labor Party elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the Clean Energy Act 2011. The government also introduced a revised Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the Queensland Flood Levy.|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

500|$|In 2017, author Timothy Tyson {{released}} {{details of}} a 2008 interview with Carolyn Bryant, during which she disclosed that she had fabricated the most sensational part of her testimony. [...] Tyson stated: [...] "she said {{with respect to the}} physical assault on her, or anything menacing or sexual, that that part isn't true". [...] She also said: [...] "nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him". [...] The 72-year-old Bryant <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not remember the rest of the events that occurred between her and Till in the grocery store. [...] Tyson said that Roy Bryant had been verbally abusive toward Carolyn, and [...] "it was clear she was frightened of her husband". Bryant described Milam as [...] "domineering and brutal and not a kind man". [...] An editorial in The New York Times said: [...] "This admission is a reminder of how black lives were sacrificed to white lies in places like Mississippi. It also raises anew the question of why no one was brought to justice in the most notorious racially motivated murder of the 20th century, despite an extensive investigation by the F.B.I." ...|$|E

Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has no need to be angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was just what she needed to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We want to see her flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E
500|$|At a July 2009 Hollyoaks press day, series {{producer}} Lucy Allan {{announced that}} there would be a [...] "big stunt" [...] involving schizophrenic character Barry [...] "Newt" [...] Newton (Nico Mirallegro) in October of that year. It was later revealed that a new character, Rae, would join the serial as part of a [...] "shock suicide plot" [...] involving Newt, in which the two characters would jump off a bridge. Alice Barlow's casting as Rae was announced in October 2009. Barlow stated that she was [...] "absolutely on top of the world" [...] to receive the part, particularly as one of her childhood dreams was to appear in a soap opera. Helen Russell-Clark– who went on to play Jem Costello in the serial– also auditioned for Rae, and reached the final stages of casting. Allan said Rae was one of her favourite additions to the cast in 2009 and expressed her pride in Barlow's performance, saying, [...] "to introduce a character as somebody and then to completely change the character six weeks later, while still delivering the performances that Alice does, is a testament to a young actress." [...] In early 2011, Barlow decided to leave Hollyoaks to pursue other projects. Her departure was kept secret until her exit scenes were aired. Barlow described her time with the programme as [...] "the perfect end" [...] to her teenage years and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not [...] "have asked for anything better." ...|$|E
