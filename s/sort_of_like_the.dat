500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{features}} a satirical {{portrayal of the}} South Korean government as bureaucratic, inept, and essentially uncaring. Korean youth protesters are featured satirically in the film, in a mixed way, partially heroic and partially self-righteous and oblivious. According to Bong Joon-ho, the Park Nam-il character is a deliberate anachronism, a reference to South Korea's troubled political history, which involved violent protest. [...] "When you look {{in terms of this}} character, it's <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> feeling of time going backwards.

2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to Q from [...] and said, [...] "Her entire existence is so {{unlike that of}} ours that she really has to learn about {{what we think of}} as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." [...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] one of the first people we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

[...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films."
