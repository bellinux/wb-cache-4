40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to design and {{construct}} an encoder and decoder for RS codes. FPGA is the recommended hardware platform. Learning outcomes:  Learn what the types of error correcting codes are and how they operate.  Understand the parameters and limitations of error correcting codes.  Gain a deep understanding of the encoding and decoding processes.  Design and implement a system to achieve the encoding and decoding.  Learn how to implement a system on an FPGA. In the current world, communication has got many applications such as telephonic conversations. in which the messages are encoded into the communication channel and then decoding it at the receiver end. During the transfer of message, the data might get corrupted due to occurrence of lots of disturbances in the communication channel. So {{it is necessary for}} the decoder tools to have a function of correcting the error that might occur. Reed Solomon codes are type of burst error detecting codes which has got many applications due to its burst error detection and correction nature. The aim of the project is to implement this reed Solomon codes in a Spartan 3 AN FPGA <b>Starter</b> kit (<b>supported</b> with XC 3 S 700 AN). To accomplish this check one can start with calculating read Solomon code by hand and then going for simulation in XILINX writing the VHDL code. The encoder and decoder design of reed Solomon codes have got different algorithms. Based on your requirements you can use those algorithms. The difference between the algorithms is in the calculations methods used within them. The complexity of the code depends on which algorithm used. The simulation result of vhdl codes is constituted in ModelSim simulator...|$|R
50|$|Office Starter 2010 was an ad-supported {{product that}} was {{discontinued}} in June 2012, {{prior to the}} release of Office 2013 and Windows 8. It included Word Starter and Excel Starter, reduced-functionality versions for viewing, editing, and creating documents. Office Starter 2010 was only available to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to preload on Windows PCs and was intended as a replacement for Microsoft Works; it is only compatible with Windows Vista and Windows 7. Office Starter 2010 omits several features available in the retail editions of Microsoft Office. Word Starter cannot insert footnotes, endnotes, citations, indexes, captions, equations, or SmartArt, and does not support customizations, macros, change tracking, full screen reading, or digital rights management. Excel <b>Starter</b> does not <b>support</b> PivotTables, PivotCharts, custom views, external data connections, error checking, calculation steps, or circular references.

5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run <b>support</b> <b>starter</b> Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a three-run homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|R
40|$|Adolescent-aged {{individuals}} with intellectual disabilities often struggle {{to learn and}} to demonstrate socially appropriate behaviors and interactions among their peers and within their community. As a result, they are dependent upon others to engage or interact in social situations. It is often difficult for these individuals to achieve acceptance and establish a sense of belonging. Such an ongoing deficiency can lead to depression and loneliness. The purpose of this project is to provide educators and {{parents of children with}} intellectual disabilities an age-appropriate resource, which teaches and models correct social behaviors in manners and foundational etiquette. This project has been designed to address and contribute to the limited resources currently available for this audience. The goal of the project includes the design and provision of an age appropriate video model of pro-social behaviors for adolescent-aged {{individuals with}} intellectual disabilities. The researcher determined that an easy-to-access website that provides animated social stories which model and demonstrate correct social behaviors, manners, and interactions in a clear and succinct manner would be of benefit to those in need. The videos are not for stand-alone instruction, but instead provided as a supplementary tool. Furthermore, the website also offers lesson plan suggestions, materials, and conversation <b>starters</b> to <b>support</b> the use of the videos. Review of the current literature supports this rationale for the project, particularly in the areas of a) social skill deficits defined and described, b) reports regarding the outcomes of social skills training, and c) substantiating research to validate the effectiveness of video modeling and social stories. 	Many special educators do not have the time available to focus on social due to the necessary time requirements for academic and life skill instruction. As a result, when students transition into adulthood, they do not possess the aptitude to engage in social conversations, use good manners when eating, shopping, working, etc., and possess a limited understanding of how to interact and control impulses when in social situations. Due to these deficiencies, they require support and assistance as adults. With proper intervention that includes a visual model of the behavior, practice, role-play, and consistent instruction, these individuals can improve their aptitude in the acquisition of these skills needed to independently exercise acceptable behavior in social situations.

40|$|Systems Biology {{studies the}} {{temporal}} and spatial 3 D distribution of macromolecular complexes with the aim that such knowledge will allow more accurate modeling of biological function and will allow mathematical prediction of cellular behavior. However, {{in order to accomplish}} accurate modeling precise knowledge of spatial 3 D organization and distribution inside cells is necessary. And while a number of macromolecular complexes may be identified by its 3 D structure and molecular characteristics alone, the overwhelming number of proteins will need to be localized using a reporter tag. GFP and its derivatives (XFPs) have been traditionally employed for subcelllar localization using photoconversion approaches, but this approach cannot be taken for obligate anaerobic bacteria, where the intolerance towards oxygen prevents XFP approaches. As part of the GTL-funded PCAP project (now ENIGMA) genetic tools have been developed for the anaerobe sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris that allow the high-throughput generation of tagged-protein mutant strains, with a focus on the commercially available SNAP-tag cell system (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), which is based on a modified O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) tag, that has a dead-end reaction with a modified O 6 -benzylguanine (BG) derivative and has been shown to function under anaerobic conditions. After initial challenges with respect to variability, robustness and specificity of the labeling signal we have optimized the labeling. Over the last year, {{as a result of the}} optimized labeling protocol, we now obtain robust labeling of 20 out of 31 SNAP strains. Labeling for 13 strains were confirmed at least five times. We have also successfully performed photoconversion on 5 of these 13 strains, with distinct labeling patterns for different strains. For example, DsrC robustly localizes to the periplasmic portion of the inner membrane, where as a DNA-binding protein localizes to the center of the cell, where the chromosome is located. Two other proteins - Thiosulfate reductase and ATP binding protein were found to be cytoplasmically distributed, whereas a molybdenum transporter was found to locate to the cell periphery. We judge labeling outcome by (1) SDS gel electrophoresis, followed by direct fluorescence imaging of the gel to address specificity of labeling/confirm expected molecular weight, and subsequent Coomassie analysis to ensure comparable protein levels (2) fluorescence intensity of culture by plate reader for statistical sampling (after adjustment for respective cell numbers) and (3) fluorescence microscopy for addressing cell-to-cell signal variation and potential localization patterns. All three assays were usually found to be consistent with one another. While we have been able to improve the efficacy of photoconversion by drastically reducing (eliminating) non-specific binding with our altered labeling protocol, we are currently working on reducing non-specific photoconversion reaction arising occasionally in non-labeled cells. In addition, we have confirmed the presence of SNAP tagged constructs in three recently cloned E. coli strains under promotor control, and are in the process of utilizing them for evaluating the sensitivity of the photoconversion protocol. Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting was successfully applied to labeled E. coli cells containing SNAP tagged AtpA protein. Different batches of sorted cells, representing low and high labeling intensity, were re-grown and re-labeled and displayed a labeling efficiency similar to the <b>starter</b> culture, <b>supporting</b> the notion that cell-to-cell differences in labeling reflect difference in protein expression, rather then genetic differences...|$|R
