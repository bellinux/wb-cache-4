5|$|<b>Superoxide</b> dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} <b>superoxide</b> anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. <b>Superoxide</b> dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on <b>superoxide),</b> while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the <b>superoxide</b> released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with <b>superoxide</b> dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is needed}} by the body {{for a number of}} functions, {{predominantly}} as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, <b>superoxide</b> dismutase and tyrosinase.|$|E
5|$|Potassium reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion, potassium forms peroxides and <b>superoxides.</b> These peroxides may react violently with organic compounds such as oils. Both peroxides and <b>superoxides</b> may react explosively with metallic potassium.|$|R
5000|$|Li and Mg form only normal oxides whereas Na forms {{peroxide}} and metals below Na, in addition, form <b>superoxides.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{alkali metals}} react with oxygen to form several {{different}} compounds: suboxides, oxides, peroxides, <b>superoxides,</b> and ozonides. They all react violently with water.|$|R
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces <b>superoxide</b> or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as <b>superoxide</b> dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium forms {{a number}} of oxides when exposed to air, {{including}} rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the <b>superoxide</b> RbO2. Rubidium forms salts with halides, producing rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.|$|E
40|$|UV light–based {{damage to}} skin cells can cause photoaging and skin cancer. A {{major cause of}} UV light–induced damage to skin is {{increased}} free radicals, such as <b>superoxides.</b> Increased <b>superoxides</b> can cause oxidative and nitrative damage to cell components. Thus, agents that counteract these damages may have therapeutic value. Herein, we show that angiopoietin- 1 (ang 1) prevented and blocked H 2 O 2 -induced increases in <b>superoxides</b> in human spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte line, HaCaT, and primary melanocytes (HeMn). Ang 1 prevented H 2 O 2 -induced increases in damage to DNA (8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine) and proteins (nitrotyrosinylation). Ang 1 promoted skin cell metabolism/viability, adhesion, and akt and MAPKp 42 / 44 activations. Using multi-gene transcriptional profiling, we found that skin cells express integrin subunits {(β 1, β 4 – 6, β 8, αv, α 2, α 3, α 6 (HaCaT)), (β 1, β 3, β 5, β 8, αv, α 3 (HeMn)) } and lack tie 2 receptor mRNA. Integrin antibodies (αv, β 1) disrupted skin cell adhesion to ang 1 and ang 1 -induced decreases in <b>superoxides.</b> Our findings show that ang 1 blocks free radical damage to skin cells and may be clinically useful to prevent and/or reduce photoaging and skin cancer...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Superoxides</b> are {{compounds}} {{in which the}} oxidation number of oxygen is −. The O-O bond distance in [...] is 1.33 Å, vs. 1.21 Å in O2 and 1.49 Å in [...]|$|R
50|$|Lastly, due {{to recent}} experiments, {{it seems that}} Nox2 also plays an {{important}} role in angiotensin II-mediated inward remodelling in cerebral arterioles due to the emittance of <b>superoxides</b> from Nox2-containing NADPH oxidases.|$|R
5|$|The {{market for}} sodium is {{volatile}} {{due to the}} difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium <b>superoxide.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium <b>superoxide,</b> , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} {{oxidative}} state, {{plants and animals}} maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., catalase and <b>superoxide</b> dismutase) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.|$|E
30|$|Sahreen S. et al. {{carried out}} an {{investigation}} on {{the fruits of}} C. opaca and reported that polyphenols and flavonoids had potent antioxidant activities in scavenging DPPH, <b>superoxides,</b> hydroxyl, hydrogen peroxide, and ABTS radicals, and had strong iron chelating activity [81].|$|R
30|$|It is {{possible}} {{that in addition to}} external gaseous oxidizers, some metals, their higher oxides, <b>superoxides,</b> ozonides, sulphides, chlorates as well as sulfur could, apparently, act as condensed oxidizing components, included in the composition of aerosol nanobatteries during their spontaneous air synthesis.|$|R
40|$|With {{potentially}} neuroprotective properties, heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{has been}} suggested {{to be the main}} mediator of cholesterol-independent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of statins. However, we had demonstrated that simvastatin-induced HO- 1 increased apoptosis of Neuro 2 A cells in glucose deprivation, and iron production from HO- 1 activity may be responsible for the toxicity. This study was designed to explore the effect of simvastatin-induced HO- 1 on cultured Neuro 2 A and C 6 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that the HO- 1 upregulation was significantly associated with increased nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation, manifested as IkBa phosphorylation and p 65 nuclear translocation, as well as increased production of <b>superoxides.</b> Inhibition of the induced HO- 1 by zinc protoporphyrin reduced the increased NF-kB activation and <b>superoxides</b> production. RNA interference wit...|$|R
5|$|To {{counteract}} these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and antioxidant enzymes such as <b>superoxide</b> dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes <b>superoxide</b> dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of <b>superoxide</b> free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state of oxygen is −2 {{in almost all}} known compounds of oxygen. The {{oxidation state}} −1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 (<b>superoxides),</b> −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).|$|R
50|$|A human {{mission to}} Mars {{presents}} a massive engineering challenge. With Mars' surface containing <b>superoxides</b> and lacking a magnetosphere and an ozone layer to protect from {{radiation from the}} Sun, scientists would have to thoroughly understand as much of Mars' dynamics as possible before any action can be taken toward the goal of putting humans on Mars.|$|R
50|$|Neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 is an {{essential}} to NADPH oxidase complex which in turn produces <b>superoxides</b> in return to microbial infection. The binding of the Rac GTPase is a key step into the assembly of the complex and the TPRs in the phox unit mediate the assembly of the multiprotein complex by acting a binding scaffold.|$|R
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme <b>superoxide</b> dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the <b>superoxide</b> (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing <b>superoxide</b> dismutase (Mn-SOD).|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{or current}} uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in vacuum tubes, {{and as a}} photocell component. Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, {{in the production of}} <b>superoxide</b> by burning in oxygen, in the study of potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers. In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.|$|E
50|$|Plastoquinol, {{the reduced}} form, also {{functions}} as an antioxidant by reducing reactive oxygen species, some produced from the photosynthetic reactions, that could harm the cell membrane. One {{example of how}} it does this is by reacting with <b>superoxides</b> to form hydrogen peroxide and plastosemiquinone.The prefix plasto- means either plastid or chloroplast, alluding to its location within the cell.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{characteristics}} upon nitrogen-doping were differentiated in {{the activation}} of <b>superoxides</b> over single-walled carbon nanotubes. Both experimental and theoretical studies revealed that enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is ascribed to a nonradical process while persulfate (PS) activation is accelerated via directly oxidizing water, yet hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) activation is inert to N-doping. This study details the first insights into versatile N-doping in carbocatalysis for organic oxidation in sustainable remediation...|$|R
40|$|Formation of <b>superoxides</b> and oxides such as dimethylselenoxide (DMSeO) from {{oxidative}} {{reactions of}} methanselenol (CH 3 SeH) and dimethylselenide [(CH 3) 2 Se] {{is one of}} the important mechanisms causing Se toxicity in fish and waterfowl. Because of a lack of analytical methods for directly measuring the <b>superoxides</b> and oxides, the mechanisms responsible for causing deformity of fish and waterfowl have not been studied in detail. In this study, an HPLC-HG-AAS system has been used to directly measure dimethylselenoxide (DMSeO) in solution. An HPLC was used to separate DMSeO with other HG-active Se compounds such as selenomethionine (Semet) and selenite [Se(IV) ], and an optimum concentration of NaHB 4 and HCl was used in the HG system to maximally increase DMSeO signal and decrease interferences from other HG-active Se species, and AAS was used to determine it. A detection limit of DMSeO was < 5 µg/L. Recovery of spiked DMSeO in drainage water was close to 100 %. This new method will be helpful to study the mechanisms of Se toxicity in fish and waterfowl...|$|R
5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium <b>superoxide</b> is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes glutathione S-transferase and <b>superoxide</b> dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow <b>superoxide</b> Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
50|$|Aside from water, life {{also needs}} {{sources of energy}} to survive. The {{abundance}} of <b>superoxides</b> makes life {{on the surface of}} Mars very unlikely, which essentially rules out sunlight as a possible source of energy for life. Therefore, alternative sources of energy must be searched for, such as geothermal and chemical energy. These sources, which are both used by life forms on Earth, could be used by microscopic life forms living under the Mars' surface.|$|R
50|$|Upon endocytic PRR binding, actin-myosin cytoskeletal {{rearrangement}} {{adjacent to}} the plasma membrane occurs {{in a way that}} endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the PRR-PAMP complex, and the microbe. Phosphatidylinositol and Vps34-Vps15-Beclin1 signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular lysosomes, where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome. The reactive oxygen species, <b>superoxides</b> and hypochlorite bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte.|$|R
50|$|According to J. Siegel (2005), sleep {{deprivation}} {{results in the}} build-up of free radicals and <b>superoxides</b> in the brain. Free radicals are oxidizing agents that have one unpaired electron, making them highly reactive. These free radicals interact with electrons of biomolecules and damage cells. In slow-wave sleep, the decreased rate of metabolism reduces the creation of oxygen byproducts, thereby allowing the existing radical species to clear. This {{is a means of}} preventing damage to the brain.|$|R
