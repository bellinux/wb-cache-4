5000|$|The cross has a {{resemblance}} to the Military William Order and is worn with the same ribbon as that order. The shape of the cross itself is somewhat different {{in the sense that}} the cross and crown are made of non-enamelled silver. On the cross of the Military William Order a gold <b>spark</b> <b>rod</b> is shown in the middle. However, on the cross for Courage and Fidelity, a heraldic Dutch Lion is shown. Between the arms of this cross two klewangs are added. The text on the cross has the description [...] "VOOR MOED EN TROUW" [...] (for Courage and Fidelity) and at the back [...] "Daden van Moed en Trouw in Nederlands-Indië door inlanders betoond" [...] (Deeds of Courage and Fidelity in the Netherlands East Indies by natives awarded). Between the crown and cross is a <b>spark</b> <b>rod,</b> a distinguishing mark of the Order of the Golden Fleece or the Military William Order.|$|E
5000|$|Assault: This is {{the basic}} {{frontline}} soldier class, and each Assault Blast Runner can use automatic weapons like assault rifles and submachine guns. They can throw grenades or launch missiles, and also use melee weapons such as sword, spear, katana, <b>spark</b> <b>rods</b> to attack their opponents. A Blast Runner in this class equips an assault charger for high speed charges but in a short time. This class is best used from close to medium range.|$|R

500|$|Then in 1989, {{the name}} was {{purchased}} by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation, which rebranded the company as Hammond-Suzuki. Although nominally a Japanese company, founder Manji Suzuki was {{a fan of the}} instrument and retained several former Hammond Organ Company staff for research and development, and ensured that production would partially remain in the United States. The new company produced their own brand of portable organs, including the XB-2, XB-3 and XB-5.

50|$|The Hedge Fund Journal {{was formed}} in 2004 by Publisher <b>Rod</b> <b>Sparks,</b> and is based near Fleet Street, London, UK. The {{magazine}} consists of feature articles, original and contributed research, opinion and legal pieces, as well as strategy commentary from hedge fund managers. Its annual features include a ranking of the top 50 European hedge fund managers called The Europe 50, The 50 Leading Women In Hedge Funds, and Tomorrow's Titans. Since 2006, The Hedge Fund Journal has hosted an annual awards ceremony, to recognise the leading service providers to the European hedge fund industry, and expanded its awards franchise to include a UCITS awards ceremony in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Sandusky, Ohio, 1984: Eric Hunter is a Eurythmics-obsessed, musically driven {{teenager}} {{coming to}} terms with his sexual identity. When Eric and his best friend, Maggie, accept summer jobs in food service at the local amusement park, they befriend their lesbian manager, Angie, and a gay college student named <b>Rod.</b> <b>Sparks</b> fly between the two boys, even as Maggie waits patiently in the wings for Eric's affections. Eric and Rod eventually go on a date, but then Rod promptly heads back to Ohio State. The encounter leaves Eric to have mixed feelings, but he is now more sure of his sexuality. After beginning his senior year of high school, Eric starts to change up his appearance by letting Maggie dye the top half of his hair blonde, and wearing more effeminate clothes. This raises eyebrows with his loving parents, but Eric learns that his mom {{is going to get a}} part-time job at a local movie multiplex to help send him to study music in New York. While at a party with Maggie, several guys from their school call Eric gay slurs that cause him to leave.|$|R
2500|$|The {{thermonuclear}} burn {{would produce}} (like the fission fuel in the primary) pulsations (generations) of high-energy neutrons {{with an average}} temperature of 14 MeV through Jetter's cycle. The cycle {{is a combination of}} endothermic and exothermic neutronic reactions involving lithium and deuterium/tritium. The reaction's neutronicity was estimated at ~0.885 (for a Lawson criterion of ~1.5). These figures do not count the Li isotope, where the LiD has a neutronicity of ~0.835 and, along with the cross-sections, were given as group averages from about 2.40 to approximately 2.55 MeV and from 14.0 to 14.1 MeV; the small power group is not statistically present (see also Nuclear fusion). As SHRIMP, along with the RUNT I and ALARM CLOCK were to be high-yield shots required to assure the thermonuclear [...] "emergency capability", their fusion fuel may have been spiked with additional tritium, in the form of LiT. All of the high-energy 14 MeV neutrons would cause fission in the uranium fusion tamper wrapped around the secondary and the <b>spark</b> plug's plutonium <b>rod.</b> The ratio of deuterium (and tritium) atoms burned by 14 MeV neutrons spawned by the burning was expected to vary from 5:1 to 3:1, a standardisation derived from Mike, while for these estimations, the ratio of 3:1 was predominantly used in ISRINEX. The neutronicity of the fusion reactions harnessed by the fusion tamper would dramatically increase the yield of the device.|$|R
