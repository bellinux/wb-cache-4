25|$|A {{new report}} was issued in 2006 and in May 2007 Akershus County Council {{voted in favor}} of {{building}} a tramway. A contributing factor was that a large array of expert bodies, including Oslo Sporveier, the Public Roads Administration, the Institute of Transport Economics and a series of consulting companies all recommended that a people mover was not suitable. The main downsides of a people mover gradually became evident for the county politicians. These included the inability to provide a direct service to Oslo and the <b>system</b> <b>costs</b> of have a fourth rail system, in addition to a metro, tramway and mainline railway. A particular concern was that very few people chose to use public transport if there are two or more transfers, which would be reality for many with a people mover.|$|E
50|$|The flyaway cost can be meaningfully {{compared}} to another cost metric, the weapons <b>system</b> <b>cost.</b> The weapons <b>system</b> <b>cost</b> (often {{referred to as}} the procurement cost) is the total price of the aircraft. A good {{way of looking at the}} difference is the flyaway cost is the cost of making the aircraft, but the weapons <b>system</b> <b>cost</b> is the cost of buying the aircraft. Weapons <b>systems</b> <b>costs</b> may include ancillary equipment costs, one time non-recurring contract costs, and airframe, engine and avionics support costs. For example, the flyaway cost for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet up to 2009 (for the 449 units built) was US$ 57.5 million per unit, but the weapons <b>system</b> <b>cost</b> was 39.8% higher, at US$ 80.4 million per unit. The production cost of technologically complicated aircraft will always be higher during the low rate initial production period, and costs per units invariably drop as an aircraft is put into full production. The Government Accountability Office has found that the United States Department of Defense rarely achieves these cost savings because few programs move from LRIP to full-scale production.|$|R
40|$|For {{a traffic}} network with fixed demand of {{heterogeneous}} users {{in terms of}} their different values of time (VOT), the system performance can be measured either in time unit by the total system travel time (in short, system time), or in monetary unit by the total <b>system</b> travel <b>cost</b> (in short, <b>system</b> <b>cost).</b> Thus we have two different objectives for network optimization, i. e. to minimize system time and to minimize <b>system</b> <b>cost,</b> which naturally gives rise to a bi-objective minimization problem. A Pareto optimum of this bi-objective optimization problem represents a bi-criteria system optimum for network optimization in the sense that, at each Pareto optimum, neither system time nor <b>system</b> <b>cost</b> can be further reduced without increasing the other one. In this paper we prove that any Pareto optimum can be decentralized into multi-class user equilibrium by positive anonymous link tolls. We then bound the system performance gap when optimized by the two different criteria.

Conversely, when <b>system</b> <b>cost</b> is minimized, how far could the corresponding system time deviate from its minimum value?

500|$|The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, {{referred}} to as V.A.T.S., is a new element for the Fallout series and plays {{an important part in}} combat within Fallout 3. The system was introduced by Bethesda's developers, who described it as a hybrid between timeturn-based and real-time combat, so much in that while using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is paused and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of [...] "bullet time". Using the <b>system</b> <b>costs</b> action points (AP), the amount of which depends on the weapon being used and thus limiting the actions of the player's combat during a turn. Through the system, the player can not only switch between multiple targets (if {{there is more than one}} around at any time), but also target specific areas of them to inflict damage – a player could either target the head for a quick kill, go for the legs to slow an enemy's movements, or shoot at their weapons to disarm them; for some enemies, they can put them into a berserker rage by hitting specific parts. The chance of striking a different area, displayed as a percentage ratio, is dependent on the weapon being used, and the distance between the character and the target; a character who is a higher level when using V.A.T.S is also more likely to hit an enemy with the system than a lower level character. The use of V.A.T.S. does confer a negative effect, in that it eliminates most of the first-person shooter elements of the game; aiming is taken over by the computer, and the player is unable to move as a means of avoiding attacks. Furthermore, ranged weapons are capable of hitting limbs, while melee weapons focus on the target in whole when using V.A.T.S.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasons that}} CCS is {{expected}} to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing [...] significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant, and about 15% for a gas-fired plant. The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other <b>system</b> <b>costs,</b> are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects {{are likely to be}} more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage, Walker Architects published the first [...] gas CAES application, proposing the use of sequestered [...] for Energy Storage on October 24, 2008. To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined.|$|E

[...] Labor for a simple open loop system in southern climates can take 3–5 hours for the installation and 4–6 hours in Northern areas. [...] Northern system require more collector area and more complex plumbing to protect the collector from freezing. [...] With this incentive, the payback time for a typical household is four to nine years, depending on the state. [...] Similar subsidies exist in parts of Europe. A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day. [...] Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a households' operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO2 emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity). Medium-temperature installations can use any of several designs: common designs are pressurized glycol, drain back, batch systems and newer low pressure freeze tolerant systems using polymer pipes containing water with photovoltaic pumping. European and International standards are being reviewed to accommodate innovations in design and operation of medium temperature collectors. Operational innovations include [...] "permanently wetted collector" [...] operation.
