2500|$|By {{supplying}} a wide assortment in {{a single}} category for lower prices a category killer retailer can [...] "kill" [...] that category for other retailers. A category killer is a <b>specialist</b> <b>store</b> that dominates a given category. Toys [...] "R" [...] Us, established in 1957, {{is thought to be}} the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market. For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include Toys [...] "R" [...] Us and Australia's Bunnings (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and Officeworks (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen cabinetry, craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office.|$|E

50|$|By {{the fourteenth}} century the Great Wardrobe had {{branched}} into manufacturing (in addition to its duties of purchase, storage and distribution of non-perishable goods) and numbered the King's Tailor, Armourer, Pavilioner and Confectioner among its officials. Nevertheless, it still remained in essence a sub-department of the Household Wardrobe up until 1324, whereupon it gained significant autonomy by being made accountable to the Exchequer {{rather than to the}} Wardrobe of the Household. It also began to travel less with the King's Court, and, significantly, began to put down roots outside the Tower in the City of London (its staff necessarily had regular dealings with the City's merchants). This was in part due to lack of space: the Tower was becoming a <b>specialist</b> <b>store</b> and manufacturing base for arms and armour (responsibility for which soon devolved upon a new branch, the Privy Wardrobe - see below).|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} retail service varies from {{personal}} {{service to the}} provision of greater ambience. Indeed, anything that adds value to the merchandise itself can be {{considered part of the}} service provided by the retailer. The focus of this paper is on that part of retail service that involves direct interactivity between the store and the customer. There are two main types of physical interactivity, namely personal service and store design and atmosphere. This paper aims to develop constructs of these two types of interactivity and analyse their impact on store loyalty. An extra dimension is added to this study by contrasting the role of service between superstores and traditional <b>specialist</b> <b>stores</b> in two retail categories. A key finding was that the major difference between the service provided by superstores compared to traditional <b>specialist</b> <b>stores</b> relates to store design and atmosphere. This leads to the suggestion that the recent wave of superstores has ushered in a new paradigm of retail service, one with elevated emphasis on self-service principles. A further finding was that store design and atmosphere was one of the more important determinants of store loyalty. The paper shows that superstores have revolutionised the nature of retail service, mainly by more effective configuration of self-service, mediated through store design.
