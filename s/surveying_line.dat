Firstly, the solution expression of navigation error for a long range spacecraft is analyzed and modified, {{and the influence of}} the earth's gravity field on flying track of spacecraft is evaluated. Then with a given limited quota of biased error of spacecraft drop point, the accuracy requirement for calculating the external disturbing gravity field is discussed and researched. Secondly, the data truncation error and the propagated data error are studied and estimated, and the quotas of survey resolution and computation accuracy for gravity anomaly on the earth' surface are determined. Finally, based on the above quotas, a corresponding program of <b>surveying</b> <b>line</b> layout for marine gravity survey is proposed.

Guanzhuang and Leigu surveying lines are located at the northern portion of the fault belt, and the result indicates that the width of the rupture zone underground in this area is about 160 – 180 m. The center position of rupture zone underground corresponds to the surface breaking trace, and is equally distributed {{at the edges of the}} two fault walls. However, Hongkou <b>surveying</b> <b>line</b> is located at the southern portion of the fault belt, and the result indicates that the width of the rupture zone underground in this area is about 180 – 200 m.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{deformation}} zones {{have been identified}} on the hangingwall at the Kiirunavaara mine - continuous and discontinuous. The continuous deformation zone {{is characterized by a}} smooth lowering of ground surface accompanied by horizontal displacement moving {{in the direction of the}} mine to the cavity created by the mine extraction. The discontinuous deformation zone is characterized by large displacement over limited surface areas forming chimneys, steps and large tension cracks. Since the deformation of the hangingwall is time dependent, the time-displacement behaviour was independently analyzed in two directions - X (perpendicular to the ore body) and Z (vertical) using surveying data from a network of stations from twelve surveying profiles along the hangingwall. These data cover a period of time of 13 years starting from 1996 and ending in 2008. The movements along the Y-direction (parallel to the ore body) are smaller and erratic therefore they were not considered. In addition, extension strain and slope were calculated for some areas where the limit between deformation zones was not clear. Curves of time versus displacement were analyzed. In the curves three stages were identified -regressive, progressive and steady state. During the regressive stage only continuous deformation is observed in the field using monitoring systems. The progressive stage is an intermediate stage between the regressive and steady state where the first cracks appear and develop. The limit between the first two stages is defined by the on-set of failure point in the curves. The point of failure (critical vertical displacement, CVD, or critical horizontal displacement, CHD) in the hangingwall was defined using the change of stage between the progressive and steady state stages. This point also defined the limit between the continuous and discontinuous deformations zones. Although the hangingwall subsidence is extending with deeper mining levels, the results show a general tendency of decreasing rate of movement due to the increasing level of caved rock that confines and constrains the movement. This fact means that it will take a longer period of time for a point farther from the mine to reach the same displacement magnitude compared to the points closer to the mine. Today, the railway is located in the outer limit of the continuous deformation zone and therefore in the regressive stage. The ground in this area is experiencing about 2 to 5 cm of vertical and horizontal accumulated displacement. To predict further displacements and rates of movements, polynomial functions were fitted to the timedisplacement data during the regressive and progressive stages. The most representative functions for each <b>surveying</b> <b>line</b> were selected to do the forecast for nine stations located close to the railway. The result indicates that the vertical and horizontal displacements could increase to about 10 to 30 cm in the following 4 years (until 2012). This prediction was also extended to cover the whole regressive stage until the year 2018 (see Appendix C). This is a conservative forecast because it was estimated with data from points closer to the mine. No large movement or catastrophic collapse is likely to occur during the regressive phase. However, the deformation may concentrate at large geological structures and its effect needs to be evaluated to adjust the forecast. There is a documented case by Herdocia (1991) where a regional fault in Gränsgesberg mine was reactivated, thus changing the overall deformation behaviour of the hangingwall.

It provides 2 -dimensional profiles including depth and distance that simplified the characterization of relatively large volumes of the subsurface. Interpretation of seismic refraction data using seismic tomography involves continuous velocity gradient across a subsurface which is more effective for site characterization compared to conventional seismic refraction. Three parallel seismic refraction <b>survey</b> <b>lines</b> were conducted at Kaki Bukit, Perlis {{with the aim of}} characterizing the subsurface of the area. 2 m geophone spacing was used with total length of 46 m. The separation between lines is 20 m. Weight drop of 20 kg and steel plate were used as seismic source. A total of 20 shotpoints were performed for <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> L 1, 23 shotpoints for <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> L 2 and 22 shotpoints for <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> L 3. The high quality seismic data obtained were then processed using SeisOptPicker and SeisOpt 2 D software to produce a seismic tomography section for each <b>survey</b> <b>line.</b> Results indicate that the study area is said to have 4 main layers with velocity increase fairly with depth. The first layer with velocity 300 - 500 m/s predominantly consists of top soil and form overburden. Second layer with velocity 500 - 800 m/s is suggested to be a highly weathered limestone. The third layer represents by highly fractured limestone with velocity 800 - 1500 m/s. Limestone bedrock represent by the fourth layer with velocity > 2000 m/s.

30|$|Finally, we {{emphasize}} the importance of the three-dimensional analysis demonstrated here, which is crucially important for imaging a correct dipole polarization. For 2.5 -dimensional analyses using data of each single <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> with an assumption that the survey track is a straight line, the source is immediately below it, and the polarization vector is restricted to the vertical plane below it, we find a different dipole polarization (Additional file 1 : Fig. A 7).

Compass surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of <b>surveying</b> <b>lines</b> are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the <b>surveying</b> <b>lines</b> are measured with a tape or chain or laser range finder.

For each <b>survey</b> <b>line</b> in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180° if local attraction is negligible.

40|$|A {{geophysical}} survey presents many challenges. A scientist {{must be able}} to not only understand the theory and nature of the geophysics being applied but must also be able to identify features of interest in a dataset. It is also of extreme importance to be able to determine where, in the subsurface, the features identified in the data occur. This research is designed in an attempt to identify the locations of subsurface heterogeneities that affect geophysical instrument response. An experiment was conducted in which topography, magnetics, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and electromagnetic induction (EM) data were collected over a defined <b>survey</b> <b>line.</b> An excavator with a modified flat-bladed bucket was used to remove, or skim, a 5 to 10 cm thick layer of material from the <b>survey</b> <b>line.</b> Upon removal of the material, datasets from the above mentioned instruments were again collected along the same <b>survey</b> <b>line.</b> This process was repeated for 10 skims, resulting in a total of 11 sets of data for each instrument.

By observing how the anomalies changed in the data from one skim to the next, {{a better understanding of the}} location of the causative heterogeneities could be had. Data for each instrument was compared to the equivalent data collected from each subsequent skim to determine how similar or different the data appeared as the depth of the trench increased.
