40|$|ABSTRACT- Over {{the last}} 60 years, {{planting}} densities for apple have increased as improved management {{systems have been}} developed. Dwarfing rootstocks have been {{the key to the}} dramatic changes in tree size, spacing and early production. The Malling series of dwarfing rootstocks (M. 9 and M. 26) have been the most important dwarfing rootstocks in the world but are poorly adapted in some areas of the world and they are susceptible to the bacterial disease fire blight and the <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> complex, apple replant disease which limits their uses in some areas. Rootstock breeding programs in several parts of the world are developing improved rootstocks with resistance to fire blight, and replant disease, and improved cold hardiness and yield efficiency. A second important trend has been the increasing importance of new cultivars. New cultivars have provided opportunities for higher prices until they are over-produced. A new trend is the “variety club ” in which variety owners manage the production and marketing of a new unique cultivar to bring higher prices to the growers and variety owners. This has led to many fruit growers being unable to plant or grow some new cultivars. Important rootstock and cultivar genes have been mapped and can be used in marker assisted selection of future rootstock and cultivar selections. Other important improvements in apple culture include the development of pre-formed trees, the development of minimal pruning strategies and limb angle bending which have also contributed to the dramatic changes in early production in the 2 nd- 5 th years after planting...|$|E

In spite of recent advances in agricultural practices involving chitin amendments, the microbial communities in chitin-amended soils remain poorly known. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to investigate the bacterial diversity and abundance in an agricultural soil supplemented with chitin that turned disease-suppressive and (2) to assess the emergence of chitinolytic bacteria under conditions of raised soil pH. Amplicon pyrosequencing of soil-extracted DNA based on the 16 S rRNA genes was used to characterize the structures of bacterial communities in soil, chitin-amended or not, with native versus raised pH (5. 7 vs 8. 7), in microcosms and the field. As a result of chitin addition, changes in the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were observed in the field soil. A large and significant increase of the relative abundance of Oxalobacteraceae (Betaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales) was found. Within the Oxalobacteraceae, the genera Duganella and Massilia showed large increases. Moreover, responses of the Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria appeared shortly after the alteration of the soil pH in the microcosms. A significant decrease in the abundance of Actinobacteria was observed in the chitin-amended field soil and in the microcosm at high pH. Overall, the bacterial abundance in soil tended to decrease with the addition of chitin. Two groups, Actinobacteria and Oxalobacteraceae, were found to be most responsive to the amendment.

40|$|Grasslands are an {{important}} source of biodiversity, providing a range of essential ecosystem services such as ensuring water quality and soil carbon storage. An increasing proportion of grasslands are being used to support grazing livestock, with agricultural grasslands covering over 25 % of the Earth’s ice-free land surface. Despite the increasing economic value of pasture-derived exports, and the recognised importance of soil-borne disease to pasture productivity, there has been little fundamental or applied research effort aimed at understanding or controlling the diverse and dynamic soil-borne pathogen complexes that develop under pasture. Soil-borne plant pathogens can be suppressed through the general activity of the total soil microbiota acting in competition with the pathogenic microbiota, or by increases in the abundance and activity of specific microbes or microbial consortia that are antagonistic against selected pathogens. Management of the diverse soil microbial communities towards a disease suppressive microbiome is an emerging approach to plant disease control in agricultural systems. In comparison to arable systems however, disease suppression under pastoral agriculture remains vastly understudied. As such, the overarching aim of this thesis was to “identify farm management practices that provide opportunities by which the indigenous microbial communities of pastoral soils may be ‘engineered’ towards an enhanced state of general disease suppression”. Soil microbial community properties known to be associated with disease suppression were examined across 50 pastoral fields. The composition and abundance of the disease-suppressive community was assessed from both taxonomic and functional perspectives. Pseudomonas bacteria were selected as a general taxonomic indicator of disease suppressive potential, while genes associated with the biosynthesis of a suite of secondary metabolites provided functional markers (GeoChip 5. 0 microarray analysis). Land use intensification was identified as the primary driver of the compositions of both Pseudomonas communities and disease suppressive functional genes. Furthermore, using a multivariate statistical approach, it was possible to associate main changes in the soil Pseudomonas populations, and functional gene abundance, with measures of soil organic matter quality, C:P ratio (nutrient stoichiometry), and aromaticity of the dissolved organic matter content (carbon recalcitrance). These associations between soil organic matter quality and <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> suppressive communities were challenged and validated using a structured experimental design. Soils collected from a long-term grassland field trial were used to investigate the impact of 20 years of plant residue management on soil suppressiveness. A novel, pasture-relevant plant pathogen bioassay, Rhizoctonia solani AG 2 - 1 induced damping-off (wirestem) of kale (Brassica oleracea), was used to detect natural variation in <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> suppression and link this with changes in soil biology and chemistry. Frequent inputs of plant material into soil altered the chemical, physical, and microbiological parameters of the pasture. Notably, Pseudomonas community composition (species richness and diversity), soil organic matter content, and carbon recalcitrance were associated with enhanced suppression of damping-off disease. Subsequent microcosm experiments, simulating on-farm management of carbon availability, assessed the importance of soil, plant, and proximity to the plant root, in shaping microbial communities in pastoral soils. While the ‘parent’ soil (within which crops were planted or residues added) was identified as the primary driver of both bacterial and Pseudomonas communities, the composition of the Pseudomonas community, particularly species diversity indices, was more sensitive to plant species-specific effects than the total bacterial community. Collectively, the research conducted in this PhD programme has demonstrated how edaphic, environmental, and farm-management factors can alter key phylogenetic and functional traits of the resident soil community. Importantly, pastoral management decisions that affect soil organic matter content, particularly carbon quality, were identified here as key opportunities to manage the indigenous microbial communities of pastoral soils to favour development of a suppressive microbiome...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{proposal}} is to develop novel regeneration technologies needed to engineer walnut rootstocks for pest and disease resistance. The productivity of the walnut industry of California is dependent the availability of superior rootstocks to combat <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> and pest problems. Individual selections displaying resistance to either Phytophthora crown and root rots or to root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus vulnus, have been identified and can be clonally propagated but these selections are susceptible to crown gall. Rootstocks with multiple resistances are clearly desirable. Walnut transformation depends {{on the use of}} somatic embryos. Somatic embryos are readily obtained from immature, and therefore uncharacterized, seed but not from vegetative or other mature tissues. This precludes inserting any genes into a rootstock exhibiting another superior trait if the trait was identified in a seedling or mature tree. Walnuts have a long generation time and the most promising rootstocks, hybrids of English walnut x black walnut, are sterile or nearly sterile, factors that severely impede developing multiple resistances by breeding. The recent discoveries of genes that stimulate regeneration provide a unique avenue to develop cultivar independent transformation for walnut. Oncogene silencing gene constructs previously developed by us will be introduced into walnut rootstocks that are resistant to Phytophthora and/or root lesion nematode. The crown gall resistant lines will be propagated and introduced into the field in two locations in California for further testing of horticultural traits and disease and pest resistance with the goal of developing a new rootstock variety that will be resistant to major soil based disease and pests of significance for the California walnut industry...|$|E

40|$|Soil is a {{component}} of primary importance in crop production, {{even if it is}} often neglected, or only regarded as a physical support for the growth of plants. However, with the increasing societal concerns for the sustainability of agriculture, soil must be considered as a living system. Its quality results from the multiple interactions among physicochemical and biological components, notably the microbial communities, primordial for soil function. Crops are threatened by soil-borne diseases. These are often difficult to control, because of the "hidden" status of the pathogens and also because of the absence, noxiousness or lack of efficacy of chemical treatments. In this context, there is a renewed interest for cultural practices {{such as the use of}} organic amendments. These practices have a strong influence on soil health, which takes into account plant health, through both changes of physicochemical characteristics and influence on soil microbial communities. Cultural practices are used to improve soil health, and can, in some cases, increase <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> suppression. The effects of these practices on soil properties have been studied, but the relationship between these properties and soil suppressiveness has not been always very clear. Many different soil descriptors, either abiotic or biotic, have been used to describe the soil health and suppressiveness, but there is a lack of identified, reliable and consistent indicators. One aim of this review is to show that, despite the age of the soil health concept and all the studies that have been conducted, there are still no guidelines for assessment of soil quality from the plant health point of view. Obviously, the extreme diversity of situations makes any generalisation from a given case-study difficult. However, based on what has already been done in related fields, a methodology to search for indicators of soil health can be proposed. In this review we will present (i) how a healthy soil can be defined and what are the concepts hidden behind the words "soil health," (ii) which cultural practices have been used to control soil-borne diseases and their limitations, (iii) which soil parameters have been measured when studying soil suppressiveness, and which relationships have been found between these parameters, and finally (iv) how these descriptors could become indicators of soil health, using appropriate analytical and statistical methods...|$|E
40|$|Strains of Pseudomonas {{that produce}} {{antimicrobial}} metabolites and control soilborne plant diseases {{have often been}} isolated from soils defined as disease-suppressive, i. e., soils, in which specific plant pathogens are present, but plants show no or reduced disease symptoms. Moreover, {{it is assumed that}} pseudomonads producing antimicrobial compounds such as 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) or phenazines (PHZ) contribute to the specific disease resistance of suppressive soils. However, pseudomonads producing antimicrobial metabolites are also present in soils that are conducive to disease. Currently, it is still unknown whether and to which extent the abundance of antimicrobials-producing pseudomonads is related to the general disease resistance of common agricultural soils. Moreover, virtually nothing is known about the conditions under which pseudomonads express antimicrobial genes in agricultural field soils. We present here results of the first side-by-side comparison of 10 representative Swiss agricultural soils with a cereal-oriented cropping history for (i) the resistance against two soilborne pathogens, (ii) the abundance of Pseudomonas bacteria harboring genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antimicrobials DAPG, PHZ, and pyrrolnitrin on roots of wheat, and (iii) the ability to support the expression of these genes on the roots. Our study revealed that the level of <b>soil</b> <b>disease</b> resistance strongly depends on the type of pathogen, e. g., soils that are highly resistant to Gaeumannomyces tritici often are highly susceptible to Pythium ultimum and vice versa. There was no significant correlation between the disease resistance of the soils, the abundance of Pseudomonas bacteria carrying DAPG, PHZ, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic genes, and the ability of the soils to support the expression of the antimicrobial genes. Correlation analyses indicated that certain soil factors such as silt, clay, and some macro- and micronutrients influence both the abundance and the expression of the antimicrobial genes. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} suggests that pseudomonads producing DAPG, PHZ, or pyrrolnitrin are present and abundant in Swiss agricultural soils and that the soils support the expression of the respective biosynthetic genes in these bacteria to various degrees. The precise role that these pseudomonads play in the general disease resistance of the investigated agricultural soils remains elusive...|$|E
40|$|Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.), {{a member}} of the family Araliaceae, is {{cultivated}} in British Columbia and Ontario, Canada for export to Asia. The dried root is valued for its medicinal properties and is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cylindrocarpon root rot, caused by Cylindrocarpon destructans (Zins) Scholten, and rusty root, a disorder of unknown cause(s), are two factors that limit ginseng cultivation globally. Epidemiological and other information on these problems is lacking and no control measures are available. In this study, 80 isolates of C. destructans were recovered from diseased roots. These isolates were classified as highly virulent (HV) (49 %) and weakly virulent (WV) (51 %), and showed differences in colony morphology, temperature optimum for growth, extracellular enzyme and spore production. Histopathological studies revealed direct hyphal penetration of ginseng roots by a HV isolate. In artificially infested soil, two-year-old ginseng roots were most susceptible to Cylindrocarpon root rot and severity reaches to the peak with a moderate inoculum density (3. 45 x 102 CFU/g <b>soil).</b> <b>Disease</b> severity was higher at 200 C compared to 15 and 250 C near field capacity, with a significant interaction between soil moisture and temperature. Disease severity on hydroponically-maintained ginseng roots was significantly (P < 0. 0001) enhanced when Hoagland’s solution was amended with Fe. Mycelial growth in broth culture, conidial germ tube length, secondary branching of germ tubes, spore production and PPO production by C. destructans was found to be enhanced by Fe. Studies on biochemical changes taking place in rusty root indicated rusty areas to be comprised of the epidermis and underlying six to eight cell layers, which accumulated phenolic compounds. Affected epidermal cells also accumulated Fe, Al, Si, Mg and other cations compared to adjoining healthy cells as determined by SEM-EDX and ICP-AES. Ginseng callus cultures treated with either chitosan (1 %) or Fusarium mycelial fragments (MF) showed an increased accumulation of phenolic compounds and defense enzymes. Based on these results, rusty root symptoms on ginseng are proposed to result from an induction of host defense responses, especially phenolic production. This induction is likely due to attempted invasion by as-yet uncharacterized chitin-containing soil fungi. Subsequent oxidation of phenolic compounds and sequestration of metal ions, in particular Fe, appear to be largely responsible for the symptoms observed...|$|E

Since crop rotation is rarely adopted, the reduction of yield, both in quantity and quality, progressively affects the crops. Investigations in Horting Institute showed that after 4 years of continuous tomato monoculture a yield reduction up to 48 % occurred,thus making necessary the adoption of soil disinfestations practices or, other methods. The treatment of soil with methyl bromide was used only by large commercial farmers (107. 72 tons methyl bromide in 2003).
