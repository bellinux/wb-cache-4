50|$|A rack case is {{a transit}} case with {{provision}} for mounting rackmount equipment such as amplifiers, computers, displays, radios, encryption devices, and so forth. In many cases, the internal 19-inch rack is mounted to the transit case via shock absorbing mounts giving the rack <b>sway</b> <b>space</b> to attenuate shocks and bumps that might be seen during shipment and handling.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} revealed the failure agent to {{be a combination}} of poor teflon coating adhesion, a decrease in bearing <b>sway</b> <b>space</b> and, possibly, lack of flushing flow through the bearing. A change in Teflon coating vendors provided substantially improved coating quality and surface finish. The <b>sway</b> <b>space</b> was increased and the cooling bleed flow was adjusted to flush the bearing. These changes were included in a test conducted in the WHL from 6 April to 22 May 1978 which resulted in the completion of 1006. 9 hours of operation at temperature and load. Post-test inspection revealed the bearings to be in excellent condition and capable of completing a much longer test...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the principles of}} optimal vibration protection of the internal sensitive components of infrared equipment from harsh environmental vibration. The authors have developed an approach {{to the design of}} external vibration isolators with properties to minimise the vibration-induced line-of-sight jitter which is caused by the relative deflection of the infrared sensor and the optic system, subject to strict constraints on the allowable <b>sway</b> <b>space</b> of the entire electro-optic package. In this approach, the package itself is used as the first-level vibration isolation stage relative to the internal highly responsive components...|$|E

He dabbed feeble hands at his injuries and examined the result upon his palms. Then he gave way at the knees and fell headlong in a dead faint at the boy's feet, between the still leaping bodies of his defeated foes. Very luckily it didn't occur to the boy to splash water on his face--for there were still more of these horrors under the alder roots--and instead he passed back by the pond {{and went into the}} garden with the intention of calling assistance. And there he met the gardener coachman and told him of the whole affair.|$|R
60|$|This preoccupation {{made his}} {{impressions}} fragmentary. Yet amidst {{so much that}} was strange and vivid, no subject, however personal and insistent, could exert undivided <b>sway.</b> There were <b>spaces</b> when the revolutionary movement passed clean out of his mind, was drawn aside like a curtain from before some startling new aspect of the time. Helen had swayed his mind to this intense earnestness of enquiry, but there came times when she, even, receded beyond his conscious thoughts. At one moment, for example, he found they were traversing the religious quarter, for the easy transit about the city afforded by the moving ways rendered sporadic churches and chapels no longer necessary--and his attention was vividly arrested by the facade {{of one of the}} Christian sects.|$|R
40|$|Microgravity science {{payloads}} can {{be extremely}} sensitive to vibrations from machinery, acoustics, ventilation, and crew activity. Suppression of Transient Acceleration by Levitation (STABLE) is an active vibration isolation system designed to protect payloads from these disturbances. This paper gives an account of results from the flight demonstration of the STABLE microgravity isolation system, which was developed and successfully flight tested in orbit during USML- 2, with the participation of Astronaut Fred Leslie. Following a very {{brief description of the}} operational principles, the hardware and software design, and performance criteria, results of the analysis of measured flight data are presented to provide an evaluation of system performance parameters, including acceleration attenuation, assessment of <b>sway</b> <b>space,</b> system power consumption, and other factors critical to the performance of an isolation system. Lessons learned and potential design improvements and evolutions are discussed. Data reduction by Robert Boucher of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA) was substantially assisted by Kenneth Hrovat of Tal-Cut, Inc., under support from National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Lewis Research Center (LeRC), Cleveland, OH...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of ever-mounting evidence, amongst which is the “zone” {{problematic}} of the Zadar conference that occassioned these notes, {{it can be concluded}} that the spatial turn has insinuated itself as an all-pervading heuristic tool throughout the humanities and the social sciences. The extent to which space and spatiality have usurped the central stage in the various branches of reasearch can be gauged by admonishments that what we are witnessing is a new fundamentalism that has simply inverted the terms of the dualism of time and space (May and Thrift 2001 : “Introduction”). According to Michael Dear the <b>sway</b> of <b>space</b> is manifested in multifold ways: in the ubiquity of spatial analysis in social theories and practices; in the explosion of publications devoted to the exploration of the interface of the social and the spatial; in the reintegration of human geography into various domains of knowledge; in the focus given to difference and the consequent diversification of theoretical and empirical practices; in a theoretically informed exploration of the relation between geographical knowledge and social action; and, finally, in the unprecedented proliferation of research agendas and publications pertaining to these isuuses (Dear 2001 : 24). Two recent collections of papers are indicative of the ubiquity of spatial issues in scholarly work...|$|R
