40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> methods: UNDEX <b>testing,</b> virtual <b>shock</b> trial and land-based <b>test</b> with <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are presented with the focus on the advances in <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> in US and Europe. Comparison of current <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are concluded. The first trend is that <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> can <b>test</b> heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{heavy-duty}} <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> {{is developed}} {{to satisfy the}} newly-built shock resistance standard and simulate accurately the actual underwater explosive environments with increased testing capability. The mathematical model for the <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> is created to predict its dynamic performance and analyze its mechanism. Then numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the prospective capability of the <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> under different <b>shock</b> velocity inputs. The double protection system incorporating the stroke limit of the accumulator piston and the unloading circuit can effectively prevent the secondary collision in the testing process. The simulation results have demonstrated that the <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> proposed in this paper can produce nearly the same shock acceleration waveform as the new shock resistance standard BV 043 / 85 and MIL-S- 901 D. Moreover, this <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> can be regulated conveniently to adjust to {{a different type of}} equipment and be extended easily to suit more severe shock environments and heavier equipment.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of three commonly used airplane fuselage materials is investigated, namely of Al 2024 -T 3, Glare- 3 and CFRP.

40|$|The {{major focus}} of this work {{is to examine the}} {{dynamics}} of velocity amplification through pair-wise collisions between multiple masses in a chain, in order to develop useful machines. For instance low-cost machines based on this principle could be used for detailed, very-high acceleration shock-testing of MEMS devices. A theoretical basis for determining the number and mass of intermediate stages in such a velocity amplifier, based on simple rigid body mechanics, is proposed. The influence of mass ratios and the coefficient of restitution on the optimisation of the system is identified and investigated. In particular, two cases are examined: in the first, the velocity of the final mass in the chain (that would have the object under test mounted on it) is maximised by defining the ratio of adjacent masses according to a power law relationship; in the second, the energy transfer efficiency of the system is maximised by choosing the mass ratios such that all masses except the final mass come to rest following impact. Comparisons are drawn between both cases and the results are used in proposing design guidelines for optimal shock amplifiers. It is shown that for most practical systems, a shock amplifier with mass ratios based on a power law relationship is optimal and can easily yield velocity amplifications of a factor 5 – 8 times. A prototype <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> that was made using above principles is briefly introduced...|$|E

50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> and pyroshock or ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>testing.</b> Classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|R

40|$|Components used {{in space}} {{are subject to}} high {{frequency}} and high amplitude mechanical shocks that occur during the launch and separation phases of the space vehicles. <b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> is done to ensure that components can withstand the shock events. A shock can be described by an acceleration and time history, but in <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{it is difficult to}} manage and quantify shocks by only looking at the acceleration and time history of a shock. Instead, a shock response spectrum is used, which plots the peak accelerations of multiple single degree of freedom systems with their own unique frequencies over a range of frequencies, usually from 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The shocks that occur in space can reach up to acceleration levels of 10 000 g’s. The main objective of this work was to develop a software application for the mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> system at Tartu Observatory. The <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> system at Tartu Observatory consists of a resonant plate, pendulum hammer, guiding rod, weights and a data acquisition module with acceleration sensors.
