25|$|His father {{remarried}} {{when he was}} nine, {{but neither}} Weston nor his sister got along with their new stepmother and stepbrother. After May was married and left their home in 1897, Weston's father devoted {{most of his time}} to his new wife and her son. Weston was left on his own much of the time; he <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to school and withdrew into his own room in their large home.|$|E
25|$|Mangeshkar {{took her}} first lesson from her father. At {{the age of}} five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On the first day in school, she started {{teaching}} songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was so angry that she <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to the school. Other sources cite that she left school because they would not allow her to bring Asha with her, as she would often bring her younger sister with her.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 he {{completed}} his third geological book, and turned from supervising {{the publication of}} expert reports on {{the findings from the}} voyage to examining barnacle specimens himself. This grew into an eight-year study, making use of his theory to find hitherto unknown relationships between the many species of barnacle, and establishing his expertise as a biologist. His faith in Christianity dwindled and he <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to church. In 1851 his treasured daughter suffered a long illness and died. In 1854 he resumed his work on the species question which led on to the publication of Darwin's theory.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a boom {{in the number of}} young girls, mostly from impoverished parts of India, coming to Delhi after being offered jobs by {{disguised}} criminals, only to be taken prisoner and forced into sex slavery. The number of victims is believed to be in the hundreds. Many brothels have been running English courses for sex workers and upgrading their facilities in anticipation of a business upturn during the games. Overseas prostitutes are also expected to come as tourists and ply their trade. One anti-trafficking NGO has claimed that there are reports of 40,000 women being brought in from northeastern India alone. A spokesperson said that recruits from that part of India were favoured because of their lighter skin. It has been reported that over 3,000 bar girls in Mumbai have <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to work; this has been blamed on an exodus to Delhi for the Commonwealth Games.|$|E
25|$|Ninoy Aquino soon {{emerged as}} a leading critic of the {{government}} of President Ferdinand Marcos. He was then touted as a strong candidate for president to succeed Marcos in the 1973 elections. However, Marcos, being barred by the Constitution to seek a third term, declared martial law on September 21, 1972, and later abolished the existing 1935 Constitution, thereby allowing him to remain in office. As a consequence, her husband was among those to be first arrested at the onset of martial law, later being sentenced to death. During his incarceration, Ninoy sought strength from prayer, attending daily Mass and saying the rosary three times a day. As a measure of sacrifice and solidarity with her husband and all other political prisoners, she enjoined her children from attending parties and she also <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to the beauty salon or buying new clothes until a priest advised her and her children to instead live as normal lives as possible.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving his}} job, Vanunu started {{attended}} Israeli Communist Party meetings, but was unimpressed {{with the level}} of discussion and soon <b>stopped</b> <b>going.</b> He also tried modeling nude for art students, but was not booked again for being too nervous and jumpy. In November 1985, he moved in with Judy Zimmet, an American woman who was working as a midwife at Soroka Medical Center. After accompanying Zimmet and her sister on a tour around Israel, he embarked on a backpacking trip throughout the Far East, and planned to meet her in the United States afterwards, though he later became uncertain about continuing the relationship. On January 19, 1986, he left Israel for Greece via a boat from Haifa to Athens. After spending a few days in Athens, he flew to Thailand on an Aeroflot flight to Bangkok. He transited through Moscow, spending a night at a transit hotel there. During his time in Thailand, he visited the Golden Triangle, where he tried opium and hash cocktails. He then flew to Burma, where he met and befriended Fiona Gall, daughter of British journalist Sandy Gall. After touring Mandalay together, Vanunu flew on his own to Nepal.|$|E

500|$|Kruger was by {{this time}} widely {{perceived}} as a personification of Afrikanerdom {{both at home and}} abroad. When he <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. [...] "Once seen, he is not easily forgotten", wrote Lady Phillips. [...] "His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number... and I think his character is clearly to be read in his face—strength of character and cunning." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2013, Frank {{expressed}} {{sympathy with}} the host's atheism on the television program Real Time with Bill Maher. [...] In his biography, however, Frank states unequivocally {{that he is not}} an atheist and is uncomfortable expressing firm views on questions for which he is unable to provide an answer. Frank's agnosticism led him to resolve (if he had been appointed as interim Senator) to take the oath of office on the United States Constitution, rather than the Bible. For most of his life and entire Congressional career, Frank was known as a Jew. Frank continues to identify strongly with the Jewish community and has been careful throughout his career that his agnosticism not reflect negatively on other Jews. For example, when he <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to temple services on the High Holy Days he was careful to remain at home and {{out of the public eye}} in order that other Jews would not be criticized using his example.|$|E

After {{the birth of his}} daughters, Stanley <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to sea and got a job with the Liverpool and Glasgow Tug Salvage Company as an {{insurance}} investigator. He moved his family to the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road. [...] According to Beatles biographer Bob Spitz, Mimi assumed a matriarchal role in the Stanley house to help her mother, and dressed [...] "as if {{she was on her way}} to a weekly garden club meeting". Friends of Lennon later stated that his aunt based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude: [...] "Either you were good enough or you were not." [...] Lennon's school friend, Pete Shotton, later commented that she [...] "had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong". [...] Annie Stanley died in 1941, so Mimi accepted the responsibility of caring for her father, with help from her younger sister, Julia.|$|E

500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E
500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon <b>stopped</b> <b>going</b> to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these words about the club I helped to build".|$|E
