40|$|Abstract: Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty {{are being}} used {{extensively}} in the United States {{for the treatment of}} osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Although short-term clinical outcomes appear favourable, long-term data are not yet available and it is becoming increasingly important to understand how the underlying biomechanics of the spine are altered by the procedure. In vitro experimental studies have investigated the eect of cement augmentation on individual ver-tebra and short spinal segments. For individual vertebra, vertebroplasty appears to increase or return strength to the prefracture level, whereas the stiness is not always restored. However for multiple-vertebra segments, the strength of the unit as a whole appears to decrease, with failure occurring in the non-augmented vertebrae. Both nite element (FE) and experimental {{studies have shown that the}} volume of cement injected aects the restoration of strength and stiness. The type of cement appears to have less of an eect. Although biomechanical studies of the vertebroplasty process have indicated that the procedure has the potential to restore vertebral strength and stiness, further work is necessary to understand fully the eects of the augmentation process on the <b>surrounding</b> <b>structures</b> <b>if</b> the treatment is to be fully optimized.

An au-tonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can decrease the operational costs, expedite the monitoring process and {{be used in}} situations where a manned inspection is not possible. This paper addresses the problem of searching and mapping such littoral boundaries using an autonomous UAV based on visual feedback. Specifically, this paper describes an exploration system that equips a fixed wing UAV to autonomously search a given area for a specified structure (could be a river, a coastal line etc.), identify the <b>structure</b> <b>if</b> <b>present</b> and map the coordinates of the structure based on the images from the onboard sensor(could be vision or near infra-red). Experimental results with a fixed wing UAV searching and mapping the coordinates of a 2 mile stretch of a river with a cross track error of around 9 meters are presented. I...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{research has}} been undertaken into the development of lead-extrusion damping technology. The high force-to-volume (HF 2 V) devices developed at the University of Canterbury {{have been the subject}} of much of this research. However, while these devices have undergone a limited range of velocity testing, limitations in test equipment has meant that they have never been tested at representative earthquake velocities. Such testing is important as the peak resistive force provided by the dampers under large velocity spikes is an important design input that must be known for structural applications. This manuscript presents the high-speed testing of HF 2 V devices with quasi-static force capacities of 250 - 300 kN. These devices have been subjected to peak input velocities of approximately 200 mm/s, producing peak resistive forces of approximately 350 kN. The devices show stable hysteretic performance, with slight force reduction during high-speed testing due to heat build-up and softening of the lead working material. This force reduction is recovered following cyclic loading as heat is dissipated and the lead hardens again. The devices are shown to be only weakly velocity dependent, an advantage in that they do not deliver large forces to the connecting elements and <b>surrounding</b> <b>structure</b> <b>if</b> larger than expected response velocities occur. This high-speed testing is an important step towards uptake as it provides important information to designers...|$|R

The crystal structure contains right-handed double-helical segments formed by complementary Watson-Crick-type hydrogen bonding between the adenine and thymine bases of neighboring molecules. The minihelix contains two base pairs. The chains are antiparallel. The A-T and T-A sequences have different phosphodiester conformations. The deoxyribose-pucker and the sugar-base orientation alternate along the chain depending {{on the nature of}} the base (3 ’-endo for purine and 2 ’-endo for pyrimidine). The extended structure is stabilized by base-base, base-sugar, and hydrogen-bond interactions. The minihelix of two base pairs provides starting coordinates for model-building studies of the dA-dT polymer. A B-DNA-type polymer structure is described, which has sequence-dependent alternations of both the deoxyribose pucker and the phosphate diester bridge conformation.

30|$|The {{comparative}} study of both inhabited and abandoned campsites has thrown light on the processes by which archaeological landscape {{was created in the}} Tadrart Acacus. A phenomenon of ‘delayed curation’ (Tomka 1993) has been identified, insofar as the settlements, once abandoned, are repeatedly visited and materials collected (Biagetti 2014 e). This explains why {{the quantity and quality of}} material that depends at deserted campsites varies according to the time elapsed since abandonment. All reusable items, even if very worn, are gradually picked up. The same applies to the structural elements of the huts, like the roof and the central pole, the sticks, and the vegetal materials in general, whilst the stones are always left behind. Indeed, some years after its abandonment, the settlement is still recognizable and visible, mainly due to the ubiquitous pens for kid goats, other stone <b>structures</b> (<b>if</b> <b>present),</b> and dung areas. If some elements of the settlements are virtually imperishable, long-term visibility may be reduced by the ‘delayed curation’ and natural decay, the latter due to the strong winds that tend to bury large items and heavy artifacts and disperse lighter ones.|$|R

This research project seeks {{to better understand}} the nature and consequences of the foreign policy attitudes of individuals from six advanced democracies (United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and the US). To test hypotheses that are of interest to academics and practitioners alike this research programme proposes to develop a common survey instrument that probes agreement and disagreement with a series of specific foreign policy issues. British and American respondents will be given multiple surveys {{over the course of a}} three year period to test the over-time stability of foreign policy attitudes. Key main questions the applicant will address through techniques appropriate for analysing survey data are whether: attitudes towards specific foreign policy attitudes have a meaningful structure; the <b>structure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> is similar across nations; agree-disagree responses to survey questions tapping attitudes towards specific foreign policies are stable in the face of actual political events or experimental manipulations that highlight the policy's proposed costs, objectives, and chances of success; sructured foreign policy attitudes are related to support for political parties, their leaders, and voter choice; national political institutions foster or blunt the ability of foreign policy attitudes to influence voter choice...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} regularization algorithm using high-order {{models is}} proposed for partially separable convexly constrained nonlinear optimization problems whose objective function contains non-Lipschitzian ℓ_q-norm regularization terms for q∈ (0, 1). It is {{shown that the}} algorithm using an p-th order Taylor model for p odd needs in general at most O(ϵ^-(p+ 1) /p) evaluations of the objective function and its derivatives (at points where they are defined) to produce an ϵ-approximate first-order critical point. This result is obtained either with Taylor models {{at the price of}} requiring the feasible set to be 'kernel-centered' (which includes bound constraints and many other cases of interest), or for non-Lipschitz models, at the price of passing the difficulty to the computation of the step. Since this complexity bound is identical in order to that already known for purely Lipschitzian minimization subject to convex constraints [CartGoulToin 2016], the new result shows that introducing non-Lipschitzian singularities in the objective function may not affect the worst-case evaluation complexity order. The result also shows that using the problem's partially separable <b>structure</b> (<b>if</b> <b>present)</b> does not affect complexity order either. A final (worse) complexity bound is derived for the case where Taylor models are used with a general convex feasible set...|$|R

One of the photo-cytotoxic {{extracts from}} the leaves of Phaeanthus ophtalmicus was further investigated. Results The ethanolic extract of the leaves from Phaeanthus ophtalmicus was able to reduce the in vitro viability of leukaemic HL 60 cells to 2 of a broad spectrum light at a concentration of 20 μg/mL. Dereplication of the photo-cytotoxic fractions from P. ophthalmicus extracts based on TLC R f values and HPLC co-injection of reference tetrapyrrolic compounds enabled quick identification of known photosensitisers, pheophorbide- a, pheophorbide- a methyl ester, 13 2 -hydroxypheophorbide- a methyl ester, pheophytin- a and 15 1 -hydroxypurpurin 7 -lactone dimethyl ester. In addition, compound 1 which was not previously isolated as a natural product was also identified as 7 -formyl- 15 1 -hydroxypurpurin- 7 -lactone methyl ester using standard spectroscopic techniques. Conclusions Our results suggest that the main photosensitisers in plants are based on the cyclic tetrapyrrole structure and photosensitisers with other <b>structures,</b> <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> are present in very minor amounts or are not as active as those with the cyclic tetrapyrrole structure. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{biological}} processes involve the physical interaction between protein domains. Understanding these functional associations requires {{knowledge of the}} molecular structure. Experimental investigations though present considerable difficulties and there is therefore a need for accurate and reliable computational methods. In this paper we present a novel method that seeks to dock protein domains using a contact map representation. Rather than providing a full three dimensional model of the complex, the method predicts contacting residues across the interface. We use a scoring function that combines structural, physicochemical and evolutionary information, where each potential residue contact is assigned a value according to the scoring function and the hypothesis is that the real configuration of contacts {{is the one that}} maximizes the score. The search is performed with a simulated annealing algorithm directly in contact space. Results We have tested the method on interacting domain pairs {{that are part of the}} same protein (intra-molecular domains). We show that it correctly predicts some contacts and that predicted residues tend to be significantly closer to each other than other pairs of residues in the same domains. Moreover we find that predicted contacts can often discriminate the best model (or the native <b>structure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>present)</b> among a set of optimal solutions generated by a standard docking procedure. Conclusion Contact docking appears feasible and able to complement other computational methods for the prediction of protein-protein interactions. With respect to more standard docking algorithms it might be more suitable to handle protein conformational changes and to predict complexes starting from protein models. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fibronectin binds to {{a variety}} of {{bacterial}} species, and we hypothesized that differential fibronectin binding might influence the invasive potential of group B streptococci (GBS). Human plasma fibronectin purified by a standard two-step chromatographic procedure was radiolabeled with 3 H. Fifty GBS strains (invasive, colonizing, or bovine) representing serotypes Ia (10 strains), Ib (6 strains), Ia/c (6 strains), II (10 strains), III (11 strains), IV (1 strain), and nontypable (6 strains) were tested. No source or serotype variability was detected among GBS strains, and binding was uniformly less than 1. 5 % of available fibronectin. Lack of detectable binding occurred at both the log and stationary growth phases and persisted despite treatment with trypsin or neuraminidase or opsonization with immunoglobulin G containing high levels (greater than 40 micrograms/ml) of antibody specific for the Ia, II, or III GBS capsular polysaccharides. Incubation with GBS did not inhibit fibronectin binding to the Cowan 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Strain COH 31 - 15, an isogenic, type III, capsule-deficient mutant of COH 31 r/s, also failed to bind fibronectin. In contrast to other streptococci, GBS do not have readily detectable receptors for soluble fibronectin as part of their surface <b>structures.</b> <b>If</b> <b>present,</b> binding sites for soluble fibronectin are deep to surface structures, obscured from host defense systems, or require the presence of other factors to facilitate their recognition of fibronectin.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{selection}} {{is an important}} step when building predictors of disease state based on gene expression data. Gene selection generally improves performance and identifies a relevant subset of genes. Many univariate and multivariate gene selection approaches have been proposed. Frequently the claim is made that genes are co-regulated (due to pathway dependencies) and that multivariate approaches are therefore per definition more desirable than univariate selection approaches. Based on the published performances of all these approaches a fair comparison of the available results can not be made. This mainly stems from two factors. First, the results are often biased, since the validation set is {{in one way or another}} involved in training the predictor, resulting in optimistically biased performance estimates. Second, the published results are often based on a small number of relatively simple datasets. Consequently no generally applicable conclusions can be drawn. Results In this study we adopted an unbiased protocol to perform a fair comparison of frequently used multivariate and univariate gene selection techniques, in combination with a ränge of classifiers. Our conclusions are based on seven gene expression datasets, across several cancer types. Conclusion Our experiments illustrate that, contrary to several previous studies, in five of the seven datasets univariate selection approaches yield consistently better results than multivariate approaches. The simplest multivariate selection approach, the Top Scoring method, achieves the best results on the remaining two datasets. We conclude that the correlation <b>structures,</b> <b>if</b> <b>present,</b> are difficult to extract due to the small number of samples, and that consequently, overly-complex gene selection algorithms that attempt to extract these structures are prone to overtraining. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{drainage}} network {{must take the}} farming systems and the landscape structure into consideration to describe flow pathways in the agricultural catchment. A new approach is proposed to build the {{drainage network}} {{which is based on}} the identification of the inlets and outlets for surface water flow on each farmers' field (or plot), estimating the relative areas contributing to the surface yield. The delineation of these areas and their links in terms of surface flow pathways provides us with a pattern of relationships between individual plots, i. e. going from each plot to the other plots over the entire catchment. In this approach, flow directions are firstly calculated in the usual way by taking account of slope direction. Plot outlets are defined from the DEM then linked together using a tree <b>structure.</b> <b>If</b> <b>present,</b> linear networks such as hedges modify both the flow directions and the location of plot outlets, hence modify this tree structure. In a final step, the plots are themselves linked together using a graph structure illustrated by an arrow diagram. This drainage network based on plot outlets is applied to a 15 -km² catchment area represented by 38, 300 pixels and 2, 000 plots. This new drainage network takes into consideration 5, 300 plot outlets, which greatly reduces the number of objects in comparison with a drainage network made up of pixels or DEM cells. This method leads to a simple and functional representation of surface flow pathways in an agricultural catchment. It allows us to identify the key plots controlling stream water pollution where converging flow pathways are coming from numerous or large-sized plots. Finally it produces a functional representation for decision support...|$|R
40|$|High-dimensional data {{visualization}} is receiving increasing interest {{because of the}} growing abundance of high-dimensional datasets. To understand such datasets, visualization of the structures present in the data, such as clusters, can be an invaluable tool. Structures may {{be present in the}} full high-dimensional space, as well as in its subspaces. Two widely used methods to visualize high-dimensional data are the scatter plot matrix (SPM) and the parallel coordinate plot (PCP). SPM allows a quick overview of the structures present in pairwise combinations of dimensions. On the other hand, PCP has the potential to visualize not only bi-dimensional structures but also higher dimensional ones. A problem with SPM is that it suffers from crowding and clutter which makes interpretation hard. Approaches to reduce clutter are available in the literature, based on changing the order of the dimensions. However, usually this reordering has a high computational complexity. For effective visualization of high-dimensional structures, also PCP requires a proper ordering of the dimensions. In this paper, we propose methods for reordering dimensions in PCP {{in such a way that}} high-dimensional <b>structures</b> (<b>if</b> <b>present)</b> become easier to perceive. We also present a method for dimension reordering in SPM which yields results that are comparable to those of existing approaches, but at a much lower computational cost. Our approach is based on finding relevant subspaces for clustering using a quality criterion and cluster information. The quality computation and cluster detection are done in image space, using connected morphological operators. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for synthetic and astronomical datasets, and show that our method compares favorably with a number of existing approaches...|$|R
