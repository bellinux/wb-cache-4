40|$|Multiring impact basins, formed after {{solidification}} of {{the lunar}} crust, account for most or all premare regional deposits and structures expressed in the lunar landscape and for major topographic and gravity variations. A fresh basin has two or more concentric mountain rings, a lineated ejecta blanket, and secondary impact craters. Crackled material on the floor may be impact melt. The ejecta blanket was emplaced at least partly as a ground-hugging flow and was probably hot. A suggested model of basin formation is that the center lifts up and the rings form by inward collapse during evisceration. The resulting basin is shallow and has a central uplift of the mantle. This results in a central gravity high and a ring low. Later flooding by mare basalt has since modified most near <b>side</b> <b>basins.</b> Highland deposits of plains, furrowed and pitted terrain, and various hills, domes, and craters that were interpreted before the Apollo missions as being volcanic can now be interpreted as being basin related...|$|E
40|$|The Schelde estuary, its <b>side</b> <b>basins</b> {{and their}} tributaries were sampled in August 1995 and April 1996 for {{phytoplankton}} abundance, biomass and species composition. In order {{to clarify the}} underlying causes of differences in phytoplanton communities, the results were related to some important abiotic variables. Although species richness and diversity did not differ significantly between the riverine and the freshwater tidal stations, multivariate ordination techniques based on species abundances differentiate between these two ecosystems. While in the rivers phytoplankton standing stocks were as high in summer as in spring, standing stocks in the freshwater tidal estuary were significantly higher in the August samples. It is postulated that due to the resuspension of suspended solids by estuarine currents, light is limiting phytoplankton development in the freshwater tidal reaches in spring. At that stage, phytoplankton populations have already developed in the rivers. In summer, zooplankton prevent any further increase of riverine phytoplankton populations. In the freshwater tidal estuary, however, increased light levels, a higher residence time compared to rivers and the absence of zooplankton due to low oxygen concentrations permit phytoplankton populations to bloom. </ol...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a combined field and numerical {{study of the}} effects of episodic internal Kelvin-type waves on bottom boundary turbulence and the exchange of a passive tracer between the main <b>basin</b> and the <b>side</b> <b>basin</b> of a large lake (Lake Geneva). High-resolution measurements of the vertical current structure near the entrance of the 25 -km-long and 70 -m-deep <b>side</b> <b>basin</b> revealed that hypolimnetic current speeds frequently exceed 0. 2 m s 21, leading to a turbulent bottom boundary layer several meters thick with logarithmic current profiles and to a region of strong shear across the thermocline. The time series and vertical structure of the currents were reproduced by a three-dimensional numerical model of the lake. It was demonstrated that, after episodes of strong winds from the northeast and southwest, exchange flows due to internal Kelvin waves were able to temporarily half or double the hypolimnetic volume of the <b>side</b> <b>basin,</b> leading to an irreversible exchange of up to 40 % of the hypolimnetic water in the <b>side</b> <b>basin</b> of Lake Geneva within only a few wave cycles. With the help of the numerical model, it was shown that the key mechanisms of exchange are horizontal dispersion by resolved scales and, to a small extent, shear dispersion in the bottom boundary layer. It is suggested that bottom boundary-layer turbulence and the interbasin exchange can explain the structural differences in the oxygen profiles observed in the <b>side</b> <b>basin</b> and the main basin, respec-tively. Past hydrodynamic studies conducted in Lake Geneva (Fig. 1 a) present a consistent picture of a lake dominated by the presence of several modes of wind-forced long internal waves modified by the Earth’s rotation (Mortimer 1974; Bäuerle 1985; Lemmin et al. 2005) and by a broad spectrum of short internal waves (Thorpe et al. 1996; Thorpe an...|$|R

40|$|The deep {{fusion of}} natural and {{artificial}} elements typical of Italian Renaissance gardens is particularly evident in the park of Villa di Castello and in the Grotto of the Animals, also called Grotto of the Flood. The soil slope is the essential element of a huge underlying hydraulic machine {{and it is the}} result of extensive earthworks which led to the construction of the big retaining wall limiting the grotto and the adjacent fountains. Hence, this grotto represents only the visible part of a mechanism running all around it. It is formed by a single chamber vaulted and covered with sponge-like stones, as well as decorations made of pebbles and shells. The space is divided into three wings, with big marble basins at their end. Over them there are reliefs of animals made of different stones and marbles. Animals recur also in the compositions of fish and shellfish decorating the <b>side</b> <b>basins</b> and in the bronze birds currently kept in the Museo del Bargello. The name “Grotto of the Flood” comes from the water feature that characterised this place: visitors were surprised by tens of jets hidden among the stones in the vault and in the floor. To obtain this effect, the whole grotto is surrounded by multi-storey tunnels, hiding the hydraulic system and people activating the mechanisms. Research agreements were drawn up between the Special Superintendence for the Historical, Artistic and Ethnoanthropological Heritage, the Florence museums group and the GeCO Lab, for the realization of the survey presented in this paper. The task of the GeCO Lab was thus identifying the best solutions to check the spatial relations between the grotto and the area above, as well as the geometric and functional connections between the building and the ancient hydraulic system, composed by pipes and nozzles concealed between the stones. Besides, the overall survey was intended as a documentation of the on-going restoration work...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2005. The June 1991 {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, {{was the second}} largest of the 20 th century, emplacing 5 [...] 6 km 3 of pyroclastic-flow material and creating record high sediment yields on rivers draining the volcano. This thesis explores landscape response to and recovery from sediment loading in the 1991 eruption from the drainage basin scale to mobility of individual clasts on the bed. Basin-scale erosion patterns were studied on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers for one decade following the eruption using digital elevation models, multispectral imagery, geomorphic terrain maps, and field observations. In {{the latter half of}} the decade, channel recovery was examined more closely through a multi-year field campaign on five east <b>side</b> <b>basins</b> measuring flow and channel parameters, grain size distributions, roughness, sediment mobility, and sediment transport. The details of bed coarsening and sediment transport under conditions similar to those at Mount Pinatubo were explored through physical experiments modeling future conditions as sand is depleted. Sediment yields on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers declined exponentially for the first decade following the eruption. Decay coefficients were inversely correlated with initial sediment loading. Erosion of pyroclastic flow deposits from valley incision, widening, and extension dominated sediment yields as early as 1991. Ten years later, sediment yields remained 20 times higher than pre-eruption levels. In the most disturbed basins, mainstem channels were braided and highly mobile. Coarse clasts moved independently over a smooth bed of sand and fine gravel. As sediment yields declined, selective transport preferentially removed sand and pumice, starting in the upper basin, causing downstream fining and gradients in pumice content. As sand content on the bed declined, coarse clasts interacted, leading to cluster formation and decreasing clast mobility. As sand content declines, bed reorganization into coarse and fine patches enables transport rates to remain high over a wide range of sand contents. In the near future, sediment yields on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers should remain elevated rather then declining to pre-eruption levels, sending an additional 14 million m 3 of sediment downstream in the second decade after the eruption...|$|E

40|$|Bangladesh is {{the biggest}} delta of the world. Construction of numbers of polders {{is one of the}} flood {{resilient}} approach. But the presence of coastal polders de-linked the flood plain. The siltation in river causes riverbeds to become higher than the adjacent crop lands, and vast area under the polders became permanently water logged rendering large tract of land uncultivable. The current practice is temporarily de-poldering by cutting embankment for selected tidal basin. An attempt has been made to study the phenomena of tidal basin management reviewing some secondary data and processes involved in successfully operated tidal basins of Bangladesh. And preliminary laboratory experiments are carried out to precisely look into the suspended sediment transport at <b>side</b> <b>basin</b> representing tidal basin. With varying outflow discharge and sediment supply, the transport processes are investigated. Sediment transport mainly depends upon direction of flow and magnitude of flow discharge...|$|R
