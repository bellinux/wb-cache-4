Based on the method introduced in this letter also the gauge non-invariant second order corrections due to the pure gluonic self-energy insertion and a certain class of O(ff 3 s) and O(ff 4 <b>s)</b> <b>corrections</b> are determined. For the special choice of the gauge parameter, ¸ = 4, the leading threshold and high energy behaviour of the pure second order gluonic corrections to the cross-section are governed by the gluonic self-energy insertion. 1 Introduction As {{a consequence of the}} high precision measurements at LEP the total cross-section for quark antiquark production in e + e Γ -annihilation has been subject to extensive studies during the past years.

It is shown that the Salpeter 2 ̆ 7 s [l] corrcction due to the plasma screening of the interaction potential is at least r/d smaller(r is the nuclei size and d is Debye screening length) than previously thought and is zero in the approximation when the terms of the order r/d are neglectcd.
