However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive.

The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E

2500|$|An {{essential}} {{feature for}} the formation of laterite is the repetition of wet and dry seasons. Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by capillary action during the dry season. These ions form <b>soluble</b> <b>salt</b> compounds which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season. Laterite formation is favoured in low topographical reliefs of gentle crests and plateaus which prevents erosion of the surface cover. The reaction zone where rocks are in contact with water—from the lowest to highest water table levels—is progressively depleted of the easily leached ions of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. A solution of these ions can have the correct pH to preferentially dissolve silicon oxide rather than the aluminium oxides and iron oxides.|$|E

The most common <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> in soils are the cations calcium (Ca + 2, magnesium (Mg + 2), and sodium (Na +) and the anions chloride (Cl-), sulfate (SO 4 - 2), and bicarbonate (HCO 3 -). Smaller quantities of potassium (K +), ammonium (NH 4 +), nitrate (NO 3 -), and carbonate (CO 3 - 2) are also found in most soils. Sources of <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> in soils include commercial fertilizers, animal manures, municipal sewage sludges, soil organic matter, runoff from areas where salt or ice-melt products have been used and irrigation water that is high in dissolved salts. At “normal ” concentrations, <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> have little harmful effect on plant growth; however, if excessive <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> exist, plant injury, such as reduced germination rates and leaf burning, or death may occur.

25|$|A common {{degradation}} {{issue in}} ceramics involves <b>soluble</b> <b>salts.</b> <b>Soluble</b> <b>salts</b> can either enter the clay {{body from the}} environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to {{the components of the}} materials or clay used.

40|$|Dust {{composition}} is reflective to environmental {{conditions of the}} source areas, the transportation dynamics, and the post-depositional environments. In this study, soil chemical analysis and micromorphological approaches were conducted on a loess-soil sequence of the last 900 ka near Xining at the western most part of the Loess Plateau. Thirty representative samples were selected to determine the pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), and the exchangeable cations. Soil solutions of sixty representative samples were analyzed to determine the composition of <b>soluble</b> <b>salts.</b> All the analyzed samples show alkaline properties with the pH values varing from 8. 5 to 10. 0. pH values in loess layers (generally > 9. 0) are higher than in soil layers (generally < 9. 0). Except the Holocene soil S 0 with weak alkaline property, ESP in loess varies from 15 ％ ~ 25 ％ while it ranges from 20 ％ ~ 40 ％ in soils. Both loess and soil layers contain {{a significant amount of}} <b>soluble</b> <b>salts,</b> including abundant sulfates that are thought to have significant climate impacts. Na+ represents a proportion of more than 70 ％ among cations. Among anions, CO 2 - 3 and HCO- 3 are more abundant in loess layers than in soil layers while SO 2 - 4 and Cl- are more abundant in soils. These indicate that loess layers contain more Na 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3, while soil layers mainly contain NaCl and Na 2 SO 4. Overall, <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> are much more abundant in soils than in loess layers. Micromorphological investigations show a weak weathering intensity of the studied soils, characterized by relatively fresh feldspars and biotite grains. All soil samples still contain detrital carbonates, suggesting their weakly developed steppe condition. These do not support a chemical weathering origin of the <b>soluble</b> <b>salts.</b> Because the studied section is located on high-terraces and no hydromorphic features were observed in either loess or soil layers, these <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> were unlikely to be originated from groundwater. Consequently, we interpret that these <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> were derived from eolian dust during the loess deposition. Salt-bearing dust should have been originated from the surrounding alkaline and saline lakes through eolian erosion. Our results therefore revealed a detrital origin for the abundant <b>soluble</b> <b>salts.</b> These indicate that alkaline/saline lakes have been constantly developed in the surrounding areas over the last 900 ka. These lakes were probably seasonal and have experienced wind erosion during dry seasons. A most startling feature is the much higher content of <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> in loess layers than in soil layers, indicating that the interglacial dusts contain more <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> than glacial dusts. These might be attributable to the more abundant rainfalls associated with the higher temperatures and stronger evaporation during the interglacial times...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} {{proved that}} mural damages {{result from the}} subflorescence of <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> with water infiltration and migration. Water can move through the plaster, and then evaporate from the surface. The changes of relative humidity in the grottoes will make <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> repeatedly dissolve and crystallize, while the plaster repeatedly expand and shrink. Then the plaster of mural becomes loose during this process. Disruption {{is characterized by the}} crumbling of soil and paint layer. Therefore, the formation of disruption is mainly influenced by the following factors. First, <b>soluble</b> <b>salts</b> in the mural plaster and rock are the basic material resources to cause disruption. Second, the alterations of temperature and humidity in the caves drive the water migration. Finally, the cycles of salt solvation – crystallization with water directly lead to disruption.|$|R
