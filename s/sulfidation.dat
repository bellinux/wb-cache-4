50|$|<b>Sulfidation</b> is {{a process}} of {{installing}} sulfide ions in a material or molecule. The process is widely used to convert oxides to sulfides but is also related to corrosion and surface modification.|$|E
50|$|Sulfidic corrosion, {{also known}} as <b>sulfidation,</b> is the term used for high {{temperature}} corrosion (above 450F / above approx. 260°C) of steel in contact with sulfur (Fe reacts with S to form FeS).|$|E
50|$|The main {{method for}} {{preparing}} these compounds is thermolysis of mixtures of phosphorus and sulfur. The product distributions {{can be analyzed}} by 31P NMR spectroscopy. More selective syntheses entail (i) desulfurization, e.g. using triphenylphosphine and, complementarily, (ii) <b>sulfidation</b> using triphenylarsine sulfide.|$|E
50|$|A {{large scale}} {{application}} of <b>sulfidation</b> is {{the conversion of}} molybdenum oxides to the corresponding sulfides. This conversion {{is a step in}} the preparation of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization wherein alumina impregnated with molybdate salts are converted to molybdenum disulfide by the action of hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5000|$|One {{commonly}} encountered {{occurrence of}} <b>sulfidation</b> in manufacturing environments involves the sulfidic corrosion of metal piping. [...] The increased {{resistance to corrosion}} found in stainless steel is attributed to a layer of chromium oxide that forms due to oxidation of the chromium found in the alloy.|$|E
50|$|CMA (CaMg2(CH3COO)6) {{decomposes}} around 380-400 °C {{to produce}} the following products: CaCO3, MgO, CH3COCH3, and CO2. CaCO3 further decomposes around 700 °C to CaO and CO2. A <b>sulfidation</b> reaction then takes place when CaO is reacted with H2S at reducing conditions in a gasifier, yielding CaS and H2O. CaS is finally reacted with O2 to produce inert CaSO4 which can then be disposed of.|$|E
50|$|The volcano {{is part of}} the {{so-called}} Tin belt, a territory in the Andes where large tin mineral deposits are found in granitic and extrusive rocks, formed from <b>sulfidation</b> reactions involving the numerous volcanoes in the area. Magmas in the territory are derived from crystal fractionation and were heavily modified by interactions with the crust that reaches a thickness of 70 km beneath the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E
50|$|High-temperature {{corrosion}} is {{a mechanism}} of corrosion {{that takes place}} in gas turbines, diesel engines, furnaces or other machinery coming in contact with hot gas containing certain contaminants. Fuel sometimes contains vanadium compounds or sulfates which can form compounds during combustion having a low melting point. These liquid melted salts are strongly corrosive for stainless steel and other alloys normally inert against the corrosion and high temperatures. Other high-temperature corrosions include high-temperature oxidation, <b>sulfidation</b> and carbonization.|$|E
50|$|In general, froth {{flotation}} {{is not used}} to concentrate copper oxide ores, as oxide minerals are not responsive to the {{froth flotation}} chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals). Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via froth flotation via <b>sulfidation</b> of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite), which can then be activated by the froth flotation plant.|$|E
50|$|Exploration from 1985 to 1993 {{determined}} Yanacocha was a 18 km by 6 km northeast trending belt of gold bearing high <b>sulfidation</b> outcrop system. Drilling in 1986 {{confirmed the}} gold potential. Other deposits discovered {{during this time}} include the Carachugo, San Jose, Yanacocha Norte, Maqui Maqui, Yanacocha Sur, Cerro Negro Este, and Cerro Quilish. Production began in 1993. By 2010, 20 hard rock deposits and 2 gravel alluvial fan deposits were being developed. The gold deposits are located in Miocene to Pliocene volcanic andesite host rocks.|$|E
50|$|Nickeline {{is formed}} by {{hydrothermal}} modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, {{and may be}} formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing pentlandite, and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblaged including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via <b>sulfidation</b> and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite. Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green nickel arsenate) on exposure to moist air.|$|E

Their two research groups are the Materials Performance Division, and the Process Development Division. Specific research is conducted on oxidation, <b>sulfidation,</b> foil lamination, and several areas related to coal burning.

50|$|The {{district}} is located within a Middle Jurassic volcano-plutonic complex composed of basaltic lavas and volcaniclastics underlain and intruded by gabbroic rocks. Mafic dikes are abundant and form sheeted dike swarms. Deposition of iron {{was not associated}} with silicification or <b>sulfidation.</b> Host rocks contain veins and large accumulations of pure magnetite in structural or breccia zones, or are impregnated with clots of magnetite in all size ranges. Magnetite is readily liberated from the host material by crushing and the iron removed by magnetic or gravity separation. Veins of pure magnetite in excess of 10 feet thick are common in the open pits and drill intercepts. Oxidation has produced some hematite.|$|E
50|$|Gold {{and silver}} {{mineralization}} is hosted in over 40 epithermal quartz veins and breccias of low to intermediate <b>sulfidation.</b> A corridor of veining extends northwesterly for 17 km {{and has a}} width of about 4 km. Individual veins can be traced for up to 2 km and vary from 1 to 20 metres thick. These are exposed in an erosional window of Lower Volcanic Series (LVS) andesite domes, flows, tuff and agglomerate, surrounded by Upper Volcanic Series (UVS) rhyolites and dacites. The main silver-bearing mineral is acanthite and native gold is associated with hydrothermal hematite. The base metal minerals galena, sphalerite and minor chalcopyrite increase with depth. Associated with the mineralized structures are hydrothermal alteration zones, including kaolinitization, silicification, and pyritization.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{approximately}} 95 percent of chloropropanes {{were being used}} as chemical intermediates. Chemical intermediates are industrial chemicals that are used {{as the starting point}} to produce other chemicals. 1,2,3-TCP is currently used as an intermediate in the production of polysulfone liquid polymers, the synthesis of hexafluoropropylene, and as a cross-linking agent in the synthesis of polysulfides. Polysulfone liquid polymers are used in the following industries: aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, electrical and electronic, health care, and in industrial equipment, such as compressor and pump valve components. Hexafluoropropylene is a fluorointermediate that is a key building block required to produce Teflon fluoropolymers; it has applications in the agrochemical, electronics, dyes/pigments, pharmaceutical, and specialty polymermarkets. Polysulfides are used as catalyst <b>sulfidation</b> agents and in the formulation of lubricant additives created for use in high-pressure environments or applications.|$|E
5000|$|The Kupol Gold Mine is a {{combination}} open-pit and underground gold mine, {{as well as a}} milling processing operation in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, in an area originally mined in the 1930s by prisoners of the Gulag. Bema Gold Corporation financed the $425-million project through various international banks, agencies, and equipment companies, plus the Chukotka government. Kinross acquired the property (at the time 75% of the mine) through the acquisition of Bema Gold, and a subsidiary (Chukotka Mining & Geological Company) purchased the remaining 25% from the government (via the State Unitary Enterprise of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) in 2011. [...] At Kupol, gold and silver occur as native gold, gold-silver alloy electrum, acanthite as well as silver-rich sulfosalts. Dvoinoye, on the other hand is a low <b>sulfidation</b> epithermal gold-silver vein deposit, and notably counts with appreciable free gold in parts of the deposit.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the pressure during the <b>sulfidation</b> on the structure and activity of a calcined CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was studied by Mössbauer emission spectroscopy (MES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dibenzothiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity measurements. <b>Sulfidation</b> at elevated pressure (4 MPa) leads to a much higher HDS activity than upon 0. 1 MPa <b>sulfidation.</b> Similarly, the HDS activity increases when after 0. 1 MPa <b>sulfidation</b> (673 K) the <b>sulfidation</b> pressure is increased to 4 MPa. The average slab size (not, vert, similar 2. 8 nm) and stacking degree (not, vert, similar 1. 4) do {{not depend on the}} <b>sulfidation</b> pressure. EXAFS data point to a higher rate of Co and Mo <b>sulfidation</b> at elevated pressure. Although this leads to a somewhat more aggregated form of Co-sulfide particles at intermediate temperatures compared to the case of 0. 1 MPa <b>sulfidation,</b> redispersion takes place to small Co-sulfide species on the MoS 2 edges. The spectroscopic data of such stepwise sulfided series support the supposition that <b>sulfidation</b> at 4 MPa leads to a Type II Co–Mo–S phase whereas 0. 1 MPa <b>sulfidation</b> results in a less active Type I phase. In addition, upon direct high-pressure <b>sulfidation</b> all Co atoms end up in the Co–Mo–S phase, whereas atmospheric pressure <b>sulfidation</b> leaves a small fraction of Co in close interaction with the support...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{specially}} developed, quasi in situ vacuum-sample-transfer system, the stepwise sequential <b>sulfidation</b> of CoMo/g-Al 2 O 3 was studied with {{transmission electron microscopy}} without exposing the catalyst to air. In a first step, the <b>sulfidation</b> was performed at 400 DegC at either 1 or 10 bar pressure. In a second step, the <b>sulfidation</b> was performed at 600 DegC and 1 bar. As the second <b>sulfidation</b> step {{was performed on the}} sample on the transmission electron microscopy grid, the same areas of the samples that had been studied for the first <b>sulfidation</b> step could be studied once more, providing detailed data on the changes in the sulfided phase. The slab length and degree of stacking have been studied in detail from the TEM/HREM images. <b>Sulfidation</b> at higher pressure or higher temp. results in a higher av. slab size. Detailed study of the same areas of the catalysts before and after the second, more severe, <b>sulfidation</b> step shows that although the dispersion of the sulfided phase decreases, the total amt. visible in the TEM images remains unchanged. This indicates that practically all the sulfide present is actually imaged on the micrographs. Addnl., detailed HRTEM study shows increased crystallinity of the slabs after the second <b>sulfidation</b> step. XPS anal. shows that after <b>sulfidation</b> at 400 DegC and 1 bar, the degree of <b>sulfidation</b> is 95 %, whereas after <b>sulfidation</b> at 600 DegC and 1 bar, <b>sulfidation</b> is complete. The catalytic performance for thiophene hydrodesulfurization is much higher after <b>sulfidation</b> at 10 bar and 400 DegC as compared to 1 bar and 400 DegC, and decreases after the second <b>sulfidation</b> step (1 bar 600 DegC). The latter effect is more pronounced for the sample sulfided at 10 bar in the first step, indicating that a distorted yet fully sulfided structure is the most active phase for thiophene HDS.

40|$|The <b>sulfidation</b> {{behavior}} of alumina-supported W catalysts was investigated {{by means of}} temperature-programmed <b>sulfidation,</b> quick extended X-ray adsorption fine structure measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of two series of tungsten catalysts, one made from ammonium metatungstate and the other from ammonium tetrathiotungstate. The effect of the fluorination of the alumina support on the <b>sulfidation</b> {{behavior of}} W on these two series of catalysts was also studied. The <b>sulfidation</b> of catalysts prepared with ammonium metatungstate passes through intermediates of W oxysulfides; the sulfided catalysts are mixtures of W oxysulfides and WS 2. After <b>sulfidation</b> at 400 °C and atmospheric pressure for 4 h, the degree of <b>sulfidation</b> is only about 50 %. Fluorination slightly increases the degree of <b>sulfidation.</b> When ammonium tetrathiotungstate is used as the precursor, fully sulfided catalysts can be obtained.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the degree of W <b>sulfidation</b> on dispersion, morphology, {{thiophene}} hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, and promotional behavior for supported Ni(Co) W sulfide catalysts was studied by varying the calcination temperature, <b>sulfidation</b> temperature, <b>sulfidation</b> pressure, and support. The catalysts were characterized by thiophene HDS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; transmission electron microscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine-structure, and Mössbauer emission measurements. Assuming that <b>sulfidation</b> to a WS 2 phase proceeds via a WOxSy phase it can be concluded that the ratio between these two phases depends on the <b>sulfidation</b> conditions and W–support interaction. For the highest thiophene HDS activity, <b>sulfidation</b> conditions that result in nearly maximum <b>sulfidation</b> of the WOxSy phase are necessary. However, one should be aware that complete <b>sulfidation</b> results in the formation of WS 2, which is more susceptible to sintering. For Al 2 O 3 -supported NiW catalysts preferable <b>sulfidation</b> conditions are a low temperature and a high H 2 S/H 2 <b>sulfidation</b> pressure. In contrast, for TiO 2 -supported NiW the calcination and <b>sulfidation</b> temperatures have to be low and <b>sulfidation</b> at atmospheric H 2 S/H 2 pressure is already sufficient, because W is more easily sulfided due to its weak interaction with TiO 2. The degree of <b>sulfidation</b> also affects the promotional behavior. The optimal Ni/W ratio is higher than the optimal Ni/Mo ratio, while in contrast to CoMo catalysts, for CoW no optimal ratio could be found. In addition, the activity of CoW appeared about the same as the sum of the W and Co activities, regardless of the Co content. In the case of NiW and CoW, Ni and Co are sulfided first. As soon as WS 2 appears, the NiS particles already formed partially redisperse to form NiWS, while the CoS particles tend to form a separate Co 9 S 8 phase instead of CoWS...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} corrosion {{of structural}} alloys in sulfur bearing environments is many {{orders of magnitude}} higher than in oxidizing environments. Efforts to increase <b>sulfidation</b> resistance of these alloys include addition of alloying elements. Aluminum additions to iron-chromium alloys bring about increase in <b>sulfidation</b> resistance. This paper reports the effect of pre-oxidation on the <b>sulfidation</b> behavior of Fe- 20 Cr and Fe- 20 Cr- 5 Al alloys in H 2 - 2 % H 2 S environment at 800 °C. The surfaces of sulfidized specimens were also examined. Pre-oxidation of the two alloys results in an incubation period during subsequent <b>sulfidation.</b> After this incubation period, the Fe- 20 Cr alloy showed <b>sulfidation</b> behavior similar to that when the alloy was not pre-oxidized.

40|$|A physics-based {{understanding}} of material aging mechanisms helps to increase reliability when predicting {{the lifetime of}} mechanical and electrical components. This report examines in detail the mechanisms of atmospheric copper <b>sulfidation</b> and evaluates new methods of parallel experimentation for high-throughput corrosion analysis. Often our knowledge of aging mechanisms is limited because coupled chemical reactions and physical processes are involved that depend on complex interactions with the environment and component functionality. Atmospheric corrosion {{is one of the}} most complex aging phenomena and it has profound consequences for the nation's economy and safety. Therefore, copper <b>sulfidation</b> was used as a test-case to examine the utility of parallel experimentation. Through the use of parallel and conventional experimentation, we measured: (1) the <b>sulfidation</b> rate as a function of humidity, light, temperature and O{sub 2 } concentration; (2) the primary moving species in solid state transport; (3) the diffusivity of Cu vacancies through Cu{sub 2 }S; (4) the <b>sulfidation</b> activation energies as a function of relative humidity (RH); (5) the <b>sulfidation</b> induction times at low humidities; and (6) the effect of light on the <b>sulfidation</b> rate.

40|$|<b>Sulfidation</b> {{properties}} of Fe- 6, 9, 18, and 28 atomic percent (a/o) A 1 alloys were investigated at 1173 K in sulfur vapor at the dissociation pressure of FeS. The Fe- 6 A 1 alloy exhibited internal sulfidation; the Fe- 9 and 18 A 1 alloys exhibited internal <b>sulfidation</b> along with {{formation of an}} external FeAI~S 4 scale. Compositions of the internal sulfide precipitates corresponded to FeAI~S 4 in the Fe- 6 A 1 alloy and to FeAI~S 4 -AI~S: ~ in the alloys containing 9 and 18 a/o AI. The Fe- 28 a/o A 1 alloy upon <b>sulfidation</b> only formed an A 12 S 3 external scale. The apparent permeability of sulfur in the alloy of the in-ternal <b>sulfidation</b> zone as defined by Ns'S~Ds product increased linearly with alloy composition. Growth of the sulfide precipitates which extended as plates across the internal <b>sulfidation</b> zones is Satisfactorily interpreted by a model involving enhanced sulfur diffusion along the interfaces between the internal sulfides and alloy matrix. Transition from internal <b>sulfidation</b> to internal <b>sulfidation</b> plus external scale formation and finally to only external scale formation based upon the alloy aluminum composition is discussed. The <b>sulfidation</b> resistance of iron in sulfur as well as H~S bearing atmospheres is improved considerably by ad-dition of aluminum as an alloying element (1 - 7). The reac-tion kinetics of these alloys are generally complex due to growth of a multilayered scale and internal <b>sulfidation</b> (7). The present paper is concerned with obtaining an un-derstanding of the <b>sulfidation</b> {{properties of}} Fe-A 1 alloys with respect o internal <b>sulfidation</b> and of the transition to external sulfide scale formation. Accordingly, Fe-A 1 al-loys containing up to 28 atomic percent (a/o) A 1 have been sulfidized at 1173 K in sulfur vapor at the dissociation pressure of FeS (1. 45 x 10 - 3 Pa) to prevent formation and influence of this rapid growing phase on the reaction mechanism...|$|E

It was shown that up to a <b>sulfidation</b> temperature of 573 K small highly active Co sulfide clusters were formed in the supercages. <b>Sulfidation</b> above 573 K led to decomposition of these Co sulfide particles by a protolysis reaction resulting {{in the formation of}} H 2 S and a blue colored Co compound having almost no HDS activit...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Co (or Ni) and W with the Al 2 O 3 -support influences the <b>sulfidation</b> behavior and thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity of COW and NiW model catalysts. High calcination temperatures retard the <b>sulfidation</b> of Co, Ni, and W to high temperature {{and lead to}} incomplete <b>sulfidation</b> at 400 degreesC, In bimetallic catalysts, the presence of W prevents the strong {{interaction of}} Co and Ni with the Al 2 O 3 support and partially blocks the diffusion of Co and Ni into the support, thereby facilitating the <b>sulfidation</b> of Co and Ni. For CoW/Al 2 O 3 catalysts bulk cobalt sulfide and WS 2 are formed during suffidation and hence no promotion effect is observed. However, the HDS activity of NiW/Al 2 O 3 is a factor 5 - 6 times higher than for W/Al 2 O 3. This strong promotion effect is ascribed {{to the formation of}} the NiWS phase by redispersion of preformed bulk Ni sulfide to the edges of WS 2 slabs as observed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Both the calcination and <b>sulfidation</b> temperature have a strong influence on the HDS activity. Incomplete <b>sulfidation</b> due to either high calcination temperature or low <b>sulfidation</b> temperature decreases the HDS activity. NiW/Al 2 O 3 containing CyDTA shows the highest HDS activity. Due to the complexation of Ni with CyDTA, the <b>sulfidation</b> of Ni is retarded to temperatures where WS 2 is already formed, thereby forming directly NiWS. However, these catalysts are highly unstable at high <b>sulfidation</b> temperature (T {{less than or equal to}} 550 degreesC) and segregation of the active phase is observed. As a result these catalysts loose their superior HDS activit...|$|E

Catalyst pellets were poisoned in diluted H 2 S between 100 and 400 °C and the <b>sulfidation</b> of the catalyst was observed. During this process, nickel sulfides are formed on the catalyst according to X-ray diffraction spectra and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data. The <b>sulfidation</b> kinetics was quantitatively described by a shrinking core model. Representative catalyst pellets were electrically contacted, and their impedance was recorded in situ during <b>sulfidation.</b> At the beginning, the particles are highly insulating and behave capacitively. Their conductivity increases by decades during <b>sulfidation.</b> At high temperatures, an almost constant slope in the double-logarithmic representation vs. time can be found. At low temperatures, the conductivity remains constantly low {{for a long time}} but changes then rapidly by decades, which is also indicated by the phase that drops from capacitive to ohmic behavior. Since nickel sulfides exhibit a lower conductivity than nickel, the conductivity increase by decades during <b>sulfidation</b> can only be explained by electrically conducting percolation paths that form during <b>sulfidation.</b> They originate from the increased volume of sulfides compared to the pure nickel metal...|$|E

Combination of the <b>sulfidation</b> behaviour of Co and Mo studied by XPS and activity measurements shows that the key {{in the formation of the}} CoMoS phase is the retardation of the <b>sulfidation</b> of Co. Complexing Co to nitrilotriacetic acid complexes retarded the Co <b>sulfidation,</b> resulting in the most active catalyst. Due to the retardation of Co in these catalysts, the <b>sulfidation</b> of Mo precedes that of Co, thereby creating the ideal conditions for CoMoS formation. In the CoMo catalyst without NTA the <b>sulfidation</b> of Co is also retarded due to a Co–Mo interaction.
