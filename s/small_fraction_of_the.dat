An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004.

Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|A <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zircon is {{converted}} to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God.

The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population.

5|$|A 2006 {{study of}} inland {{bodies of water}} around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap {{in the range of}} prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, {{terrestrial}} birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. Both species preyed on the maned duck. Rabbits constituted only a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white-bellied sea eagle's diet. Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores. However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned.

Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just a <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs {{is that they have}} recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. - We propose an {{electromechanical}} transducer {{based on a}} resonant-tunnelling configuration that, {{with respect to the}} standard tunnelling transducers, allows larger tunnelling currents while using the same bias voltage. The increased current leads to a decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shot noise and an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> momentum noise which determine the quantum limit in the system under monitoring. Experiments with micromachined test masses at 4. 2 K could show dominance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> momentum noise over the Brownian noise, allowing observation of quantum-mechanical noise at the mesoscopic scale. Recently a novel {{electromechanical transducer}} based upon vacuum tunnelling of electrons has been proposed to detect displacements of a macroscopic mass [1]. A variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance between the test mass and a tip changes the tunnelling current and whenever <b>small</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current are appreciable, corresponding displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test mass, which are <b>small</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> De Broglie wavelength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnelling electrons, are also detectable. <b>The</b> relevance <b>of</b> this new class of transducers has been emphasized expecially concerning detection of gravitational waves using bar antennae [1, 2], design of quantum standard of current in metrology [3] and study of quantum-mechanical noise at th...|$|R
