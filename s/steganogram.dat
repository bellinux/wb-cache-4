40|$|The paper {{presents}} Multi-Level Steganography (MLS), which {{defines a}} new concept for hidden communication in telecommunication networks. In MLS, at least two steganographic methods are utilised simultaneously, {{in such a way}} that one method (called the upper-level) serves as a carrier for the second one (called the lower-level). Such a relationship between two (or more) information hiding solutions has several potential benefits. The most important is that the lower-level method steganographic bandwidth can be utilised to make the <b>steganogram</b> unreadable even after the detection of the upper-level method: e. g., it can carry a cryptographic key that deciphers the <b>steganogram</b> carried by the upper-level one. It can also be used to provide the <b>steganogram</b> with integrity. Another important benefit is that the lower-layer method may be used as a signalling channel in which to exchange information that affects the way that the upper-level method functions, thus possibly making the steganographic communication harder to detect. The prototype of MLS for IP networks was also developed, and the experimental results are included in this paper. Comment: 18 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

50|$|All {{information}} hiding techniques {{that may be}} used to exchange <b>steganograms</b> in telecommunication networks can be classified under the general term of network steganography. This nomenclature was originally introduced by Krzysztof Szczypiorski in 2003. In 2016, a first network steganography covering book was published by Mazurczyk et al. However, network {{information hiding}} was already applied in the late 1980s by Girling and Wolf.Contrary to typical steganographic methods that use digital media (images, audio and video files) to hide data, network steganography uses communication protocols' control elements and their intrinsic functionality. As a result, such methods can be harder to detect and eliminate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Steganography {{is often}} {{combined}} with cryptographic mechanisms. This enhances steganography by valuable properties that are originally left to cryptographic systems. However, new problems for cryptographic mechanisms {{arise from the}} context of steganography. There are two sorts of steganographic tools: commercial tools with insecure or badly implemented cryptography and academic proof-of-concepts that abstain from the actual implementation of the cryptographic part. Comparably to cryptography, steganography evolves in an iterative process of designing and breaking new methods. In this paper we examine the encoding properties and cryptographic functionality of steganographic tools to enable the detection of embedded information in <b>steganograms</b> even if the embedding part was otherwise secure. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper shows three {{approaches}} for detecting <b>steganograms</b> with low change density. MP 3 Stego is a steganographic algorithm {{with a very}} low embedding rate. The attack presented here is a statistical analysis of block sizes. It is able to detect 0. 001 % of steganographic payload in MP 3 files. The second approach {{is the use of}} hash functions to combine sample categories for the chi-square attack. One of these hash functions enables us to detect about 0. 2 bits per pixel in true colour images. Another algorithm (Hide) was presented at the last workshop and constructed to be secure against visual and statistical chi-square attacks. The detection method for Hide combines the three colour components of each pixel to recognise an increased number of “neighbour colours”. ...|$|R
40|$|TranSteg (Trancoding Steganography) is {{a fairly}} new IP {{telephony}} steganographic method that functions by compressing overt (voice) data to make space for the <b>steganogram</b> by means of transcoding. It offers high steganographic bandwidth, retains good voice quality and is generally harder to detect than other existing VoIP steganographic methods. In TranSteg, after the <b>steganogram</b> reaches the receiver, the hidden information is extracted and the speech data is practically restored to what was originally sent. This is a huge advantage compared with other existing VoIP steganographic methods, where the hidden data can be extracted and removed but the original data cannot be restored because it was previously erased due to a hidden data insertion process. In this paper we {{address the issue of}} steganalysis of TranSteg. Various TranSteg scenarios and possibilities of warden(s) localization are analyzed with regards to the TranSteg detection. A steganalysis method based on MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) parameters and GMMs (Gaussian Mixture Models) was developed and tested for various overt/covert codec pairs in a single warden scenario with double transcoding. The proposed method allowed for efficient detection of some codec pairs (e. g., G. 711 /G. 729), whilst some others remained more resistant to detection (e. g., iLBC/AMR).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new hidden data insertion procedure based on estimated probability {{of the remaining}} {{time of the call}} for steganographic method called LACK (Lost Audio PaCKets steganography). LACK provides hidden communication for real-time services like Voice over IP. The analytical results presented in this paper concern the influence of LACK's hidden data insertion procedures on the method's impact on quality of voice transmission and its resistance to steganalysis. The proposed hidden data insertion procedure is also compared to previous <b>steganogram</b> insertion approach based on estimated remaining average call duration. Comment: 23 pages, 27 figure...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to allowing more packets {{to be used}} as covert channel, DST-LACK offers a flexible requirement for the frame size. Since the DST voice stream will convey the information in the packets whose payloads are substituted by the <b>steganogram,</b> the frame size is allowed to be larger without affecting the quality of the voice frame. Furthermore, the numerical results also show that the call duration distribution performance is improved for the DST-LACK method which means that DST-LACK is more difficult to be detected in the VoIP network. The necessary trade-off of the DST-LACK method is the processing delay and hardware overhead involved by the DST buffer.|$|E

40|$|The typical {{approach}} to steganography is to compress the covert data {{in order to}} limit its size, which is reasonable {{in the context of}} a limited steganographic bandwidth. TranSteg (Trancoding Steganography) is a new IP telephony steganographic method that was recently proposed that offers high steganographic bandwidth while retaining good voice quality. In TranSteg, compression of the overt data is used to make space for the <b>steganogram.</b> In this paper we focus on analyzing the influence of the selection of speech codecs on hidden transmission performance, that is, which codecs would be the most advantageous ones for TranSteg. Therefore, by considering the codecs which are currently most popular for IP telephony we aim to find out which codecs should be chosen for transcoding to minimize the negative influence on voice quality while maximizing the obtained steganographic bandwidth.

30|$|On {{the sender}} side, LACK is {{implemented}} in two steps. In the first step, some random packets {{in the voice}} stream are selected. It {{should be noted that}} the maximum probability of one packet being selected is limited to satisfy the quality requirement of the voice service. The payload of the selected packets is replaced by the <b>steganogram</b> which refers to the secret message to be sent for the party of interest. The second step will hold those packets for a while to make sure the packets will be considered as late in the receiver side. The time for which a packet is held depends on the size of the receiver de-jitter buffer. Since the VoIP service is a time-sensitive service, very small delay is allowed for each packet, and the receiver de-jitter buffer will not be too large. The artificially delayed time must be greater than the de-jitter buffer size. However, it must be kept as small as possible to avoid detection.|$|E
40|$|The art of {{information}} hiding {{has been around}} nearly {{as long as the}} need for covert communication. Steganography, the concealing {{of information}}, arose early on as an extremely useful method for covert information transmission. Steganography is the art of hiding secret message within a larger image or message such that the hidden message or an image is undetectable; this is in contrast to cryptography, where the existence of the message itself is not disguised, but the content is obscure. The goal of a steganographic method is to minimize the visually apparent and statistical differences between the cover data and a <b>steganogram</b> while maximizing the size of the payload. Current digital image steganography presents the challenge of hiding message in a digital image {{in a way that is}} robust to image manipulation and attack.

30|$|Lost audio packet {{steganography}} (LACK), {{which was}} proposed in [1] and studied in [2 – 5], {{is an effective}} and high-capacity steganography scheme established over VoIP network. LACK takes advantages of the high data capacity of the VoIP data frame and its real-time feature. VoIP protocol is a popular technique for real-time voice communication through the Internet. The analog voice signal is sampled and packed in the VoIP voice frames to be transmitted over the IP network. In order to realize the real-time voice communication, VoIP protocol, which is also {{considered to be a}} real-time transport protocol (RTP), demands a very critical packet delay requirement. It cannot afford the delay tolerance level, which is admissible for the normal data packets since in real-time scenario, there is no time to wait for the delayed packets. As a result, a considerable amount of delayed packets will be dropped off at the receiver side. Therefore, a relatively high packet dropped-off rate is considered to be legitimate and necessary for RTP network. LACK simulates this behavior by generating many delayed packets purposely. The receiver will drop those delayed packets without decoding the payload of those packets. Nevertheless, those packets could be used to establish a covert channel to transmit secret message to designated parties by replacing the payload of those packets with the <b>steganogram.</b> The intended receiver will decode those delayed LACK packets instead of dropping them. One of the reasons to use RTP network to implement LACK is that those delaying and dropping behaviors are normal in the RTP network. Therefore, the LACK packets will not draw much suspicion from the network monitors. Besides undetectability, another advantage of LACK steganography is its high capacity. The high capacity derives from the high packet loss rate allowed in the RTP network. A considerable number of packets {{can be used as a}} covert channel. On the other hand, compared to the protocol header-based covert channels where usually only few bits in the protocol header can be used as covert message, the entire payload of the packets can be used to convey <b>steganogram</b> in LACK covert channel which incurs a large increase to the channel capacity. Some other covert channel methods can be found in [6 – 11].|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new steganographic method for IP telephony called TranSteg (Transcoding Steganography). Typically, in steganographic communication it is advised for covert {{data to be}} compressed in order to limit its size. In TranSteg it is the overt data that is compressed to make space for the <b>steganogram.</b> The main innovation of TranSteg is to, for a chosen voice stream, find a codec {{that will result in}} a similar voice quality but smaller voice payload size than the originally selected. Then, the voice stream is transcoded. At this step the original voice payload size is intentionally unaltered and the change of the codec is not indicated. Instead, after placing the transcoded voice payload, the remaining free space is filled with hidden data. TranSteg proof of concept implementation was designed and developed. The obtained experimental results are enclosed in this paper. They prove that the proposed method is feasible and offers a high steganographic bandwidth. TranSteg detection is difficult to perform when performing inspection in a single network localisation. Comment: 17 pages, 16 figures, 4 table...|$|E
40|$|Feature based steganalysis, an {{emerging}} branch in information forensics, aims at identifying {{the presence of}} a covert communication by employing the statistical features of the cover and stego image as clues/evidences. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of <b>steganogram</b> behaviours, optimizing the performance of steganalysers becomes an important open problem. This paper is focussed at fine tuning the performance of six promising steganalysers in this field, through feature selection. We propose to employ Markov Blanket-Embedded Genetic Algorithm (MBEGA) for stego sensitive feature selection process. In particular, the embedded Markov blanket based memetic operators add or delete features (or genes) from a genetic algorithm (GA) solution so as to quickly improve the solution and fine-tune the search. Empirical results suggest that MBEGA is effective and efficient in eliminating irrelevant and redundant features based on both Markov blanket and predictive power in classifier model. Observations show that the proposed method is superior in terms of number of selected features, classification accuracy and computational cost than their existing counterparts.

40|$|Steganography is the hiding of payload data within cover data. The {{goal of a}} steganographic {{method is}} to {{minimize}} the visually apparent and statistical differences between the cover data and a <b>steganogram</b> while maximizing {{the size of the}} payload. Current digital image steganography presents the challenge of hiding data in a digital image {{in a way that is}} robust to image manipulation and attack. Concealment of the payload data is contingent upon minimizing the apparent differences between the cover data and the stego data. There are two basic steganographic methods: Least significant bit (LSB) and transform-based. LSB steganography is one of the simplest methods. Data hidden in images using LSB steganography is highly sensitive to image alteration and vulnerable to attack. Transform based steganography is potentially more resistant to loss from image manipulation and increases the difficulty to a potential attacker. This paper describes a steganography implementation using the insignificant coefficients of a fast transform of an image for data hiding. The performance of this method using different transforms is measured and the characteristics of each transform are examined. Performance is measured by examining the payload density and its effect on image degradation. The performance of different transforms is measured on a variety of image types...|$|E
30|$|When LACK is applied, the {{legitimate}} VoIP service quality {{will be affected}} because of the increased delayed packets. One further reason that causes quality reduction {{is the loss of}} information in the packets replaced by the <b>steganogram.</b> The bandwidth of the VoIP channel is squeezed by the covert channel. In order to maintain integrity of the voice stream, one straightforward idea is to down-sample the entire voice stream to fit in the lowered bandwidth. Even though this helps to maintain the integrity of the voice stream, the quality of the voice is not improved because of the lowered sampling rate. From the information theory point of view, it is impossible to transmit the same voice stream in the same quality with a channel squeezed by the covert channel. One solution to this problem is to rearrange the perceptually insignificant parts of the signal into the dropped frames. On other hand, the perceptual quality of the voice stream is not lost because of the existence of the covert channel. A detailed way to implement the above scheme is to use the DST to voluntarily reduce those perceptual redundancies of the voice stream. DST dynamically resamples the voice stream in a variable sampling rate. The sampling rate is localized to not harm the perceptual quality of the signal. In fact, the basic idea for the DST is to make the distortion averagely distributed in the entire stream so that it is not noticeable to human beings.|$|E
