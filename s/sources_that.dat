5|$|The most {{complete}} and extant {{rendering of the}} story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity. It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> were available in his era such as the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus (2nd century BC), or <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially Sophocles' tragic drama Tereus (5th century BC).|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} {{beryllium}} was bombarded with alpha rays from {{the decay of}} radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered {{the existence of the}} neutron.

5|$|Approximately 400 were built, with Gordon and Dexter citing <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> state 389 or 399. They {{also provide}} a yearly {{production}} table that lists 35 built in 1928, 47 in 1929, 250 in 1930 and 55 in 1931, which add up to 389 when the two prototypes are included.|$|E

5|$|Bands {{to emerge}} from other major British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham. None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> included Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained {{at the core of}} their early albums.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's Register {{is only as}} {{accurate}} as the information owners gave it, and there are discrepancies between the entries for vessels and information from other <b>sources.</b> <b>That</b> said, there is generally a strong correspondence between the information in Lloyd's Register, and other sources, at least with respect to Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Pelé numbers differ between sources mostly due to {{friendly}} games. The RSSSF {{states that}} Pelé scored 767 goals in 831 official games, 1281 goals in 1365 overall {{while he was}} active, and 1284 in 1375 taking into account benefit games after retirement.

5|$|Sustainable seafood is seafood {{from either}} fished or farmed <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> can {{maintain}} or increase {{production in the}} future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E

5|$|The sons of vanquished foes {{would be}} enslaved and often {{forced to work}} in male brothels, {{as in the case}} of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an {{enterprise}} by the philosopher's rich friends. On the other hand, it is attested in <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> the rape of slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.|$|E

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{busy with}} The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> propelled him toward fame.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from <b>sources</b> <b>that</b> have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
