Correlations of the biological activities and computer modeling studies of the conformational properties of Tyr², Phe², eBmp² (agonists), Pen¹, and Tic² (antagonists) oxytocin analogs revealed that a g+ conformation for the aromatic ring in the 2 -position is important for the oxytocin-uterus receptor transduction. Examination of the topographical features of the energy minimized conformations of these analogs shows that a parallel aromatic surface {{over the top of the}} 20 -membered disulfide containing ring of the molecule is equally important for the transduction. Though the Tic compound may exclusively exist as the g+ conformation for the aromatic ring in the 2 -position, possible backbone changes and particularly the perpendicularly located aromatic ring on the top of the 20 -membered ring may be the reason for its antagonism. Calculations shows that (erythro(2 S, 3 S) -β-methyltyrosine²) OXT has all the requirements for being an highly active compound, while the isomer (threo-L-(2 S, 3 R) -β-methyltyrosine²) OXT, which differs only in the configuration of the β carbon, is unlikely to be an agonist according to our calculations.

40|$|Abstract — This work proposes {{the use of}} {{magnetic}} coupling for powering autonomous sensors in <b>space-constrained</b> applications, such as occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats. The power demand of the autonomous sensor is considered between tens and hundreds of milliwatts. A theoretical analysis first highlights the critical parameters {{in order to achieve}} a large powering range and high efficiency. Series-resonant tanks are considered for both the primary and secondary networks. Because the intended application is <b>space-constrained,</b> small coils have to be used. In order to increase their quality factor, commercial ferrite-core coils are used. A class D power amplifier is proposed for the primary network. Experimental results show that a power of tens of milliwatts can be transferred to a 100 Ω load placed at the secondary network up to a distance of 2 cm, near seven times the radius of the coils (3 mm). The addition of a rectifier and a voltage regulator at the secondary network in order to properly power an autonomous sensor (3 V @ 30 mA) limits the powering range to 1 cm. Overall power efficiencies around 45 % and 20 % are achieved respectively at distances of 5 mm and 1 cm...|$|E

In order to overcome a pure tone noise with a high peak value that is harmful to human hearing, a traditional reactive muffler has been used. However, the traditional method for designing a reactive muffler has proven to be time-consuming and insufficient. In order to efficiently reduce the peak noise level, interest in shape optimization of a Helmholtz muffler is coming to the forefront. Helmholtz mufflers that deal with a pure tone have been adequately researched. However, the shape optimization of multi-chamber Helmholtz mufflers that deal with a broadband noise hybridized with multiple tones within a constrained space has been mostly ignored. Therefore, this study analyzes the sound transmission loss (STL) and the best optimized design for a hybrid Helmholtz muffler under a <b>space-constrained</b> situation. On the basis of the plane wave theory, the four-pole system matrix used to evaluate the acoustic performance of a multi-tone hybrid Helmholtz muffler is presented. Two numerical cases for eliminating one/two tone noises emitted from a machine room using six kinds of mufflers (muffler A∼F) is also introduced. To find the best acoustical performance of a <b>space-constrained</b> muffler, a numerical assessment using a simulated annealing (SA) method is adopted. Before the SA operation can be carrie...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the analysis of}} current and future cellular communication systems. The main focus is on multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) antenna systems. The goal of this work is to characterize the achievable spectral efficiency of MU-MIMO systems, {{as well as to}} analyze the performance of practical, linear MU-MIMO transceiver structures in heterogeneous propagation environments. The analytical derivations in this thesis are based on the mathematical theory of finite and large dimensional random matrices. A collection of new general random matrix theory results, which permit efficient numerical evaluation are derived. With downlink regularized zero-forcing (RZF) processing at a cellular base station (BS), a general framework for the analysis of the expected (average) signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and ergodic sum spectral efficiency is developed for uncorrelated and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading, as well as uncorrelated Ricean fading propagation channels. In contrast to existing results, the presented analyses are extremely general, applicable to single-cellular, multi-cellular, as well as distributed antenna systems. These systems could consist of arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas, link signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), equal and unequal transmit correlation structures, and line-of-sight (LoS) levels, respectively. Numerical results are presented for single-cellular, as well as for two-tier multi-cellular systems demonstrating the impact of novel BS coordination strategies to suppress dominant inter-cellular interference. With dominant LoS directions in the propagation channel, the instantaneous downlink zero-forcing (ZF) SNR of a given terminal is analyzed. The ZF SNR is shown to be approximated by a gamma distribution for any number of transmit and receive antennas, link SNRs, and LoS levels. Furthermore, for moderately sized MU-MIMO systems, simplified instantaneous and ergodic sum spectral efficiency analyses are presented with RZF, ZF and matched-filter (MF) transmission on the downlink, and minimum-mean-squared-error, ZF and maximum-ratio combining (MRC) on the uplink, respectively. The simple nature of the derived expressions lead to the discovery of several valuable system level insights {{as a function of the}} contributing network parameters. Numerical results are presented for conventional and moderate MU-MIMO systems. Considering downlink semi-correlated Rayleigh fading channels with spatial correlation at the BS, it is mathematically proven that common correlation patterns for each terminal predicts lower ergodic sum spectral efficiencies in comparison to terminal specific correlation patterns. Closed-form approximations for the expected SINR and ergodic sum spectral efficiency are derived for both MF and ZF precoding, demonstrating the sensitivity of unequal correlation structures on the expected signal, interference and noise powers, respectively. The presented numerical results provide a cautionary tale of the impact of unequal correlation patterns on MU-MIMO performance and the importance of modeling this phenomenon. Finally, an approximate uplink performance analysis of large MU-MIMO systems with MRC and <b>space-constrained</b> uniform linear antenna arrays (ULA) is presented for semi-correlated Ricean fading channels. A <b>space-constrained</b> channel model is proposed, encapsulating the effects of unequal receive spatial correlation, unequal LoS levels, and unequal link gains for each terminal. The per-terminal and cell-wide ergodic sum spectral efficiencies are characterized and numerous practical special cases are presented. A limiting analysis of the ergodic per-terminal and cell-wide spectral efficiencies is also carried out, as the number of BS antennas grow without bound with a finite number of terminals and fixed physical dimensions of the ULA. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of <b>space-constrained</b> ULAs on the MU-MIMO system performance with variation in the LoS levels, correlation structures, physical array dimensions, and system size, respectively...|$|E
