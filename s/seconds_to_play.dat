5|$|The Lakers won 58 {{games in}} 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and {{defeated}} San Antonio four games to one {{to advance to}} the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento. The series would go on to be {{known as one of the}} greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games, and ended in a Lakers victory. In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> After the Kings won game five on a buzzer beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy scandal), the Lakers would win by four points. The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals. O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} 2014–15 season, Hilliard {{was named to}} the Preseason Second Team All-Big East. He {{averaged}} 14.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game as a senior. Villanova was ranked in the top ten for most of the season thanks to a balanced offense. Hilliard scored 23 points on December 20 in an overtime victory over Syracuse, hitting 9-of-17 shots. He hit two free throws to give the Wildcats the first lead of the game in overtime before being kicked in the face and tested for concussion-like symptoms. Against Creighton on January 25, 2015, he scored 24 points and made 6-of-10 three-pointers in a 71–50 victory at home. On February 14, in a 78–75 victory over Butler, Hilliard scored a career-high 31 points and also set a career high with 8 three-pointers made out of 13 attempts. He also hit the game-winning three-pointer with 1.5 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the game. Eight of his nine field goals in that game were three-pointers, and his eight rebounds were one short of a career-high. He averaged 18.7 points during a nine-game stretch that included the Butler game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E

25|$|After twelve minutes, {{the first}} goal was scored by the Wanderers' Moose Johnson to {{increase}} the goal lead to nine. Ottawa's Frank McGee, Harry Smith, and McGee again scored before half-time, cutting the deficit to 10–4. Harry Smith would score to open the second half, followed by Rat Westwick. Then Westwick scored again to make it 10–7 before Harry Smith scored three straight goals to make the score 9–1, evening the series with ten minutes to play to tie the series, causing a five-minute standing ovation. With seven minutes to play Smith was sent off {{for the rest of}} the game and Lester Patrick would score with ninety <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> to put the Wanderers back in the lead. Patrick would ice the game with a goal with a few <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> The Silver Seven reign was over.|$|E
25|$|Game three {{was played}} on April 16, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, {{and again the}} Drillers gave a valiant effort, and were within a goal of tying the match until midnight finally struck, and Steve Kuntz sealed their fate with an empty net goal with just seven <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> final score St. Louis 16, Edmonton 11.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Mallett later led a 56-yard {{drive to}} the UF 21-yard line, but Alex Tejada missed a {{potential}} game-winning field goal with 3:08 remaining.

On March 6, Ottawa lost the replay, and the loss would cost them a tie of the league championship, as Quebec finished 10–8 and Ottawa would finish 9–9.|$|E
25|$|In this double-overtime thriller, Kentucky {{started out}} well and led Michigan State by four at halftime, but Michigan State {{caught up in}} the second half, {{actually}} leading 70-62 with 5:43 to play. Kentucky rallied back, however, cutting the lead to one when Kelenna Azubuike drained a three with 1:19 to play. After Patrick Sparks missed the front end of a one-and-one with 41 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> Michigan State's Shannon Brown appeared to ice the game with two free throws with 20 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> But with time expiring, Sparks put up a prayer from three, and the ball bounced around the rim four times before falling in. After the referees spent nearly ten minutes reviewing the play, they upheld that Sparks' shot was a three pointer, sending the game into overtime. In the first overtime, neither team relented, and Brown hit a key three-point basket for Michigan State to keep them in the game. Kentucky's Azubuike missed a three as time expired to send the game into double overtime. In the second overtime, Michigan State's mettle finally won the game for them, as they scored 11 of their 13 points from the free throw line to finally seal the game and send them to the Final Four for the fourth time under coach Tom Izzo.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} closely fought until MSJ pulled {{away in the}} closing minutes. With the Lions having the ball with 30 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> and a safe 9-point lead, Benjamin called a timeout and sent Hill back into the game. They ran another play for Hill, this time for a {{right-handed}} layup, but she missed. One of her teammates rebounded the ball and passed {{it back to her}} for a second right-handed layup, which she made to close out the scoring in the Lions' 66–55 win. After the game, MSJ announced that $40,000 had been raised for TCSN.|$|E

25|$|In {{the other}} and more climactic Midwest Regional semifinal, Arizona squeaked by Oklahoma State when Salim Stoudamire canned a jumper with 2.8 seconds remaining. The game had been back-and-forth all night long, with Arizona leading by three at halftime but then letting up, {{allowing}} Oklahoma State to take a five-point lead at 72-67 with 4:29 remaining. Arizona and Oklahoma State then traded baskets, and Stoudamire sliced the Oklahoma State lead to 76-75 with 1:58 left on a three-pointer. After Joey Graham put Oklahoma State back up by one with eighteen <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> Stoudamire nailed his game-winner to send Arizona to the Regional Finals.|$|E
25|$|The Colts had two late {{opportunities}} to score on separate drives. On the first drive, the Colts faced a 4th down {{from inside the}} Charger 20-yard line. They decided against a field goal which still would have left them down by 1 point. Trying for the score, Peyton Manning was hurried by a blitzing Shawne Merriman as his throw came up short. The Chargers took over on downs but failed to get a first down. After a long punt by Mike Scifres, the Colts had less than 2 minutes {{to try to win}} the game. Once again, the Chargers defense stifled the Colts, taking over on downs with <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
25|$|Miller's {{last game}} was on May 19, 2005, at Conseco Fieldhouse, when the Pacers lost 88–79 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, ending the series 4–2. In the game, Miller led the Pacers with 27 points, making 11 out of 16 field goals {{including}} four of eight three-pointers. When {{he was taken}} out with 15.7 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> the Indianapolis crowd gave him a final standing ovation, where there were many teary eyes. Then-Pistons coach (and former Pacers coach) Larry Brown called an additional timeout during which the Pistons players joined in the ovation, a moment which provided closure to Miller's career and to a season that had been overshadowed by the brawl between the two teams.

25|$|Exhibiting his {{trademark}} poise {{in front of}} an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Law again provided a number of big shots. Hitting 13 of his 15 free-throw attempts, he ended the game with 26 points, including the final two points of the game. The Aggie's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 {{for the first time since}} 1980. In a show of good sportsmanship, Law spent time after the game consoling disappointed Louisville freshman Edgar Sosa, complimenting him on his performance. On March 22, however, Law and his teammates faced the #2 seed Memphis Tigers. The score was close throughout and Law had a chance to put A up by three on a break away lay up that he missed with just a few <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> The Aggies lost in a narrow contest 65–64, ending his collegiate career.|$|E
25|$|In another Regional Final {{overtime}} game (and {{a preview}} of a future Big East rivalry), West Virginia opened up the game at a blistering pace, using five three-pointers to jump out to a 19-5 lead. When Joe Herber made a three, West Virginia had a 32-13 lead with 5:30 {{to play in the}} first half. West Virginia led by thirteen at halftime, but Louisville finally went to a zone defense coming out of the half, and West Virginia began to go cold. Louisville cut the lead to three nine minutes into the second half, but Kevin Pittsnogle extended the West Virginia lead to ten with six minutes to play with a three. But West Virginia missed their last four field goals and Louisville tied the game with 38 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on Larry O'Bannon's layup. Louisville had grabbed the momentum and scored sixteen points in overtime to secure a berth in the Final Four.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997 Ford Motor City Bowl against Ole Miss, Moss {{added his}} 26th {{touchdown}} {{of the season}} on Marshall's first offensive play from scrimmage. He streaked down the right sideline and caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to tie the score at 7–7. NCAA rules at the time did not allow for statistics from bowl games to be combined with regular season stats, so the touchdown did not officially increase his season touchdown record. The two teams traded the lead {{several times in the}} fourth quarter before Ole Miss running back Deuce McAllister scored on a 1-yard touchdown run with 31 <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> giving them a 34–31 lead. Trying to pull out a last-second win, Pennington connected with Moss on a 40-yard pass on the final play of the game, but he was stripped of the ball as time expired. Moss finished the game with 6 receptions for 173 yards.|$|E
50|$|Mauti {{came back}} for the 2012 season and during the first four games, Mauti {{recorded}} a total of forty tackles.
