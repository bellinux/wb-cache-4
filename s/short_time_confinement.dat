A series of approximation on the hot spot energy balance differential equation leads to an analytical expression for ignition criteria as function of its areal density H s and temperature T s which determines ignition boundaries. In these calculations the uniform work done by cold fuel against hot spot pressure is also added. Its tamping effect allows the ignition at new spark parameter sets than a bare DT micro-sphere.

40|$|Evaluation of plasma {{parameters}} of driven and ignited Tokamaks {{for use in}} experimental power reactor (EPR) and commercial reactor applications has been performed. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the most pessimistic conditions under which a power producing reactor could be operated assuming the use of a high efficiency power (HEP) cycle. The adoption of the HEP cycle will enable a power producing reactor to operate with a plasma Q of 1. 5 or less as opposed to a required Q of approximately 8. 0 utilizing a conventional conversion cycle. Q is defined as the ratio of thermal fusion power produced to beam input power required. Pessimistic assumptions of large impurity concentrations and <b>short</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> are made in order to determine the regimes of operation the HEP cycle would render accessible. Characteristic values of plasma and reactor parameters are listed for each of three reactor models for both EPR's and commercial reactors and the favorable implications of the HEP cycle are delineated.

40|$|In the {{reversed}} field pinch RFX-mod at {{the highest}} plasma current of 2 MA, when error fields are not effectively feedback controlled, localized thermal loads up to tens of MW m(- 2) can be produced. The graphite tiles withstand such high power loads, but the high hydrogen retention makes density control extremely difficult. Several wall conditioning techniques have been optimized in the last campaigns, including helium glow discharge cleaning and wall boronization by diborane glow discharges. More recently, lithium conditioning has been applied {{for the first time}} in a {{reversed field pinch}} by the evaporation technique. The main results are discussed in this paper. Lithization leads to important operational advantages: a significant improvement of the density control is obtained. Densities up to n/n(G) approximate to 0. 5 can be produced in a controlled way. At the same value of input power, plasmas at higher densities can be sustained. However, due to the <b>short</b> particle <b>confinement</b> <b>time,</b> such densities are reached with high rates of gas puffing and the resulting profiles at high density are edge peaked.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{magnetic}} field within a fusion target {{is now known as}} Magnetized Target Fusion in the US and as MAGO (Magnitnoye Obzhatiye, or magnetic compression) in Russia. In contrast to direct, hydrodynamic compression of initially ambient-temperature fuel (e. g., ICF), MTF involves two steps: (a) formation of a warm, magnetized, wall-confined plasma of intermediate density within a fusion target prior to implosion; (b) subsequent quasi-adiabatic compression and heating of the plasma by imploding the confining wall, or pusher. In many ways, MTF can be considered a marriage between the more mature MFE and ICF approaches, and this marriage potentially eliminates some of the hurdles encountered in the other approaches. When compared to ICF, MTF requires lower implosion velocity, lower initial density, significantly lower radial convergence, and larger targets, all of which lead to substantially reduced driver intensity, power, and symmetry requirements. When compared to MFE, MTF does not require a vacuum separating the plasma from the wall, and, in fact, complete magnetic confinement, even if possible, may not be desirable. The higher density of MTF and much <b>shorter</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> should make magnetized plasma formation a much less difficult step than in MFE. The substantially lower driver requirements and implosion velocity of MTF make z-pinch magnetically driven liners, magnetically imploded by existing modern pulsed power electrical current sources, a leading candidate for the target pusher of an MTF system...|$|R

40|$|Turbulent {{transport}} {{of heat and}} particles significantly degrades the confinement in tokamaks. Whilst the confinement improves in larger devices, these are more expensive and the economic viability of future fusion power plants depends upon understanding turbulence so that operating scenarios can be optimised. Gyrokinetic models are able to describe the plasma turbulence responsible for transport. The assumption that the equilibrium varies slowly relative to the radial width of the instability is often exploited to reduce the global gyrokinetic system to a local one. The relation between the global and local systems is a key topic in this thesis. It is shown that local solutions can only capture the true global behaviour when freedoms in the system are treated correctly. A procedure to reconstruct the global solution from the local one has been developed and successfully tested. The spontaneous transition to a regime of high confinement, observed on many tokamaks, {{is associated with the}} suppression of turbulence in a narrow region near the plasma edge, known as the pedestal, and is accompanied by edge localised instabilities (ELMs) which can eject large amounts of energy in a <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> damaging the <b>confinement</b> vessel. Understanding the ELM and pedestal behaviour is crucial to predict the performance of future tokamaks, as well as offering insight into techniques to reduce the threat of damage due to ELMs. The application of gyrokinetics to study microinstabilities in the edge region of MAST in the time between two ELMs is presented as part of this thesis. This work finds kinetic ballooning modes to be unstable in the pedestal whilst microtearing modes are unstable in the shallow gradient region towards the core. The transition from MTMs to KBMs at the interface between the two regions has been studied and may {{play an important role in}} the pedestal evolution.

Using an ethnographic approach, and the personal prison experience, the author has interviewed twenty lifers.
