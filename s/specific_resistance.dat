These remarks are prefaced in the 'Encyclopaedia' article by the following statement: 'No telegraphic testing ought in future to be accepted in any department of telegraphic business which has not this definite character; although it is only within the last year that convenient instruments for working, in absolute measure, have been introduced at all, and the whole system of absolute measure is still almost unknown to practical electricians.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} between Liberty and Authority {{is the most}} conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government. By liberty, was meant protection against {{the tyranny of the}} political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, <b>specific</b> <b>resistance,</b> or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point.|$|E

It is always important to achieve reliable and accurate results in the extraction of any parameter. Several test structures achieve these conditions, of reliability and accuracy, including the Transmission Line Model, the Circular Transmission Line Model and the newer Single Dot test structure. This work seeks to improve the techniques used to extract <b>specific</b> contact <b>resistance</b> {{with a focus on}} the Circular Transmission Model and its equations. As such, the mathematical solutions to the Circular Transmission Line model have been reduced such that they are simpler and therefore faster to solve with no loss of accuracy. 3 C-SiC is used as a semiconductor example in developing the work presented. 3 C-SiC is not easily etched and {{is a good example of}} a semiconductor where circular transmission line model test structures are appropriate. Results presented in this report demonstrated how the improved analysis process increases the accuracy of measurements for determining <b>specific</b> contact <b>resistance.</b> The effects of temperature on <b>specific</b> contact <b>resistance</b> are discussed and analytical models developed. Since the pioneering research in this area and the extensive reports that were produced in the 1960 s and 1970 s, there has been relatively little work reported on investigating and testing of <b>specific</b> contact <b>resistance</b> with regard to changes in temperature.
