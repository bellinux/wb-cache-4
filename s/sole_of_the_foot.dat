5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> before inserting {{at the base of}} the toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E

However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

25|$|First, {{each foot}} would be soaked {{in a warm}} mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was {{intended}} to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut {{back as far as}} possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> Cotton bandages, 3m long and 5cm wide (10ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> until the toes broke.|$|E

25|$|Plantar warts are benign {{epithelial}} tumors generally {{caused by}} infection by human papilloma virus types 1, 2, 4, 60, or 63, but {{have also been}} caused by types 57, 65, 66, and 156. These types are classified as clinical (visible symptoms). The virus attacks compromised skin through direct contact, entering through possibly tiny cuts and abrasions in the stratum corneum (outermost layer of skin). After infection, warts may not become visible for several weeks or months. Because {{of pressure on the}} <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> or finger, the wart is pushed inward and a layer of hard skin may form over the wart. A plantar wart can be painful if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprint identification, {{known as}} dactyloscopy, or hand print identification, {{is the process}} of {{comparing}} two instances of friction ridge skin impressions (see Minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> to determine whether these impressions could have come from the same individual. The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an expert computer system operating under threshold scoring rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole).|$|E
25|$|Many changes {{brought about}} by the {{domestication}} of the horse have led to a need for shoes for numerous reasons, mostly linked to management that results in horses' hooves hardening less and being more vulnerable to injury. In the wild, a horse may travel up to 50 miles per day to obtain adequate forage. While horses in the wild cover large areas of terrain, they usually do so at relatively slow speeds, unless being chased by a predator. They also tend to live in arid steppe climates. The consequence of slow but nonstop travel in a dry climate is that horses' feet are naturally worn to a small, smooth, even and hard state. The continual stimulation of the <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> keeps it thick and hard. However, in domestication, the ways horses are used differ from what they would encounter in their natural environment. Domesticated horses are brought to colder and wetter areas than their ancestral habitat. These softer and heavier soils soften the hooves and make them prone to splitting, making hoof protection necessary. Consequently, it was in northern Europe that the nailed horseshoe arose in its modern form.|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} {{specimen}} contracted in alcohol is 20mm, the height and breadth are 9mm. Behind the shell, which is situated upon the hinder {{half of the}} body, the tail projects slightly. The end of the tail is flat, has no caudal mucous pit, and is bluntly pointed. The margin of the foot is produced into a slight flange. A pair of grooves running along the median line from the mantle to the muzzle define a row of small tubercles. Right and left, between this median line and the foot-edge, 2 indistinct grooves can be traced from the mantle to the lips. Posterior to these, the surface is divided into tubercles by small irregular grooves meandering outwards and downwards. The mantle has an even margin, with 2 small lappets on the under-side; the right proceeds forward from a little behind the respiratory pore (pneumostome), extends to almost one-third {{of the length of}} the mantle-margin, and forms a narrow fold; the left is minute, simply a rudiment, and in some specimens it is difficult to detect.
