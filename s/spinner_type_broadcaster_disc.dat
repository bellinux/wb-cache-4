50|$|As {{with all}} <b>spinner</b> <b>type</b> baits, various shapes of blades are used {{depending}} on many factors. Speed of retrieve {{is a major}} consideration because different blade designs revolve at different speeds. For example, the elongated willow leaf design requires the most speed to start and maintain the spin. The broader and more circular Colorado blade requires less speed and a slower retrieve to maintain spin. An Indiana blade falls somewhere in between. Vibration is higher with broader blades, less with streamlined blades, but flash depends more on blade size, texture and color than on design.|$|R
50|$|A shock jock is a <b>type</b> {{of radio}} <b>broadcaster</b> or <b>disc</b> jockey who entertains {{listeners}} or attracts attention using humor and/or melodramatic exaggeration that {{some portion of}} the listening audience may find offensive. The term is usually used pejoratively to describe provocative or irreverent broadcasters whose mannerisms, statements and actions are typically offensive to {{many members of the}} community. It is a popular term, generally not used within the radio industry. A shock jock is considered to be the radio equivalent of the tabloid newspaper, for which entertaining readers is as important as, or more important than, providing factual information. Within the radio industry, a radio station that relies primarily on shock jocks for its programming is said to have a hot talk format.|$|R
50|$|Many {{believe that}} a dressed treble {{presents}} a body/target that follows the flash ahead of it and that it may entice more strikes than a bare treble hook. For this reason, some companies have added soft plastic dressings to the hook to change the appearance and action of the bait and these are routinely called trailers. Soft plastic trailers have traditionally been curly tailed grubs and come in any color desired, as well as either single tail, double tails or quadratails. The speed of retrieve will always depend first on the blade size and design, but trailers provide lift for any <b>spinner</b> <b>type</b> bait, allowing a slightly lower retrieve speed.

The spinner system was also ground - and flight tested on a twin-engine fighter airplane. Flight measurements of cylinder-head temperature over a range of fuel-air ratios and engine power conditions were made at an altitude of approximately 10, 000 feet. Starting and accelerating of the engine on the ground were unaffected by the fuel-injection modifications. During the flight investigation, no appreciable variation occurred between the maximum and minimum cylinder-head temperature with the standard and modified system for the same power condition and no irregularity of mixture distribution could be detected throughout the power range of the engine. Normal mixture distribution was also indicated by a similar response of cylinder-head temperature for variations of fuel-air ratio at manifold pressures of 25 and 35 inches of mercury absolute. Both modified fuel-injection systems required less fuel-nozzle pressure than the standard system to obtain the desired fuel-air ratio for given air-flow condition...|$|R

50|$|It is {{also known}} as break {{spinning}} or rotor spinning. The principle behind open-end spinning {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring spinning with rotor speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended <b>spinners.</b> Each <b>type</b> of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between media ownership and partisan bias {{has been an}} important source of controversy in emerging democracies. Systematic tests of the effects of ownership, however, remain relatively rare. Using data from content analysis of 93 television news programs, as well as more detailed examination of six provincial television stations, we assess the extent of bias in different <b>types</b> of <b>broadcasters</b> during Mexico’s 2000 presidential campaign. We find that privately owned television stations were generally more balanced than public broadcasters, who typically followed propagandistic models of coverage. At the same time, private ownership often entailed collusive arrangements between broadcasters and politicians based on the prospect of future business concessions (i. e., “crony capitalism”). We conclude that changes in ownership patterns are unlikely to eradicate partisan bias, and we discuss other institutional remedies aimed at insulating both private and state-run media from political manipulation. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBioreactor, {{the womb}} for human stem cells, plays {{a vital role}} in {{enhancing}} its proliferation under controlled environment. Stem cells have the potential to differentiate and replicate it-self to further grow human tissues and organs. Bioreactor nurtures stem cells by providing nutritious environment and peerless oxygen flow inside the cell bag without obstructing the sheer force of the fluid or gas bubbles. The present paper unveils the design and development of bioreactor using the gyrator motion mechanism. This high functional bioreactor provides automation system that enhances the environment and serves excellent nutrient distribution to exceed cell growth through oxygen transfer and better mixing. One of the best characteristic of this bioreactor is that it requires no cleaning or sterilization as it is disposable. Compared to other bioreactors such as <b>spinner</b> flask <b>type,</b> rotating-wall type and the hollow fibre type, the proposed bioreactor is more convenient, easy to operate and maintain with more flexibility. Proposed bioreactor system operates in conjunction with mechanism of external gyrating motion that uses gravity in a natural way to make the flow circular inside it. The simultaneous mixing motion base is extremely suitable to grow stem cells. This bioreactor can be easily placed in an incubator and further addition or sampling is viable without the use of laminar flow cabinet...|$|R

40|$|Unlike other <b>types</b> of media, <b>broadcasters</b> do {{not enjoy}} full First Amendment {{protection}} against government restraints on speech. 1 The government’s authority to restrain broadcast speech derives from the intrinsic limitations of early radio signal modulation technology. 2 Early radios were designed {{to communicate with each}} other by decrypting radio signals that were broadcasted over a single radio frequency. 3 Interference with the per frequency operation of radios impeded early listeners’ abilities to hear speech from competing broadcasters and contributed to a perceived scarcity of broadcast frequencies (i. e., broadcast spectrum) for delivering free speech. 4 Amid such perceived scarcity and due to the competition for access to the airwaves between broadcasters and the listening public interest, government restraints on broadcasters developed concomitantly with lowered First Amendment protection for broadcasters. 5 Since then, broadcasters must apply for costly government-issued licenses to speak over the airwaves, and unlicensed broadcasters face sanctions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Public and {{commercial}} news have a distinct logic and adhere to different goals. In this paper, we evaluate {{the effect of}} this duality in the case of television news coverage on immigration and ethnic minorities. First, using survey analysis, we investigate whether individuals with a preference for public versus commercial television news differ in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and immigrants. In a second step, we hypothesize that this attitudinal gap is reflected by differences in content between both <b>types</b> of <b>broadcasters.</b> Relying on a content analysis of Flemish (i. e. the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium) television news (2003 - 2013), we compare coverage of ethnic minorities and immigrants between public {{and commercial}} news. We consistently find that individuals with a preference for commercial news hold more negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities and immigrants. The content analysis shows that, despite the overall negativity bias in coverage, commercial news focuses more on sensational news content, stressing negativity and conflict, and contains more tabloid characteristics like episodic news coverage and soft news topics. In line with its democratic function, public television news offers a more positive view on ethnic minorities and immigrants. We propose that these differences in news content can offer an explanation for the attitudinal gap between public and commercial news consumers. In this regard, we conclude that public broadcasters still have an important tolerance-enhancing and informative role to play in society. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Third Sector Broadcasting, {{which is}} {{sometimes}} {{also known as}} community broadcasting, is a significant sector of broadcasting and is becoming more important {{in many parts of}} the world. At present, it is clear that third sector actors have become significant players in the worldwide broadcasting industry. Due to the progress of the sector, during the last decade several countries have introduced their first laws or policies recognizing, or dealing specifically, with third sector broadcasting. Unlike many other countries, Australia and Canada have long-established specific laws and policies for the sector. This thesis presents a detailed comparative analysis of the regulation of Third Sector Broadcasting in Australia and Canada, drawing on the considerable experience of these jurisdictions in dealing with third sector-specific policies and regulations. The essential goals of the thesis are to identify significant regulatory and policy issues, and to develop guidelines to inform future policy and legislative developments in relation to TSB in jurisdictions that are yet to adopt specific laws or policies for the sector, or which have only recently done so. In addressing these goals, the thesis identifies and analyses eight key issues that need to be addressed when designing a best practice policy and regulation framework for TSB. Additionally, the thesis explains how TSB can contribute to the fulfillment of internationally recognized human rights and, thus, why it is desirable for governments to support the development of the sector. The thesis also assesses the legitimacy, under international human rights law, of subjecting third sector broadcasters to restrictions or requirements over and above those that apply to other <b>types</b> of <b>broadcasters...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} manner in which France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK have implemented the provisions in 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive for television advertising and sponsorship shows that there are obstacles {{for the development of a}} Single European Market in television advertising. Although 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive allowed transfrontier television advertising, the regulation of television advertising remains nationally based. Furthen-nore, Member States have different levels of advertising expenditure, selling practices and television market structures. There is a tension between the provisions for television advertising and sponsorship in the Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Television and those in the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Member States have indicated their commitment to one text over the other in the detailed choices for their national rules. The European Court of Justice resolved some of the contradictions and ambiguities in the 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive, and these have been reflected in the revised 1997 text. But there is still an ambiguity so as to what level of sponsor presence is adequate to ensure both transparency, and the protection of a broadcaster's editorial independence. Rules about the frequency and quantity of advertising differ between the five countries and four of them set different competitive requirements according to the <b>type</b> of <b>broadcaster.</b> There are marked differences in the rules about advertising breaks in feature films and other audiovisual works. National rules on sponsorship also vary, especially those on centre credits and the promotional mentions of the sponsor within the programme. So do the detailed provisions. National regulators decide when and what type of commercial presence constitutes surreptitious advertising. In some countries, it is only payment that renders product placement illegal, whereas in others the product has to be editorially justified and not given undue prominence. Direct offers to the public have proved to be a grey area in Member States where their economic value was high. Teleshopping is likely to become a significant source of programming, especially if Member States effectively expand their limits on airtime as allowed in the 1997 text. Although some differences have been resolved in the 1997 revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, there are still difficulties in establishing an effective level playing field for European television advertising...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this PhD dissertation is to apply theories from intergroup relations literature to media effect studies to obtain a better insight in how immigration news coverage as {{an aspect of the}} intergroup context affects native citizens’ attitudes toward immigration. The primary research question is as follows: how does immigration news coverage as a contextual-level factor contribute to attitudes toward immigration. This research question can be splitted into three main research goals: 1. The systematic study of the content of immigration news in terms of tone and use of threat frames, building upon intergroup threat theory; 2. The examination of the relationship between exposure to immigration news and anti-immigrant attitudes; 3. The exploration of the underlying process, building further on intergroup threat theory, through which news consumption affects anti-immigrant attitudes. This PhD project is an interdisciplinary project, in which concepts from political science, literature from media studies and theories from social psychology are employed to build a bridge between the various academic disciplines. In this way, I build further on extant research and offer a contribution to the literature via expanding the scope in a number of ways. The central contribution to the scientific literature stems from the intention to provide a comprehensive and systematic approach. I make use of a combination of quantitative research methods—content analysis, survey analysis and an experiment—to deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between news, threat perceptions and anti-immigrant attitudes. The context studied present two Western European case studies, Flanders and the Netherlands. With regard to the content of immigration news (goal 1), the results are clear-cut. Immigration news is mostly negative, while positive news about immigrants is very rare. Additionally, news often contains references to threat frames, which depict immigrants as posing a threat to the host society and its members: {{more than half of the}} news stories about North African immigrants contains threat frames. The most prevalent threat frames are criminal threats, followed by cultural threats and to a lesser extent economic threat. Remarkable in this regard is that often multiple threat frames are combined in one news story: the most often made combination are cultural and criminal threat frames. Analysis of trend over time shows that the use of threat frames is rising over time. Put differently: there is a negativity bias in immigration news coverage. In conclusion, news about immigration can be considered as an aspect of the intergroup context, in which mostly negative news, problems and threat frames are predominant. In this way, immigration news has the potential to operate as an information environment in which a collection of arguments about immigration are being promoted to which native citizens may be exposed, which subsequently may exert a profound influence on their attitudes about immigration. Exposure to negative and threathening news content about immigratie has consequences for native citizens’ threat perceptions and attitudes toward immigration (goal 2) : particularly exposure to negative news and cultural and criminal threat frames exert a strong influence, while the direct effects of exposure to positive news and economic threat are rather diffuse and somewhat less persistent. If natives are simultaneously exposed to criminal, cultural and economic threat frames, they tend to select the most threatening frame: criminal threat. The effects of exposure to criminal threat is decisive: this is probably due to its prevalence in the news, the specific way in which crime stories are being framed (in an episodical manner, black-white, with clear responsibility attribution), due to its personal and proximate nature, and due to the extreme risky nature of the threat. The negativity bias also seems to be at play when considering media effects: negative and threatening news is widespread, which makes this type of information easy to activate and apply in subsequent judgment. It seems that native citizens are especially ready to adopt threat frames which are congruent with prior knowledge (amongst others constructed by the news media) about a specific immigrant group. In a next step the underlying mechanism or exact process through which news exposure exerts influence on anti-immigrant attitudes is further explored into detail (goal 3). To this end, again an appeal is made upon intergroup relations literature, which is adopted as basis to empirically test a set of mediators. At least three mediators seem to be at play: perceived immigrant size, fear of crime, and perceptions and emotions about the economy. First, the visibility of immigration on the news results in an overestimation of the number of immigrants in society, which in turn leads to more negative attitudes toward immigrants. Second, the salience of crime as news topic and possibly the emphasis of involvement of immigrants in crime makes that native citizens who regularly watch television news become more fearful to become a victim of crime. This subsequently results in more negative attitudes with regard to immigration. Finally, news consumption – e. g. news about the economy and economic threats posed by immigrants – leads to the development of negative perceptions and emotions about the economy, which subsequently again results in anti-immigrant attitudes. The results in this dissertation as such shed more light on the underlying characteristics of news and the exact mechanism through which news effects come about. Still, nuance is in order. The content of immigration news and the effects of news exposure are partly dependent upon the specific type of broadcaster: the public broadcaster pays somewhat more attention to positive news stories and less often makes an appeal to sensational and tabloid reporting styles. Immigration news on the commercial broadcaster is more often negative, makes use of personal perspectives, rather than offering context and background information. The connection between immigration and soft news topics (such as crime) is more prevalent on commercial news. There is some evidence that people who prefer public news are slightly more positive toward immigrants. Furthermore, it seems that exposure to television news has stronger attitudinal consequences compared to newspaper exposure. Finally, especially soft and popular genres of news exert influence on threat perceptions and attitudes toward immigrants. Hence, this dissertation demonstrates that immigration news is not uniform, and that differentiating between various <b>types</b> of genres, <b>broadcasters</b> and content is a fruitful strategy, which to some extent offer a more qualified vision. An innovative finding is that a hierarchy exists in the way different types of minority groups are being depicted on the news: not all groups are portrayed in an evenly positively or negatively manner. The level and the type of threat frames that are being emphasised differs across outgroups: Roma, North Africans and Eastern Europeans are depicted in a more negative and threatening manner compared to Jews and LGBT. This is subsequently reflected in attitudes toward these various minority groups: the hierarchy in news coverage runs perfectly synchronous to the hierarchy in attitudes. Those groups that are most negatively portrayed and most often associated with threat frames are most negatively judged by the audience. Hence, news does not only operate as a contextual-level factor for anti-immigrant attitudes in general, but can also offer an explanation for a hierarchy in evaluations. News promotes specific arguments in the intergroup context, making some characteristics and threats more salient dependent upon the particular outgroup, which subsequently gives rise to differences in attitudes. The reach of news exposure are wider than previously documented: exposure to a news story about a particular immigrant group has consequences for the evaluation of other minority groups as well. This mainly holds for positive news: when natives were exposed to a positive news story about North African immigrants, they also became more positive toward other immigrant groups. This finding sheds more light on the applicability and reach of news, while showing that effects of news tone differ for direct versus carry-over effects. Finally, there is only limited evidence that immigration news presents a correct reflection of reality: the patterns and trends in immigration news are largely independent of developments and events occurring in society. status: publishe...|$|R
