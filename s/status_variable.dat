30|$|To {{implement}} the two-list architecture, we added an additional control field, transmission order, to the SKB data structure, {{to show the}} packet transmission order. Whenever a packet was initially sent or resent, its transmission order was recorded. Therefore, each packet from the sk_write_queue to the sk_send_head had its own transmission order. The RTXLIST was implemented using the <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> in the SKB data structure. When the <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> was set as LOST, the packet {{was considered to be}} in the RTXLIST. Sequential traversing of the list allows for determination of those packets in the RTXLIST. The dupCnt variable was also declared in the SKB in order to {{implement the}} per packet acking process. Whenever a duplicated ACK arrived, the dupCnt s of the corresponding SKB increased by one up to the threshold of 3. Every SKB having the dupCnt s value was marked as LOST.|$|E
40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{intensive}} services for women using drugs during pregnancy can reduce child maltreatment. Within-subjects, dose-response analyses can be conducted us-ing Child Protective Services (CPS) reports. Dose of services received can indicate either engagement or higher need for ser-vices. Using data from an intensive intervention program for mothers of drug-exposed infants, the authors examined asso-ciations between CPS reports and (a) dose of services received and (b) a termination <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> combining dose of ser-vices received with duration of service involvement and prog-ress on treatment plan goals. Cox regression revealed no association between dose of services and follow-up CPS re-ports. The termination <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> was strongly related to follow-up CPS reports, such that higher ratings were associ-ated with significantly lower risk of re-report, even after con-trolling for baseline motivation. Findings suggest that program effects may be detectable using a treatment process– based index that combines dose, duration, and quality of program involvement...|$|E

40|$|A panel {{data set}} {{covering}} 145 countries between 1960 and 2010 {{has been investigated}} closely by using models of parameter heterogeneity. The Functional Coefficient Model (FCM) introduced by Cai, Fan and Yao (2000) allows estimated parameters of growth determinants to vary as functions {{of one or two}} status variables. As a <b>status</b> <b>variable,</b> coefficients depend on the level of development, measured by initial per capita GDP. In a two-dimensional setting, time is used as an additional <b>status</b> <b>variable.</b> At first, the analysis is restricted to bivariate relationships between growth and only one of its determinants, dependent on one or both status variables in a local estimation. Afterwards, the well-known Solow (1956) model serves as a core setting of control variables, while functional dependence of additional explanatory variables is investigated. While some constraints of this modeling approach have to be kept in mind, functional specifications are a promising tool to investigate growth relationships, as well as their robustness and sensitivity. Finally, a simple derivation of FCM called local mean values provides a suitable way to visualize macroeconomic or demographic development patterns in a descriptive diagram...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} five articles. The first article describes a simulated monetary demand-led macro model with {{different types of}} interacting agents. As such, it is assigned {{to the field of}} agent-based computational economics (ACE), where agents become virtual objects in a computer simulation. The model features long-run growth and generates endogenous business cycles. The second article covers a welfare analysis of macroeconomic stabilization analysis under the ACE paradigm. The third article describes a core-periphery network identification procedure which was applied to data from the monthly ZEW business climate survey. A discrete model and a continuous model were both used to detect the assumed network structure. The fourth article deals with cross-country growth regressions. A large panel data set was analyzed with a functional coefficient model (FCM), that is, regression parameters are modeled heterogeneously in a semiparametric approach. In a one-dimensional FCM initial per capita GDP serves as a <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> for local estimates, in a two-dimensional setting the time dimension provides a second <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> for local estimation. Finally, the fifth article concerns patent analysis. The patent portfolio of publicly financed research organizations (PROs) in Germany is analyzed and compared to US-PRO patents and firm patens.

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{concern in}} making statistical inference for causal {{effects of a}} policy or treatment based on observational studies {{is that there are}} unmeasured confounding variables. The instrumental variable method is an approach to estimating a causal relationship in the presence of unmeasured confounding variables. A valid instrumental variable needs to be independent of the unmeasured confounding variables. It is important to control for the confounding variable if it is correlated with the instrument. In health services research, socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>variables</b> are often considered as confounding variables. In recent studies, distance to a specialty care center has been used as an instrument for the effect of specialty care vs. general care. Because the instrument may be correlated with socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>variables,</b> it is important that socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>variables</b> are controlled for in the instrumental variables regression. However, health data sets often lack individual socioeconomic information but contain area average socioeconomic information from the US Census, e. g., average income or education level in a county. We study the effects on the bias of the two stage least squares estimates in instrumental variables regression when using an area-level variable as a controlled confounding variable that may be correlated with the instrument. We propose the aggregated instrumental variables regression using the concept of Wald’s method of grouping, provided the assumption that the grouping is independent of the errors. We present simulation results and an application to a study of perinatal care for premature infants...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore which demographic and health <b>status</b> <b>variables</b> moderated the relationship between psychological distress and three nutrition indicators: the consumption of fruits, vegetables and takeaway. - Method We analysed data from the 2009 Self-Reported Health Status Survey Report collected in the state of Queensland, Australia. Adults (N = 6881) reported several demographic and health <b>status</b> <b>variables.</b> Moderated logistic regression models were estimated separately for the three nutrition indicators, testing as moderators demographic (age, gender, educational attainment, household income, remoteness, and area-level socioeconomic status) and health status indicators (body mass index, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes status). - Results Several significant interactions emerged between psychological distress, demographic (age, area-level socioeconomic status, and income level), and health <b>status</b> <b>variables</b> (body mass index, diabetes status) in predicting the nutrition indicators. Relationships between distress and the nutrition indicators were not significantly different by gender, remoteness, educational attainment, high cholesterol status, and high blood pressure status. - Conclusions The associations between psychological distress and several nutrition indicators differ amongst population subgroups. These findings suggest that in distressed adults, age, area-level socio-economic status, income level, body mass index, and diabetes status may serve as protective or risk factors through increasing or decreasing the likelihood of meeting nutritional guidelines. Public health interventions for improving dietary behaviours and nutrition may be more effective if they take into account the moderators identified in this study rather than using global interventions...|$|R

The public sector wage premium is found to be higher for city dwellers than non-city dwellers, pointing to the role of political influence in the government wage setting process. ...|$|E
30|$|To {{construct}} {{the measure of}} status discordance, we first use latent class analysis (LCA) to generate a unidimensional measure of objective status in so much we can quantify the divergence between objective and subjective social status. The LCA hypothesizes the existence of unobserved (latent) categorical variables to explain the associations among a constellation of observed (manifest) categorical variables. As regards this paper, the latent categorical variable refers to objective social status, while the manifest categorical variables are three major indicators in the surveys, namely income, education, and occupational prestige. In light of LCA model, when informants’ responses on manifest variables are mutually independent {{on the condition of}} being a member of one of the latent classes, the typology could be identified according to the number of latent classes at a given significant level. Having generated the categorical variable of objective social status, we quantify the divergence between subjective social status and objective social status. Specifically, since we have a five-category subjective <b>status</b> <b>variable,</b> as long as we show that a five-category objective <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> can be identified according to LCA statistical criteria, we can simply subtract the objective status from the subjective status. Note that if the objective status has more than five categories according to LCA statistical criteria, we simply choose the five-category objective status for compatibility because the subjective status is a five-category dummy.|$|E
40|$|The {{trajectory}} optimization {{technology is}} one of the key technologies for hypersonic air-vehicle. There are multiple constraints in the process of hypersonic flight, such as uncertainty of flight environment, thermal current, dynamic pressure and overload. The trajectory optimization of hypersonic air-vehicle is facing with a great challenge. This article studies the direct shooting method, the Gauss pseudo spectral method and sequential gradient-restoration algorithm, among which the direct shooting method simply makes the control variables discrete in the time domain, and obtains the status value by explicit numerical integration; Gauss pseudo spectral method makes the <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> and control variable discrete in a series of Gauss points, and constructs multinomial to approximate to the status and control variable by taking the discrete points as the nodes; sequential gradient-restoration algorithm uses iteration to meet the constraints and minimize the increment of initial value of control and <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> in order to constantly approximate to the optimal solution on condition that the constraints meet first order approximation. Finally this article conducts a numerical simulation by taking the diving segment of hypersonic air-vehicle as an example for comparative analysis on those three algorithms respectively from, such as, the initial value selection, constraint handling, convergence speed and calculation accuracy. The simulation result indicates Gauss pseudo spectral method is a method with fairly good comprehensive performance...|$|E

They used an area-level variable based on census blocks that was an average of home value, income, education, and occupation. Education was the individual-level socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>variable.</b> The authors studied socioeconomic status-mortality trends with each socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>variable</b> adjusted for the other. For all causes, an individual’s education was strongly and inversely associated with mortality; a weak but significant inverse trend was also present for area-level socioeconomic status. A similar pattern was seen for all-vascular disease. For all cancers, there was again a significant inverse trend with education but no trend with area-level socioeconomic status. Adjustment for conventional (non-socioeconomic status) individual-level risk factors diminished the effect of both socioeconomic status variables, although significant trends remained for men between education and all-cause, all-cancer, and all-vascular disease mortality. Study data indicate that the predictive value of area-level socioeconomic status variables varies by cause of death but {{is less important than}} individual-level socioeconomic status variables.
