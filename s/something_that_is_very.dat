5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The {{subject matter of the}} vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings there is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> seldom {{found in the}} art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Gunn {{revealed}} that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write {{some of the}} score first {{so that he can}} film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just like you and me. Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E

50|$|Tellus {{championed the}} audio work {{of women and}} gay artists, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much needed {{at the time in}} the machismo-tinged {{experimental}} music scene. Their curatorial policy was efficient, as well, as the editorial trio sometimes asked outside specialists to compile a program in their own field. This policy ensured state-of-the-art programming.|$|R

'His precepts {{are false}} or trivial, or both; his {{thoughts}} are crude and abortive, his expressions absurd, his numbers harsh and unmusical, his rhymes trivial and common:--instead of majesty, we have <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> mean; instead of gravity, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> boyish; {{and instead of}} perspicuity and lucid order, we have but too often obscurity and confusion.' And in another place: 'What rare numbers are here!

60|$|If I had {{not lived}} long enough to be little {{surprised}} at anything, I should have been in some degree astonished at the continued rage of several gentlemen, who, not satisfied with carrying fire and sword into America, are animated nearly with the same fury against those neighbors of theirs whose only crime it is, that they have charitably and humanely wished them to entertain more reasonable sentiments, and not always to sacrifice their interest to their passion. All this rage against unresisting dissent convinces me, that, at bottom, they are far from satisfied they are in the right. For what is it they would have? A war? They certainly have at this moment the blessing of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> like one; and if the war they enjoy at present be not sufficiently hot and extensive, they may shortly have it as warm and as spreading as their hearts can desire. Is it the force of the kingdom they call for? They have it already; and if they choose to fight their battles in their own person, nobody prevents their setting sail to America in the next transports. Do they think that the service is stinted for want of liberal supplies? Indeed they complain without reason. The table of the House of Commons will glut them, let their appetite for expense be never so keen. And I assure them further, that those who think with them in the House of Commons are full as easy in the control as they are liberal in the vote of these expenses. If this be not supply or confidence sufficient, let them open their own private purse-strings, and give, from what is left to them, as largely and with as little care as they think proper.|$|E
60|$|There {{remains one}} other element {{if we are}} to {{complete}} the parallelism of the old Bible and the new. The Christian Bible ends with a forecast, the Book of Revelation; the Hebrew Bible ended also with forecasts, the Prophets. To that the old Bible owed much of its magic power over men's imaginations and the inspiration it gave them. It was not a dead record, not an accumulation of things finished and of songs sung. It pointed steadily and plainly to the Days to Come as the end and explanation of all that went before. So too our Modern Bible, if it is to hold and rule the imagination of men, must close I think with a Book of Forecasts. We want to make our world think more than it does about the consequences of the lives it leads and the political deeds that it does and that it permits to be done. We want to turn the human imagination round again towards the future which our lives create. We want a collection and digest of forecasts and warnings to complete this modern Bible of ours. Now here I think you will say--and I admit with perfect reason--that I am floating away from any reasonable possibility at all. How can we have forecasts and prophecies of things that are happening now? Well, I will make a clean breast of it, and admit that I am asking for something that may be impossible. Nevertheless it is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> necessary if men are to remain indeed intelligent co-operating communities. In the past you will find where there have been orderly and successful communities the men in them had an idea of a Destiny, of some object, something that would amount to a criterion and judgment upon their collective conduct. Well, I believe that we {{have to get back to}} something of that sort.|$|E
5000|$|I wanted <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very,</b> {{very natural}} sounding. Not unproduced, but just very, very natural, {{sort of like}} the early Black Flag records or the early Melvins records; <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just <b>very</b> honest and you can hear what the drummer's doing, you can hear what the guitar player's doing, and not oversaturate it with a huge wall of guitars. I just kind of wanted it to be rather 'bare bones' and let the music speak for itself in the {{performances}} as well. I wanted it to sound good and clean, somewhat, but I also didn't want to overproduce it by putting in a bunch of triggers and stuff like that.|$|R
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{unusual in the}} 1920s and 1930s.

He sat down close to Mr. Carvel's chair with a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a thought. He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper which had indorsements on their backs. His fine lips were tightly closed, as if in pain.|$|R
5000|$|Hilson's {{music is}} {{generally}} R&B, hip hop and pop. Her debut album, In a Perfect World..., {{consists of a}} pop/R&B style, with elements of electro music. Many of the album's themes deal with relationships, physical attraction and lovemaking. Hilson said, [...] "lyrically it's a very vulnerable album. You know, I definitely didn't want to paint myself as perfect on this project. Instead, I wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> relatable, especially to women".|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the album, Kozelek noted: [...] "With this record, I had {{a vision}} in mind. I wanted to make <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> personal, <b>that</b> had a theme and a flow, musically." [...] Kozelek has {{subsequently}} named Admiral Fell Promises the album he is most proud of recording, stating, [...] "Bury me with Admiral Fell Promises. <b>That</b> album <b>is</b> me at my best, my most focused. It's cohesive, beautiful and my playing {{was inspired by the}} legendary Andrés Segovia.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, {{referring}} to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, [...] "I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done." [...] Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: [...] "I think that both {{the process and the}} plan were flawed. We were trying to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes." ...|$|R
5000|$|The perfume is {{described}} as an [...] "unusual mixture". [...] The fragrance's Top Notes consists of notes of white tea, bitter orange, lemon zest. In its Heart Notes, the scent features a combination of mint, sea moss, cassis, raspberry, precious woods. The fragrance finishes in its Base Notes with Tahitian vanilla, benzoin, white musk, sandalwood. When speaking on the product Jordin said [...] "For the bottle I wanted <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> really sleek, and I wanted <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> easy to hold...

50|$|The idea of {{a secret}} brand works off {{of one or more}} of three {{economic}} principles. The first is scarcity value. The secret brand creates products with highly specific, unique qualities, usually very subtle and invisible to the casual observer.
