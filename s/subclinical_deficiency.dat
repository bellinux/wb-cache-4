This study aimed to assess prevalence and predictors of <b>subclinical</b> iodine <b>deficiency</b> among pregnant women in Haramaya district, eastern Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional, community-based {{study was conducted}} on 435 pregnant women existing in ten randomly selected rural kebeles (kebele is the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia). Data on the study subjects’ background characteristics, dietary habits, and gynecological/obstetric histories were collected via a structured questionnaire.

This study’s objectives were to estimate the prevalence of subclinical vitamin D, folate, vitamin B 12 and iron deficiencies among older adults, aged 65 to 93, from the KORA-Age study in Augsburg, Germany (n = 1079), and to examine associated predictors, using multiple logistic regression. Serum concentrations of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD), folate, vitamin B 12, and iron were analyzed. The prevalence of subclinical vitamin D and vitamin B 12 deficiencies were high, with 52. 0 % and 27. 3 % of individuals having low 25 OHD (< 50 nmol/L) and low vitamin B 12 concentrations (< 221 pmol/L), respectively. Furthermore, 11. 0 % had low iron (men < 11. 6 µmol/L, women < 9. 0 µmol/L) and 8. 7 % had low folate levels (< 13. 6 nmol/L).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the correlation between <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiency</b> of Vit A, Vit C and zinc and ovine pneumonia.

Sampling was done during the summer and autumn in Miandoab province. Patients showing signs of rapid and shallow breathing, dyspnea, coughing, nasal discharge and abnormal lung sound were selected as having pneumonia. Animals without any sign of particular disease were selected as apparently healthy after general examination. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein. The results indicated that serum levels of vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc were 46. 94 ± 0. 26 (μg/dl), 1. 83 ± 0. 05 (mg/dl) and 183. 25 ± 1. 86 (μg/dl) in healthy sheep respectively and serum levels of vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc were 42. 45 ± 0. 19 (μg/dl), 1. 47 ± 0. 02 (mg/dl) and 134. 59 ± 1. 77 (μg/dl) in pneumonic sheep (p= 0. 000) respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the epidemiology of Vitamin A and C and folic acid deficiencies and {{their association with}} sociodemographic and dietary factors in a national probabilistic sample of Mexican women and children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a probabilistic sample from the National Nutrition Survey 1999 (ENN- 99) including 1 966 children and 920 women. Vitamins A and C were measured in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography, and folic acid in total blood by a microbiological method. Determinants for such deficiencies were explored by multiple regression models. RESULTS: Vitamin A deficiency (retinol 10 and < 20 µg/dl) was present in 25 % of children. The likelihood of <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiency</b> of vitamin A was less in older children (OR= 0. 98, p= 0. 01) and in women with higher body mass index (OR= 0. 93, p= 0. 01). About 30 % of children < 2 {{years of age and}} 40 % of women were vitamin C deficient. The likelihood of vitamin C deficiency was less in children and women as socioeconomic level increased (OR= 0. 69, p= 0. 03, and OR= 0. 80, p= 0. 04), and higher in older women (OR= 1. 02, p= 0. 05). The prevalence of folate deficiency varied in children (2. 3 to 11. 2), in women it was 5 %. Folate deficiency was less in children of higher socioeconomic level (OR= 0. 62, p= 0. 01), and in those eating more vegetables (OR= 0. 22, p= 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiency</b> of vitamin A in children is indicative of risk of further deterioration under adverse circumstances.

40|$|Vitamin {{deficiencies}} can {{be detected}} in several ways, none of which is entirely unambiguous. Evidence of several types is, therefore, required.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{the potential impact}} of nutritional factors and individual micronutrients on the brain and on cognitive performance, especially in older adults. The B vitamins, folate, B 12, and B 6, are of partic-ular interest because even <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in these vitamins are thought to be relatively common in the general population and in older adults in particular. Recent cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have pro-vided evidence for an association between these B vitamins and many aspects of cognitive performance and have raised the possibility that even subclinical differences in nutritional status may have a subtle influence on aspects of cognitive performance, especially in older adults and in clinical populations.

40|$|Significance: It is {{generally}} accepted that {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) scavenging molecules or antioxidants exert health-promoting effects and thus their consumption as food additives and nutraceuticals has been greatly encouraged. Antioxidants may be beneficial in situations of <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiency</b> and increased demand or acutely upon high-dose infusion. However, to date, there is little clinical evidence for the long-term benefit of most antioxidants. Alarmingly, recent evidence points even to health risks, in particular for supplements of lipophilic antioxidants. Recent Advances: The biological impact of ROS depends not only on their quantities but also on their chemical nature, (sub) cellular and tissue location, and the rates of their formation and degradation. Moreover, ROS serve important physiological functions; thus, inappropriate removal of ROS may cause paradoxical reductive stress and thereby induce or promote disease.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{new class}} of migrant workers, {{commonly}} known as “Boia-Frias”, is rapidly growing in the periurban slums (favelas) of Brazil. In 1978 a collaborative study was undertaken to assess the food habits and nutritional status of 100 migrant worker families of Vila Recreio, a typical Boia-Fria settlement near Ribeirao Preto {{in the state of}} Sao Paulo. The findings of this survey revealed that the traditional diet of Boia-Frias is nutritionally inadequate both in quality and quantity. Their rice and bean-based diet lacks sufficient variety because of the infrequent use of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are available locally, and of supplemental amounts of protein-rich foods of animal origin. Empty-calorie foods such as carbonated drinks and alcoholic beverages are consumed freely; and starchy foods, traditionally used in the North and Northeast of Brazil, are used commonly as weaning foods. Although dietary practices of pregnant and lactating women are poor, breast-feeding is still practiced by most mothers. The biochemical analysis of blood samples did not indicate major <b>subclinical</b> <b>deficiencies</b> except low hematological values and low plasma vitamin A concentrations in about 25 % of the population examined.
