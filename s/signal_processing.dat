5|$|Analogue {{filters are}} a basic {{building}} block of <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> much used in electronics. Amongst their many applications are the separation of an audio signal before application to bass, mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers; the combining and later separation of multiple telephone conversations onto a single channel; {{the selection of a}} chosen radio station in a radio receiver and rejection of others.|$|E
5|$|Spurious {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion {{in the creation of the}} output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> chain.

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital <b>signal</b> <b>processing.</b> DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in <b>signal</b> <b>processing</b> applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures {{to deal with this}} were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far {{the most common type of}} parallel programs.|$|E
5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent <b>Signal</b> <b>Processing</b> System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
30|$|The FRFT is {{actually}} a unified time-frequency transform. With the order from 0 increasing to 1, the FRFT can reveal the characteristic of the signal gradually changing from the time domain to the frequency domain. Unlike usual quadratic time-frequency distributions, it reveals the time-frequency characteristics with a single variable, and does not suffer from cross-terms. Compared with the traditional FT, the FRFT does better in non-stationary <b>signals</b> <b>processing</b> especially in the chirp-like <b>signals</b> <b>processing.</b> Moreover, one extra degree of freedom (the order) may sometimes help to obtain better performance than the usual time-frequency distributions or the FT. And its developed fast algorithms lead to little computation load for good performance.|$|R
