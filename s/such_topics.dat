40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{plurality}} of sureties assisting the same debt. After a brief analysis of <b>such</b> <b>topic</b> in Roman law, the contribution sets out the {{issues related to}} the plurality of sureties under current law, with particular regard to the possibility to draw a distinction between the co-suretyship and the plurality of independent sureties. The study is carried out also in a comparative perspective, mainly with reference to German law, and aims at developing a consistent systematic reconstruction of the coexistence of more sureties for the same debt, constantly verifying its validity with regard to the solution of some relevant issues raised by <b>such</b> <b>topic.</b> The topic is discussed in the broader framework of debtors’ joint and several liability. Accordingly, a detailed analysis is dedicated to various aspects of <b>such</b> <b>topic</b> in order to achieve outcomes which may help in the solution of specific problems related to the plurality of sureties. Thus, {{on the basis of the}} conclusions drawn with reference to joint and several liability in general, a focus has been given to aspects concerning the right of contribution and the subrogation among sureties, the release of a guarantor and the settlement with one of the sureties. ...|$|R

As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing <b>such</b> <b>topics</b> as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes <b>such</b> <b>topics</b> as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with <b>such</b> <b>topics</b> as capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog {{as a private}} eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes <b>such</b> <b>topics</b> {{as world}} war, urbanization, the {{alienation}} from nature, mechanization, the dehumanization {{of the modern}} world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Döblin's experiences during the First World War, when he served in Alsace as a military doctor, left their mark on the novel: psychically damaged veterans, devastated landscapes, and all-destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling. Because of the bleak {{vision of the future}} that the novel presents, it has often been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic, irrationalistic, or regressive work. Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect, in this reading, not Döblin's own world view but instead different historical possibilities, alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found.|$|E
