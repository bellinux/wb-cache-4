50|$|With the {{development}} of reliable spring steel in Spain, the navaja could be fitted with a tempered steel, externally mounted backspring, making the design much more useful. The new <b>spring-back</b> navaja proved very popular throughout Spain and was later exported to or manufactured in other countries as well, particularly France and the island of Corsica.During {{the first part of}} the 18th century, the blade heel and backspring of the navaja were cleverly altered to provide a locking device for the blade. Pulling open the blade from the handle, the lock allowed the blade to rotate into the fully open position, where it locked into position. The locking mechanism itself consisted of pinion teeth (piñones or dientes) cut into the blade heel (talón de la hoja) that are engaged by a lug attached to either the backspring or a separate spring-loaded metal latch as the knife is opened. The last pinion tooth serves to keep the blade locked in its fully opened position. The ratcheting-tooth lock-blade navaja was commonly referred to as a navaja de muelles or navaja de siete muelles. The metal-to-metal contact produces a distinctive clicking sound when the blade is opened, and the navaja de muelles was popularly termed the carraca in consequence. With its locking blade, the navaja de muelles was now a versatile fighting knife, able to safely deliver thrusts as well as slashes (cuts). The navaja de muelles proved sufficiently formidable as an offensive arm that it was specifically named by the Marqués de la Mina, the Spanish military governor of Catalonia, in his edict of 29 May 1750 prohibiting the carrying of armas blancas, or edged weapons.|$|E

Precise predictions of <b>spring-back</b> angle after the bending process are the key to the design of the bending die, bending tool, and to produce the accuracy part geometry. This thesis purpose is to determine the reliability of analytical method in V-bending analysis of stainless steel by comparing the results with experimental results and the experimental measurements of Özgür (2008). The effects of significant parameters including sheet thickness and sheet anisotropy on <b>spring-back</b> in V-bending analysis also have been studies. The mechanical properties that provided from tensile test experiment have been used in the analytical calculation in solving the <b>spring-back</b> equation. Two different equations from previous studies have been used to determine the <b>spring-back</b> angle. In the V-bending experiment, two different test procedures (bottoming and air V-bending process) were used. The experimental results have been used to evaluate the analytical results. The results of this project shown the <b>spring-back</b> values for analytical calculation are generally is not in agreement with the experimental value but the graph trends obtained in this study are generally in agreement with experimental graph patterns. The graph patterns are also in agreement with the past study by other researcher (Özgür, 2008). Increasing the sheet thickness resulted increase in the <b>spring-back</b> angle. The orientation angle and anisotropy value R will influence the <b>spring-back.</b> In general, the <b>spring-back</b> angle is increase if the orientation angle is increase. Therefore, the 0 degree orientation angle is a suitable condition in V-bending processes because the <b>spring-back</b> value is smallest compared to other orientation angles. The percentage error is very high because there are some errors occur during the tensile specimen preparation, tensile test experiment and V-bending test experiment.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and the neurologic consequence of <b>spring-back</b> closure after open-door laminoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective radiographic and clinical review. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lateral cervical spine X-rays were evaluated. Anteroposterior diameters (APD) of the vertebral canal of C 3 -C 7 were measured. <b>Spring-back</b> was defined as loss of APD on follow-up in comparison to immediate postoperative canal expansion. The loss of the end-on lamina silhouette with consequent reappearance of the lateral profile of the spinous processes was also assessed to verify the presence of <b>spring-back.</b> <b>Spring-back</b> closure was classified based on whether the collapse was total or partial, and whether all the operated levels or only a subset had collapsed (ie, complete vs. partial closure, segmental closure vs. total-construct closure). Neurologic status was documented using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients who underwent open-door laminoplasty from 1995 to 2005 at a single institution with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were assessed. They were all operated on using the classic Hirabayashi technique. Radiographic outcomes were assessed independently by two individuals. RESULTS: Sixteen men and 14 women with an average follow-up of 5 years (range, 2 - 12 years) were included. Of these patients, 24 had cervical spondylotic myelopathy and six had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. <b>Spring-back</b> closure was found in three patients (10 %) and 7 of 117 laminae (6 %) within 6 months of the operation, which was further confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. All <b>spring-back</b> closures were partial segmental closures. Gender and age were not significant factors related to spring back (p>. 05). The mean JOA score on follow-up was 12. 5, with a recovery rate of 40 %. All patients with spring back and available JOA data exhibited postoperative neurologic deterioration. Of the three patients with spring back, two patients underwent revision surgery, whereas one declined. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Spring-back</b> closure occurred in 10 % of our patients at or before 6 months after surgery. The incidence of <b>spring-back</b> by level (ie, 117 laminae) was 6 %, mainly occurring at the lower cervical spine. All <b>spring-back</b> closures were partial segmental closures, most commonly involving C 5 and C 6.

In addition, bending is used in many sheet metal forming, such as deep drawing and stamping processes. Bending process is usually followed by some elastic recovery upon unloading, called <b>spring-back.</b> A static approach is described to determine new formulas for the bending force, the shift of neutral-axis {{and the value of}} <b>spring-back,</b> in V-die bending process.

40|$|In {{automotive}} {{and home}} appliance industries, {{there are many}} complex-shaped sheet metal components which need to be fabricated in multiple stamping operations. For example, the manufacturing of an outer case of washing machine consists of stamping followed by a bending operation. After {{the first stage of}} the stamping process, a large amount of <b>spring-back</b> takes place, and therefore, it is difficult to proceed to the next stage of the bending process. In the stamping process of that kind of sheet component with low geometric constraint, the forming area is large compared to the forming depth. Therefore, the formed part is in an unstable state and is less geometrically constrained, which causes a large amount of <b>spring-back.</b> To investigate this phenomenon, finite element analyses are carried out. During a <b>spring-back</b> analysis after forming, bifurcation takes place and the finite element solution procedure using the Newton-Raphson scheme becomes unstable. To get a stable post-bifurcation solution, a bifurcation algorithm is introduced at the bifurcation point. The deformed shapes obtained from finite element analyses are in good agreement with the experimental data. From this study, it is shown that the bifurcation behaviour enlarges the <b>spring-back</b> and the degree of dimensional error. To obtain additional possible post-bifurcation solutions, non-bifurcation analyses using initial guesses obtained in a modal analysis are carried. For the initial guesses, lowed four eigenmodes are utilized.
