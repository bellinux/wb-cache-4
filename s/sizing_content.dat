First, the <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> of the alkali-free cloth was analyzed, and then the resin, soluble resin and volatiles content of the prepreg was analyzed simultaneously using the FT-NIR spectrometer. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used to develop the calibration models, which for the <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> was preprocessed by 1 stDER +MSC, for the volatile content by 1 stDER +VN, for the soluble resin content by 1 stDER +MSC and for the resin content by the VN spectral data preprocessing method. RMSEP of the prediction model for the <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> was 0. 732 %, for the resin content it was 0. 605, for the soluble resin content it was 0. 101 and for volatiles content it was 0. 127. The results of the paired t-test revealed {{that there was no}} significant difference between the NIR method and the standard method. The NIR spectroscopy method could be used to predict the resin, soluble resin and the volatiles content of the prepreg simultaneously, as well as <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> of alkali-free cloth. The processing parameters of the prepreg during manufacture could be adjusted quickly with the help of the NIR analysis results. The results indicated that the NIR spectroscopy method was sufficiently accurate and effective for the on-line monitoring of alkali-free cloth/phenolic resin prepreg...|$|E

40|$|Interface related {{mechanical}} properties of unidirectional continuous glass fibre (GF) /polypropylene (PP) composites made of commingled yarns have been systematically studied {{according to a}} three level, three-factor factorial design. The three systematically varied factors comprised different silane coupling agent and film former contents in GF sizings {{as well as a}} varying GF diameter. Besides the statistical evaluation of those main effects on the transverse tensile and compression shear strengths of the composites, interfacial shear strength measurements on model composites have been performed. The latter ones as well as the results of the dynamic mechanical thermal analysis support the statistical significance of sizing components, the <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> on the GF, and GF diameter for the {{mechanical properties}} of the composites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, a sizing {{is shown}} to {{significantly}} affect both the population and size of flaws on the fibre surface by healing effects. Different alkali-resistant glass (ARG) fibres are coated with special polymer dispersions to provide superior alkali resistance and compared with HTA carbon fibres. Durability testing in highly concentrated NaOH-solutions at ambient and elevated temperatures revealed significant reduction of <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> of the ‘‘as received’ ’ ARG fibres after short-term testing. Improved durability of the ARG fibres identified by increased sizing retention is achieved by additional coatings. Styrene–butadiene dispersions proved to be most resistant of those tested. The assessment {{of changes in the}} fibre surface chemical properties assisted by nanomechanical investigation is essential for understanding the fibre bulk mechanical fracture behaviour. Sizings and coatings on glass and carbon fibres, respectively, and especially on polymer films, were found to significantly influence both tensile strength of alkali-resistant filament yarns and adhesion strength of coated fibres with cementitious matrices investigated by single fibre pull-out. It would be very advantageous if one could predict higher composite...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to study}} the effect of {{processing}} temperature on interfacial behavior of HKT 800 carbon fiber composites with epoxy and Bismaleimide (BMI) matrix. Referring to the processing conditions of the composite, various processing-heat treatments were conducted on HKT 800 and the extracted <b>sizing</b> <b>content</b> declines with increasing temperature. Chemical analysis shows that the HKT 800 sizing is epoxy-type and reactive at 200 °C. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of HKT 800 /epoxy and HKT 800 /BMI was investigated by micro-droplet method, for which the composites were fabricated with modeling temperature schemes referring to different diffusion, cure and post-cure stages. It shows that diffusion temperature and conversion degree of the resin both enhance the interfacial adhesion of HKT 800 /epoxy composite. For the HKT 800 /BMI composite, the diffusion temperature shows a insignificant effect on the IFSS. FTIR analysis indicates that sufficient reactions are achieved between HKT 800 -sizing and epoxy resin, however only partial reactions are observed between the sizing and BMI. Moreover, {{the presence of the}} sizing can evidently improve the wettability of HKT 800 with epoxy resin but is unfavorable for HKT 800 with BMI...|$|E

With the increase in <b>size</b> and <b>content</b> of Ag NPs, the absorption intensity of both TiO 2 compact film and PSC device gradually decreased and increased, respectively. With the addition of Ag NPs, the charge transport capability increases {{and the performance of}} the PSC device is consequently improved. Moreover, the PSC device with a small size and amount of Ag NPs showed higher PCE and IPCE values. Specifically, the PSC device with 10 -nm Ag NPs and 1.5  mol% Ag/TiO 2 compact film exhibited the highest PCE of 13.26 %.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 25 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 10 - 13 July 2006 " 2010 : Will transport infrastructure and systems be ready?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the applicability of weathered stone gravels for use in rural roads and the factors influencing the structural strength of granular materials. The effects of the gradation, coarse <b>size</b> <b>content,</b> maximum <b>size</b> and fines <b>content</b> of gravel on its CBR value and shear strength were studied by using the CBR test and large-scale direct shearing test for two kinds of weathered stone gravels. The results showed that the CBR value of weathered stone gravel is influenced greatly by the fines (< 0. 0 75 mm) content and the maximum size. The bigger the maximum size, the higher the CBR value. It was also concluded that the shear strenth of weathered stone gravel is influenced greatly by the coarse <b>size</b> <b>content,</b> with a maximum value of the percentage retained on the 4. 75 mm sieve. Weathered stone gravels with high strength have higher shear strength and their C values correlate well with the content of aggregates below 0. 6 mm. Finally, target values for the key influencing factors are recommended. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.
