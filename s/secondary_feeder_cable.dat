50|$|The {{cause of}} the outages - which was {{undetermined}} for five days - {{appeared to be the}} company's decision to continue supplying power to the 400,000 people serviced by twenty-two <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> after ten of them had failed, overloading the remaining twelve. After these were repaired, a manhole-to-manhole inspection and repair of smaller cables which had also burned took place. Consolidated Edison was due to make an initial status report, regarding the outage, on August 2, 2006. Data submitted by Con Edison in August, 2006 indicated that the failed <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> had been in service an average of 16 years, with the oldest failed cable 59 years old.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{tremendous}} development of GSM services over the last years, the number of related services used by organizations has drastically increased. Therefore, monitoring GSM services is becoming a business critical issue {{in order to be able}} to react appropriately in case of incident. In order to provide with GSM coverage all the CERN underground facilities, more than 50 km of leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> have been deployed. This infrastructure is also used to propagate VHF radio signals for the CERN’s fire brigade. Even though CERN’s mobile operator monitors the network, it cannot guarantee the availability of GSM services, and for sure not VHF services, where signals are carried by the leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable.</b> So, a global monitoring system has become critical to CERN. In addition, monitoring this infrastructure will allow to characterize its behaviour over time, especially with LHC operation. Given that commercial solutions were not yet mature, CERN developed a system based on GSM probes and an application server which collects data from them via the CERN GPRS network. By placing probes in strategic locations and comparing measurements between probes, it is possible now possible to determine if there is a GSM or VHF problem on one leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> segment. This system has been successfully working for several months in underground facilities, allowing CERN to inform GSM users and fire brigade in case of incidents...|$|R

The limit lengths of <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> were determined as 1, 000 m for octagon loop detector and 900 m for circle loop detector, respectively.
