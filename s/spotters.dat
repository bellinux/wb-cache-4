5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm <b>spotters</b> to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the <b>spotters</b> were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) <b>spotters,</b> storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these <b>spotters</b> look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather <b>spotters</b> across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Normally, Furious {{could carry}} only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this {{commonly}} meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of <b>spotters</b> (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart). In 1935 {{there was one}} squadron of fighters with Hawker Nimrods and Hawker Ospreys, one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF <b>spotters.</b> During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spotter</b> {{should always}} be used for {{accident}} prevention. A climbing <b>spotter</b> will typically hold their arms up with hands in a supporting position for more or less vertical climbs. When the climber falls, the <b>spotter's</b> hands lightly hold the climber's hips or lower back, near the climber's center of gravity. This allows the <b>spotter</b> to help guide the climber's fall effectively, helping them keep their center of gravity over their feet. When on steeper, past vertical climbs, the <b>spotter</b> will hold their arms out in a cradling position. If the climber falls, the <b>spotter</b> supports the upper and middle back, helping the climber land on their feet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit - <b>Spotter</b> is a Rabbit who competed against Jumpy Ghostface {{to be the}} Rabbit King's successor. Rabbit King {{selected}} Jumpy Ghostface to be {{his successor}} instead of <b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit causing Sparta to leave. Upon training with some bad guys and mastering the full human language, <b>Spotter</b> befriended the Mantis army and they invade Rabbit Castle where he captures all the Rabbits leaving one to let Jumpy Ghostface {{know that he is}} back. While First Squad and the Beetles fought the Mantis Army, Jumpy Ghostface dueled with <b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit. After <b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit was repelled and the Mantis Army also takes their leave, the other Rabbits were rescued.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{features}} a semi-intelligent <b>spotter,</b> {{who can be}} set to follow you or hold position, and [...] "hold fire" [...] or [...] "fire at will". The <b>spotter</b> call out the compass heading of the direction that enemies are in as they come within a certain range. The <b>spotter</b> can also assist the player in engaging enemies. You fail a mission if the <b>spotter</b> dies or if you die.|$|R
5|$|Argus usually {{operated}} about 15 aircraft {{during the}} 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or Fairey Flycatchers), one of <b>spotters</b> (Parnall Panthers or Avro Bisons), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{a similar}} network of {{volunteer}} weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, {{with more than}} 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks {{under the auspices of}} Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of <b>spotters</b> in the United Kingdom since 1974.|$|E
5|$|Usually <b>spotters</b> {{are trained}} by the NWS {{on behalf of their}} {{respective}} organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and forward the report to the NWS.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{some people}} {{prefer to have}} a <b>spotter</b> present during the barbell {{military}} press or barbell push press (two very similar exercises). This exercise involves lifting {{a considerable amount of}} weight about the head. During this exercise the <b>spotter</b> will assist in “lifting off” the bar from the racked position. Then the <b>spotter</b> will keep his/her hands about 6 inches under the bar. This allows the <b>spotter</b> to assist when the lifter runs out of energy, but most importantly allows the <b>spotter</b> to catch the weight if the lifter cannot lift any more. A <b>spotter</b> may not be preferred, however, because the risk of injury is lower and it is easier to drop the weight on the ground if the lifter loses control of the barbell.|$|R
40|$|Analyzing how {{software}} engineers use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) {{is essential}} to better understanding how engineers carry out their daily tasks. <b>Spotter</b> is a code search engine for the Pharo programming language. Since its inception, <b>Spotter</b> has been rapidly and broadly adopted within the Pharo community. However, {{little is known about}} how practitioners employ <b>Spotter</b> to search and navigate within the Pharo code base. This paper evaluates how software engineers use <b>Spotter</b> in practice. To achieve this, we remotely gather user actions called events. These events are then visually rendered using an adequate navigation tool chain. Sequences of events are represented using a visual alphabet. We found a number of usage patterns and identified underused <b>Spotter</b> features. Such findings are essential for improving <b>Spotter...</b>|$|R
50|$|The sniper and <b>spotter</b> use a {{wide variety}} of optics, such as the sniper scope, the <b>spotter</b> scope, field glasses (binoculars) and laser rangefinders.|$|R
5|$|Innis's {{role as an}} {{artillery}} signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) {{on the front lines}} as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge. Signallers, or <b>spotters,</b> watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up {{position}} {{in support of the}} 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial <b>spotters</b> were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16inch shells at the site, but in the darkness <b>spotters</b> were unable to confirm any hits.|$|E
5|$|Storm <b>spotters</b> {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a {{distance}} is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E
5000|$|Spotting is a {{technique}} used in climbing, especially in bouldering, where the climbers {{are close to the}} ground and ropes are not typically used. The <b>spotter</b> stands below the climber, with arms raised or at the ready. If the climber falls, the <b>spotter</b> does not catch the climber, but redirects the climber's fall so that they land safely on a bouldering mat. At the very least the <b>spotter</b> ensures that the climber's head and back do not strike the ground directly. If the climber jumps down, the <b>spotter</b> can also help prevent stumbles and injuries on uneven ground. The <b>spotter</b> should stand with their fingers together (known as [...] "using spoons") to avoid broken fingers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spotter</b> detects, observes, and assigns {{targets and}} watches {{for the results}} of the shot. Using a {{spotting}} scope and/or rangefinder, the <b>spotter</b> will also read the wind by using physical indicators and the mirage caused by the heat on the ground. Also, in conjunction with the shooter, the <b>spotter</b> will make calculations for distance, angle shooting (slant range), mil dot related calculations, correction for atmospheric conditions and leads for moving targets. It is not unusual for the <b>spotter</b> to be equipped with a notepad and a laptop computer specifically for performing these calculations.|$|R
50|$|Raines {{served as}} the <b>spotter</b> for Sam Hornish Jr. and the No. 9 of Richard Petty Motorsports in 2015, but {{returned}} to Front Row Motorsports as a <b>spotter</b> mid-year.|$|R
5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more <b>spotters</b> to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of this mission New Jersey steamed south, taking a position off Da Nang and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire {{support to the}} U.S. 1st Marine Division operating in the area. On 2 November New Jersey commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foliage in the area prevented <b>spotters</b> from seeing {{the results of the}} shelling.|$|E
5|$|Between 23 and 27 May {{and again}} 30 May 1951, New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong, {{dispersing}} troop concentrations, dropping a bridge span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air <b>spotters</b> reported Yangyang abandoned {{at the end}} of this action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she lost one of her helicopters after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.|$|E
2500|$|... Four Canadair CL-215 water {{bombers and}} two <b>spotter</b> planes from {{the provinces of}} Alberta and Manitoba and one Martin Mars bomber along with a Cessna L-19 <b>spotter</b> plane from British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|He is {{currently}} a <b>spotter</b> at Richard Childress Racing for the No. 27 of Menard and also works for Cunningham Motorsports as the <b>spotter</b> of the No. 77 car of Chase Briscoe.|$|R
5000|$|Mantis - In this show, the Mantis {{are shown}} to be the size of humans. <b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit enlisted the Mantis Army to help him take over Rabbit Castle. During Jumpy Ghostface's fight with <b>Spotter</b> the Rabbit, First Squad and the Beetles helped to fight the Mantis Army and free the Rabbits. When <b>Spotter</b> is {{defeated}} and driven off, the Mantis Army also takes their leave.|$|R
5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire <b>spotters</b> were significantly more accurate than shipboard <b>spotters.</b> In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, five USAAF personnel, {{as well as}} four {{officers}} and 20 enlisted men from the US Signal Corps, were seconded to the NGAWW to be trained as <b>spotters</b> {{for the purpose of}} establishing the American Air Warning Wireless Unit to function in the Philippines. The company's headquarters moved to Nadzab in June 1944, by which time stations had been established as far as Hollandia, with many behind Japanese lines. Eventually, at its peak in late 1944 there were more than 150 spotter stations deployed on islands and mainland territories throughout Papua, New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea. However, in September 1944 the Australian military decided that it would not agree to American requests for the unit to serve outside the Australian area of operations and it was subsequently withdrawn after being left without a future operational role. Meanwhile, Captain John Marsh took over command from Cumpston who was posted to Washington as a liaison officer. Marsh then oversaw the closure of the remaining network and the preparation of the unit for shipping back to Australia. The <b>spotters</b> were subsequently concentrated at Nadzab, with many meeting each other face-to-face for the first time. The unit left New Guinea in December 1944.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} <b>spotters</b> in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the <b>spotter</b> or the observer should be present. The <b>spotter's</b> job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The <b>spotter</b> usually {{sits in a chair}} on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat's occupants communicate using hand signals (see the Safety section below).|$|R
50|$|Sprite {{arrives at}} Pell Station shortly after Corinthians {{departure}} {{and takes off}} again in pursuit. During Corinthians jump to Tripoint, Capella is aware of Sprite and a Mazianni <b>spotter</b> following and performs a premature system-drop near an abandoned freighter, causing the other ships to overshoot. Corinthian immediately starts frantically offloading to the freighter, a Fleet drop-point. As the <b>spotter</b> and Sprite approach, Tom and Christian activate the freighters weapons and destroy the <b>spotter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting at Texas in the Fall of 2010, Kevin {{will be the}} <b>spotter</b> for NASCAR Sprint Cup driver Clint Bowyer. He {{held this}} {{position}} for the 2011 season as well. Starting in mid 2012 he became the <b>spotter</b> for Kasey Kahne.|$|R
5|$|Storm <b>spotters</b> {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely {{signatures}} which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotters</b> were {{initially}} equipped with Teleradio 3A sets and amateur equipment; however, many outstations later had these replaced by improved 3B and 3BZ sets to provide higher power communications. This occurred following {{a decision to}} standardise on the 3B following {{the formation of the}} NGAWW. In addition, some teams operating in more difficult jungle and mountain terrain, such as that closer to Port Moresby, were equipped with RAAF supplied ATR-2 radios which were lighter than the Teleradio 3A sets provided to the more distant outstations.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{have been}} {{observed}} and documented on every continent except Antarctica. However, {{the vast majority of}} tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur in south-central and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm <b>spotters.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{vehicles}} used are light four-wheel drive trucks and utilities. A team may consist of three persons, {{the driver and}} the shooter and the <b>spotter.</b> The shooter and <b>spotter</b> stand side by side behind the cab, holding onto a bar {{at the front of}} the tray or on top of the cab, which allows them a good 360 degree view. The <b>spotter</b> sweeps the surrounding countryside with a powerful hand-held lamp with a tightly focused beam.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, Hedlesky {{became the}} <b>spotter</b> for Cup Series driver Matt Kenseth. He was swapped with Kenseth's {{previous}} <b>spotter</b> Chris Osborne after {{the retirement of}} Carl Edwards {{and the promotion of}} Daniel Suarez to the 19 car in the Monster Energy Cup Series.|$|R
50|$|The shooter fires {{the shot}} while the <b>spotter</b> assists in {{observation}} of targets, atmospheric conditions and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location, communication with other parties; including directing artillery fire and close air support. A flanker's {{task is to}} observe areas not immediately visible to the sniper or <b>spotter</b> and assist with the team's perimeter and rear security, therefore flankers are usually armed with an assault rifle or battle rifle. Both <b>spotter</b> and flanker carries additional ammunition and associated equipment.|$|R
