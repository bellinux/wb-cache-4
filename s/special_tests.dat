5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. <b>Special</b> <b>tests</b> may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{identify}} the cause of CAP. Blood cultures can isolate bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream. Sputum Gram staining and culture can also reveal the causative microorganism. In severe cases, bronchoscopy can collect fluid for culture. <b>Special</b> <b>tests</b> can be performed if an uncommon microorganism is suspected, such as urinalysis for Legionella antigen in Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism, and <b>special</b> <b>tests</b> {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E

60|$|The {{remaining}} {{plea for}} exempting Literature from Censorship, {{put forward by}} unreflecting persons: That it would require too many Censors--besides being unworthy, is, {{on the face of}} it, erroneous. <b>Special</b> <b>tests</b> have never been thought necessary in appointing Examiners of Plays. They would, indeed, not only be unnecessary, but positively dangerous, seeing that the essential function of Censorship is protection of the ordinary prejudices and forms of thought. There would, then, be no difficulty in securing tomorrow as many Censors of Literature as might be necessary (say twenty or thirty); since all that would be required of each one of them would be that he should secretly exercise, in his uncontrolled discretion, his individual taste. In a word, this Free Literature of ours protects advancing thought and speculation; and those who believe in civic freedom subject only to Common Law, and espouse the cause of free literature, are championing a system which is essentially undemocratic, essentially inimical to the will of the majority, who have certainly no desire for any such things as advancing thought and speculation. Such persons, indeed, merely hold the faith that the People, as a whole, unprotected by the despotic judgments of single persons, have enough strength and wisdom to know what is and what is not harmful to themselves. They put their trust in a Public Press and a Common Law, which deriving from the Conscience of the Country, is openly administered and within the reach of all. How absurd, how inadequate this all is we see from the existence of the Censorship on Drama.|$|E

40|$|Silicon Carbide is a {{promising}} wide band gap semiconductor with many new properties {{yet to be}} established and investigated. Ion implantation is the dominant method of incorporating dopant materials into the Silicon Carbide crystalline structure for electronic device fabrication. The implantation process of dopants into Silicon Carbide, both theoretical and practical, is described in this Thesis. Additional fabrication process steps, such as annealing, and their implications are also described. To gain further insight into the process of ion implantation into Silicon Carbide, the detailed design of a <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die is discussed. The aim of the <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die was to obtain general information such as implanted dopant sheet resistivity and to test a novel bipolar transistor design. The fabrication steps involved for the <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die are discussed in detail. The results from the <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die {{take the form of}} specific electrical measurements, together with detailed visual observations provided by a scanning electron microscope. When viewed under the scanning electron microscope, the novel transistor design structures fabricated on the <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die revealed new and previously unreported surface nucleation formations. These new surface nucleation formations, called Step Bunch Bleed, spread or 'bleed' between co-implanted doped regions on the test die and are found to have specific crystallographic and implantation process implications. The electrical measurements obtained from the <b>special</b> <b>test</b> die led to the re-examination of Silicon Carbide processing results previously held within the department research group. A new phenomenon of co-dopant Field Enhanced dopant diffusion was identified which occurs during the anneal process. A study was conducted to mathematically describe the newly observed field enhanced diffusion phenomenon. A resultant Field Enhanced Diffusion model is proposed and developed in this Thesis to describe the migration progress of entw in Silicon Carbide during the process of annealing...|$|R
