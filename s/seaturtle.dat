40|$|The {{olive ridley}} {{is the most}} {{abundant}} <b>seaturtle</b> species {{in the world but}} little is known of the demography of this species. We used skeletochronological data on humerus diameter growth changes to estimate the age of North Pacific olive ridley seaturtles caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries operating near Hawaii and from dead turtles washed ashore on the main Hawaiian Islands. Two age estimation methods [ranking, correction factor (CF) ] were used and yielded age estimates ranging from 5 to 38 and 7 to 24 years, respectively. Rank age-estimates are highly correlated (r = 0. 93) with straight carapace length (SCL), CF age estimates are not (r = 0. 62). We consider the CF age-estimates as biologically more plausible because of the disassociation of age and size. Using the CF age-estimates, we then estimate the median age at sexual maturity to be around 13 years old (mean carapace size c. 60 cm SCL) and found that somatic growth was negligible by 15 years of age. The expected age-specific growth rate function derived using numerical differentiation suggests at least one juvenile growth spurt at about 10 – 12 years of age when maximum age-specific growth rates, c. 5 cm SCL year− 1, are apparent...|$|E
40|$|Mystic Aquarium’s Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding Program {{has been}} {{responding}} to distressed marine animals in Connecticut and Rhode Island for over 35 years. To date, the Aquarium {{has responded to}} more than 1, 290 stranded seals, whales, dolphins and sea turtles. As required by NOAA, each recorded stranding has an associated Level A data form which contains {{the details of the}} stranding event, including specific information on the animal, its condition and the exact location of the event. This detailed information is very valuable, and can be mapped in programs such as ArcMap and shared through online databases like OBIS-SEAMAP and <b>SeaTurtle.</b> Org for visual representation and analysis. Interactive maps of the coordinates and details of these stranding events can be used to detect spatial and temporal trends in marine animal strandings, and can also improve efficiency in responding to future events by targeting education and outreach efforts based on historic observations of species, location and seasonality. Mystic Aquarium’s stranding data was mapped using both ArcMap and OBIS-SEAMAP, to look for spatial and temporal patterns in marine mammal and sea turtle strandings. The maps produced will be used to target resources and educational efforts to identified stranding hot spots, and also used as educational displays outside Mystic’s Seal Rescue Clinic. Adding data to OBIS-SEA map will add to the growing global database and allow researchers to observe trends on a larger scale...|$|E

40|$|Skeletochronological data {{on growth}} changes in humerus {{diameter}} {{were used to}} estimate the age of Hawaiian green <b>seaturtles</b> ranging from 28. 7 to 96. 0 cm straight carapace length. Two age estimation methods, correction factor and spline integration, were compared, giving age estimates ranging from 4. 1 to 34. 6 and from 3. 3 to 49. 4 yr, respectively, for the sample data. Mean growth rates of Hawaiian green <b>seaturtles</b> are 4 – 5 cm/yr in early juveniles, decline to a relatively constant rate of about 2 cm/yr by age 10 yr, then decline again to less than 1 cm/yr as turtles near age 30 yr. On average, age estimates from the two techniques differed by {{just a few years}} for juvenile turtles, but by wider margins for mature turtles. The spline-integration method models the curvilinear relationship between humerus diameter and the width of periosteal growth increments within the humerus, and offers several advantages over the correction-factor approach...|$|R
40|$|Aim Tracking {{technologies}} are often proposed {{as a method}} to elucidate the complex migratory life histories of migratory marine vertebrates, allowing spatially explicit threats to be identified and mitigated. We conducted a global analysis of foraging areas of adult green turtles (Cheloniamydas) subject to satellite tracking (n = 145) and the conservation designation of these areas according to International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria. Location The green turtle has a largely circumtropical distribution, with adults migrating up to thousands of kilometres between nesting beaches and foraging areas, typically in neritic seagrass or algal beds. Methods We undertook an assessment of satellite tracking projects that followed the movements of green turtles in tropical and subtropical habitats. This approach was facilitated {{by the use of}} the Satellite Tracking and Analysis Tool ([URL] www. <b>seaturtle.</b> org) and the integration of publicly available data on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Results We show that turtles aggregate in designated MPAs far more than would be expected by chance when considered globally (35 % of all turtles were located within MPAs) or separately by ocean basin (Atlantic 67 %, Indian 34 %,Mediterranean 19 %, Pacific 16 %). Furthermore,we show that the size, level of protection and time of establishment of MPAs affects the likelihood of MPAs containing foraging turtles, highlighting the importance of large, well-established reserves. Main conclusions Our findings constitute compelling evidence of the worldwide effectiveness of extant MPAs in circumscribing important foraging habitats for a marine megavertebrate...|$|E
40|$|To further {{describe}} {{movement patterns}} {{and distribution of}} East Pacific green turtles (Chelonia mydas agassizii) and to determine threat levels for this species within the Eastern Pacific. In order to do this we combined published data from existing flipper tagging and early satellite tracking studies with data from an additional 12 satellite tracked green turtles (1996 - 2006). Three of these were tracked from their foraging grounds in the Gulf of California along {{the east coast of}} the Baja California peninsula to their breeding grounds in Michoacán (1337 - 2928 km). In addition, three post-nesting females were satellite tracked from Colola beach, Michoacán to their foraging grounds in southern Mexico and Central America (941. 3 - 3020 km). A further six turtles were tracked in the Gulf of California within their foraging grounds giving insights into the scale of ranging behaviour. Turtles undertaking longdistance migrations showed a tendency to follow the coastline. Turtles tracked within foraging grounds showed that foraging individuals typically ranged up to 691. 6 km (maximum) from release site location. Additionally, we carried out threat analysis (using the cumulative global human impact in the Eastern Pacific) clustering pre-existing satellite tracking studies from Galapagos, Costa Rica, and data obtained from this study; this indicated that turtles foraging and nesting in Central American waters are subject to the highest anthropogenic impact. Considering that turtles from all three rookeries were found to migrate towards Central America, it is highly important to implement conservation plans in Central American coastal areas to ensure the survival of the remaining green turtles in the Eastern Pacific. Finally, by combining satellite tracking data from this and previous studies, and data of tag returns we created the best available distributional patterns for this particular sea turtle species, which emphasized that conservation measures in key areas may have positive consequences on a regional scale.

Along with the proposed Jamursba-Medi and Sausapor reserves the three reserves combined would protect 85 km of the coastline.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, Carr {{discovered}} that the young of green and loggerhead <b>seaturtles</b> {{spent a great deal}} of their pelagic lives in floating sargassum mats. Within these mats, they found ample shelter and food. In the absence of sargassum, sea turtle young feed in the vicinity of upwelling [...] "fronts". In 2007, Reich determined that green sea turtle hatchlings spend the first three to five years of their lives in pelagic waters. In the open ocean, pre-juveniles of this particular species were found to feed on zooplankton and smaller nekton before they are recruited into inshore seagrass meadows as obligate herbivores.|$|R
40|$|The {{timing and}} {{synchrony}} of sea turtle emergences from the nests are primary factors in determining hatchling vigor and likelihood of survival. A clear benefit of synchronous emergence is {{a reduction in}} energy expenditure through social facilitation, but disadvantages also result from reduction in energy stores if hatchlings have to wait any appreciable time in the nest. We investigated hatchling emergence times throughout emergence of the entire clutch for 21 clutches of Flatback <b>Seaturtles,</b> Natator depressus, incubating in a beach hatchery at three clutch sizes and three nest depths. Emergence of the entire clutch spanned an average of 3. 1 days, with shallower nests exhibiting greater emergence asynchrony (mean 20 cm = 4. 0 days, mean 35 cm = 4. 5 days) than deeper nests (mean 50 cm = 1. 7 days). Hatchlings emerged through the night, peaking between 2100 and 2200 h, with hatchlings from shallower nests emerging earlier in the night. For natural nests, hatchlings generally emerged within a single night, evident from the low number of hatchlings remaining in the nest the day after emergence. The disparate observations between a beach hatchery, and natural nests provide important conservation implications for hatchery management...|$|R
