50|$|Prior to 1986, {{there was}} no {{structured}} reception for asylum seekers in Belgium. The federal government considered the Public <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Centres</b> responsible for this and paid for their support services. In 1986, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number}} of asylum requests, owing in part to conflicts in Eastern Europe, Iraq and Iran, Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were displacing great waves of refugees. The federal government therefore decided to set up collective reception locations. The first to open, in November 1986, was the ‘Petit Château’, a former military barracks in Brussels, but by the end of 1992, it was no longer able to accommodate the flow of refugees. A total of almost 27,000 asylum seekers arrived in Belgium in 1993, which led the federal government to open multiple centres across the country. Over the years, Fedasil has needed to expand or reduce its reception capacity depending on the number of asylum seekers on Belgian soil. In the years 1999 and 2000, for example, Belgium saw a steep {{rise in the number of}} asylum requests. The year 2000, which also saw the one-off regularisation campaign, broke all records with 42,691 requests.|$|E

The Community Follow-up Project begins with the student choosing a hospital in-ward patient during their first clinical ward based attachment and follows this patient's progress after discharge from the hospital. The students do a series of home visits and also accompany their patients for some of their follow-ups to the hospital or government clinics; to their general practitioners and even to the palliative care or <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres.</b> The students assess the physical, psychological and social impact of the illness on the patient, family and community. This project supplements students ' knowledge of {{the natural history of}} disease and emphasizes the importance of communication and the use of community resources. By commitment to the patient for a duration of time, the students are able to {{take an active role in}} patients' care, understand in depth the problems faced by patients and in assessing a patient's progress, students find themselves in the role of a teacher and advisor to their patient as well. We outline the main components of this project, describe its outcome and consider areas that invite further developments. Key-words: community-follow-up, clinical students, home visits...|$|E

40|$|U ovom radu raspravlja se o novom sustavu socijalne skrbi koji je sadržan u Zakonu o s ocijalnoj skrbi usvojenom sredinom ove godine. Autorica u drugom dijelu članka posebnu pažnju posvećuje tretmanu nezaposlenih osoba u hrvatskom sustavu socijalne skrbi. In this paper, {{the author}} {{deals with the}} effects of the social welfare system on the {{unemployed}} in the Republic of Croatia. Since a large number of the unemployed have no means for living and for the support of their families, a large number of them rely on different forms of assistance from the social welfare system. The changes in the Croatian social welfare system {{in the last few years}} have to a large extent been influenced by the increased problem of unemployment. The author analyses the social welfare system from the point of view of current regulations. She also analyses the provisions and institutes introduced by the new Law on Social Welfare, the implementation of which will commence on January 1, 1998. According to the new legislation, able-bodied unemployed persons will be entitled to certain rights within the social welfare system. However, the conditions for their entitlement are much stricter than for other person, and the financial assistance that they can receive will be lower that for other users. The purpose is to encourage every working persons to obtain his or her social security primarily by working and only exceptionally through the social welfare system. A better cooperation of competent local employment services and <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> will be necessary...|$|E

Materiales Estudio descriptivo transversal, que abordó algunas características relacionadas con el apoyo social recibido por 276 adultos mayores institucionalizados en 39 centros de protección social, con fuente de información primaria. El análisis de la información fue univariado y bivariado. Resultados Los institucionalizados eran en su mayoría mujeres, con edades de 65 - 84 años, solteras o viudas, con nivel de educación primaria y secundaria; la mayor parte estaban afiliadas al régimen contributivo. Los principales motivos de institucionalización fueron: soledad, problemas de salud y por decisión familiar; ellos son visitados por sus hijos y otros familiares, y este apoyo fue valorado como satisfactorio, pero más de la mitad tenía sentimientos de soledad y la sexta parte manifestó humillaciones de sus seres queridos; es de anotar que una baja proporción reportó maltrato de sus cuidadores. Conclusiones Las redes de apoyo social son fuertes dentro de la institución y perciben un menor maltrato por parte de los cuidadores institucionales que de los familiares. En general, la soledad es un aspecto que lleva a los adultos mayores a institucionalizarse, pero esta permanece en ellos, motivada en parte por el poco contacto con las familias y la mediana satisfacción con amigos y la misma institución, evidenciando su condición de desamparo y de vulnerabilidad social. Objective Analysing {{the social}} support {{provided}} for elderly institutionalised adults being cared for in Elderly Welfare Centres (Centros de Bienestar del Anciano de Medellín) in Medellin during 2008. Materials This was a cross-sectional descriptive study (primary information source) which addressed some characteristics {{related to the}} social support being received by 273 elderly people institutionalised in 37 <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres.</b> Univariate and bivariate analysis {{was applied to the}} data. Results The institutionalised people were mostly single or widowed women aged between 65 and 84 who had received primary and secondary education; most were affiliated to the contributory health regimen. Loneliness, health problems and family decision were the main causes for them having become institutionalised. They were visited by their children and other relatives and such support was rated as being satisfactory; however, {{more than half of them}} had feelings of loneliness and one sixth claimed to be humiliated and insulted by their loved ones. It should be noted that a few of them reported being mistreated by their caregivers. Institutionalised elderly adults performed recreational activities, were satisfied with the support received from friends, with cohabitation and the pertinent institution. Conclusions Social support networks were strong within the institution (i. e. Elderly Welfare Centres); the elderly seemed to receive greater abuse from family members and cohabitants than institutional caregivers. Loneliness generally leads elderly adults to become institutionalised; however, once having entered an institution (being partly motivated by little family contact and average satisfaction with friends and the institution itself) their neglect and social vulnerability becomes evident...|$|E

50|$|Anders Vilhelm Lundstedt (September 11, 1882 - August 20, 1955) was a Swedish jurist and legislator, {{particularly}} {{known as}} a proponent of Scandinavian Legal Realism, having been strongly influenced by his compatriot, the charismatic philosopher Axel Hägerström. He studied Law at Lund University and was {{a professor of law}} at the University of Uppsala from 1914 to 1947. Like Hägerström, Karl Olivecrona and Alf Ross, he resists the exposition of rights as metaphysical entities, arguing that realistic legal analysis should dispense with them. Lundstedt's main focus in his theoretical work became a sustained attack on what he called the method of justice. He considered that there was no objective way to define the requirements of justice and that invocations of justice cloaked purely subjective preferences or unacceptable metaphysical claims. Instead, law and legislation should be guided by a method of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centred</b> on objective study of social conditions and of the practical effects and capabilities of law in improving society for all its members. Lundstedt was a member of the Swedish parliament for many years and promoted within it changes to the penal system and a range of other liberal reforms.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed {{that people with}} disabilities suffer from {{financial}} disadvantage and incur extra costs of living which people without disabilities do not have. To live in an advanced industrial society involves costs across a wide range - costs borne by individuals, families, agencies, and governments. We assume but {{do not know the}} extent of the extra costs borne by those with disabilities, {{and the development of a}} method by which these extra costs may be assessed is imperative. The <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> Research <b>Centre</b> has been fortunate in securing the services of Dr Robert Horn to begin to examine these issues. Unfortunately we have not been able to go beyond an initial examination. This paper is not a research paper. It was not intended to report results nor was it intended to develop theory. It was intended as a first step in developing a study which might examine the extra costs of disablement. The <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> Research <b>Centre</b> is not able to conduct such a survey, nor is it able to develop in detail the component parts of such a survey. We hope, however, that we are performing a service by examining in a systematic way the definitional and conceptual issues that have to be thought through in our search for a better understanding of a social issue of great importance.

40|$|The {{work of the}} <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> Research <b>Centre</b> {{on family}} care of elderly people {{commenced}} in 1981 with a survey of carers in New South Wales and Tasmania. This first stage investigated the experience of 79 people who were looking after an elderly relative at home. A monograph published in 1982 laid out the theoretical issues {{in the analysis of}} family care and presented data from the first stage of the survey. In 1983, the SWRC made a further investigation of families caring for elderly relatives. The sample for the second survey, conducted in South Australia and New South Wales, consisted not only of families still providing care but also of 40 families who had recently stopped caring and had placed their relatives in a nursing home. A total of 79 families were studied in this second stage. This monograph is the second of three publications reporting the <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> Research <b>Centre's</b> work on family care of elderly people. It reports data from the whole study (i. e. both the 1981 and 1983 survey samples) but does not attempt to extrapolate the findings. Its purpose is to present detailed survey results for discussion by key State and Federal policy makers in the health and welfare areas at a SWRC research meeting early in 1984. The final volume, due for publication later in 1984 after consultation with service providers and government officers, will analyse the findings and examine the policy ramifications of the data presented here...|$|R
