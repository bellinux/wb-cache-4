5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic <b>spectrum</b> <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|R

40|$|Searching for {{combinations}} in {{the frequency}} <b>spectra</b> of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> is a commonly used method within the asteroseis-mological community, as harmonics and linear combinations of individual frequencies are expected to appear not only by chance, {{but also as a}} characteristic signature linked to different physical phenomena, e. g., nonlinear oscillations, binarity, and rotation. Furthermore {{it is very important to}} identify independent frequencies for modelling purposes. We show that using high precision data sets delivered by recent space missions, the distinction between combinations having a real phys-ical meaning and spurious combinations which only appear by chance gets more and more difficult. We demonstrate how careful one should be with the interpretation of such combination frequencies by presenting the statistical distributions derived from artificial data sets. Based on comparisons to observations, we find that, despite the high statistical probability of finding combinations in random data sets (having similar properties to the ones of real stars), there is a significant differ-ence in the number of the lowest order combinations between stars with and starts without real combination frequencies. This way, a search for frequency combinations is very useful when interpreted properly, and when results are compared to simulations. c © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

40|$|Starspots {{are usually}} {{associated}} with the action of magnetic fields at the stellar surfaces. However, recently an inhomogeneous chemical distribution of mercury was found for the mercury-manganese (HgMn) star alpha And [...] a well-established member of a non-magnetic subclass of the chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence. In this study we present first results of the high-resolution survey of the HgII 3984 resonance line in the spectra of rapidly rotating HgMn stars with atmospheric parameters {{similar to those of}} alpha And. We use spectrum synthesis modelling and take advantage of the Doppler resolution of the stellar surfaces to probe horizontal structure of mercury distribution. Clear signatures of spots are found in the HgII 3984 line profiles of HR 1185 and HR 8723. Two observations of the latter star separated by two days give evidence for the line profile variability. We conclude that inhomogeneous distribution of Hg is a common phenomenon for the rapidly rotating HgMn stars in the 13000 [...] 13800 K effective temperature range independently of the stellar evolutionary stage.
