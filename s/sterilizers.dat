At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, civil protection teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special <b>sterilizers</b> were distributed to sanitize possibly contaminated waters. A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after being hit by a fallen tree. High winds caused some property damage in Léogâne and Jacmel.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized {{hydrogen}} peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant, which {{allows it to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide <b>sterilizers</b> have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|In hospitals, endospores on {{delicate}} invasive instruments (e.g., video endoscopes) {{are killed}} by low-temperature and non-corrosive, non-toxic, plasma-activated concentrated hydrogen peroxide vapor in <b>sterilizers.</b> [...] In contrast, [...] "high level disinfection" [...] does not kill endospores but is used for instruments that don't enter sterile bodily cavities (e.g., a colonoscope).

2500|$|... Since {{ethylene}} oxide is explosive at concentrations above 3%, {{ethylene oxide}} was traditionally supplied with an inert carrier gas {{such as a}} CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of ozone depletion. These halogenated hydrocarbons are being replaced by systems using 100% ethylene oxide because of regulations and {{the high cost of}} the blends. In hospitals, most ethylene oxide <b>sterilizers</b> use single use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of ethylene oxide blends.|$|E

2500|$|Ethylene oxide {{treatment}} is generally carried out between 30°C and 60°C with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800mg/l. [...] Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all porous materials, {{and it can}} penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic and carcinogenic, however, with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide <b>sterilizers</b> and processes require biological validation after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.|$|E
2500|$|To process materials, {{either a}} gamma source or an {{electron}} beam can be used. The international type IV (wet storage) irradiator {{is a common}} design, of which the JS6300 and JS6500 gamma <b>sterilizers</b> (made by 'Nordion International', which used to trade as 'Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd') are typical examples. In these irradiation plants, the source is stored in a deep well filled with water when not in use. When the source is required, it is moved by a steel wire to the irradiation room where the products which are to be treated are present; these objects are placed inside boxes which are moved through the room by an automatic mechanism. By moving the boxes from one point to another, the contents are given a uniform dose. After treatment, the product is moved by the automatic mechanism out of the room. The irradiation room has very thick concrete walls (about 3 m thick) to prevent gamma rays from escaping. The source consists of [...] 60Co rods sealed within two layers of stainless steel, the rods are combined with inert dummy rods to form a rack with a total activity of about 12.6PBq (340kCi).|$|E
2500|$|Drawbacks of {{hydrogen}} peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. [...] The penetrating ability {{of hydrogen}} peroxide {{is not as}} good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of lumens that can be effectively sterilized and guidance is available from the sterilizer manufacturers. Hydrogen peroxide is primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Level (IDLH) at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Sterilizer manufacturers {{go to great lengths to}} make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas <b>sterilizers</b> are documented in the FDA MAUDE database. When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices will include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.|$|E
