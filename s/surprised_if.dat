5|$|I {{should not}} be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> this were to {{terminate}} in my death. I {{did not expect to}} encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|The opening was a placid Nimzo-Indian Defence, {{and after}} 17...Ba4 {{the game was}} even (Filip). After a series of piece exchanges the {{position}} in the diagram was reached after 29.b5. It {{appeared to be a}} dead-drawn ending, and no one would have been remotely <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the players had agreed to a draw here.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Vernal Utah Temple (51) {{served as}} the Uintah Stake Tabernacle for Latter-day Saints in eastern Utah. The Tabernacle's {{foundation}} was constructed of nearby sandstone, with walls built of four layers of fired brick from local clay. Constructed using considerable donated labor from the fall of 1899, it was dedicated on August 24, 1907, by LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith. Smith reportedly {{said he would not}} be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> a temple was built there some day.|$|E
25|$|Despite the above, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea {{certified}} the Grenfell {{tower building}} work as allegedly conforming to “the relevant provisions”. Council building inspectors visited the site 16 times from August 2014 to July 2016. Kooltherm, a phenolic insulation, {{was also used}} on Grenfell. Kooltherm was never tested with polyethylene core aluminium panels according to the manufacturer. The manufacturer, Kingspan, “would be very <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> such a system … would ever pass the appropriate British Standard 8414 large-scale test”. Kooltherm’s LABC certificate states phenolic products, “do not meet the limited combustibility requirements” of building regulations.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, it was {{reported}} that Jamie Chung had been cast in the film as Stu's fiancée as well as it being renamed, The Hangover Part II. In an interview director Todd Phillips revealed that Mike Tyson would be back in the sequel. Also in November, it {{was reported}} that Paul Giamatti had joined the cast. The next day {{it was reported}} that former U.S. President Bill Clinton filmed a cameo appearance for the film in Bangkok {{while he was in the}} city to deliver a speech on clean energy. Ed Helms clarified that Clinton merely visited the set and would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> he appeared in the film.|$|E

5000|$|Despite this practice, a small twin edged-dagger, (a mattucashlass), {{concealed}} {{under the}} armpit, {{combined with a}} smaller knife, (...) , concealed in the hose or boot, would offer an element of defence or of <b>surprise</b> <b>if</b> employed in attack.|$|R
50|$|It {{will not}} be a <b>surprise</b> <b>if</b> the name Jambezi is a {{variation}} of the name Zambezi, for Jambezi is sometimes pronounced as Zhambezi. Jambezi is a village in Zimbabwe, Matabeleland North, close to the mighty Zambezi River.|$|R
25|$|On 22 March at 9:38pm Islamabad, (16:38 GMT), Gillani {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the peoples party as its candidate for the premiership of the country. Many analysts {{said that they would}} not be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Zardari succeeded Gillani after a few months. It was reported on 24 March 2008, that Zardari said he was not interested in the job of prime minister and that Gillani would serve until 2013 in the position. Speculation that Zardari might be gunning for the premiership grew stronger when he picked the less popular Gillani over Ameen Faheem, a much powerful member of the central executive committee. Fahmida Mirza, the newly elected Speaker of the Assembly, insisted there was no plan to replace Gillani. She added, however, that if Gillani did not do a good job, all options were open.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 2005 he {{committed}} his future to Cardiff City, signing a new long-term {{contract with the}} club. This was shortly after he had won a call up to the Wales under-21 squad. A month later he scored a vital goal, to earn three points for Cardiff as they beat Sheffield United 1–0. Ledley's season ended in April as he suffered a fractured metatarsal bone in training. Before this he had played 32 times for Cardiff City and had also earned three Wales under-21 caps. His performances had provided a major boost for Cardiff City in what was a poor season for them {{as they were in}} relegation trouble {{at the bottom of the}} Championship and were suffering financial troubles as well. Lawrence said that he hoped Ledley would stay at Cardiff for the next few seasons and that he wouldn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the 18-year-old earned a full Wales call-up in the near future.|$|E

6000|$|The rising {{solicitor}} {{lifted his}} eyebrows in polite <b>surprise.</b> <b>If</b> Mr. Kendrew wanted information, why should Mr. Kendrew {{ask for it}} in that way? [...] "Do you wish me {{to go into the}} law of the case?" [...] he inquired.|$|R

500|$|However, R. A. Dunlap {{points out}} the {{contrast}} between the order of the polyhedral forms and the more chaotic biological nature of the chameleons inhabiting them. In the same vein, Beech observes that the stars themselves convey tension between order and chaos: despite their symmetric shapes, the stars are scattered apparently at random, and vary haphazardly from each other. [...] As Escher himself wrote about the central chameleon cage, [...] "I shouldn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> it wobbles a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, indeed; and I {{take it to}} be the news, or {{connected}} with the news, that you have sent to the First Lord, in the late despatches. It has not taken you altogether by <b>surprise,</b> <b>if</b> the truth were said?" ...|$|R
60|$|Another slight {{movement}} in the dark circle apprised the trapper that his declaration was not received without <b>surprise,</b> <b>if</b> entirely without distrust. The chief alone seemed unmoved; nor was he disposed to relax from the loftiness and high dignity of his air.|$|R

500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|He was not drafted, however, in the 2010 NBA Draft. [...] Coach K {{elaborated}} {{on what he}} {{had said}} before the draft: [...] "In the second round, it's better not to be drafted. As soon as the draft is over, if you are good enough, you will be invited by five or six teams, and you {{will have a chance to}} choose who you will play summer league ball with. [...] I would be a little bit <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> [...] not on an NBA roster playing next season." ...|$|E
500|$|The court set out nine minimum standards. In {{response}} to the court's ruling, the General Assembly passed the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, which radically altered Kentucky's school system, providing mechanisms to equalize funding among school districts and implementing {{some of the toughest}} accountability standards in the United States. Of the legislature's actions, Combs opined [...] "Kentucky has now, by reason of this legislation, decided to become educated—and we have embarked on a crusade for that purpose. Don't be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> we should within the next decade develop a first class, world-wide educational system." ...|$|E
25|$|But mostly Against the Wall is a {{pleasant}} surprise, with Carpani being {{a much bigger}} <b>surprise.</b> <b>If</b> Against the Wall can make its disparate parts work, it will be plenty more intriguing than a number of network procedurals.

500|$|A {{day after}} the Leicester City match, Arsenal paraded the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus, in front of more than 250,000 fans.

We achieved something unbelievable but we couldn't {{have done it without}} the fans." [...] In an interview with the BBC, Dein added: [...] "We've seen history made and I'd be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> it happens again.

500|$|In 2004, Harrah's Casinos {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area: Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a [...] "style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe." ...|$|E
