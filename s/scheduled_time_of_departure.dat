The roads {{needed for a}} journey could be pre-booked, the price of [...] "slots" [...] rising as the roads to be used approached capacity. The price would become payable at the <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> unless the slot holder resold the slot before then. Casual motorists without bookings would be charged the current price. The paper proposed that Finland, having no serious road congestion to address, {{could serve as a}} testbed for road charging mechanisms.|$|E

This paper describes a solution of Air Holding Problem (AHP) of ATM in Brazil using Multiagent System to improve Reinforcement Learning {{in collaboration with the}} flight controllers to support the decision process. The results obtained in the case study are promising, the behavior of the prototypes demonstrated that the Q-learning algorithm converged in a satisfying way.

3000|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, a DQ-MAC {{statistical model}} approaches the delay and throughput {{performance of the}} theoretical optimum queuing systems M/M/ 1, or G/D/ 1, depending on the traffic distribution (i.e., M: exponential, G: general, and D: deterministic). DQ-MAC protocol can be modeled as if every body sensor in the system maintains two common logical distributed queues—CRQ and DTQ—as portrayed in Figure 4. The CRQ controls body sensor accesses to the collision resolution server (the access minislots) and is designed to resolve collisions among stations attempting to successfully obtain an access minislot. The DTQ, {{in charge of the}} data server (the [...] "data subslot"), is used to buffer the data packets that have obtained permission to transmit and are awaiting their <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> using a first-come-first-served (FCFS) discipline. The enable transmission interval (ETI), modeled with a nonqueuing infinite server system in Figure 4, is the time elapsed from the actual arrival time of a packet {{to the head of the}} CRQ subsystem at the beginning of the next DQ-MAC superframe, when the contention process can start. The first queuing system models the CRQ subsystem and the second represents the DTQ subsystem.|$|E
40|$|With {{the drastic}} {{increase}} in the demand for air travel, taxiway aircraft traffic scheduling is becoming increasingly important in managing air traffic. In order to reduce traffic congestion on taxiways, this thesis proposes a tool for air traffic controllers to use in decision making: a taxiway air traffic model developed using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) {{that can be applied}} to a rolling time horizon. The objective of this model is to minimize the total taxi time, and the output is a schedule and route for each aircraft. This MIP model assumes that only the origin and destination of each aircraft is fixed; due to some uncertain factors in the air arrival and departure process, it allows for the departure time and arrival time to vary within a certain time window. This MIP model features aircraft type, and also incorporates runway crossings and runway separations. The model is programmed using C++ and Solved in CPLEX 12. 1. Runways 26 R and 26 L of George Bush International Airport are used to find solutions. The author presents a rolling horizon method by dividing the large scheduling issue into smaller time interval problems according to the <b>scheduled</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> or arrival. A bound is also proposed based on the discretized time interval problems. By using partial data from George Bush International Airport (IAH), solutions are obtained. The results are compared with the bound and show fairly high optimality. Compared with the previous research, this thesis presents a model with more flexibility by considering different operations. By using the rolling horizon method, the problem is broken into smaller units that can be solved efficiently without losing much optimality...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{aspects of}} tram-network section reliability, which {{operates as a}} part of the model of whole city tram-network reliability. Here, one of the main points of interest is the character of the chronological development of the disturbances (namely the differences between <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> provided in <b>schedule</b> and real <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure)</b> on subsequent sections during tram line operation. These developments were observed in comprehensive measurements done in Krakow, during one of the main transportation nodes (Rondo Mogilskie) rebuilding. All taken building activities cause big disturbances in tram lines operation with effects extended to neighboring sections. In a second part, the stochastic character <b>of</b> section running <b>time</b> will be analyzed more detailed. There will be taken into consideration sections with only one beginning stop and also with two or three beginning stops located at different streets at an intersection. Possibility of adding results from sections with two beginning stops to one set will be checked with suitable statistical tests which are used to compare the means of the two samples. Section running time may depend on the value of gap between two following trams and from the value of deviation from schedule. This dependence will be described by a multi regression formula. The main measurements were done in the city center of Krakow in two stages: before and after big changes in tramway infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Scheduling {{aircraft}} maintenance personnel at an {{aircraft maintenance}} company entails some special problems. First, the workforce scheduling problem is heavily constrained by labour union agreements. Second, the maintenance jobs {{that have to}} be carried out are malleable. This means that the company should decide when exactly the maintenance will take place between the arrival and departure of the aircraft. Hence, the timing of the workload is an extra decision in the scheduling problem. Third, aircraft tend to not always fly on schedule and arrive now and then with a delay. When the workforce scheduling does not anticipate delays in arrival time, the scheduled capacity may be insufficient to maintain all aircraft in time. This paper focuses on this latter problem and presents a technique to obtain robust aircraft maintenance personnel rosters that minimize the total labour costs. Robust personnel rosters are rosters that can handle delays in aircraft arrival times. We define the stochastic robustness of these rosters as their ability to ensure a certain service level; i. e., to ensure that on average at least a certain percentage of the flights can be maintained before their <b>Scheduled</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Departure</b> (STD). To obtain this stochastic robustness, we propose a model enhancement heuristic that iteratively enhances a deterministic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model by adding constraints based on information that is obtained by simulation experiments. This research is inspired by the real life problems at Sabena Technics, a large aircraft maintenance company located at Brussels Airport in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} phenomenal growth of many {{low-cost}} airlines, competitiveness has increased significantly. Within this competition, {{to achieve an}} on-time departure performance is a momentous factor; thus providing those airlines with on-time departure performance with a foremost competitive advantage. On-time departure performance is important for airlines to satisfy passengers by departing on adequate <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> (STD). The main component of achieving on time departure {{is being able to}} complete the turnaround time of an aircraft within its scheduled time. By considering this problem, optimally scheduling of turnaround time was studied in this thesis as a real case of a low-cost company. One of the Turkish airline companies was facing many delays occurring because of subjective scheduling of turnaround operations. In order to solve this problem a number of on-site visits were conducted and data was collected from the turnaround operations of Boeing 737 - 800 type of aircrafts from the hub airport of the company. A mathematical model is then developed to find an optimal schedule of operations for four different flight types considering arrival from a domestic or international port and departing to a domestic or international port. The objective of the modelling is to minimise the completion time of the last operation. There are other studies in the literature which were interested to schedule turnaround operations with heuristic approaches and simulation. This study fills the gap of optimisation with integer linear programming (ILP) since there is no other papers used ILP to schedule turnaround operations. The problem was solved using mathematical modelling approach and an optimisation solver (IBM ILOG OPL) to get the results for different scenarios. The results of the model are then interpreted and Gantt charts of schedules for different flight types are generated. In addition to these, models were also run for different disembarking/boarding styles and the fastest completion time of turnaround time was determined. It was concluded that the minimum time of turnaround operations are in domestic-domestic flight type with using passenger stair for disembarking and airbridge for boarding. Finally, critical path in each schedule were listed to indicate the critical operations needed to be focused...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} optimal {{pricing policies}} for airlines when passengers are uncertain at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> ticketing of their eventual {{willingness to pay}} for air travel. Auctions at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> efficiently allocate space and a profit maximizing airline can capitalize on these gains by overbooking ights and repurchasing excess tickets from those passengers whose realized value is low. Nevertheless profit maximization entails distortions away from the efficient allocation. Under regularity conditions, we show that the optimal mechanism can be implemented by a modified double auction. In order to encourage early booking, passengers who purchase late are disadvantaged. In order to capture the information rents of passengers with high expected values, ticket repurchases at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> are at a subsidized price, sometimes leading to unused capacity...|$|R
