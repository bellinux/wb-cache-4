John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, {{to be a part of}} a sharecropper farm. During this time, Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers and attended a one-room school [...] away. His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked to <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse, William, and Julia Brown sang in the church choir. In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton.|$|E

[...] Mrs. Bulah's daughter, Shirley, had been denied admission to the modern, whites-only Hockessin School No. 29, and instead was compelled to attend a one-room [...] "colored" [...] school, Hockessin School No. 107, which, though very near School No. 29, had vastly inferior facilities and construction. [...] Moreover, Shirley Bulah was required to walk to <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> even though a school bus serving the nearby whites-only school passed by her house every day. [...] Mrs. Bulah had attempted to obtain transportation for Shirley on that bus, but she was told they would never transport an African-American student.|$|E

In 2001, the Supreme Court of India instructed all state governments to implement free school lunches in all government-funded schools, but implementation has been patchy due to corruption and social issues.

2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing {{really sort of}} seriously when I was about eleven. I say seriously {{in the sense that}} like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E

60|$|The male {{heads of}} the {{families}} were necessarily drawn into the quarrel, and the children on either side were forbidden {{to have anything to}} do with the unhallowed offspring of the other party.

Thus all communication between the households was sundered. Except the cats. Much as Mrs. Saunders might deplore it, rumour persistently pointed to the Crick he-cat as the presumable father of sundry kittens of which the Saunders she-cat was indisputably the mother. Mrs. Saunders drowned the kittens, but the disgrace remained.|$|E
6000|$|From the allusion, above, to the {{colliery}} effort, {{it would}} seem that the act for removing women and children from the coalpits preceded the reform of the printworks. Concerning the result of these various enterprises, he says, [...] "The present state of things may be told in few words. Full fifty thousand children under thirteen years of age attend <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> None are worked more than seven, generally only six, hours in the day. Those above thirteen and under eighteen, and all women, are limited to ten hours and a half, exclusive of the time for meals. The work begins at six in the morning and ends at six in the evening. Saturday's labor ends at four o'clock, and there is no work on Sunday. The printworks are brought under regulation, and the women and children removed from the coalpits." [...] His lordship adds, [...] "The report of inspectors which I send you will give you a faint picture of the physical, social, and moral good that has resulted. I may safely say of these measures, that God has blessed them far beyond my expectation, and almost equal to my heart's desire." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{school meal}} or school lunch [...] (also known as hot lunch, a school dinner, or school breakfast) is a meal, {{typically}} {{in the middle}} or {{beginning of the school}} day, provided to students at school. Countries all over the world have various kinds of school meal programs. Millions of children from all standards and grades get their meals at their respective <b>schools</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Scientifically and medically, school meals are regarded as an essential component of children's upbringing and growth.

60|$|At home, generally, {{they found}} that the {{children}} had not missed them, and were perfectly safe. It was {{one of the advantages of}} a flat that they could leave the children there whenever they liked without anxiety. They liked better staying there than wandering about in the evening with their parents, whose excursions seemed to them somewhat aimless, and their pleasures insipid. They studied, or read, or looked out of the window at the street sights; and their mother always came back to them with a pang for their lonesomeness. Bella knew some little girls in the house, but in a ceremonious way; Tom had formed no friendships among the boys at school such as he had left in Boston; as nearly as he could explain, the New York fellows carried canes at an age when they would have had them broken for them by the other boys at Boston; and they were both sissyish and fast. It was probably prejudice; he never could say exactly what their demerits were, and neither he nor Bella was apparently so homesick as they pretended, though they answered inquirers, the one that New York was a hole, and the other that it was horrid, and that all they lived for was to get back to Boston. In the mean time they were thrown much upon each other for society, which March said was well for both of them; he did not mind their cultivating a little gloom and the sense of a common wrong; it made them better comrades, and it was providing them with amusing reminiscences for the future. They really enjoyed Bohemianizing in that harmless way: though Tom had his doubts of its respectability; he was very punctilious about his sister, and went round from his own <b>school</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> to fetch her home from hers. The whole family went to the theatre a good deal, and enjoyed themselves together in their desultory explorations of the city.|$|E

50|$|The {{average length}} of courses in FATEC is 2,700 hours, with three years duration. Taking into account that the final {{resolution}} of the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) provides the minimum hours to 2,400 hours for various careers of bachelorship, we can conclude that even with a shorter duration in comparison to traditional degree courses, the degrees offered in FATECs form professionals with working hours equal and even superior to several BA. This is possible {{because the number of}} hours that students remain in <b>schools</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> is high, being more than 5 hours on some campuses.
