40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is The Concept of Immunity and Inviolability for Diplomatic Agent at Receiving State: Implementation and Abuses. The legal issue of this thesis is based on facts, there are some {{diplomatic}} agents in the Receiving State abuse their immunity and inviolability, which is given to them to ensure {{the performance of their}} functions. Then, the purposes of this thesis are: firstly, to know the action taken either by Receiving <b>State</b> or <b>Sending</b> <b>State</b> if there is a diplomatic agent from <b>Sending</b> <b>State</b> abuses his/her immunity and inviolability. Secondly, this thesis is made as a completion of the prerequisite for graduate. The method used in the research for this thesis is normative legal research by using deductive principle. The results of this research are: the acts taken by the <b>Sending</b> <b>State</b> are declaring waiver or recall its diplomatic agent. And the acts taken by the Receiving State are declaring persona non grata, asking the <b>Sending</b> <b>State</b> to bring that case before the <b>Sending</b> <b>State’s</b> Court and Law, asking the <b>Sending</b> <b>State</b> to waives its diplomatic agent’s immunity and inviolability, or expel the diplomatic agent. The suggestions are to organize a better selection and training for the diplomatic agent to-be so they have a good intellectual and moral.

30|$|What {{makes the}} {{mobilization}} by migrants {{different from other}} forms of ethnic mobilization is that migrants can be politically involved in both the sending and the receiving country. Increasingly, globalization allows migrants to form transnational communities and share multiple identities (Castles, 2002). Receiving countries often promote these transnational bonds {{with the goal of}} stimulating remittances from the expatriates (Portes and Rumbaut, 2006). This implies that migrants remain connected to their <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> and are therefore also expected to mobilize in the case of political conflict in their country of emigration. In fact, many migrants leave for political reasons such as war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b> In the context of a globalized world, in which migrants can easily remain informed about the political situation in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> and might even be in continuous contact with family members that remained there, opposition to the government in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> is a strong source of motivation. Hence, we can assume that more migrants protest in the case of war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{cross-sectional}} analysis also {{allows us to}} test whether the result that migrant protest is strongly conditioned by war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> is dependent upon latter’s operationalization. 11 Hence, in addition to measure war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> {{with the number of}} asylum seekers we make use of information on the political situation in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b> We make use of Polity IV scores in order to measure whether the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> was an autocracy or not. The Polity IV project measures political regime characteristics on a global scale and over time (Marshall and Jaggers, 2002). We make use of the Polity 2 index, where a negative score indicates that the country was an autocracy. A major weakness of the Polity IV score {{is that it does not}} sufficiently take into account that specific minorities might be discriminated even if the regime as a whole cannot be considered an autocracy. Hence, we also code states as being at war or discriminating a share of its population if they are engaged in an ethnic war. 12 We take this information from the Ethnic War Dataset (Cederman, Wimmer, and Min, 2010). Our resulting indicator is positively correlated with the share of asylum seekers (R[*]=[*] 0.26; Pr[*]=[*] 0.00; N[*]=[*] 288)—our original measure for war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{suitable}} {{relationship that}} defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> is as follows. On occasions {{when the system}} {{happens to be in}} states that are sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> are such that they can be measured locally with sufficient accuracy by the same techniques as are used to measure thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables,</b> or by corresponding time and space derivatives, including fluxes of matter and energy. In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> that correspond to extensive thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> On occasions when the system is sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables,</b> for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> In reality, these requirements are very demanding, and it may be difficult or practically, or even theoretically, impossible to satisfy them. This is part of why non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress.|$|R
