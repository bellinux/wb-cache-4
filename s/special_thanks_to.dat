We {{would like to give}} <b>special</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

500|$|Before Monitor was {{put into}} dry dock for repairs President Lincoln, Navy Secretary Fox, various {{officials}} {{and a few of}} Worden's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire regiments were also directed to come by the naval yard and review the ship and honor the crew. Monitors crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front, while Lincoln, Fox and other guests stood near the turret. When Worden, with part of his face blacked from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in [...] President Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others. After Lincoln's formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return. Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden's career. At Fox's request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between Monitor and Virginia, while paying tribute to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave <b>special</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of Monitor possible.|$|E

6000|$|Let us {{rejoice in}} that thought on this day, above all {{days in the}} year. On this day we give <b>special</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> God for all His {{servants}} departed this life in His faith and fear. Let us rejoice in the thought that we know not how many they are; only that they are an innumerable company, out of all tongues and nations, whom no man can number. Let us rejoice that Christ's grace is richer, and not poorer, than our weak imaginations can conceive, or our narrow systems account for. Let us rejoice that the goodly company in whose presence we stand, can be limited and defined by no mortal man, or school of men: but only by Him from whom, with the Father, proceeds for ever the Holy Spirit, the inspirer of all good; and who said of that Spirit--"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth. So is every one who is born of the Spirit"--and who said again, [...] "John came neither eating nor drinking, and ye said, He hath a devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But I say unto you, Verily wisdom is justified of all her children"--and who said again--when John said to Him, [...] "Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and he followeth not us"--"Forbid him not. For I say to you, that he that doeth a miracle in My name will not lightly speak evil of Me"--and who said, lastly--and most awfully--that the unpardonable sin, either in this life or the life to come, was to attribute beneficent deeds to a bad origin, because they were performed by one who differed from us in opinion; and to say, [...] "He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, prince of the devils." ...|$|E
