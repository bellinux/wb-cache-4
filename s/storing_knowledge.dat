5000|$|Researches of Prof. Salahaddin Khalilov {{elucidate}} {{the stages of}} the process of application of new scientific knowledge to production with logical-gnoseological way; they also determine the special place and specificities of scientific-technical knowledge in the classification of sciences, and draw comparative analysis of the notions of “applied sciences”, “technical sciences”, “scientific-technical knowledge”, “technological knowledge”. The comparative researches of science and economy, science and technology, science and language, science and religion, science and education, science and literature etc., are useful to appraise the role of science in the modern social life from different aspects. Some of his investigations are dealing with determination of the peculiarities of Eastern and Islamic way of thought.Prof. Khalilov discusses ideas which are presented in the West as intuition, irrational comprehension and mysticism in the context of Tasavvuf philosophy. His researches compare several Islamic philosophers with Western philosophers, such as comparison between Avicenna and Descartes, Suhravardi and Kant, Ibn Khaldun and Karl Marx and also give an explanation of similarities between Sufizm and Phenomenology.In his opinion the problem of determining the boundary between conscious and unconscious is in some sense equivalent to the problem of isolating the rational soul in the structure of internal life. From what does consciousness originate? The core condition for consciousness is the obviousness of an object. This is achieved by the concretion of a certain idea in the confines of the body. (For every object, reality is the synthesis of an infinite number of ideas.) Intentionality, phenomenological reduction, is the isolation of a single idea in pure form. Alongside Brentano’s and Husserl’s notably efficient idea about the intentionality of consciousness, other ideas and constructions of Husserl directed at the creation of an all-embracing theory seem to be argumentative and are sometimes also artificially constructed. For instance, there is the problem of the corporeal activity of man, the idea of kinetic consciousness, etc. where the functions of the body are seen as if detached from the functioning of the sensory organs.In his papers he discusses some peculiarities - simililarities and differences - of memory and remembrance (personal life memory). The mechanisms of <b>storing</b> <b>knowledge</b> and recollection have been analysed. It was shown that earlier used spirit-body or soul-body methods could not adequately explain the correlation between memory and remembrance [...] For consideration specific details of the correlation of memory and remembrance more realistic model of “spirit-soul-body” or “mind-soul-body” [...] was developed.Some of Western ideologists have considered that Eastern Islamic countries, including Azerbaijan, stay behind Western countries in the economical competition based on modern technology, for the reasons of Islam and traditional thought. However, sciences which are bases of economical development do not depend on the religions of scientists. S. Khalilov explains that it could be a problem of relations of religion and science but not of religions of scientists. When we define the main attributes of the East and West, it becomes clear that all religions, including the Christianity are Eastern phenomena, regardless of their geographical location. So, it would be wrong if we relate Western civilization to the Christianity.According to the view of Prof. Khalilov, the modern civilization had been formulated by joint efforts of both the East and the West, in different stages of history.|$|E

40|$|In two {{language}} production experiments, {{we investigated}} whether <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{of the typical}} color of objects affects spoken reference. In experiment 1, human speakers referred to objects with colors ranging from very typical (e. g., red tomato) to very atypical (e. g., blue pepper). The probability that speakers redundantly include color in their descriptions was almost linearly predicted by the degree of atypicality. In experiment 2, we extended this finding to references to objects for which color is inherently a less salient property in <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> (i. e., objects with a highly characteristic shape, making color less important for recognition). Following these findings that typicality affects reference production, we conclude that speakers utilize <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> about everyday objects they refer to. We discuss the implications of our findings for artificial agents that generate natural language, arguing that computational models fall short in captur- ing general knowledge about typical properties of objects...|$|R

The research adopted a qualitative case study research method. It used survey, observation and documentations as the data collection techniques, as they are best suited to examine and help understand the wider research context of how {{learning and teaching}} knowledge generated can be collected and how the <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> can be reused. They also helped examine how <b>knowledge</b> was <b>stored</b> through technology. <b>Knowledge</b> created in a classroom can be effectively reused. The research findings indicate that the instructors (e. g. the course coordinators) {{will need to be}} familiar with what technology (like a learning management system) can do and help collect the usable learning and teaching knowledge for reuse. The instructors however have to selectively reuse the appropriate <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge.</b> They also have to plan ahead before a course offering starts what types of <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> are to be reused. Knowledge reuse is made so simple and easy when the instructor/ course coordinator has the ‘know-why’, ‘know-how’, ‘know-when’, ‘know-where’ and ‘know-what’ to make successful learning and teaching happen...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Informa / Taylor and Francis Group [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Following a right-hemisphere lesion, the patient SM had impaired object recognition, with good elementary visual abilities, and could derive information about object structure. He was also impaired on all tasks tapping <b>stored</b> structural <b>knowledge,</b> even when tested in the verbal modality. This suggests that SM has a disorder affecting <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> of object structure, though he remains able to assemble novel structural descriptions. His object recognition ability also appeared significantly worse for non-living things. By contrast, existing models relating to <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> would predict that SM would show greater impairment with living things. We argue that SM's deficit reflects the loss of a type of structural knowledge that relates to the ???within-item structural diversity??? of items. It is argued that living things show less structural variation than objects in the natural world, and might arguably be easier to recognise, because the image of the to-be-recognised object would be similar to the stored representation. Hence, a deficit affecting this aspect of <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> would differentially impact upon non-living things. This argument receives confirming independent support from the finding that normal subjects ratings for the within-item structural diversity of visual stimuli are (unlike other ???critical??? variables) significant predictors of SM's naming performance...|$|R
40|$|The current thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} visual attention {{in relation to}} the effects of <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> and ageing, as well as the contribution of top-down and bottom-up processes in visual search. A first set of experiments focused on ‘singleton search’. The performance of younger adults was compared to older adults. Results of these experiments revealed evidence that the presence of a singleton distractor can sometimes facilitate search as reported by Geng & DiQuattro (2010). Apparent differences between the groups were found to be attributable to the ageing process. In the second set of experiments examined the impact of <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge</b> and colour associations on search. Results of these experiments indicated an impact of <b>stored</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Again, apparent differences between the groups on these 2 experiments were found to be attributable to the ageing process. Finally I carried out a cognitive intervention aimed at improving attention and working memory in older adults, and compared the performance of an intervention group to a control group. Results demonstrated that this computerised attention training programme (CPAT) can improve cognitive functions which otherwise decline with age.
