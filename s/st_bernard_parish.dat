5|$|Upon {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning {{from the mouth of}} the Mississippi River to Pensacola, Florida. Sixhours later, the warning was extended westward to Morgan City, Louisiana. The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish</b> in Louisiana, and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs. Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O'Connor, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting {{in the development of}} a strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall in a rural area of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> <b>Parish,</b> Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi. The remnants continued into northern Louisiana and then turned northward, before dissipating over Arkansas on August3.|$|E

In the 1860s some of the Isleños fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side. After the end of the war, there were food shortages throughout the South, including <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> <b>parish,</b> and hunting became even more important to the Isleños, as it already was for the Cajuns around New Orleans.|$|E
