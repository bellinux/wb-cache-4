6000|$|By {{the time}} Dinah had undressed {{and put on}} her night-gown, this feeling about Hetty had {{gathered}} a painful intensity; her imagination had created a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow, in which she saw the poor thing struggling torn and bleeding, looking with tears for rescue and finding none. It was in this way that Dinah's imagination and sympathy acted and reacted habitually, each heightening the other. She felt a deep longing to go now and pour into Hetty's ear all the words of tender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind. But perhaps Hetty was already asleep. Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard still some slight noises, which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed. Still she hesitated; she was not quite certain of a divine direction; the voice that told {{her to go to}} Hetty seemed no stronger that the other voice which said that Hetty was weary, and that going to her now in an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more obstinately. Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices. There was light enough for her, if she opened her Bible, to discern the text sufficiently to know what it would say to her. She knew the physiognomy of every page, and could tell on what book she opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing title or number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the edges. Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was strongest, and then opened it with her forefinger. The first words she looked at were those {{at the top of the}} left-hand page: [...] "And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him." [...] That was enough for Dinah; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning. She hesitated no longer, but, opening her own door gently, went and tapped on Hetty's. We know she had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out her candles and throw off her black lace scarf; but after the <b>second</b> <b>tap</b> the door was opened immediately. Dinah said, [...] "Will you let me come in, Hetty?" [...] and Hetty, without speaking, for she was confused and vexed, opened the door wider and let her in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A finger tapping {{task was}} used to assess motor speed (MS) of both hands in 53 adults and, 152 {{children}} before and after yoga training and in 38 adults of a non-yoga (control) group. All subjects were right hand dominant. The 30 <b>second</b> <b>tapping</b> speed (TS) test was considered as three time intervals, i. e. 0 - 10 second (TSI), 10 - 20 seconds (TS 2) and 20 - 30 seconds (TS 3). There was a significant (Student's t-test) increase in all three TS values following 10 days of yoga in children and 30 days of yoga in adults. However for both groups at baseline and final assessments, TS 2 and TS 3 were significantly lower than TS 1. Hence the TS was increased after yoga training during the first 10 seconds of the test but not during the next 20 seconds. These results suggest an increase in motor speed for repetitive finger movements following yoga training, but not in strength or endurance, as the increase was not sustained over 30 sec.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if performance-based self-esteem, {{personality}} (Type A), perceived stress, age and gender predict the value of own or others life-stress (VLS). The aim was also to examine whether the variables were correlated significantly with each other. The investigation was conducted in a town in the mid-south of Sweden. The instrument consisted of two forms where the first measured Type A personality and the <b>second</b> <b>tapped</b> perform-ance-based self-esteem, perceived stress and the level of life-stress. The results showed that the level of life-stress could explain, on the basis of the predictors, performance-based self-esteem, personality (Type A), perceived stress, age and gender. Perceived stress was signifi-cantly correlated with VLS when Spearman’s test was performed but it was not a significant predictor in the MRA. Performance-based self-esteem and perceived stress were higher among the younger participants. Gender differences were found where men valued a higher level of a stressed life situation, more than women. The results also showed that a higher score on Type-A behavior resulted in a higher value of a stressed life situation...|$|R

In many cases it is desirable to monitor the data traffic flowing between two points in a copper or fiber based Operational or Onboard Network System (ONS) for Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) purposes because these ONS systems may carry important data {{which can be used}} without duplicating/installing a specific FTI data acquisition system to receive this data. The two types of network taps that can be used are Inline Network Taps and network end-point taps. This paper examines the usage of Inline Network Taps for FTI applications and how they can support network access strategies and objectives. An Inline Network Tap is a hardware device which allows access to data flowing across a network. These devices are typically active/powered and have a number of ports: a first tap port, a <b>second</b> <b>tap</b> port, and one or more mirror ports. An in-line network tap inserted between the first and <b>second</b> <b>tap</b> port passes all data traffic through unimpeded but also copies that same data to one or more mirror ports. Some Inline Network Tap devices may also pass packets when the tap is not powered or a malfunction is detected on the device via an integrated by-pass function. If the Inline Network Tap device goes offline the unit automatically bypasses the tap connection and data traffic is directed through the bypass directly to network devices. This capability is crucial for inline usage on mission critical network segments that cannot afford the risk of losing the network connection. An in-line network tap can either be based on copper or fiber technology and as a "filterable" network tap can also provide advanced packet filtering capabilities. These filterable network taps can selectively pass data, e. g., based on VLAN ID or other parameters, to a mirror port for deep analysis, monitoring and recording. Another advanced tap function that is presented in this paper is the support for inserting time stamps at the tap level in monitored packets which provides a reference time when the data content of a given packet was generated at a data source. This capability is a significant feature for FTI applications as most ONS systems do not provide time stamped data...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of a cohort study of pregnant women conducted in Brittany (France), we assessed the exposure to trihalomethanes (THM) during pregnancy in a subset by evaluating (1) potential sources of variability in household THM levels; (2) the between- and within-subject variability in THM levels; (3) THM levels in swimming pools; and (4) the role of water-related habits on total THM uptake. We visited 109 women from the ongoing cohort study at home for an interview and collection of tap water from October to December 2004. Forty-three of them were re-contacted to obtain a <b>second</b> <b>tap</b> water sample in April-May 2005. We designed a questionnaire to collect individual information on source and amount of drinking water, frequency of showering, bathing, and swimming pool attendance, and household characteristics. We obtained 282 THM measurements, 152 specifically for the study and 130 from a regulatory agency. Personal information and environmental data were combined using two methodologies (method 1 using regulatory data and method 2 using our THM measurements) with a different set of assumptions. We calculated ingestion, showering, bathing, and swimming pool THM uptakes and added up those uptakes to calculate total THM uptake. Average THM levels from our measurements in October, November-December, and April-May were 61. 3, 45. 1, and 54. 5 microg/l, respectively. Geographical variability was low and characteristics of the household did not influence THM levels. Within-subject variability in THM levels was three times higher than between-subject variability. Average THM level in swimming pools was 80. 4 microg/l. Average water consumption during pregnancy was 1. 9 l/day. The source of the household drinking water was 90 % bottled, 8 % municipal, and 2 % from other sources. Forty-seven per cent attended swimming pools during pregnancy. Using method 1, the geometric mean of total THM uptake was 0. 93 microg/day. Showering contributed 64 %, swimming in pools 23 %, bathing 12 %, and drinking water 1 % to the total THM uptake. In a setting with low geographical variability and limited environmental measurements, individual data is highly relevant to determine personal THM exposure and uptake. In a population that mainly drinks bottled water (e. g., pregnant women), individual THM uptakes are dominated by inhalation and dermal absorption during, showering, swimming in pools, and bathing...|$|E

Ten healthy elderly subjects and 95 patients in different clinical stages of PD have utilized a touch-pad handheld computer to perform alternate tapping tests in their home environments. First, a neurologist used a web-based system to visually assess impairments in four tapping dimensions (‘speed’, ‘accuracy’, ‘fatigue’ and ‘arrhythmia’) and a global <b>tapping</b> severity (GTS). <b>Second,</b> <b>tapping</b> signals were processed with time series analysis and statistical methods to derive 24 quantitative parameters. Third, principal component {{analysis was used to}} reduce the dimensions of these parameters and to obtain scores for the four dimensions. Finally, a logistic regression classifier was trained using a 10 -fold stratified cross-validation to map the reduced parameters to the corresponding visually assessed GTS scores. Results showed that the computed scores correlated well to visually assessed scores and were significantly different across Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale scores of upper limb motor performance. In addition, they had good internal consistency, had good ability to discriminate between healthy elderly and patients in different disease stages, had good sensitivity to treatment interventions and could reflect the natural disease progression over time. In conclusion, the automatic method can be useful to objectively assess the tapping performance of PD patients and can be included in telemedicine tools for remote monitoring of tapping.

40|$|Temporal {{information}} processing {{in people with}} parkinson's disease [off medication] and in healthy controls was investigated using a psychophysical choice procedure and an interval production task in two time ranges, milliseconds and seconds. There were no differences between groups on a frequency bisection task [control task, non-timing]. Control subjects produced equivalent Weber fractions in the estimation [bisection] task for the milliseconds range [200 ms 800 ms] and in the seconds range [1 - 4 seconds]. The PD group showed poorer performance only in the millisecond estimation task. For the interval production task, the parkinsonian subjects produced higher coefficient of variation values for total variance irrespective of range tested [target inter-tap intervals of 550 ms and 2. 25 s]. The use of verbal suppression/no-suppression {{had little or no}} influence on these findings. Separate clock and motor-delay variance was estimated using the Wing and Kristofferson [1973] model. Analysis of the subset of subjects whose data did not violate the model's assumptions produced a group difference on this task but indicated that both clock and motor deficits, irrespective of range would be found if larger sample sizes are used. Coefficients of variation were higher in the <b>seconds</b> <b>tapping</b> task for both the PD and the control subjects.
