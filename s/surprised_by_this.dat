5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E
5|$|The {{first pick}} in Toronto Raptors' history was Damon Stoudamire, {{a point guard}} from the University of Arizona, who was the seventh overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. People in the crowd were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> pick because they {{expected}} the Raptors to pick Ed O'Bannon from UCLA. In their second pick of the same draft, Fab Five member Jimmy King from Michigan was drafted in the second round. The Raptors won the first overall pick in 1996, {{but they had to}} give that up due to the expansion agreement with the league. Chris Bosh was selected by the Raptors as the fourth pick overall in the 2003 NBA draft, and he went on to play in three all-star games, while starting in two. Andrea Bargnani, who was selected by the Raptors with the first overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft, became the first European to be picked first overall in the NBA draft.|$|E
25|$|The {{first issue}} {{contained}} a supposed editorial done by del Pilar, which, in fact, {{was done by}} Jacinto himself. It also included Bonifacio's Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa, Valenzuela's Catuiran? and several works that exposed Spanish abuses and promoted patriotism. Copies spread to nearby Manila provinces, including Cavite, Morong (now Rizal), Kalookan, and Malabon. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> initial success, Jacinto decided to print a second issue that would contain nothing but his works.|$|E

[...] However, her nomination was delayed. A report by the United States House Committee on Homeland Security ruled that Myers led a [...] "coordinated effort to conceal" [...] her role in the scandal.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly John sprang {{in at the}} Roman, {{throwing}} {{himself with}} all his force against him. He partially warded, with his sword, the blow which the Roman struck {{at him as he}} came in; but his weapon was beaten down, and the Roman blade cut through his thick headdress. But the impetus of his spring was sufficient. The Roman, taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> sudden attack, tottered, and then fell with a crash, John falling on the top of him.|$|R
50|$|On 5 October 1863, the Military Tribunal of Potenza {{condemned}} him {{to seven}} years in prison because his lawyer had asked for a reduced sentence because of his collaboration with the establishment. On 1 March 1864, he received permission from the prefect to leave prison, Caruso, along with De Vico, captain of the Carabinieri of Potenza, seized Crocco and other brigands <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> <b>By</b> <b>this</b> time, the ex brigand killed two colleagues, and took a third to a military prison in Rionero.|$|R
25|$|The {{nature of}} the India-Pakistan {{conflict}} took a more sinister turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear warheads were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear brinkmanship, even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a White House official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In a May 2000 article, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj claimed that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, but could not back up this claim with any official proof.|$|E
25|$|The main {{character}} {{returns to the}} Realm of the Almighty, finding that Corvus has changed it into a dark and twisted world known as the Realm of the Mighty. Confronting Corvus, he/she eats one of the fyggs and becomes a mortal in order to fight back against the fallen angel. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this,</b> Corvus sends Barbarus to attack the {{main character}}, but he/she manages to best the dragon {{and goes on to}} fight and defeat Corvus. After the battle, Serena arrives and explains her intentions to Corvus, managing to redeem him. The two then disappear and the Realm of the Almighty is returned to its former state.|$|E
25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was pointed down, the ground returns produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an artificial horizon, one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having been <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect and should have been predicted.|$|E
60|$|Taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> sudden demand, {{which was}} {{fortunately}} {{at the moment}} backed up by two ships of the squadron which had hitherto taken no part in the action being seen sailing in, the governor, after a hasty consultation with his officers, resolved to surrender, and two minutes afterwards the Danish flag was hauled down in the fort and the white flag run up. One of the Danish officers was directed to return with Harry to the ship to notify {{the captain of the}} surrender of the fort.|$|R

25|$|In 1926 the Commonwealth Government {{ordered a}} {{seaplane}} tender, , and the RAAF {{was instructed to}} provide an air wing for the ship once she was completed; the service had not received any warning that the ship was to be ordered, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> decision. At this time No. 101 Flight's Seagull IIIs were the only RAAF aircraft which were potentially suitable for being operated from a seaplane tender, though Albatross designers were not informed of this. In the absence of advice from the RAAF, they designed a ship capable of operating nine Fairey IIIs which fortunately had similar dimensions {{to those of the}} Seagull III. In January 1928 the Cabinet decided to not form a RAN fleet air arm, and directed that the RAAF would provide the pilots and maintenance personnel for Albatrosss air wing while the RAN would contribute observers and radio operators for the aircraft. When embarked, Albatross air wing would come under the control of her captain.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 November, the {{reinforcements}} and the loyal members of the 26th and 62nd Regiments moved into position. They secretly surrounded the sepoy camp ground and a final message {{was sent to the}} mutineers, demanding that they lay down arms before any discussion on grievances but it is said that only ten minutes were offered to make up their minds. The sepoys either hesitated or rejected the ultimatum and Paget ordered two cannons to fire on the rebels, followed by an attack from the rear by the secretly placed horse artillery. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> sudden assault, the sepoys tried to flee {{but the rest of the}} British regiments attacked from all directions. Some of the sepoys jumped into the Hooghly River to escape and drowned, others entered local households for shelter but the loyalists chased them in and killed them with bayonets. Many bystanders, including women and children who happened to be in the neighbourhood, were killed during the operation. Afterwards, it was found that the muskets of the Indian sepoys were not loaded. Stevenson concludes that this implies no violence was intended by the rebels.|$|E
500|$|Reacting to {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to Odd Girl Out that she was shocked {{to find out that}} her characters were not only remembered but that they were archetypes among the lesbian community. The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and LGBT studies college courses. Bannon often admits to being <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this,</b> explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing Odd Girl Out: [...] "If I had known, it might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that would have been so cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{following}} {{the course of}} the river, for a few miles, we met the stream, buried low in the earth, at one of its sudden bends, and, descending a sharp declivity, crossed to its left bank, and into the Canton of Zurich. We were taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> sudden rencontre, and could hardly believe it was the mighty Rhine, whose dark waters were hurrying beneath us, as we passed a covered bridge of merely a hundred or two feet in length. One meets with a hundred streams equal to this in width, while travelling in America, though it is rare to find one anywhere with the same majesty of motion, and of its fine cerulean tint.|$|R
60|$|To the astonishment {{of every}} one, Bridget {{appeared}} in the council, and announced her determination to remain behind, while her husband carried the ship to her owners. She saw and felt, {{the nature of his}} duty, and could consent to his performing it to the letter. Mark was quite taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> heroic and conscientious act in his young wife, and he had a great struggle with himself on the subject of leaving her behind him. Heaton, however, was so very prudent, and the present relations with their neighbours--neighbours four hundred miles distant--were so amicable, the whole matter was so serious, and the duty so obvious, that he finally acquiesced, without suffering his doubts to be seen.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} five o'clock when Pakenham, {{with the third}} division, fell like a {{thunderbolt}} upon the head of Maucune's troops. These, taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> attack, {{on the part of}} an enemy whom they had thought to see in full flight, yet fought gallantly, and strove to gain time to open out into order of battle. Bearing onwards, however, with irresistible force, the third division broke the head of the column, and drove it back upon its supports. Meanwhile, the battle raged all along the line; in the plain the fourth division carried the village of Arapiles, and drove back Bonnet's division with the bayonet, and the fifth division attacked Maucune's command in flank, while Pakenham was destroying its front.|$|R
500|$|In {{water tank}} testing, {{engineers}} subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately {{called to the}} scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open at {{a corner of the}} forward left escape hatch cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. [...] Based on these findings, Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, said he was not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this,</b> noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte {{is the second}} original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this,</b> as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that {{were not able to}} be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but {{he said that he had}} no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a [...] "Key-like story", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a trial-and-error process to work out what kind of setting and story would work well for an anime series.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{received}} {{another call}} from General Shelton in July 1999 {{in which he}} was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this,</b> because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was told that this was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston {{was not going to be}} appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation [...] "didn't wash"; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston's reassignment, although David Halberstam wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.|$|E

Prescot is taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> turn and wonders why Vomanus would be interested in Delia after knowing how much Prescot loved her. Prescot starts to plan to run away with Delia, either to Zenicce or the Eye of the World. Instead however, Prescot is summoned to follow the emperor and Delia to Vindelka. On the way he is delayed by storms and upon arrival finds out that the Emperor's party had been attacked. He accidentally runs into Inch, who has been captured and enslaved by a Vallians ship, and Prescot frees him. Warned by Vomanus, the emperor and Delia have escaped to a place called the Dragon's Bones, and Prescot follows them while sending Inch to the Blue Mountains to organise help.|$|R
500|$|After the Grand Prix, Schumacher's Benetton and Coulthard's Williams {{cars were}} [...] {{from the race}} {{classification}} {{as a result of}} the illegal fuel sample [...] "fingerprints", and Berger declared the new victor. Further samples of both cars' fuel were taken after the race; these also did not match the specified sample. Patrick Head was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> outcome as he believed that [...] "there was no question of disqualification until the fuel samples had been returned to Europe for further analysis". In addition to Benetton and Williams, fuel samples were taken from the Ferrari (Agip) and McLaren (Mobil) cars during the event, all of which were declared legal after FIA analysis. After an appeal was made by the two teams, the drivers were reinstated into the race classification at the hearing on April 13 (after the Argentine Grand Prix had taken place); however, the teams did not receive Constructors' points. The two teams were fined a further $200,000 during the hearing. It was generally agreed that the illegal fuel did not offer a performance advantage or break any of the regulations relating to chemical composition, only that it did not precisely match the sample that had previously been lodged with the FIA. Niki Lauda, an advisor to Ferrari, was not happy with the decision made at the appeal: ...|$|E

Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|While the ROK 7th Infantry Division {{was being}} annihilated at Tokchon by the PVA 38th Corps, the ROK 8th Infantry Division was also being routed, at Yongwon by the PVA 42nd Corps.

At 1 p.m. on November 25, the ROK 16th Infantry Regiment to the ROK 8th Infantry Division's rear spotted the two Chinese divisions at Maengsan, [...] {{south of the}} Yongwon. [...] <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> development, the ROK 8th Infantry Division ordered the 16th Infantry Regiment to block the Chinese advance while the ROK 10th and 21st Infantry Regiment were retreating from Yongwon. [...] But before the order could be carried out, the Chinese struck first after learning their trap had been discovered. As the ROK 10th and 21st Infantry Regiment were retreating from Yongwon {{early in the morning}} of November 26, the PVA 125th Division ambushed both ROK regiments, forcing the Koreans to abandon their heavy equipment and to scatter into the hills. Meanwhile, following the bonfires made by the Koreans for the cold weather, the PVA 124th Division overran a battalion from the ROK 16th Infantry Regiment and attacked the ROK 8th Infantry Division's command post at Maengsan. With the entire division dispersed, the ROK 8th Infantry Division headquarters and the ROK 16th Infantry Regiment broke out of Maengsan on November 27 and retreated from the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
500|$|Sasuke has {{ranked among}} the top five Naruto {{characters}} in every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll of the series. Though Sasuke's rank initially alternated between the third and fourth spot, he has twice come first. Several items of Sasuke merchandise have been released, including plush toys with his Part I and Part II appearances, key chains, and numerous figurines. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Sasuke and Sarada's images. NTT customers voted him their fifth favorite black haired male anime character in 2014. IGN also listed him as the seventh best Naruto character when the series ended in 2014. In a Japanese pollsters' Charapedia poll, Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry won first place. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted the 13th [...] "Best Guy". In developing the fighting game , CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama stated his favorite fight in making the series was the one between Sasuke and Itachi. In an interview of Mezamashi TV, Kishimoto was given questions by Nogizaka46's band member Rina Ikoma who was cosplaying as Sasuke; Kishimoto complimented Ikoma's cosplay. At New York's 2015 Comic-Con, stage moderator Christopher Butcher and editor Jo Otsuki discussed Sasuke's great popularity, noting that he became the series' most popular character. Otsuki admitted Sasuke was his own favorite character in the series. Butcher was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> <b>this</b> given Sasuke's pessimistic worldview and its contrast to Naruto's more positive outlook. Butcher wondered whether readers found Sasuke a more relatable character after the defeat of his worldview by Naruto's in the series finale. Otsuki thought that fans found Sasuke's character and abilities cooler than his rival, and given the similarities between these two characters and the series' happy ending, he thought Sasuke found a more positive worldview by the end. Animation director Chengxi Huang considered the battle between Sasuke and Killer Bee as one of best ones he saw in anime.|$|E
