5|$|As Presley {{had refused}} to carry Jackson's children, Rowe offered {{to give birth to}} a child for the pop singer. Shortly after Presley and Jackson's separation, Rowe became {{pregnant}} but suffered a miscarriage in March 1996. The event devastated Rowe, who feared <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to have a baby. Jackson comforted and consoled Rowe throughout the ordeal, which remained hidden from the media and public.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

60|$|At {{the end of}} a {{week the}} {{sufferer}} was able to sit up, and soon recovered a large part of her native cheerfulness although it was evident to me that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>be</b> the woman of the ready hand. Her days of labor were over.|$|R

25|$|Many {{characters}} in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, {{and others are}} common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China princess lives in fear of breaking, because <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> as pretty even if repaired.|$|E
500|$|Ana Lucia was {{described}} by Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer as [...] "demanding", [...] "hostile" [...] and a [...] "bully". She called Ana Lucia a [...] "brooding, broken ex-cop" [...] with a [...] "perpetual scowl". McFarland described the character as someone with a [...] "take-charge nature", and an [...] "inability to be reasoned away from her dictatorial decisions". Anna Johns from AOL's TV Squad felt Ana Lucia is [...] "abrasive and lacking common sense or civility". C. K. Sample, also from TV Squad, thought Ana Lucia was [...] "angry", [...] "power mad" [...] and a [...] "total nut job". According to supervising producer Leonard Dick, [...] "Ana Lucia is somebody who {{does not want to}} be a victim. She was a victim once and she swore to herself <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a victim again". Rodriguez described the character as [...] "very intuitive", adding [...] "I like that the character is pretty much always aware and suspicious". She is [...] "street smart" [...] and has a [...] "speak-her-mind quality".|$|E
6000|$|Upon {{this she}} threw herself at her husband's feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of true repentance, vowing that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> more <b>be</b> disobedient. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have melted a rock, so {{beautiful}} and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock! ...|$|R

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E
500|$|Lynd visits Bond {{every day}} as he recuperates in hospital, and he {{gradually}} realises that he loves her; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers. One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements, which greatly distresses Lynd. The following morning, Bond finds that she has committed suicide. She leaves behind a note explaining {{that she had been}} working as an unwilling double agent for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. SMERSH had kidnapped her lover, a Polish Royal Air Force pilot, who had revealed information about her under torture; SMERSH then used that information to blackmail her into helping them undermine Bond's mission, including her own faked kidnapping. She had tried {{to start a new life}} with Bond, but upon seeing Gettler—a SMERSH agent—she realised that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> free of her tormentors, and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger. Bond informs his service of Lynd's duplicity, coldly telling his contact, [...] "The bitch is dead now." ...|$|E
500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
60|$|But Charlotte {{explained}} her purpose, and implored, {{and put her}} in {{mind that}} Mrs. Beckett was gone, and she had no protector; and Martha relented, told her that if she had minded her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>been</b> in the scrape at all, but agreed, not without satisfaction, to afford Mr. Delaford the society of his old acquaintance.|$|R

2500|$|Elena {{suffered}} a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. A medical specialist {{told her that}} her injury could be repaired through surgery. Her chances of ever again competing at the highest level would be negligible. In fact it could mean <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a gymnast again. Elena took plenty of rest and homeopathic treatments. Her resilience and spirit won through. [...] "When I was injured my coach believed in me and didn't give up on me. In my mind I knew I could still be on the team. I kept going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime between 1 and 14, {{her husband}} Paullus was {{executed}} as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt. [...] Livia plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them, according to some. This led to open {{compassion for the}} fallen family. In 29 AD, Julia died on the same island {{where she had been}} sent in exile twenty years earlier. Due to the adultery that Julia committed, Augustus stated in his will that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> buried in Rome. She was survived by a daughter, possibly a son, and by several grandchildren.|$|E

Determined to continue the feud with Mark, Nick starts making threats to Mark's pregnant girlfriend Lisa and soon causes the death of Ashley after sabotaging the brakes on Mark's motorbike, only for Ashley to steal and crash it. Following Ashley's death, Dot overhears an argument between Nick and Mark and realises that Nick had tampered with the brakes on Mark's motorbike. After Ashley's funeral, Dot banishes Nick from her life and tells him to leave and never return, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to forgive him.|$|E

In response, Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement, citing that he and Love [...] "have a contract". In a later interview, Erlandson explained how [...] " [...] management convinced me that it was all hot air and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to finish her album.

2500|$|Aldrete {{spoke to}} the press in 2003 and denied her {{participation}} in Kilroy's murder and in the cult killings. She stated {{that it was impossible}} for investigators to understand what had happened at Santa Elena because the biggest evidence in the case, Constanzo, was dead. Aldrete also stated that the police hid the names of famous people involved with Constanzo for their own convenience. She concluded by stating that she believed in God and was not going to ask society for forgiveness because she was innocent of the crimes. The following year, Aldrete interviewed with the press again and stated that she had been tortured to confess. She said she had been stripped naked, blindfolded, beaten upside down, and then had her toenails yanked. Aldrete claimed she was beaten so severely that doctors told her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to have children.|$|E

[...] She also cited the Superstar, Nora Aunor as her inspiration, but she admitted she doesn't want to be compared with Aunor who originally showcased Domingo's latest theater role, Bona. She also cited the Philippines Star For All Season, Vilma Santos {{as one of her}} idols. She also parodied some of the famous dialogues and looks of Santos in various films such as D' Lucky Ones. Domingo also announced admiration for the Philippine actress, Maricel Soriano who is dubbed as [...] "The Diamond Star". She likes how she handled her career and all the issues being thrown at her and she was impressed by her class and elegance.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1893, Thérèse, {{having been}} a professed novice for the {{standard}} three years, {{asked not to be}} promoted but to continue a novice indefinitely. As a novice she would always have to ask permission of the other, full sisters. [...] <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> elected to any position of importance. Remaining closely associated with the other novices, she could continue to care for her spiritual charges. In 1841 Jules Michelet devoted the major part of the fifth volume of his History of France to a favourable presentation of the epic of Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans. Felix Dupanloup worked relentlessly for the glorification of Joan who, on 8 May 1429 had liberated Orléans, the city of which he became bishop in 1849. Thérèse wrote two plays in honour of her childhood heroine, the first about Joan's response to the heavenly voices calling her to battle, the second about her resulting martyrdom.|$|E
2500|$|In 1820, George became {{king of the}} United Kingdom and Hanover. [...] George hated her, vowed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> the queen, {{and insisted}} on a divorce, which she refused. A legal divorce was {{possible}} but difficult to obtain. Caroline returned to Britain to assert her position as queen. She was wildly popular with the British populace, who sympathized with her and who [...] despised the new king for his immoral behaviour. On {{the basis of the}} loose evidence collected against her, George attempted to divorce her by introducing the Pains and Penalties Bill to Parliament, but George and the bill were so unpopular, and Caroline so popular with the masses, that it was withdrawn by the Tory government. In July 1821, Caroline was barred from the coronation on the orders of her husband. She fell ill in London and died three weeks later; her funeral procession passed through London on its way to her native Brunswick, where she was buried.|$|E
