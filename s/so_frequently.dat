5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, {{although}} some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

5|$|The Paperboys {{routinely}} {{sell out}} shows {{in some of}} the most popular and prestigious clubs and festivals throughout Canada, the United States, Mexico and Europe. One of their most notable appearances was being asked to perform at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. In Canada, The Paperboys appeared at almost every folk festival across the country, including Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto. They have also played festivals across the United States, including New York’s Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, The Folk Alliance Festival, the New England Folk Festival and Seattle’s Bumbershoot. The Paperboys have also performed at other music festivals, including Toronto's Harbourfront, the Milwaukee Irish Fest, and Wintergrass. The band has been asked to return almost every year to several festivals across Europe, headlining at the United Kingdom's Warwick and Trowbridge festivals, as well as at festivals in Germany and Denmark. The band has also toured in Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Austria. According to Landa, their European travels are some of their most successful and popular performances, explaining why they travel to Europe <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> for long musical tours.|$|E

25|$|An additional, albeit not <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> used {{technique}} is the modifier addition method. This technique {{relies on the}} use of an extractant/solvent/modifier system. The additional modifier is supposed to enhance the penetration of the extractant into the particle pores. The solvent is subsequently evaporated, leaving extractant and modifier in the particle pores.|$|E

25|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{are common}} as well, especially skinks and geckos. Crocodiles were once common, {{but have been}} <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> hunted for their hides that they are nearly extinct. There are several venomous sea snakes and two species of venomous land snakes, in the elapid family. There are also numerous species of frogs of various sizes.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Heyman of The New York Times {{warned that}} Wildwood {{might be too}} violent for some readers, having many of the horrors <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> found in Decemberists songs, {{including}} battles when people and animals die by musket and cannon fire, sword blows, and falling, and references to torture, {{and the threat of}} the blood sacrifice of a baby at the book's climax.|$|E
25|$|The main defences are {{entered a}} little farther on in the same line, through a {{projecting}} two-story building which has some fireplaces with very simple and late mouldings. The buildings are of the local basalt, and the masonry is rough rubble; there are, as is <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> the case, no very clear indications for dating the different parts, which were in all probability erected at different times.|$|E

25|$|The itacistic error occurs very frequently, much {{often than}} in Codex Alexandrinus, and almost <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> as in Codex Bezae, {{but they are}} unequally {{distributed}} over the {{different parts of the}} manuscript. The change ι into ει is not so perpetual as in these two manuscripts. There is no iota adscriptum or iota subscriptum in the codex. N ephelkystikon occurs almost constantly. According to Scrivener the grammatical forms of the manuscript usually are considered as Alexandrian.|$|E
25|$|A war {{was not in}} {{the best}} {{interest}} of business, because New York had strong ties to the Deep South, both through the port of New York and manufacture of cotton goods in upstate textile mills. Half of New York City's exports were related to cotton before the war. Southern businessmen <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> traveled to the city that they established favorite hotels and restaurants. Trade was based on moving Southern goods. The city's large Democrat community feared the impact of Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 and the mayor urged secession of New York.|$|E
25|$|Laramie {{was named}} for Jacques LaRamie, a French or French-Canadian trapper who {{disappeared}} in the Laramie Mountains in the late 1810s and was never heard from again. He {{was one of the}} first Europeans to visit the area. European-American settlers named a river, mountain range, peak, US Army fort, county, and city for him. More Wyoming landmarks are named for him than for any other trapper but Jim Bridger. Because the name was used <b>so</b> <b>frequently,</b> the town was called Laramie City for decades to distinguish it from other uses.|$|E
25|$|Mullins's {{interest}} in Saint Francis of Assisi {{led to an}} attraction to Roman Catholicism in his final years. There was no daily Protestant service on the Navajo reservation, <b>so</b> Mullins <b>frequently</b> attended daily Mass. He never converted, and there is dispute over his intentions.|$|R
60|$|Weston met her gaze, {{and there}} was a grave forcefulness in his manner which almost {{astonished}} her. He evidently for once had suffered his usual self-restraint to relax, and she felt it was almost a pity that he had not done <b>so</b> more <b>frequently.</b>|$|R

Spectral {{response}} range {{similar to}} the Sb-Cs photocathode, but with higher sensitivity and lower dark current than Sb-Cs. They have sensitivity well matched to the most common scintillator materials and <b>so</b> are <b>frequently</b> used for ionizing radiation measurement in scintillation counters.|$|R
25|$|From O gauge's {{beginnings}} {{up until}} the mid-1970s, the various manufacturers' trackside accessories would interoperate with one another, but the train cars themselves used couplers of differing designs, often making it difficult or impossible to use different manufacturers' cars together. The post-War consolidation did little to improve matters: Marx used three different standards, {{depending on the product}} line, and Lionel used two, <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> the companies' own entry-level products were incompatible with their high-end products, let alone with the competition. Hobbyists who wanted differing standards to interoperate had to resort to replacing couplers.|$|E
25|$|And {{thus the}} {{hypothesis}} that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, {{a right to be}} considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis <b>so</b> <b>frequently,</b> that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of Abiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
50|$|Since a {{young age}} Aoba {{always wanted to be}} a police officer, and she takes her job of {{protecting}} the school very seriously, helping students resolve problems no matter how small they are.

25|$|The {{majority}} of Gautier's career was spent writing a weekly column of theatrical criticism. Because Gautier wrote <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> on plays, {{he began to}} consider {{the nature of the}} plays and developed the criteria by which they should be judged. He suggested that the normal five acts of a play could be reduced to three: an exposition, a , and a dénouement. Having abandoned the idea that tragedy is the superior genre, Gautier was willing to accept comedy as the equal of tragedy. Taking it a step further, he suggested that the nature of the theatrical effect should be in favour of creating fantasy rather than portraying reality because realistic theatre was undesirable.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the fame}} of the St. Francis {{was because of}} its legendary chef, Victor Hirtzler. Hirtzler learned to cook in Strasbourg, France, and then cooked for royal courts across Europe. According to Hirtzler, he had created a dish for King Carlos I of Portugal, called La Mousse Faisan Lucullus, a mousse of Bavarian pheasant's breast and {{woodcock}} flavored with truffles, with a sauce of cognac, Madeira and champagne. The dish was so expensive, and the King ate it <b>so</b> <b>frequently,</b> that he bankrupted Portugal twice and was assassinated in 1908, followed by the downfall of Portuguese monarchy in 1910. Victor moved to New York, became the Chef of the Waldorf Hotel, and then was persuaded by {{the manager of the}} St. Francis, James Woods, to move to San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Wessels {{decided to}} switch to cricket, even though the rules of Grey College did not allow him to play {{at such a young}} age. With the help of Johan Volsteedt (who was the first team captain), Wessels was allowed to {{participate}} in the net practices and soon cricket became his main activity during summer. During winter, he played tennis, at which he won <b>so</b> <b>frequently</b> that, by 1973, he was the number 1 under-16 player in South Africa and was offered a scholarship of $25 000 over four years from the University of Houston. However, {{due to the fact that}} he played as an under-16 against adults, Wessels began to lose regularly in senior tournaments. After a dramatic loss during the Griqualand West Open in Kimberley – after which he cut all the strings from his racket in the changing room – Wessels turned down the offer from Houston and decided to focus all his attention on cricket.|$|E
