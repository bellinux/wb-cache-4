40|$|While {{the present}} {{generation}} of serology-based assays has significantly decreased {{the number of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections acquired by transfusion, the possibility of infected donations escaping detection still exists. The average seronegative viremic window duration during which immunological assays are unable to detect the virus {{is estimated to be}} between 16 and 22 days for HIV- 1 and approximately 70 days for HCV. Significant reduction of detection window duration was demonstrated using a nucleic acid amplification assay, the Procleix HIV- 1 /HCV Assay, which utilizes transcription-mediated amplification technology to simultaneously detect HIV- 1 and HCV RNAs. For 26 commercially available HIV- 1 <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> tested, specimens were reactive in the HIV- 1 /HCV assay {{at the same time as}} or earlier than in serological assays. Overall, the HIV- 1 /HCV assay was able to reduce the detection window duration by an average of 14 days and 6 days compared to tests relying on recognition of HIV- 1 antibody and p 24 antigen, respectively. For 24 commercially available HCV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> tested, the specimens were reactive in the HIV- 1 /HCV assay at an earlier blood sampling date than in serological assays, reducing the detection window duration by an average of 26 days. Similar results were obtained in testing the HIV- 1 and HCV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> in the virus-specific HIV- 1 - and HCV-discriminatory assays, respectively. In conclusion, the HIV- 1 /HCV assay and corresponding discriminatory assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{window period}} in {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection {{is still a}} major problem in ensuring blood safety. HCV RNA detection by nucleic acid amplification technology-based tests has contributed to reduce the infectivity of blood products, but it is expensive, time-consuming and affected by a high prevalence of false-positive results. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the performance of a newly developed enzyme immunoassay for the detection of HCV core antigen and its suitability for use in the screening of blood units in order to identify infecting samples that do not contain specific antibodies. For evaluation of laboratory performance, different samples were selected: to evaluate specificity, we tested 2, 586 sera from blood donors, 500 general population samples, and 58 "difficult sera". All samples were tested by two screening assays, and results were negative. To estimate clinical sensitivity, 103 HCV RNA-positive, anti-HCV-negative samples, 6 natural <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels,</b> and 9 commercial <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> were tested. Intra- and interassay precision were determined on two HCV-RNA-positive, anti-HCV-negative sera. Seventeen (0. 66 %) blood donor samples, 2 (0. 4 %) general population samples, and 2 (3. 44 %) difficult sera were initially reactive; 3 sera were positive on repetition. These 21 samples tested by reverse transcription-PCR were negative. The clinical sensitivity calculated with <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> and seroconverted patient samples was very similar to PCR sensitivity: 95 % of PCR-positive, antibody-negative samples contained detectable HCV antigen. Data on intra- and interassay precision showed dispersion indices with values of less than 10 %. In conclusion, the HCV antigen assay showed high sensitivity and specificity and could become a useful means of improving the safety of blood and blood products...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a new automated analyzer for the processing and interpretation of the RIBA Strip Immunoblot Assay (SIA), used in the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, was evaluated. Laboratory {{performance of}} the RIBA SIA was {{compared with that of}} two manually processed supplementary anti-HCV tests (RIBA HCV 3. 0 SIA and INNO-LIA HCV Antibody III). Specificity of the automated processing of SIA was 100 % for 90 selected anti-HCV-negative samples. On the other hand, 119 of 120 (99. 2 %) previously confirmed anti-HCV-positive samples were also positive when assayed on the automated processor. Results for all specimens except one (51 of 52) were concordant for manual and automated RIBA, while 15 of 68 sera tested with automated RIBA and the INNO-LIA assay showed different patterns of reactivity. Three HCV sensitivity <b>panels</b> and one <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panel</b> were also compared. The results show a high sensitivity for SIA NS 3 - and NS 5 -encoded antigens. Moreover, data obtained for the anti-HCV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panel</b> and for samples with borderline or discordant anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results suggest that bands with a relative intensity of > 0. 5 on the automated analyzer (theoretically negative) should be evaluated with care. Coefficients of variability ranged from 9 to 14. 8 % in an interassay reproducibility study. Overall, the performance of the automated analysis of SIA is comparable to that of the manual RIBA assay. The new automated processor for SIA bands proved to be sensitive and specific. Its use makes the optical scoring of bands unnecessary by indicating relative intensity values, which could be particularly useful in the follow-up care of anti-HCV-positive patients receiving antiviral therapy...|$|R

40|$|Three {{automated}} assays (Abbott AxSYM, Bayer ADVIA Centaur, and bioMerieux VIDAS) {{used for}} the detection of rubella virus-specific immunoglobulin M were evaluated. A total of 57 samples from individuals with evidence of infection with rubella virus were used to estimate sensitivity, and 220 samples from blood donors and individuals attending an antenatal clinic who had no evidence of recent infection were used to estimate specificity. <b>Seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> comprising an additional 31 samples from four individuals were used to determine clinical sensitivity. Samples containing potentially cross-reacting substances were also tested. The sensitivities of the three assays ranged from 84. 2 to 96. 5 %, and the specificities ranged from 96. 8 to 99. 9 %. The Abbott AxSYM assay detected more reactive samples than the other two assays when a panel of 57 positive samples was tested.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic liver disease and liver cancer, and remains a large health care burden to the world. In this study we {{developed}} a DNA microarray test to detect HCV RNA and a protein microarray to detect human anti-HCV antibodies on a single platform. A main focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate possibilities to reduce the assay time, as a short time-to-result (TTR) is a prerequisite for a point-of-care test. Significantly reducing hybridisation and washing times did not impair the assay performance. This was confirmed first using artificial targets and subsequently using clinical samples from an HCV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panel</b> derived from a HCV-infected patient. We were able to reduce the time required for the detection of human anti-HCV antibodies to only 14 min, achieving nanomolar sensitivity. The protein microarray exhibited an analytical sensitivity comparable to that of commercial systems. Similar results were obtained with the DNA microarray using a universal probe which covered all different HCV genotypes. It was possible to reduce the assay time after PCR from 150 min to 16 min without any loss of sensitivity. Taken together, these results constitute a significant step forward in the design of rapid, microarray-based diagnostics for human infectious disease, and show that the protein microarray is currently the most favourable candidate to fill this role...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} a double-antigen sandwich recombinant enzyme immunoassay (EIA; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) and compared it with that of a synthetic-peptide-based EIA (Biochem Immunosystems, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) for the detection of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV- 1) and HIV- 2 antibodies in 2, 321 clinical serum samples. The results of both EIA methods and Western blot (immunoblot) were in agreement for 1, 046 HIV- 1 and 10 HIV- 2 specimens from a panel of known positives. From a prospective panel of 1, 085 specimens, 38 proved to be positive by both EIAs and Western blot, 3 were positive by the recombinant EIA only, and 9 were positive by the peptide EIA only, for calculated specificities of 99. 71 and 99. 04 %, respectively. Of 180 specimens from a <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panel</b> collected from 77 patients, the results for 170 were in agreement by all antibody testing methods and 10 were found to be repeat reactive for HIV antibodies by the recombinant EIA only. All 10 were initial specimens of seroconverting patients; 7 were also reactive for HIV p 24 antigen. An examination of four of these sera by radioimmunoprecipitation assay showed gp 120 and gp 160 bands in each. Analysis of the anti-Env antibody class in three of these samples showed that one consisted of immunoglobulin M (IgM) only and two contained both IgG and IgM antibodies. Although both EIA procedures were sensitive and specific in the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 and both were capable of detecting early antibodies, the recombinant assay was more sensitive for antibody detection during early seroconversion...|$|R
40|$|Assays that detect p 24 antigen {{reduce the}} {{diagnostic}} window period of HIV testing. Most point-of-care HIV assays have poor sensitivity to diagnose acute HIV infection as they only detect antibodies against HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 (HIV- 1 / 2). This was a cross-sectional laboratory-based study that evaluated {{the performance of}} the DetermineTM HIV- 1 / 2 Ag/Ab Combo fourth generation rapid strip – currently the only rapid assay that detects both HIV- 1 / 2 antibodies and p 24 antigen. A total of 79 serum specimens (29 positive for HIV antibodies only, 14 positive for HIV antibodies and p 24 antigen, 20 HIV-negative, and 16 positive for p 24 antigen only) were used for the evaluation. Results were compared with those from validated fourth generation HIV ELISAs. The DetermineTM Combo rapid strips had a sensitivity of 90. 7 % and a specificity of 100 % for the detection of HIV- 1 / 2 antibodies. Its sensitivity for the detection of p 24 antigen was only 10 % (3 out of 30 p 24 antigen positive specimens). This implies that most acute HIV infections will be missed with this assay. The need for a point-of-care assay which can detect acute HIV infection reliably still remains, particularly for use in a high prevalence setting such as South Africa.

40|$|Diagnosis of {{hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) is usually determined serologically by detection {{of the presence}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies or rising anti-HEV IgG titers. However, serological assays have demonstrated a significant variation in their sensitivities and specificities. In this study, we present the systematic comparison of different immunological anti-HEV assays using complete <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> of 10 virologically confirmed HEV genotype 3 infected individuals. Assay sensitivities were further evaluated by testing serially diluted World Health Organization (WHO) reference reagent for hepatitis E virus antibody and one patient sample infected with HEV genotype 3. Anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibody presence was determined using the immunological assays Wantai HEV IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands), recomWell HEV IgM/IgG (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany), HEV IgM ELISA 3. 0, HEV ELISA, HEV ELISA 4. 0, Assure HEV IgM Rapid Test (all MP Biomedicals Europe, Illkirch Cedex, France) and Anti-HEV ELISA (IgM/IgG, Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). The assays showed differences regarding their analytical and diagnostic sensitivities, with anti-HEV IgM assays (n = 5) being more divergent compared to anti-HEV IgG (n = 4) assays in this study. Considerable variations were observed particularly for the detection period of IgM antibodies.

40|$|Simple {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) tests may facilitate ascertainment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in settings with high endemicity but limited infrastructure. We evaluated two rapid HBsAg tests and characterized HBV coinfection in a Ghanaian HIV-positive cohort. Samples from 838 patients were {{tested by the}} rapid assays Determine and Vikia and the reference assays Architect, Murex version 3, and Liaison Ultra. The assays were also evaluated using the 2 nd International Standard, a <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panel,</b> and two mutant panels. HBsAg-positive samples underwent HBV DNA quantification by real-time PCR and surface and polymerase gene population sequencing. Overall, 140 / 838 patients (16. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval, 14. 2 to 19. 2 %) were HBsAg positive, and of these, 103 / 140 (73. 6 %) were e-antigen negative and 118 / 140 (84. 3 %) showed an HBV DNA level of > 14 IU/ml (median, 8, 279 IU/ml). Assay sensitivities and specificities were as follows: Architect, 97. 9 and 99. 6 %; Liaison, 97. 1 and 99. 4 %; Murex, 98. 6 and 99. 3 %; Determine, 69. 3 and 100 %; and Vikia, 70. 7 and 100 %.

By the improved immunoassays, p 24 antigen and antibody IgG to p 17 antigen were detected earlier in 32 and 53 %, respectively, of the HIV- 1 <b>seroconversion</b> serum <b>panels</b> tested than before the improvements, and p 24 antigen was detected as early as or earlier than HIV- 1 RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in all of the panels tested.

The diagnostic window was reduced with VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra by 3. 82 days, on average, in comparison with the fourth-generation assay with the lowest sensitivity of the antigen detection module. HIV- 1 infection was detected 5. 88 days earlier than with third-generation EIA. The mean time delay between reverse transcription-PCR and VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra was only 2. 31 days. The specificity of fourth-generation assays after retesting ranged between 98. 1 and 100 %. In conclusion, VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra can replace single-antigen screening for laboratory diagnosis and screening of HIV infection in blood donors. There was no evidence for a second diagnostic window due to impaired sensitivity of the antibody detection module of all the fourth-generation EIAs evaluated in the present study. The specificity after initial and/or repeated testing of VIDAS HIV DUO Ultra was equivalent to that of a third-generation assay...|$|E
40|$|Point-of-care tests {{provide a}} {{plausible}} diagnostic strategy for hepatitis C infection in economically impoverished areas. However, their utility {{depends upon the}} overall performance of individual tests. A literature search was conducted using the metasearch engine Mettā, a query interface for retrieving articles from five leading medical databases. Studies were included if they employed point-of-care tests to detect antibodies of hepatitis C virus and compared the results with reference tests. Two reviewers performed a quality assessment of the studies and extracted data for estimating test accuracy. Thirty studies that had evaluated 30 tests fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood-ratio, negative likelihood-ratio and diagnostic odds ratio for all tests were 97. 4 % (95 % CI: 95. 9 - 98. 4), 99. 5 % (99. 2 - 99. 7), 80. 17 (55. 35 - 116. 14), 0. 03 (0. 02 - 0. 04), and 3032. 85 (1595. 86 - 5763. 78), respectively. This suggested a high pooled accuracy for all studies. We found substantial heterogeneity between studies, {{but none of the}} subgroups investigated could account for the heterogeneity. Genotype diversity of HCV had no or minimal influence on test performance. Of the seven tests evaluated in the meta-regression model, OraQuick had the highest test sensitivity and specificity and showed better performance than a third generation enzyme immunoassay in <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> The next highest test sensitivities and specificities were from TriDot and SDBioline, followed by Genedia and Chembio. The Spot and Multiplo tests produced poor test sensitivities but high test specificities. Nine of the remaining 23 tests produced poor test sensitivities and specificities and/or showed poor performances in <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels,</b> while 14 tests had high test performances with diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 590. 70 to 28822. 20. Performances varied widely among individual point-of-care tests for diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection. Physicians should consider this while using specific tests in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{detection}} of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) {{is an important}} aid in the diagnosis of patients infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). A multi-center {{study was conducted to}} characterize the performance of the HBsAg assay on the family of Access immunoassay systems from Beckman Coulter. METHODS: The Access HBsAg assay was characterized in a multi-center study and compared to the Abbott AxSYM* and PRISM* HBsAg assays. The bioMérieux VIDAS* assay was used to resolve discrepant results. Reproducibility studies (intra-assay, inter-assay and inter-lot) were performed with pooled serum samples (negative sample, close to cut off, low, medium and high positive samples). Analytical sensitivity, subtype and genotype detection were studied with various commercial panels (SFTS panel, WHO 80 / 549, WHO 00 / 588, Teragenix HBV Genotype panel). A panel of recombinant HBsAg mutant proteins was tested to investigate reactivity towards genetic mutations. Clinical sensitivity was verified with <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> and samples from subjects with known HBV infection. Analytical specificity was studied with samples from patients with potential cross-reactive infections. Clinical specificity was validated among blood donors and a hospitalized population. RESULTS: The imprecision was < 10 %. Analytical sensitivity was < or = 0. 1 ng/mL (SFTS panel), 0. 020 PEI Units/mL (ad panel), 0. 024 PEI Units/mL (ay panel), 0. 092 IU/mL with WHO 80 / 549 and 0. 056 IU/mL with WHO 00 / 588. All genotype samples and HBsAg mutants were reactive with the Access HBsAg assay. <b>Seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> tested showed no significant difference with the reference method. Sensitivity for subjects with known HBV infection was 100 %. No interference with potentially cross-reactive infections was observed after confirmatory testing. Specificity was 99. 96 % (100 % after confirmatory testing) in a blood donor population and 99. 5 % (100 % after confirmatory testing) in a hospitalized population. Excellent separation of positive and negative populations was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Access HBsAg and HBsAg Confirmatory assays meet all clinical and analytical performance requirements of assays for the {{detection of}} HBsAg...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Accurate {{determination}} of the infectious window period (IWP) that remains with individual-donation (ID) or minipool (MP) NAT compared to those with serology assays is essential for residual risk estimations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:The relative sensitivity of the Procleix Tigris system (Gen-Probe/Chiron) used in ID-NAT format and cobas s 201 (Roche Molecular Systems) applied in 1 : 6 diluted samples to mimic six-minipool (MP 6) nucleic acid test (NAT) was assessed by quadruplicate testing of five <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> per marker. A mathematical analysis based on the log-linear increase of viremia in the ramp-up phase, as established with bDNA 3. 0 assays enabled estimation of the IWP for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) assays. RESULTS:The mean IWPs were Tigris HIV RNA 5. 5 days, s 201 (1 : 6) HIV RNA 7. 4 days, GenScreen Plus p 24 /anti-HIV 17. 8 days, PRISM anti-HIV 19. 0 days, Tigris HBV DNA 20. 6 days, s 201 (1 : 6) HBV DNA 22. 6 days, Bio-Rad hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 37. 8 days, and PRISM HBsAg 35. 5 days. At estimated 50 percent NAT seroconversion rates, s 201 (1 : 6) and Tigris showed mean window-period reduction times (WPRTs) of 30. 5 to 35. 5 days to hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) assays, 10. 4 to 13. 5 days to anti-HIV, or combination p 24 /anti-HIV assays and 12. 8 to 17. 2 days to HBsAg assays. CONCLUSIONS:Tigris ID-NAT detected HIV RNA 2 days earlier than s 201 MP 6 -NAT, but the difference in sensitivity between the two NAT systems was not significant in HBV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> Insufficient seroconversion samples were available for reliable modeling of WPRT in early HCV infection, but 1. 4 to 2. 0 days could be predicted by translating analytical sensitivity data. Both multiplex NAT systems demonstrate significant WPRTs compared to (combined) antigen and antibody assays...|$|E
40|$|Recently, 4 th {{generation}} assays {{that permit}} the combined detection of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) p 24 antigen (Ag) and anti-HIV antibody (Ab) were introduced on the international market.

Up to now, no data had been available on the sensitivity of this new generation of assays for detection of HIV- 1 non-B subtype primary infection.

40|$|AbstractMapping and {{possible}} diagnostic {{meaning of a}} highly conserved, linear NS 4 epitope (NS 4 / 3), located outside the C 100 - 3 antigen within the carboxyl terminal proportion of the NS 4 region, with major immunoreactivity with specimens of patients with HCV infection from various geographic origins is described. Transient, acute-phase IgM anti-HCV NS 4 / 3 was detected coincidentally or earlier than active IgG anti-HCV NS 4 / 3 response with four well-characterized <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> GenBank alignment studies identified patch homologies between the NS 4 / 3 sequence {{and a number of}} non-HCV proteins, which may explain part of the cross-reactivity of the NS 4 / 3 epitope. Some of the “false positive reactivities” of the NS 4 / 3 epitope with asymptomatic blood donors, not being confirmed with FDA-approved anti-HCV assays without the NS 4 / 3 epitope, may be explained by recognition of very early seroconversion antibodies...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop an ELISA system for the {{antibody}} detection of HIV- 1 or HIV- 2 infections, MAPs for HIV- 1 gp 41 (584 - 618) and HIV- 2 gp 36 (574 - 602) corresponding to the immunodominant regions of HIV- 1 gp 41 and HIV- 2 gp 36 were used as coating antigens in the ELISA. The MAPs were synthesized by the solid phase method using Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc) -OH and their molecular weights were confirmed by tricine gel electrophoresis. The MAPs reacted with all HIV positive sera (64 samples), but did not react with HIV negative sera (48 samples) obtained from healthy blood donors. The MAPs showed high sensitivity and specificity in anti-HIV 1 / 2 combo panel and anti-HIV- 1 <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} ELISA system using synthetic MAPs of gp 41 (584 - 618) and gp 36 (574 - 602) as coating antigens can be used as an analytical system for the immunodiagnosis of HIV- 1 or HIV- 2 infections. ope...|$|E
40|$|Fourth-generation assays for the {{simultaneous}} detection of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) antigen and antibody that were available on the international market until now have antigen detection modules with relatively poor sensitivity and produce {{a higher rate of}} false-positive results than third-generation enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). The new Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA with an improved sensitivity for HIV p 24 antigen was compared to alternative fourth- and third-generation assays, the p 24 antigen test, and HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 94 <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> (n = 709 sera), samples from the acute phase of infection after seroconversion (n = 32), anti-HIV- 1 -positive specimens (n = 730) from patients in different stages of the disease, 462 subtyped samples from different geographical locations, anti-HIV- 2 -positive sera (n = 302), dilutions of cell culture supernatants (n = 62) from cells infected with different HIV- 1 subtypes, selected performance panels from Boston Biomedica Inc., 7, 579 unselected samples from blood donors, 303 unselected daily routine samples, 997 specimens from hospitalized patients, and potentially interfering samples (n = 1, 222) were tested with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA. The new assay showed a sensitivity comparable to that of the Abbott HIV- 1 AG Monoclonal A for early detection of HIV infection in <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> The mean time delay of Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA (last negative sample plus 1 day) in comparison to that for HIV- 1 RT-PCR for 87 panels tested with both methods was 2. 75 days. The diagnostic window was reduced with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA by between 3. 6 and 5. 7 days from that for third-generation assays. The specificities of Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA in blood donors were 99. 84 and 99. 85 % (after repeated testing). Overall, 30 repeatedly reactive false-positive results out of 10, 031 HIV-negative samples were obtained with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA. Our results show that a fourth-generation assay with improved specificity such as Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA is suitable for blood donor screening because of its low number of false positives and because it detects HIV p 24 antigen with a sensitivity comparable to that of single-antigen assays...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} simple and rapid tests for infectious diseases, we have devised a test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and HIV- 2 which resembles many contemporary strip-style pregnancy tests in format and ease of use. The test was evaluated with 2, 928 serum specimens (1, 541 reactive and 1, 387 nonreactive) collected and tested at a Mexico City hospital clinic and was compared with a laboratory assay (Abbott) performed simultaneously. The sensitivity and specificity of the test using these serum specimens were 99. 68 and 99. 71 %, respectively (before the code of the blinded study was broken). This compares with 100 % sensitivity and 97. 55 % specificity with the laboratory assay (specificity upon reassay after the code was broken, 99. 21 %). In a survey of HIV- 2 specimens, reactive (positive) specimens were detected in 51 of 51 cases.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) needlestick studies, the time to se-roconversion for anti-HIV antibodies is 1 – 9 months (mean, ∼ 2 – 3 months). However, an earlier marker of an immune response to HIV often occurs—serum anti-HIV antibodies reactive with live HIV-infected cells, termed “early HIV antibodies. ” The specificities of these anti-bodies are characterized by the recognition of type-specific conformational epitopes of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp) 160 and gp 41. By use of a third-generation native HIVIIIB gp 160 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), detection of HIV antibodies occurred, on average, 33 days earlier than did detection by commercial EIA and 25 days earlier than did detection by the reference antigen and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in 3 of 5 HIV <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels.</b> A fourth panel possessed early HIV antibodies that reacted with HIV 213 but not with HIVIIIB, allowing for detection of HIV antibodies ∼ 3 weeks earlier than by RT-PCR or other current tests.

40|$|Cloning and {{expression}} of hepatitis C virus {{have allowed the}} development of immunoassays to detect hepatitis C virus infection. However, currently available recombinant fusion protein C 100 - 3 assays, based on a nonstructural protein of the virus, are limited in sensitivity, particularly for detecting acute infection. In this report <b>seroconversion</b> <b>panels</b> showed that an assay based on synthetic peptides, derived from immunodominant regions of both capsid and nonstructural proteins, accelerated hepatitis C virus antibody detection by 4 - 10 weeks. In screening, this enzyme immunoassay increased detection from 47 % to 64 % in plasmapheresis donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (greater than 100 international units per liter), from 15 % to 24 % in anti-hepatitis B core antigen-positive blood donors, and from 28 % to 42 % in renal dialysis patients when compared with nonstructural peptide-based assays. The screening assay was repeatedly reactive for 27 of 2902 volunteer blood donor samples (0. 93 %); four sera reacted only with the capsid antigen.
