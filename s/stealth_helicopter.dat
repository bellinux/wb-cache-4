The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E

Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on a parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before injuring himself when his car lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead.

50|$|<b>Stealth</b> <b>helicopters</b> are <b>helicopters</b> that {{incorporate}} <b>stealth</b> technology to avoid detection. Helicopters {{are in many}} ways less suitable for stealth technology than airplanes are, because of the noise generated by their rotor blades, which also give off a strong radar signature. In recent years, designs for blades have emerged that can significantly reduce noise, which is a major issue for clandestine use of helicopters. A raid on the compound of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 utilized {{what appeared to be}} two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks, heavily modified for quieter operations and employing stealth technology to be less visible to radar.|$|R

Michael Herr, Dispatches Blades thumping rhythmically, the Bell UH- 1 “Huey ” Iroquois helicopter, oneof the many war craft {{carrying}} America into 1960 s Vietnam, flies across the abyss between the late mechanization of World War II and the current virtuality of cyberwar in transparent battlespace. The gas-turbine-powered Huey turboshaft rotor marks an event in early-postmodern war, as America once again finds itself both through and in high technology. The rotor that turned lazily during the early days of battle in Vietnam is now running at full throttle, holding aloft the Boeing Sikorsky RAH- 66 Comanche <b>stealth</b> <b>helicopter</b> as it flies backward, banks verti-cally, and slips sideways, sliding fluidly through the battlefield of C 4 I 2 (command, control, communication, computing, intelligence, and interoperability).

The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|R

While detailed postwar analysis showed that early reports about weapons effectiveness were overstated, precision guidance was a significant force multiplier. An unexpected force multiplier was GPS, which let Coalition soldiers go off-road and move through the desert as ships moved through the seas, where Iraqis stayed on roads for ease of navigation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} low-attitude and {{relatively}} low-speed fight profiles, helicopters {{are subjected to}} serious threats from radio, infrared (IR), visual, and aural detection and tracking. Among these threats, infrared detection and tracking are regarded as more crucial for the survivability of helicopters. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of infrared stealth, several different types of infrared suppressor (IRS) for helicopters have been developed. This paper reviews contemporary developments in this discipline, with particular emphasis on infrared signature suppression, advances in mixer-ejectors and prediction for helicopters. In addition, several remaining challenges, such as advanced IRS, emissivity optimization technique, helicopter infrared characterization, etc., are proposed, as an initial guide and stimulation for future research. In the future, the comprehensive infrared suppression in the 3 – 5 μm and 8 – 14 μm bands will doubtfully become the emphasis of <b>helicopter</b> <b>stealth.</b> Multidisciplinary optimization of a complete infrared suppression system deserves further investigation...|$|R
5000|$|Brian and {{the rest}} of the crew return to the U.S. and live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, but misses the old life he once enjoyed. Meanwhile, Dom learns from his sister, Mia, that she is {{pregnant}} again, but fears to tell Brian because of his longing for missing the bullets. However, their house is destroyed by Deckard Shaw, brother to Owen Shaw, who has come out of hiding for vengeance, which forces Brian, Roman, Tej, Letty and Dom to go after him. Before leaving, Brian makes a promise to Mia that after Shaw is dealt with, he will dedicate himself to his family. To rescue Ramsey, a hacker who has a device known as 'God's Eye' that can locate anyone on Earth, the team airdrops their cars over the Caucasus Mountains and ambush Jakande's convoy and rescue Ramsey, finding out that she is a young woman. They then head to Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye. The team break into his penthouse and manage to steal the flash drive. On the both occasions, the team is pursued by Shaw, who engages in combat with Dom, with the team barely managing to escape. With God's Eye, the team manages to track down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian and Mr. Nobody, along with a covert ops unit, attempt to capture Shaw but are ambushed by Jakande and Jakande's militants, who have allied with Deckard. After the ambush, Nobody's men are killed and Nobody is injured, though he manages to escape with Toretto and Brian, while Jakande obtains God's Eye. Nobody warns Brian and Dom that Jakande will use God's Eye to hunt down Ramsey, who is the only one who can destroy it. They drive off, leaving Nobody behind to be evacuated by one of his 'stand-by' helicopters. Left with no other choice, the team return to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men on their home turf. Dom plans to confront Shaw alone while Brian {{and the rest}} of the crew prepare to deal with Jakande. Just as they are preparing, Brian calls Mia and professes his love, fearing he may not survive, and learns that she is pregnant with a baby girl, motivating him to come back alive. While Jakande pursues Brian {{and the rest of}} the crew with a <b>stealth</b> attack <b>helicopter</b> and a UAV, using God's Eye to track down Ramsey, they barely survive and manage to shut down God's Eye with Brian's help to establish a connection for Ramsey to hack it. In the aftermath, Hobbs kills Jakande by shooting the bag of grenades that Dom managed to throw inside the helicopter, while also taking out the UAV. Deckard is defeated by Dom and imprisoned. Finally at peace, the team celebrate at the beach. While Brian and Mia play with their son, Dom, Letty, Ramsey, Roman and Tej observe, appreciating their happiness and acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. Dom silently leaves, not wanting to disturb the happy moment and drives off. Brian notices and manages to catch up to him, asking Dom [...] "You thought you could leave without saying goodbye?" [...] As he pulls up beside Dom's car in his white Toyota Supra (A reference of how the first movie ended). They look at each other and smile, then bid each other farewell as Brian turns off the main road, and Dom continues on ahead.|$|R
