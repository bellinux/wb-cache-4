50|$|Duplex spacing is the {{separation}} between the uplink channel and the corresponding downlink channel. A larger separation implies less likelihood of <b>self-interference</b> between a handset transmitter and its own receiver. Because a power amplifier out of band response {{is related to the}} bandwidth, the duplex separation requirement is also dependent on the carrier bandwidth {{in order to protect the}} receiver from <b>self-interference.</b> A duplex spacing of 30 MHz is sufficient to support carrier bandwidths of up to 10 MHz.

50|$|The highly {{interconnected}} wireless ad hoc network {{increases the}} flexibility of wireless networking {{at the cost of}} increased multi-user interference. To improve the interference immunity, PHY/MAC-layer protocols have evolved from competition based to cooperative based transmission and reception. Cooperative wireless communications can actually exploit interference, which includes <b>self-interference</b> and other user interference. In cooperative wireless communications, each node might use <b>self-interference</b> and other user interference to improve the performance of data encoding and decoding, whereas conventional nodes are generally directed to avoid the interference. For example, once strong interference is decodable, a node decodes and cancels the strong interference before decoding the self-signal. The mitigation of low Carrier over Interference (CoI) ratios can be implemented across PHY/MAC/Application network layers in cooperative systems.|$|E

50|$|Some {{experiments}} display {{both the}} wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, {{such as the}} <b>self-interference</b> of a single photon.

50|$|These {{studies have}} found that, in {{addition}} to the standard uncertainty of localization due to the point spread function fitting, <b>self-interference</b> with light scattered by nanoparticles can lead to distortions or displacements of the imaged point spread functions, complicating the analysis of such measurements.

50|$|SFN {{transmission}} {{can be considered}} as a severe form of multipath propagation. The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as <b>self-interference)</b> may result in fading. This is problematic especially in wideband communication and high-data rate digital communications, since the fading in that case is frequency-selective (as opposed to flat fading), and since the time spreading of the echoes may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). Fading and ISI can be avoided by means of diversity schemes and equalization filters.|$|E

It is the result of <b>self-interference</b> of the wave function during its interaction with reflecting boundaries. For example, in the infinite potential well, after the spread of the initially localized Gaussian wave packet {{in the center of the}} well, various pieces of the wave function start to overlap and interfere with each other after reflection from the boundaries. The geometry of a quantum carpet is mainly determined by the quantum fractional revivals.|$|E
50|$|In {{wideband}} digital broadcasting, <b>self-interference</b> cancellation is {{facilitated by}} the OFDM or COFDM modulation method. OFDM uses {{a large number of}} slow low-bandwidth modulators instead of one fast wide-band modulator. Each modulator has its own frequency sub-channel and sub-carrier frequency. Since each modulator is very slow, we can afford to insert a guard interval between the symbols, and thus eliminate the ISI. Although the fading is frequency-selective over the whole frequency channel, it can be considered as flat within the narrowband sub-channel. Thus, advanced equalization filters can be avoided. A forward error correction code (FEC) can counteract that a certain portion of the sub-carriers are exposed to too much fading to be correctly demodulated.|$|E

This arrangement is designed to illustrate the effect of mutual Black interferences: for example, consider what happens after the key if Black plays 1...Bf7. White now mates with 2.Qf5#, a move which is only possible because the bishop Black moved has {{got in the way of}} the rook's guard of f5 - this is known as a <b>self-interference.</b> Similarly, if Black tries 1...Rf7, this interferes with the bishop's guard of d5, allowing White to mate with Nd5#. Mutual interferences like this, between two pieces on one square, are known as Grimshaw interferences. The theme this problem exhibits is precisely such Grimshaw interferences.|$|E
50|$|Digital audio {{broadcasting}} standards {{may provide}} terrestrial or satellite radio service. Digital radio broadcasting systems are typically designed for handheld mobile devices, just like mobile-TV systems, but {{as opposed to}} other digital TV systems which typically require a fixed directional antenna. Some digital radio systems provide in-band on-channel (IBOC) solutions that may coexist with or simulcast with analog AM or FM transmissions, while others are designed for designated radio frequency bands. The latter allows one wideband radio signal to carry a multiplex consisting of several radio-channels of variable bitrate as well as data services {{and other forms of}} media. Some digital broadcasting systems allow single-frequency network (SFN), where all terrestrial transmitters in a region sending the same multiplex of radio programs may use the same frequency channel without <b>self-interference</b> problems, further improving the system spectral efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Together with KFKI colleagues, {{he carried}} out a famous low-intensity {{interference}} experiment, a quantum-mechanical process in which low-intensity photon beams interfere with themselves—although the experiments originally sought to refute this possibility. These interference results involving {{a small number of}} photons are significant for appreciating the quantum nature of light. The measurements he carried out in connection with the dual character of light (<b>self-interference</b> of few photons) supplied results that were expected on the basis of quantum mechanics; yet, due to the requirements of extremely high accuracy, measurements of this kind had not been carried out before Jánossy. Spurred by this famous photon experiment, Schrödinger was quick to write a letter, in which he emphasized the importance of the result. In both the measurement of cosmic radiation and the low intensity interference experiment, precision of the correct results is of fundamental importance, which justified Jánossy's interest in the statistical evaluation of measurements.|$|E
50|$|The eMBMS {{service can}} offer many more TV {{programs}} {{in a specific}} radio frequency spectrum as compared to traditional terrestrial TV broadcasting, since {{it is based on}} the principles of Interactive Multicast, where TV content only is transmitted in where there currently are viewers. The eMBMS service also provides better system spectral efficiency than video-on-demand over traditional cellular unicasting services, since in eMBMS, each TV program is only transmitted once in each cell, even if there are several viewers of that program in the same cell. The MBSFN transmission mode further improves the spectral efficiency, since {{it is based on the}} principles of Dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN). This implies that it dynamically forms single-frequency networks (SFNs), i.e. groups of adjacent base stations that send the same signal simultaneously on the same frequency sub-carriers, when there are mobile TV viewers of the same TV program content in the adjacent cells. The LTE OFDMA downlink modulation and multiple access scheme eliminates <b>self-interference</b> caused by the SFN:s. Efficient TV transmission using similar combinations of Interactive multicast (IP Multicast) and DSFN has also been suggested for the DVB-T2 and DVB-H systems.|$|E

Since the interference cancellation is a challenging {{problem and the}} number of <b>self-interference</b> cancellation is often related to the wireless network capacity, the residual <b>self-interference</b> has negative effects on the network capacity. Although previous results generally assumed that <b>self-interference</b> can be completely eliminated, in the realistic applications, the <b>self-interference</b> only can be eliminated to the level of noise in the best case. In this paper, we will describe the residual <b>self-interference</b> as a constant fraction of the transmission power P, that is RSI=gP, where g is a constant fraction [21] and P is transmission power of all transmitting nodes.|$|E

The power of the <b>self-interference</b> signal can be orders of magnitude larger than any external signal of interest, and full-duplex systems must therefore implement <b>self-interference</b> suppression [2].

40|$|We {{present an}} experiment-based {{characterization}} of passive suppression and active <b>self-interference</b> cancellation mechanisms in full-duplex wireless communication systems. In particular, we consider passive suppression due to antenna separation {{at the same}} node, and active cancellation in analog and/or digital domain. First, we show that the average amount of cancellation increases for active cancellation techniques as the received <b>self-interference</b> power increases. Our characterization of the average cancellation {{as a function of}} the <b>self-interference</b> power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any active cancellation is applied), the rate of a full-duplex link increases as the <b>self-interference</b> power increases. Second, we show that applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the <b>self-interference,</b> and thus digital cancellation is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values. Third, we complete our study of the impact of <b>self-interference</b> cancellation mechanisms by characterizing the probability distribution of the <b>self-interference</b> channel before and after cancellation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the analysis of}} oscillator phase-noise effects on the <b>self-interference</b> cancellation capability of full-duplex direct-conversion radio transceivers. Closed-form so-lutions are derived for {{the power of the}} residual <b>self-interference</b> stemming from phase noise in two alternative cases of having either independent oscillators or the same oscillator at the transmitter and receiver chains of the full-duplex transceiver. The results show that phase noise has a severe effect on <b>self-interference</b> cancellation in both of the considered cases, and that by using the common oscillator in upconversion and downconversion results in clearly lower residual <b>self-interference</b> levels. The results also show that it is in general vital to use high quality oscillators in full-duplex transceivers, or have some means for phase noise estimation and mitigation in order to suppress its effects. One of the main findings is that in practical scenarios the subcarrier-wise phase-noise spread of the multipath components of the <b>self-interference</b> channel causes most of the residual phase-noise effect when high amounts of <b>self-interference</b> cancellation is desired.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the main}} {{bottlenecks}} in practical full-duplex systems is the oscillator phase noise, which bounds the possible cancellable <b>self-interference</b> power. In this paper, a digital-domain <b>self-interference</b> cancellation scheme for full-duplex or-thogonal frequency division multiplexing systems is proposed. The proposed scheme increases the amount of cancellable <b>self-interference</b> power by suppressing the effect of both transmitter and receiver oscillator phase noise. The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, an estimation phase and a cancellation phase. In the estimation phase, the {{minimum mean square error}} estimator is used to jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver phase noise associated with the incoming <b>self-interference</b> signal. In the cancellation phase, the estimated phase noise is used to suppress the intercarrier interference caused by the phase noise associated with the incoming <b>self-interference</b> signal.
