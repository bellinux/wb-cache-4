5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States. In United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5|$|To {{enforce the}} Reconstruction Amendments, Congress passed the Enforcement Acts in the 1870s. The Acts criminalized the {{obstruction}} of a citizen's voting rights and provided for federal {{supervision of the}} electoral process, including voter registration. However, in 1875 the Supreme Court struck down parts of the legislation as unconstitutional in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Cruikshank and United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Reese. After the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877, enforcement of these laws became erratic, and in 1894, Congress repealed most of their provisions.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In Grady v.

500|$|Following his {{admission}} to the North Carolina bar, Kuykendall commenced practicing law in Greensboro, where he practiced for {{a little over a}} year before returning to West Virginia. Kuykendall established his law practice in Romney and made his permanent residence there. Kuykendall argued his first case before the Hampshire County Circuit Court in defense of a Mr.Miller, who had been charged with petit larceny. Kuykendall secured the acquittal of his client, which further encouraged the young lawyer. Following this case, Kuykendall continued to perform as a criminal defense lawyer. According to historian James Morton Callahan, Kuykendall [...] "adhered to his rule to take part only on the side of the defense, and he has a merited reputation or skill and ability in that particular field." [...] By 1923, Kuykendall had been a defense attorney in three murder cases: <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Hetrick, <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Averell, and <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Gardner. Kuykendall secured acquittals for his clients in <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Hetrick and <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Averell, but in <b>State</b> <b>v.</b> Gardner, his client was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|R

A few hours before the statutory period was due to expire the next day, Congress extended it for 90 daysthe {{first of a series of}} such extensions. United <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Maine was stayed, pending the resolution of Passamaquoddy v. Morton.
