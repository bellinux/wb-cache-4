The arcs have the special feature that the high order non-linearities are fully compensated inside each arc, and therefore the dynamic aperture of the whole machine is conserved. We consider and compare two lattices with the same absolute value of transition energy: the current lattice with a negative momentum compaction factor in both arcs and correspondingly the lattice with negative and positive momentum compaction factors in different arcs. Simultaneously, we analyzed the 4 - and 6 - fold symmetry arc machine.

40|$|The {{influence}} of geometric properties and particle size on dynamic properties of fractal-like aggregates was {{studied in the}} mass and momentum-transfer transition regimes. Two different methodologies were investigated. The Collision Rate Method (CRM) that determines the <b>slip</b> correction <b>factor</b> through the ratio of two molecule-aggregate collision rates, and the Adjusted Sphere Method (ASM) that assumes {{the existence of a}} virtual, flow-independent adjusted sphere with the same <b>slip</b> correction <b>factor</b> as the aggregate over the entire transition regime. The fractal-like aggregates were generated via a cluster-cluster aggregation algorithm. The CRM was used to calculate the adjusted-sphere radius of different aggregates: it was found to be approximately constant for monomer Knudsen numbers greater than 0 : 5, suggesting that it is independent of flow conditions. Two numerical expressions are proposed: one for the aggregate orientationally averaged projected area, which is proportional to its squared free molecular mobility radius, and one for the adjusted-sphere radius. Both expressions depend on geometric, non-ensemble averaged quantities: the radius of gyration and the number of monomers. The <b>slip</b> correction <b>factor</b> and the mobility radius of DLCA and RLCA aggregates were calculated using the ASM; for a given number of monomers, fractal dimension and prefactor, and Knudsen number their values were approximately constant. A fractal-like scaling law based on the mobility radius was found to hold. The corresponding mobility fractal dimension and prefactor were determined for different aggregates.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} impeller outlet relative flow exhibits two regions, across blade to blade pitch. A region of low relative velocity towards the suction surface called wake flow and {{a region of}} high relative velocity towards the pressure surface called jetflow are known to exist.

40|$|Riser {{operating}} modes {{are vital}} to designing a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor for a required process of either a gas-solid or a gas-catalytic nature. Different operating modes provide different solids' residence times and mixing behaviors, which define the reactions' efficiency and yield. The literature demonstrates distinct operating modes resulting from observed differences in <b>slip</b> <b>factors</b> {{and the range of}} particle velocities and their associated residence time distribution. The present research uses positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) in a riser of B-type bed material to determine the different operating modes by measuring (i) particle velocities and residence time distribution, (ii) population densities of these particles in the cross-sectional area of the riser, and (iii) solids flow pattern {{at the bottom of the}} riser. Data treatment defines four distinct solids hold-up regimes in the riser and proposes a "phase diagram" depicting the existence of the different operating modes (dilute, dense, core-annulus and combined) as a function of the superficial gas velocity and solids circulation flux in the riser. The delineated regimes have good agreement with available literature data and known industrial operations. Comparison with literature data for risers using A-type powders is also fair.

40|$|The {{velocity}} field inside a torque converter pump was studied for two separate effects: variable pump rotational speed and variable oil viscosity. Three-dimensional velocity measurements were taken using a laser velocimeter {{for both the}} pump mid- and exit planes. The effect ofvariable pump rotational speed was studied by running the pump at two different speeds and holding speed ratio (pump rotational speed]turbine rotational speed) constant. Similarly, the effect of viscosity on the pump flow field was studied by varying the temperature and]or using two different viscosity oils as the working fluid in the pump. Threedimensional velocity vector plots, through-flow contour plots, and secondary flow profiles were obtained for both pump planes and all test conditions. Results showed that torque converter mass flows increased approximately linearly with increasing pump rotational speed (and fixed speed ratio) but that the flow was not directly proportional to pump rotational speed. However, mass flows were seen to decrease as the oil viscosity was decreased with a resulting increased Reynolds number; for these conditions the high velocity regions were seen to decrease in size and low velocity regions were seen to increase in size.
