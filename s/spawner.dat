5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast <b>spawner.</b>|$|E
25|$|The western school whiting {{does not}} reach sexual {{maturity}} {{until the end}} of the first year of its life in deeper waters, while populations that inhabit nearshore waters don't fully reach maturity {{until the end of}} the second year. All male fish are mature by the time they reach 130mm in length and 160mm in female fish. The species spawns in deeper waters during a period between December and February, with a peak in early January. Anatomical evidence suggests S. vittata is a batch <b>spawner,</b> releasing eggs in batches over a period during the spawning months, possibly to buffer against adverse environmental factors. juveniles reside in protected inshore waters such as bays and mangrove swamps until they reach sexual maturity, when they move offshore to spawn. Western school whiting usually reach 2 years of age, with some individuals surviving up to 7 years, allowing each fish to spawn multiple times throughout its life. The species reaches 30cm at its maximum length.|$|E
25|$|The {{false scad}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} during {{its second year}} of life at a length of around 20cm in both sexes. The timing of spawning appears to vary slightly between locations, with {{a study in the}} Mediterranean indicating a period from June to August, while a study off Senegal found the period to be more protracted, occurring from April to November. Spawning occurs in shallow inshore waters, with the event occurring at an optimum water temperatures of 18.7 degrees Celsius. Studies on females between 29 and 35cm in length found each fish releases between 480,000 and 990,000 eggs, with the species a partial <b>spawner,</b> in which a proportion of the mature oocytes are not released from the ovary and are instead reabsorbed by the female. Larvae and juveniles remain in the shallow water environment, with growth quite rapid in the species. The newly hatched fish will reach a length of 12.2cm at age one year, 17.9cm at two, 22.3cm at three, and 29.7 at the age of five years.|$|E

25|$|The western school whiting, Sillago vittata (also {{known as}} the banded whiting, golden whiting and bastard whiting), is a species of benthic marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The species {{is one of three}} 'school whiting' that inhabit {{southern}} Australia and share a very similar appearance. Western school whiting are known to grow to 30cm in length and 275 g in weight, although unconfirmed reports suggest this might be an underestimate. The western school whiting is distributed along the Western Australian coast from Maud Landing in the north to Rottnest Island in the south. The species inhabits both shallow inshore environments and waters to depths of 55 m. The species is a benthic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms, and shows a change in diet with age and habitat. S. vittata is a multiple <b>spawner,</b> reproducing between December and February once it has reached one or two years of age. Juveniles inhabit protected inshore waters, moving offshore once they reach sexual maturity. It is often found in association with other sillaginids and comprises a minor fraction of commercial whiting catches in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is {{a strong}} predatory fish, with a diet dominated by fish and supplemented by cephalopods and crustaceans as an adult. Juveniles consume a higher amount of small crustaceans, but transfer to a more fish based diet as they grow. The species displays {{a wide array of}} hunting techniques ranging from aggressive midwater attacks, reef ambushes and foraging interactions with other larger species, snapping up any prey items missed by the larger animal. The bluefin trevally reproduces at different periods throughout its range, and reaches sexual maturity at 30–40cm in length and around 2 years of age. It is a multiple <b>spawner,</b> capable of reproducing up to 8 times per year, releasing up to 6 million eggs per year in captivity. Growth is well studied, with the fish reaching 194mm in its first year, 340mm in the second and 456mm in the third year. The bluefin trevally is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishermen. Commercial fisheries record up to 50 tonnes of the species taken per year in the west Indian Ocean, and around 700 lbs per year in Hawaii. The rapid decimation of the Hawaiian population due to overfishing has led to increased research in the aquaculture potential of the species, with spawning achieved in captivity. Despite its popularity as a table fish, many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species.|$|E

2500|$|Alternate male {{strategies}} {{which allow}} small males {{to engage in}} cuckoldry can develop in species where spawning is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of polyandry, and can occur with sneak spawners (sometimes called streak spawners). A sneak <b>spawner</b> is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair. A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing gametes at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation. Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, jack males are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into a redd (spawning nest) to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an evolutionarily stable strategy for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the [...] "standard" [...] strategy of large males.|$|E
2500|$|Yellowfin whiting reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} 200 mm in males and 230mm in females, {{with the majority of}} both sexes reaching this length by the end of their second year of life. The timing of spawning varies over the species range, a trait found {{in a number of other}} sillaginids. In the northernmost part of its range in Shark Bay, spawning occurs between August and December, while further south off southern Western Australia, spawning occurs between December and February. The South Australian population also spawns between December and February, with this event preceded by the movement of fish into shallow tidal and estuarine regions where spawning occurs. Ripe fish then break off the main schooling body to form smaller spawning schools, where the eggs are shed. There is conflicting data concerning the pattern of spawning in yellowfin whiting, with an earlier Shark Bay study finding the species to be a single <b>spawner,</b> [...] whilst recent studies in the south indicate they are multiple spawners. In South Australia, once spawning has occurred the fish disperse and move further offshore once again.|$|E
2500|$|... {{with one}} study Hawaii {{suggesting}} maturation occurs at {{a length of}} around 35cm on average. [...] There is also {{a difference in the}} length at maturation between the two sexes, with females on average reaching maturity at 32.5cm length, while males attain maturity at 35cm on average. Sex ratios in the species vary by location with population off east Africa being skewed towards males (M:F = 1.68:1), while in Hawaii the opposite is true with the M:F ratio being 1:1.48. The period of the year over which spawning occurs is also variable by location, with African fish reproducing between September and March while in Hawaii this occurs between April and November, with a peak in May to July. Natural spawning behaviour in the species has never been observed, although large aggregations of bluefin trevally observed in Palau consisting of over 1000 fish are believed to be for the purpose of spawning. Extensive studies on the species in captivity has revealed the species to be a multiple <b>spawner,</b> capable of spawning at least 8 times a year, and up to twice in 5 days. Spawning events are often clustered in a few consecutive or alternate days, usually in the third or fourth lunar phases. Spawning apparently occurs at night to minimise predation on eggs. Fecundity in the natural environment has been reported to range from around 50 000 to [...] 4 270 000, with larger individuals releasing more eggs. Studies in captive fish show females may produce over 6 000 000 eggs per year. These eggs are pelagic and spherical, with diameters between 0.72 and 0.79mm.|$|E

40|$|While fishery {{closures}} {{during the}} <b>spawning</b> season are commonplace, direct evidence for their benefit is mainly restricted to species forming large <b>spawning</b> aggregations. This paper analyses {{the conditions under}} which <b>spawning</b> closures could contribute to sustainable fisheries management by reviewing how fishing during <b>spawning</b> may affect the physiology, behaviour and ecology of individuals and how this may influence the dynamics and the genetics of the population. We distinguish between the effects of fishing activities in relation to mortality, disturbance of <b>spawning</b> activity, and impact on <b>spawning</b> habitat. <b>Spawning</b> closures may be of benefit it they: (1) reduce the fishing mortality of the large and older spawners; (2) avoid negative effects on <b>spawning</b> habitats; (3) reduce the risk of over-exploitation in species which form large <b>spawning</b> aggregations; (4) reduce the evolutionary effects on maturation and reproductive investment; and (5) reduce the risk of over-exploitation of specific <b>spawning</b> components. The contribution of <b>spawning</b> closures to sustainable fisheries will differ among species and depends on the complexity of the <b>spawning</b> system, the level of aggregation during <b>spawning</b> and the vulnerability of the <b>spawning</b> habitat. The importance of these closures depends on the degree of population depletion but does not cease when populations are ‘healthy’ (i. e. no sign that recruitment is impaired) ...|$|R

2500|$|Spawning {{occurs during}} the daytime. There is {{indication}} that the female drinks the sperm and that fertilization takes place after the sperm has passed through her digestive tract. The male and female form the [...] "T-position", where the female places its mouth over the male's genital opening and collects the sperm in the mouth. The female rests at the bottom for 3060seconds, and then swims to the nest, turns upside down, and lays the eggs in the nest. H. littorale is a multiple <b>spawner.</b> Investing in reproduction is high in females since they can spawn up to 14 times during a 7month breeding season and each spawn consists of 6,0009,000 eggs. On average, two to four females spawn simultaneously, resulting in an average number of 20,000 eggs per nest. The adhesive eggs {{are located in the}} centre of the nest under the plant debris above the surface of the water, and not in contact with the oxygen-depleted swamp water. The male guards the nest during incubation; incubation of the eggs takes two to three days depending on the temperature in the nest. The male also regularly supplies foam to the nest. Guarding and maintenance of the nest occurs day and night. Once spawning has been completed, the male attacks females that have deposited their eggs in the nest. Despite intense predation pressure on eggs and larvae, the male's guarding behavior extends for only one or two days after hatching. The male attacks with its large pectoral spines erect; the attack consists of rapid propulsion towards its target followed by a sharp lateral turn, which causes the rough outer edge of pectoral spine to drag across the target and cause abrasion.|$|E
