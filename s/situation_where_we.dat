Cornell approached Wood's former bandmates, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament—who were still {{figuring out how to}} continue without Mother Love Bone—with the intention of releasing the songs as a single. Ament described the collaboration as [...] "a really good thing at the time" [...] for Gossard and him that put them into a [...] "band <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> could play and make music." [...] The band's lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready.

[...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just not fair to him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold.

500|$|After Wimp Sanderson {{was forced}} out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under {{consideration}} to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying [...] "It boiled down to us looking at a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now." [...] That summer Amaker {{was one of two}} college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O'Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} {{close to}} the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was [...] "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a [...] "junior partner" [...] whose only role would be [...] "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning {{part of the economy}} given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said [...] "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." [...] A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said {{to be aware of the}} risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, [...] "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> would be in but out of government." ...|$|E
60|$|Such are our sentiments on {{the duty}} and policy of {{conforming}} to the prejudices {{of a whole}} people, even where the foundation of such prejudices may be false or disputable. But permit us to lay at your Majesty's feet our deliberate judgment on the real merits of that principle, the violation {{of which is the}} known ground and origin of these troubles. We assure your Majesty, that, on our parts, we should think ourselves unjustifiable, as good citizens, and not influenced by the true spirit of Englishmen, if, with any effectual means of prevention in our hands, we were to submit to taxes to which we did not consent, either directly, or by a representation of the people securing to us the substantial benefit of an absolutely free disposition of our own property in that important case. And we add, Sir, that, if fortune, instead of blessing us with a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> may have daily access to the propitious presence of a gracious prince, had fixed us in settlements on the remotest part of the globe, we must carry these sentiments with us, as part of our being,--persuaded that the distance of situation would render this privilege in the disposal of property but the more necessary. If no provision had been made for it, such provision ought to be made or permitted. Abuses of subordinate authority increase, and all means of redress lessen, as the distance of the subject removes him from the seat of the supreme power. What, in those circumstances, can save him from the last extremes of indignity and oppression, but something left in his own hands which may enable him to conciliate the favor and control the excesses of government? When no means of power to awe or to oblige are possessed, the strongest ties which connect mankind in every relation, social and civil, and which teach them mutually to respect each other, are broken. Independency, from that moment, virtually exists. Its formal declaration will quickly follow. Such must be our feelings for ourselves: we are not in possession of another rule for our brethren.|$|E
