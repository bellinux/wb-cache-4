5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of offerings to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the queen. On the back wall, which lies to the west along the axis of the temple, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> out of the mountain: the goddess is depicted as the Mistress of the temple dedicated to her and to queen Nefertari, who is intimately linked to the goddess.|$|E

2500|$|String Quartet No. 2 (1968) {{consists}} of five movements. They differ widely {{from each other}} in their types of motion. In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in Aventures. In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from a distance, with great lyricism. The pizzicato third movement is another of Ligeti's machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes creates a [...] "granulated" [...] continuum. In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together. Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out. In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.|$|E
2500|$|Oldbuck {{functions}} in the novel as a comic foil to the down-to-earth realist Ochiltree, the gothically tragic Glenallan, and the absurdly self-important Wardour. [...] The most obvious aspect of his character is an obsessive devotion {{to the pursuit of}} antiquarianism. [...] He writes on castrametation, the science of ancient fortification, and contributes papers on learned subjects to journals; he argues heatedly with his friends over the nature of the Pictish language; he buys overpriced land purely for the pleasure of owning the site of a Roman camp and of the battle of Mons Graupius. [...] His devotion to his scholarship, and his celibacy, make him a modern equivalent of the monks of St. Ruth’s Priory, as he recognises himself. But this enthusiasm can lead him into self-delusion, as with his supposed Roman camp which was in fact built as a shelter by local peasants only twenty years before, partly because his approach to the past is not that of a scientific historian, deducing hypotheses from solid evidence, but that of an antiquary, forming opinions first and justifying them with whatever evidence comes to hand afterwards. [...] He also has a legal training, and believes strongly in its usefulness in all matters of business, but {{in the early stages of}} the novel both his antiquarian and his legal skills tend to be in practice of little use to him. [...] He is, like his author, a Stoic, but this philosophy is compromised by his Scottish materialism. [...] His rejection by Eveline Neville has left him with an marked lack of regard for “womankind”, but has not embittered him to the extent of drying up all capacity for human sympathy. [...] His futility as an agent in human affairs is only ended when he begins to feel for the troubles of others, and to listen and observe rather than acting on preconceived theories. [...] Then, as A. N. Wilson says, “Oldbuck’s stature as a man is measured by the depth of his sympathies, by his Christian charity”. [...] Though Oldbuck is in politics a Whig and a supporter of the French Revolution, yet at the novel's end when the Revolution <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> too close to home he finds himself to be a patriot ready to fight for his country.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR LADY TAYLOR,--I have to {{announce}} our great news. On June 15th we sail from San Francisco in the schooner yacht Casco, for a seven months' cruise in the South Seas. You can conceive what {{a state of}} excitement we are in; Lloyd perhaps first; {{but this is an}} old dream of mine which actually <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> true, and I am sun-struck. It seems indeed too good to be true; and that we have not deserved so much good fortune. From Skerryvore to the Galapagos is a far cry! And from poking in a sick-room all winter to the deck of one's own ship, is indeed a heavenly change.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. No it wouldnt. If you all sat in silence, as if {{you were}} waiting for {{something}} to happen, then there would be hope even if nothing did happen. But this eternal cackle, cackle, cackle about things in general is only fit for old, old, OLD people. I suppose it means something to them: theyve had their fling. All I listen for is some sign of it ending in something; but just when it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to a point, Johnny or papa just starts another hare; and it all begins over again; and I realize that it's never going to lead anywhere and never going to stop.

Of course, you can administer the push if you like; but, as I say, it will be {{by way of a}} confession that your scheme has sprung a leak.

What abundant cause we have for thankfulness! All the many hours that I spent in that atmosphere, and yet not a whit the worse for it. What a sight it was! What scenes of suffering! There {{seemed to be no}} end to it; and yet there was always strength for the immediate work in hand. Tending twenty-four sick, after hurrying back from burying two dear lads in one grave, or with a body lying in its white sheet in the chapel; and once, after a breathless watch of two hours, while they all slept the sleep of opium, for we dared almost anything to obtain some rest, stealing at dead of night across the room to the figure wrapped so strangely in its blanket, and finding it cold and stiff, while one dying lay close by.

"Sun being set, {{the drums}} in Bautzen sound TATTOO,--audible to {{listening}} Croats in the Environs;--beat TATTOO, and, {{later in the}} night, other passages of drum-music, also for Croat behoof (GENERAL-MARCH I think it is); indicating That we have started again, in pursuit of Daun. And in short, every precaution being taken to soothe the mind of Lacy and the Croats, Friedrich silently issues, with his best speed, in Three columns, by Three roads, towards Lacy's quarters, which go from that village of Godau westward, in a loose way, several miles. In three columns, by three routes, all to converge, with punctuality, on Lacy. Of the columns, two are of Infantry, the leftmost and the rightmost, on each hand, hidden as much as possible; one is of Cavalry in the middle. Coming on in this manner--like a pair of triple-pincers, which are to grip simultaneously on Lacy, and astonish him, if he keep quiet. But Lacy is vigilant, and is cautious almost in excess. Learning by his Pandours that the King <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> this way, Lacy gathers himself on the instant; quits Godau, by one in the morning; and retreats bodily, at his fastest step, to Bischofswerda again; nor by any means stops there."

6000|$|We cannot {{deny that}} the poetical view of any period is higher, and in the deepest sense truer, than all others; but we are thankful also for the penny-a-liner, whether ancient or modern, who {{reflects}} the whims and humors, the enthusiasms and weaknesses, of the public in unguarded moments. Is it so certain, after all, {{that we should not}} be interesting ourselves in other quite as nugatory matters if these were denied us? In one respect, and no unimportant one, the instantaneous dispersion of news and the universal interest in it have affected the national thought and character. The whole people have acquired a certain metropolitan temper; they feel everything at once and in common; a single pulse sends anger, grief, or triumph through the whole country; one man sitting at the keyboard of the telegraph in Washington sets the chords vibrating to the same tune from sea to sea; and this simultaneousness, this unanimity, deepens national consciousness and intensifies popular emotion. Every man feels himself a part, sensitive and sympathetic, of this vast organism, a partner in its life or death. The sentiment of patriotism is etherealized and ennobled by it, is kindled by the more or less conscious presence of an ideal element; and the instinctive love of a few familiar hills and fields widens, till Country is no longer an abstraction, but a living presence, felt in the heart and operative in the conscience, like that of an absent mother. It is no trifling matter that thirty millions of men should be thinking the same thought and feeling the same pang at a single moment of time, and that these vast parallels of latitude should become a neighborhood more intimate than many a country village. The dream of Human Brotherhood <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> true at last. The peasant who dipped his net in the Danube, or trapped the beaver on its banks, perhaps never heard of Caesar or of Caesar's murder; but the shot that shattered the forecasting brain, and curdled the warm, sweet heart of the most American of Americans, echoed along the wires through the length and breadth of a continent, swelling all eyes at once with tears of indignant sorrow. Here was a tragedy fulfilling the demands of Aristotle, and purifying with an instantaneous throb of pity and terror a theatre of such proportions as the world never saw. We doubt if history ever recorded an event so touching and awful as this sympathy, so wholly emancipated from the toils of space and time that it might seem as if earth were really sentient, as some have dreamed, or the great god Pan alive again to make the hearts of nations stand still with his shout. What is Beethoven's [...] "Funeral March for the Death of a Hero" [...] to the symphony of love, pity, and wrathful resolve which the telegraph of that April morning played on the pulses of a nation? ...|$|E
