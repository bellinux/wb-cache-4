Vanderweyde stated the <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> used in Crookes' experiment was unreliable as it was easy to manipulate by deception and suggested he should repeat the experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E
500|$|According to Barry Wiley {{during the}} board and <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> experiment, Home refused for Crookes to sit near {{him and he was}} {{occupied}} by writing notes. Wiley suspected Home used resin on his finger tips to tamper with the apparatus which managed to fool Crookes into believing a psychic force was being displayed. Regarding Crookes, the magician Harry Houdini wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Home was {{investigated}} by Crookes in a self-built laboratory {{at the rear}} of his house at Mornington Road, North London in 1871. No plans of the laboratory have been found and there is no contemporary description of it. Crookes wrote the board and <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> experiment was a success with Home and had proven [...] "beyond doubt" [...] the existence of a [...] "psychic force." [...] However, the experiment could be easily dismissed as the result of vibrations caused by the passage of Euston trains in the large railway cutting near his house in London. The experiment was not repeatable and sometimes failed to produce any phenomena. The experiment was rejected and ridiculed by the scientific community for lack of scientific controls. In the experiment Home refused for Crookes to be near him and would draw attention to something {{on the other side of}} the room, or make conversation for diversionary signals.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{is a fine}} spiral or helical {{torsion spring}} used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the balance wheel. The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> is an essential adjunct to the balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>balance</b> wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R
50|$|A {{sash window}} is the {{traditional}} style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts {{are not necessarily the}} same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a cottage window. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use <b>spring</b> <b>balances</b> to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes {{on either side of the}} window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of <b>spring</b> <b>balances</b> are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.|$|R
2500|$|Of great {{significance}} to those pioneers working toward powered flight, Hargrave successfully lifted {{himself off the}} ground under a train of four of his box kites at Stanwell Park Beach on 12 November 1894. Aided by James Swain, the caretaker at his property, the kite line was moored via a <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> to two sandbags (see image). Hargrave carried an anemometer and clinometer aloft to measure windspeed and {{the angle of the}} kite line. He rose 16 feet in a wind speed of 21mph. This experiment was widely reported and established the box kite as a stable aerial platform. Hargrave claimed that [...] "The particular steps gained are the demonstration that an extremely simple apparatus can be made, carried about, and flown by one man; and that a safe means of making an ascent with a flying machine, of trying the same without any risk of accident, and descending, is now at the service of any experimenter who wishes to use it." [...] This was seen by Abbott Lawrence Rotch of the meteorological observatory at Harvard University who constructed a kite from the particulars in Engineering. A modification was adopted by the weather bureau of the United States and the use of box-kites for meteorological observations became widespread. The principle was applied to gliders, and in October 1906 Alberto Santos-Dumont used the box-kite principle in his aeroplane to make his first flight. Until 1909 the box-kite aeroplane was the usual type in Europe.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} they {{took one of}} the pieces of stone, weighing, by a <b>spring</b> <b>balance,</b> twenty pounds, and with the flat plate and the crushing-hammer went to the stream. The rock was first broken with the sledge into pieces the size of a walnut. These were pulverized on the iron plate and the result carefully washed, and when the work was finished the gold was weighed in the miner's scales, and turned the four-ounce weight.|$|E
60|$|The beauty, the darling, the daisy, my Salmon Bahadur, weighed twelve pounds, and I {{had been}} seven-and-thirty minutes {{bringing}} him to bank! He had been lightly {{hooked on the}} angle of the right jaw, and the hook had not wearied him. That hour I sat among princes and crowned heads greater than them all. Below the bank we heard California scuffling with his salmon and swearing Spanish oaths. Portland and I assisted at the capture, and the fish dragged the <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> out by the roots. It was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds. We stretched the three fish on the grass--the eleven and a half, the twelve and fifteen pounder--and we gave an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to the <b>balance</b> wheel around 1657 by Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens greatly increased the accuracy of portable timepieces, transforming early pocketwatches from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers. Improvements to the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time. Modern <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> are made of special low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the mainspring runs down. Before the 1980s, balance wheels and <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic quartz timekeeping technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> is in mechanical watches.|$|R
50|$|If {{two or more}} <b>spring</b> <b>balances</b> are hung one {{below the}} other in series, each of the scales will read {{approximately}} the same, {{the full weight of}} the body hung on the lower scale. The scale on top would read slightly heavier due to also supporting the weight of the lower scale itself.|$|R
50|$|Main uses of <b>spring</b> <b>balances</b> are industrial, {{especially}} {{related to}} weighing heavy loads such as trucks, storage silos, and material {{carried on a}} conveyor belt. They are also common in science education as basic accelerators. They are used when the accuracy afforded by other types of scales can be sacrificed for simplicity, cheapness, and robustness.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> in Britain {{was made}} around 1770 by Richard Salter of Bilston, near Wolverhampton. He and his nephews John & George founded {{the firm of}} George Salter & Co., still notable makers of scales and balances, who in 1838 {{patented}} the <b>spring</b> <b>balance.</b> They also applied the same <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> principle to steam locomotive safety valves, replacing the earlier deadweight valves.|$|E

50|$|The Salter {{coil spring}} <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> for weighing, was first made in Britain by around 1770. This used the newly {{developed}} spring steels {{to make a}} powerful but compact spring in one piece. Once again by using the lever mechanism, such a <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> {{could be applied to}} the considerable force of a boiler safety valve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>balances</b> come in {{different}} sizes. Generally, small scales that measure newtons {{will have a}} less firm spring (one with a smaller spring constant) than larger ones that measure tens, {{hundreds or thousands of}} newtons or even more depending on the scale of newtons used. The largest spring scale ranged in measurement from 5000-8000 newtons.|$|R
50|$|The engines had a Sharp boiler barrel. The {{vertical}} boiler had {{a rounded}} top. On the foremost boiler section was the steam dome with a safety valve and <b>spring</b> <b>balances.</b> The frame comprised two outside stiffener frame sections (Futterrahmen) and four plate frame sections (Plattenrahmen) for the steam engine. The EXPANSION had two plate frame sections.|$|R
25|$|However, because Arnold's <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> patents were {{in force}} (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could {{not use the}} helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, {{in the case of}} the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> may {{be labeled}} in both units of force (pounds, liters) and mass (grams, kilograms). Strictly speaking, only the force values are {{correctly}} labeled. In order to infer that the labeled mass values are correct, an object must be {{hung from the}} <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> at rest in an inertial reference frame, interacting with no other objects but the scale itself ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{extensively}} rebuilt in 1882. This included modern features, such as paired Salter <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> safety valves.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in temperature increases {{the dimensions of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance</b> due to thermal expansion. The strength of a spring, the restoring force it produces in response to a deflection, is proportional to its breadth and the cube of its thickness, and inversely proportional to its length. An {{increase in}} temperature would actually make a spring stronger if it affected only its physical dimensions. However, a much larger effect in a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made of plain steel is that the elasticity of the spring's metal decreases significantly as the temperature increases, the net effect being that a plain steel spring becomes weaker with increasing temperature. An increase in temperature also increases diameter of a steel or brass balance wheel, increasing its rotational inertia, its moment of inertia, making it harder for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to accelerate. The two effects of increasing temperature on physical dimensions of the <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance,</b> the strengthening of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the increase in rotational inertia of the balance, have opposing effects and to an extent cancel each other. The major effect of temperature which affects the rate of a watch is the weakening of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> with increasing temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Early watchmakers empirically found {{approaches}} {{to make their}} <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> isochronous. For example, John Arnold in 1776 patented a helical (cylindrical) form of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> in which {{the ends of the}} spring were coiled inwards. In 1861 M. Phillips published a theoretical treatment of the problem. [...] He demonstrated that a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> whose center of gravity coincides with the axis of the balance wheel is isochronous.|$|R

50|$|If {{an object}} is weighed {{with a simple}} <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> {{at one of the}} Earth's poles, there are two forces acting on the object: the Earth's gravity, which acts in a {{downward}} direction, and the equal and opposite tension in the spring, acting upward. There is no net force acting on the object and the <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> so the object does not accelerate and remains stationary. The balance shows the value of the force of gravity on the object.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> {{measures}} {{the weight of}} an object by opposing {{the force of gravity}} acting with the force of an extended spring.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring scale}} or <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> or newton meter {{is a type}} of {{weighing}} scale. It consists of spring fixed at one end with a hook to attach an object at the other. It works by Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to extend a spring is proportional to the distance that spring is extended from its rest position. Therefore, the scale markings on the <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> are equally spaced. A spring scale can not measure mass, only weight.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{invention}} of pendulum clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (<b>balance</b> <b>spring)</b> system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> for watches ushered {{in a new era}} of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (<b>balance</b> <b>spring)</b> system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} operation, {{the weight}} of the glazed panel is usually balanced by a heavy steel, lead, or cast-iron sash weight or counter-weight concealed within the window frame. The sash weight is connected to the window by a braided cotton sash cord, or a chain, that runs over a pulley {{at the top of the}} frame, although <b>spring</b> <b>balances</b> are sometimes used. Breakage of this cord requires disassembly, or destruction, of the trim pieces to gain access for repair.|$|R
25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|R
50|$|Norbar has {{manufactured}} torque testers {{for almost}} {{as long as they have}} manufactured wrenches. The earliest types employed a simple <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> attached to a pivoted bar. The next evolution was to utilise a hydraulic cell and hydraulically activated gauge. The 'Static Torque Meter' was much more compact than the earlier versions and were easier to use because this system avoided the needle fluctuations of the <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> type. This product enjoyed a near 50 year life span before finally being rendered obsolete by electronic measurement methods.|$|E

50|$|After the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> was added, a major {{remaining}} {{source of}} inaccuracy was {{the effect of}} temperature changes. Early watches had <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> made of plain steel and balances of brass or steel, {{and the influence of}} temperature on these noticeably affected the rate.|$|R
50|$|Windmills was {{regarded}} as one of the finest clockmakers in seventeenth century London, producing a large number of lantern clocks, bracket clocks, longcase clocks and pocket watches. His earliest watch, displayed in the British Museum, was made before 1680 and did not make use of a <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> Thomas Tompion's <b>sprung</b> <b>balance</b> transformed the pocket watch from ornamental item into an accurate timepiece. Joseph's last recorded attendance at the Court of the Clockmakers' Company was on 24 October 1723, ending a membership of more than thirty-two years. He died in 1724, having spent fifty-two years at his trade. Thomas then ran the company until his death in 1737. Thomas died childless and thus was the last of the Windmills' male line.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mainstream}} {{transition to}} the use of stem-wind, stem-set watches occurred at around {{the same time as the}} end of the manufacture and use of the fusee watch. Fusee chain-driven timing was replaced with a mainspring of better quality spring steel (commonly known as the [...] "going barrel") allowing for a more even release of power to the escape mechanism. However the reader of this article should not be misled to think that the winding and setting functions are directly related to the balance wheel and <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> The <b>balance</b> wheel and <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> provide a separate function: to regulate the timing (or escape) of the movement.|$|R
