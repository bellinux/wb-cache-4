2500|$|The {{writer of}} {{regional}} literature, Robert Morin (1893–1925) {{was the author}} of Mélie Buttelière (Mélie the Basket Carrier), which was published posthumously in 1926. In the 1920s Morin lived in the Ménard manor house at Pocé-sur-Cisse. His heroine, Mélie, lived half way up a hillside in a cave-dwelling between the hamlets of Fourchette and Moncé in Limeray, right {{in the heart of the}} present AOC wine-growing area. Her job was to carry the soil washed down the hillsides by the rain back up the slopes again, earthing up the base of each vine. The <b>small</b> <b>basket</b> she used was known locally as a [...] "buttelet", and is the root of the word [...] "buttelière" [...] (basket carrier), Mélie's job title. [...] By depicting a few brief scenes from her existence, the author painted a vivid picture of the lives and characterful speech of the local wine-growing community in the early 20th century.|$|E
