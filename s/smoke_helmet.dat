Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet.|$|E

50|$|Late in {{the evening}} of 21 January 1911, a second fire broke out aboard Koombana, this time while she was berthed at Victoria Quay, Fremantle. About four or five tons of fodder stored in the Nos 2 and 3 cargo holds were {{discovered}} to be ablaze, apparently by spontaneous combustion. The Fremantle Fire Station quickly sent a fire engine, and soon afterwards the Harbour Trust fire plant was requisitioned. Once again the holds were flooded. By 4 am on 22 January 1911, the fire was pronounced extinguished, and again the vessel appeared to be undamaged. A <b>smoke</b> <b>helmet</b> sent over by {{the captain of the}} German-Australian liner Augsburg {{did not need to be}} used, but greatly impressed the fire brigade staff.|$|E

6000|$|XII. But on the British heart {{were lost}} The terrors of the {{charging}} host; For not an eye {{the storm that}} viewed Changed its proud glance of fortitude, Nor was one forward footstep stayed, As dropped the dying and the dead. Fast as their ranks the thunders tear, Fast they renewed each serried square; And on the wounded and the slain Closed their diminished files again, Till from their line scarce spears'-lengths three, Emerging from the <b>smoke</b> they see <b>Helmet,</b> and plume, and panoply, - [...] Then waked their fire at once! Each musketeer's revolving knell, As fast, as regularly fell, As when they practise to display Their discipline on festal day. [...] Then down went helm and lance, Down were the eagle banners sent, Down reeling steeds and riders went, Corslets were pierced, and pennons rent; [...] And, to augment the fray, Wheeled full against their staggering flanks, The English horsemen's foaming ranks [...] Forced their resistless way. Then to the musket-knell succeeds The clash of swords--the neigh of steeds - As plies the smith his clanging trade, Against the cuirass rang the blade; And while amid their close array The well-served cannon rent their way, And while amid their scattered band Raged the fierce rider's bloody brand, Recoiled in common rout and fear, Lancer and guard and cuirassier, Horsemen and foot,--a mingled host Their leaders fall'n, their standards lost.|$|R
40|$|Unintentional {{injuries}} {{are the leading}} cause of death in children and youth all over the world. Presentation at a health facility when injured may provide a key opportunity to impart safety education counselling, but should be evaluated for effectiveness due to time and cost implications. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to assess whether injury interventions based in the clinical setting are effective in reducing injury and changing safety behaviours in children and youth. Studies were included in the systematic review if: 1) the intervention was designed to prevent unintentional injuries to children or adolescents under 20 years of age; 2) the intervention was delivered in a "clinical setting," such as a physician’s office, a clinic, an emergency department, or a hospital; 3) participants were assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups; and 4) the study collected empirical data on injuries or safety practices (e. g. seatbelt use). Databases searched included the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Dissertation Abstracts. RESULTS: Of the 21 randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria, the majority assessed the effect of an intervention on safety behaviours, rather than on injury occurrence. Outcomes assessed included: motor vehicle restraint use; bicycle helmet use; safe tap water temperature; smoke alarm ownership; and a variety of safety practices designed to protect young children from injuries in the home (such as safe storage of cleaning materials and medication). Results of interventions varied by outcome assessed, with motor vehicle restrain use, bicycle helmet purchase, likelihood of having safe hot water temperature and owning a smoke alarm all improved. Home safety improved least in response to counselling. Trials that had the greatest effect on safety practices used a combination of education, demonstrations, provision of free or subsidised safety devices (such as <b>smoke</b> alarms, cycle <b>helmets),</b> and repeated reinforcement of the safety messages. CONCLUSIONS: Counselling alone is unlikely to alter behaviour in the long term. Despite their importance as causes of injury, no trials evaluating clinical interventions designed to prevent motorcycle, pedestrian, drowning, or firearm injuries were identified, and only one designed to prevent alcohol-related injuries was identified...|$|R

Subsequently he became a Battery Sergeant Major (49135) and was awarded the DCM on 22 September 1917. The {{newspaper}} reported, [...] "While six ammunition wagons were being unloaded, a sudden and intense fire was opened, and a scene of great confusion ensued; it was very dark, and the drivers were unable to see {{what to do in}} their gas masks. He removed his <b>smoke</b> <b>helmet</b> and assisted the officer in charge to restore order and by doing so saved a considerable block in the traffic which would have caused heavy casualties. His coolness and presence of mind under heavy fire set a very fine example {{at a time when it}} was most needed." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first use}} of poison gas on the Western Front was on 22 April 1915, by the Germans at Ypres, against Canadian and French colonial troops. The initial {{response}} was to equip troops with cotton mouth pads for protection. Soon afterwards the British introduced the Black Veil Respirator, which consisted of a long cloth which was used to tie chemical-soaked mouth pads into place. Dr. Cluny MacPherson of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment brought {{the idea of a}} mask made of chemical absorbing fabric and which fitted over the entire head to England, and this was developed into the British Hypo Helmet of June 1915. This mask offered protection to the eyes {{as well as to the}} respiratory system. One British officer described it as a <b>smoke</b> <b>helmet,</b> a greasy grey-felt bag with a tale window certainly ineffective against gas. This helmet had two celluloid eyepieces, but there was no way to expel the carbon dioxide build up inside the mask [...] This type of mask went through several stages of development before being superseded in 1916 by the canister gas mask the PH helmet. This had a mask connected to a tin can containing the absorbent materials by a hose and an outlet valve to reduce the carbon dioxide build up inside the mask.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the edge}} of High Wood is the London Cemetery and Extension. This Commonwealth {{cemetery}} was opened with the interment of 47 soldiers of the 47th Division {{in the days following}} 15 September 1916 and extended in 1934. The men were buried in a large shell hole and by 1987, the cemetery contained the remains of 3,870 men, 3,114 of whom have no name. Opposite the cemetery is a 47th Division memorial and a cairn for the 9th (Glasgow Highlanders) Highland Light Infantry. A memorial to the Cameron Highlanders and Black Watch lies {{on the east side of}} the wood. Memorials to the 1st and 51st divisions, 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, Cameron Highlanders, 1st South Wales Borderers, 10th Glosters and the 20th Royal Fusiliers were also built in the wood; Thistle Dump Cemetery is in a field to the south. High Wood is also mentioned in a poem by Siegfried Sassoon and is the subject of High Wood by P. Johnstone. The stench of rotting corpses in the wood was overwhelming in summer and it inspired E.A. MacKintosh to pen a parody of Chalk Farm to Camberwell Green. HIGH WOOD TO WATERLOT FARMTune: [...] "Chalk Farm to Camberwell Green"There is a wood at the top of a hill,If it's not shifted it's standing there still;There is a farm a short distance away,But I'd not advise you to go there by day,For the snipers abound, and the shells are not rare,And a man's only chance is to run like a hare,So take my advice if you're chancing your armFrom High Wood to Waterlot Farm.ChorusHigh Wood to Waterlot Farm,All on a summer's day,Up you get to the top of the trenchThough you're sniped at all the way.If you've got a <b>smoke</b> <b>helmet</b> thereYou'd best put it on if you could,For the wood down by Waterlot FarmIs a bloody high wood.|$|E
