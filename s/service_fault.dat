She contributed significantly to Singapore's 3–2 win against South Korea in the semifinals by defeating Dang Ye-Seo and Park Mi-Young in two singles matches. Feng's match against Park was closely fought, with Feng eventually overcoming Park 3–1. Singapore was assisted by the implementation of the expedite system when the game failed to be completed in ten minutes. Under the system, players serve on alternative points rather than on every two points. A receiving player scores a point if she manages 13 returns, which disadvantages defensive play by the server. The system unsettled Park, and Feng won two minutes after its introduction in the match when Park committed a <b>service</b> <b>fault.</b> Interviewed afterwards, Feng said: [...] "I definitely did not expect that [...] It was a surprise and the best birthday present I've ever gotten." ...|$|E

In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In <b>Service</b> <b>Fault</b> Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} years {{a paradigm shift}} {{in the area of}} IT service management could be witnessed. IT management does not only deal with the network, end systems, or applications anymore, but is more and more concerned with IT services. This is caused by the need of organizations to monitor the efficiency of internal IT departments and to have the possibility to subscribe IT services from external providers. This trend has raised new challenges in the area of IT service management, especially with respect to service level agreements laying down the quality of service to be guaranteed by a service provider. Fault management is also facing new challenges which are related to ensuring the compliance to these service level agreements. For example, a high utilization of network links in the infrastructure can imply a delay increase in the delivery of services with respect to agreed time constraints. Such relationships have to be detected and treated in a service-oriented fault diagnosis which therefore does not deal with faults in a narrow sense, but with service quality degradations. This thesis aims at providing a concept for <b>service</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis which {{is an important part of}} IT <b>service</b> <b>fault</b> management. At first, a motivation of the need of further examinations regarding this issue is given which is based on the analysis of services offered by a large IT service provider. A generalization of the scenario forms the basis for the specification of requirements which are used for a review of related research work and commercial products. Even though some solutions for particular challenges have already been provided, a general approach for <b>service</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis is still missing. For addressing this issue, a framework is presented in the main part of this thesis using an event correlation component as its central part. Event correlation techniques which have been successfully applied to fault management in the area of network and systems management are adapted and extended accordingly. Guidelines for the application of the framework to a given scenario are provided afterwards. For showing their feasibility in a real world scenario, they are used for both example services referenced earlier...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{promising}} advantages of web service technology is the possibility of creating added-value services by combining existing ones. A key step for composing and executing services lies in the selection of the individual services to use. Much attention has been devoted to appropriate selection of service functionalities, but also the non-functional properties of the services play a key role. Due to ever changing business environment, service users are not guaranteed from unexpected <b>service</b> <b>faults.</b> <b>Service</b> composition can compensate the deficiencies of constituent components aggregating a redundant number of them for individual tasks. This paper proposes a service selection strategy targeting at minimizing the impact of atomic service failure on the quality of service of compositions. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{practical}} warranty <b>services</b> management, <b>faults</b> may {{not always}} be found in claimed items by warranty service agents, which is the well-known no-fault found phenomenon (for example, caused by a loose connection between parts, or simply human error). This phenomenon can contribute more than 40 % of reported <b>service</b> <b>faults</b> in electronic products and it can be due to faults of manufacturers or product users. Little research, however, considers this phenomenon in warranty management since faults are normally assumed {{to be found in the}} claimed items. On the basis of different levels of testing, this paper proposes three warranty return policies, which decide whether new items should be sent to warranty claimants or not. It then derives and compares the expected costs of the policies, and obtains the optimal warranty periods under supply chain environments.

In this paper, we introduce an innovative, system-level, modular per-spective on creating and managing fault tolerance in Clouds. We propose a comprehensive high-level approach to shading the implementation details of the fault tolerance techniques to application developers and users by means of a dedicated service layer. In particular, the service layer allows the user to specify and apply the desired level of fault tolerance, and does not require knowledge about the fault tolerance techniques that are available in the envisioned Cloud and their implementations.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} use of service level agreements for the provisioning of IT services, providers have to ensure that the guarantees for the quality of their offered services, expressed by quality of service parameters, are met. These guarantees are endangered by resource malfunctions in the provider’s infrastructure or quality degradations of services which are supplied by subproviders. To optimize the resolution of customer reports about service quality degradations affecting the quality guarantees we propose to apply event correlation techniques. In this paper we present a framework for this new kind of event correlation which is called service-oriented event correlation. The framework bridges the gap between the management of the infrastructure and the offer of services for the customers with respect to the <b>service</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis. The application of event correlation approaches in the framework is examined in detail. ...|$|E

Besides of fault isolation, it is also necessary to make decisions about fault treatment.

40|$|International audienceContinuity {{of service}} of wind energy {{conversion}} systems {{as well as}} their reliability and performances are some of the major concerns in this power generation area. Six-legs AC/DC/AC converters are normally used in modern wind energy systems like as in the system with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). A sudden failure of the converter can lead to the total or partial loss of the control of the phase currents and can cause serious system malfunction or shutdown. Therefore, {{to prevent the spread of}} the fault to the other system components and to ensure continuity of <b>service,</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant converter topologies associated to quick and effective fault detection and compensation methods must be implemented. In this paper, a fault tolerant AC/DC/AC converter for a wind energy conversion system based on a DFIG is studied. The presented six-legs converter uses an additional leg that replaces the faulty one after the fault detection. An FPGA is used for experimental implementation of the fault detection scheme, to assure the fast fault detection.

However, {{it is challenging to}} make the <b>service</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance and scalable to fulfill the voluminous demand of users in a distributed network (DN). While many reliable group communication protocols have been dedicated to addressing such a challenge so as to accommodate the changes in the network, they are often costly or require complicated strategies to handle the service interruptions caused by node departures or link failures, which hinders the service practicability. In this paper, we present two schemes to address the challenges. The first one is a location-aware replication scheme called NS, which makes replicas in a dispersed fashion that enables the services on nodes to gain immunity of failures with different patterns (e. g., network partition and single point failure) while keeping replication overhead low. The second one is a novel failure recovery scheme that exploits the independence between service recovery and structure recovery in time domain to achieve quick failure recovery. Our simulation results indicate that the two proposed schemes outperform the existing schemes and simple alternative schemes in service success rate, recovery latency, and communication cost...|$|E
