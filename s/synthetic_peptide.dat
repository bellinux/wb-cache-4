25|$|Staining and {{labeling}} {{techniques are}} often used in microscopy to help identify specific structures in a cell. Staining usually {{involves the use of}} dyes that are absorbed by various cell structures at different rates. Labeling involves the use of fluorescence to identify specific molecules. Fluorophores, fluorescent molecules, may be directly attached or attached to an antibody in order to detect a specific target. In the case of dendritic spikes, staining and labeling are used to identify and quantify the presence of certain voltage-gated channels. For example, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against <b>synthetic</b> <b>peptide</b> sequences have been used to identify the presence of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 sodium channels in dendrites of the globus pallidus neuron.|$|E

However, due to low GC-content and the mismatching of base pairs, the temperature used during subtractive hybridization was adjusted to 35°C. Small amounts of biosynthetic enzymes L-cysteine synthase and acetyltransferase were detected in L. jordanis and L. pneumophila; 19 open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. jordanis, {{with a range of}} punitive functions making up around 47.5% of the 41 sequences represented by 40 ORFs. L. jordanis was found to contain the gene loci sidH, sidE, sidB, and sidG which express an Dot/Icm effector protein. This effector protein is essential for L. pneumophila to infiltrate host cells, so it is thought {{to be used as a}} virulence factor in L. jordanis, also. Both strains of L. jordanis tested positive for proteolysis and hemolysis. They did not test positive for cytotoxicity. Several species of Legionella “produced different proteolytic cleavage patterns on <b>synthetic</b> <b>peptide</b> substrates.” This suggests some genetic differences exist between the proteases produced by the different species of Legionella, despite them having some similarities. L. jordanis also appears to contain complex chains of lipopolysaccharides. Legionella species use amino acids as both carbon and energy sources.|$|E

The mice were immunized subcutaneously with <b>synthetic</b> <b>peptides</b> emulsified in RIBI adjuvant, employing various immunization protocols. Equivalently high IgG responses were induced using SP-KLH conjugates (GVTSAPDTRPAPGSTA-KLH) or an SP [...] MAP- 4 chimeric configuration (SP 1 - 6), which also included a universal malarial CST- 3 T-helper epitope (SP 1 - 6 = SAPDTRPAEKKIAKMEKASSVFNVVNS [...] MAP- 4). These IgG antibodies bound both the appropriate MUC 1 <b>synthetic</b> <b>peptides</b> and the cell surface expressed MUC 1 mucin on murine mammary cells that had been transfected with the human MUC 1 gene and a human breast cancer cell line that expresses cell-surface MUC 1. A MAP- 4 molecule, which included the entire 20 -amino-acid sequence of the MUC 1 tandem repeat (SP 1 - 5 = PDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGVTSA-MAP- 4) induced a poor IgG response.
