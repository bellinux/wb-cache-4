5|$|CSS parsing: A {{number of}} illegal CSS <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> present in Acid2 to test error handling. Standards-compliant browsers are {{expected}} to handle these errors as the CSS specification directs. This helps ensure cross-browser compatibility by making all browsers treat CSS with {{the same level of}} strictness, so that what works in one browser should not cause errors in another.|$|E

The Board's most recent proposal, announced to the public on April 22, 2015, could establish new {{standards for}} financial performance and liquidity information available to donors and lenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial and somewhat pompous melody (D), played on brass and woodwind. In between these formal-sounding <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and {{variations on the}} Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the first}} <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true, then {{so is the}} second. But if the second <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true, then the first <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. It follows that if the first <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true, then the first <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false.|$|R

5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{function}} and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide {{the ability to}} interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace {{in the manner of}} a free-form language, and <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser.|$|E
50|$|Whereas logic {{represents}} only two values; true and false as {{the values of}} statement, probability associates a number in 0,1 to each statement. If {{the probability of a}} <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> 0, the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. If the probability of a <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> 1 the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true.|$|R

5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{narratives}} Zuo zhuan and Guoyu {{contain the}} oldest descriptions of divination using the Zhou yi. The two histories describe {{more than twenty}} successful divinations conducted by professional soothsayers for royal families between 671 BC and 487 BC. The method of divination is not explained, {{and none of the}} stories employ predetermined commentaries, patterns, or interpretations. Only the hexagrams and line <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> used. By the 4th century BC, the authority of the Zhou yi was also cited for rhetorical purposes, without relation to any stated divination. The Zuo zhuan does not contain records of private individuals, but Qin dynasty records found at Shuihudi show that the hexagrams were privately consulted to answer questions such as business, health, children, and determining lucky days.|$|E

Another example of vicious circularity {{is the following}} group of statements: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Liar (pseudomenos) paradox:A man says: [...] "What I {{am saying}} {{now is a}} lie." [...] If the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true, then he is lying, even though the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true. If the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> a lie, then he is not {{actually}} lying, even though the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> a lie. Thus, if the speaker is lying, he tells the truth, and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E
5|$|With {{respect to}} the theory {{that there was a}} single author, as {{initially}} postulated by Dessau, this is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the scriptores. If those <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must {{have been involved in the}} project in order to select one scriptors life over another's.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud is {{a wide-ranging}} {{document}} that touches {{on a great}} many subjects. Traditionally Talmudic <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> classified into two broad categories, halakhic and aggadic statements.

Aggadic <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> not legally related, but rather are exegetical, homiletical, ethical, or historical in nature.|$|E
