50|$|The snowiest {{weather station}} is Clones, County Monaghan, which receives, on average, nearly 30 days of snow and/or sleet per year. Of these, 10.8 <b>days</b> have <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> at 09:00.

50|$|Whilst E. coccifera is {{considered}} fairly frost-hardy, rare extreme frost events {{are thought to}} be one of the principle determinants of subalpine species distribution. Similarly, the duration of <b>snow</b> <b>lie</b> dictates, to a large extent, the species that can persist in alpine/sub-alpine habitats. As <b>snow</b> <b>lie</b> in Tasmania is not permanent, woody species such as E. coccifera and its underlying shrub population can persist at higher altitudes.|$|R
40|$|A temperature-based snow module {{has been}} {{coupled with a}} grid-based {{distributed}} hydrological model, to improve simulations of river flows in upland areas of Britain subject to snowfall and snowmelt. The coupled model has been driven with data from an 11 -member perturbed-parameter climate model ensemble, for two time-slices (1960 - 1990 and 2069 - 2099), to investigate the potential impacts of climate change. The analysis indicates large reductions in the ensemble mean {{of the number of}} <b>lying</b> <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> across the country. This in turn affects the seasonality of peak river flows {{in some parts of the}} country; for northerly regions, annual maxima tend to occur earlier in the water year in future. For more southerly regions the changes are less straightforward, and likely driven by changes in rainfall patterns rather than snow. The modelled percentage changes in peak flows illustrate high spatial variability in hydrological response to projected climate change, and large differences between ensemble members. When changes in projected future peak flows are compared to an estimate of current natural variability, more changes fall outside the range of natural variability in southern Britain than in the north...|$|R

50|$|Similarly to {{the ratio}} of days of snow falling to altitude, {{the number of days}} in which snow settles on the ground {{increases}} by five days per every 100 m increase in altitude. In the south-west, it is rare that snow settles on the ground. From 1979 to 2000 on average, lowland areas did not record any <b>lying</b> <b>snow</b> in {{one out of every three}} years. During this period, snow settled, on average, fewer than three days per year across the Isles of Scilly and on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Inland areas had an average of 5-10 <b>days</b> of <b>snow</b> <b>lying</b> per year and, as with the days of snow falling; this was higher towards the north-east of the region.
