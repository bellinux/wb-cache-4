5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is no <b>stranger</b> <b>than</b> when Darth Vader from the film {{franchise}} Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, <b>Stranger</b> <b>than</b> Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Thompson won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for {{the period}} drama Howards End. In 1993, she {{garnered}} dual Academy Award nominations for her roles in The Remains of the Day as the housekeeper of a grand household and In the Name of the Father as a lawyer. Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her (among other awards) an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress. Other notable film and television credits include: the Harry Potter film series, Wit (2001), Love Actually (2003), Angels in America (2003), Nanny McPhee (2005), <b>Stranger</b> <b>than</b> Fiction (2006), Last Chance Harvey (2008), Men in Black 3 (2012), Brave (2012) and Beauty and the Beast (2017). In 2013, she received acclaim and several award nominations for her portrayal of P. L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's <b>Stranger</b> <b>than</b> Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} heavily stylized {{opening and}} ending cinematics produced {{in part by}} Pete Candeland of Passion Pictures, with help from animator Robert Valley and background visuals from Alberto Mielgo. Candeland, {{who is known for}} his work animating Gorillaz videos, also produced the opening cinematics for both the original Rock Band and Rock Band 2. Within two and a half minutes, the opening cinematic provides a brief representative history of the band interspersed with numerous references to songs by The Beatles, followed by more metaphorical scenes reflecting their studio albums. Prior to each of the chapters in the game's Story mode, the game presents short introductory animations; these animations were prepared by graphic design studio MK12, who had previously worked on the opening cinematics for movies such as <b>Stranger</b> <b>than</b> Fiction and Quantum of Solace.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} detection of deception in unsanctioned, consequential lies between either friends or strangers using an ultimatum game. The sender {{was given an}} {{amount of money to}} divide with the receiver. The receiver did not know the precise amount the sender had to divide, and the sender had the ability to deceive the receiver about the monetary amount. Not surprisingly, senders were more likely to deceive <b>strangers</b> <b>than</b> friends, and receivers were more suspicious of <b>strangers</b> <b>than</b> friends. When senders lied, they stated their offer more times and gave more supporting statements for their offer. Receivers had a strong truth bias, although the majority of senders were truthful, and friends had more of a truth bias <b>than</b> <b>strangers.</b> Receivers were not able to detect deception at a rate above chance. Friends were not better at detecting deception <b>than</b> <b>strangers.</b> However, because most participants were truthful and there was a strong truth bias, a high percentage of participants were able to detect when their partner was truthful, in confirmation of the veracity effect...|$|R

25|$|Another {{territorial}} lizard, {{the common}} collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), can individually recognize neighbours and will increase aggression towards {{them as the}} threat to territorial ownership increases.

However, residents responded more aggressively towards <b>strangers</b> <b>than</b> towards neighbours on natural territories and also in neutral arena encounters.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the American society has internalized the criminal stereotype of African Americans. For example, in experiments where African American and white individuals perform the same act, respondents have reported that the black figure is more threatening than the white figure.
