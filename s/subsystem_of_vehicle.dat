The results of this research highlight that the whole motorcycle is a complex system that shows many kinds of modes of vibration: rigid modes, in which the structural components <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> (chassis, fork, handlebars) behave as rigid bodies and deflection is given by tires and suspensions; local modes, in which deflection is concentrated in some <b>subsystem</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> (e. g. handlebars) {{and the rest of the}} motorcycle behaves as a system of rigid bodies; global modes with relevant deflection <b>of</b> the whole <b>vehicle.</b> This paper focuses on a specific issue, which is important for motorcycle design: the identifications of the frequencies of the first modes that show relevant deflection of the front fork and swing-arm.

The evasion to non-terrestrial sources {{as a solution to}} this problem has made it's way to the spotlight. The project KaNaRiA deals with the design and analysis of an asteroid resource extraction mission. In this thesis, a conceptual re-entry mission architecture is designed. First, the re-entry trajectory design conditions are assessed. As per KaNaRiA's mission concept, the return capsule will be launched from the space borne Operational Centre. Hence a sensitivity analysis is performed on the starting maneuver using Monte Carlo to estimate the probability of hitting Earth and there by establishing a baseline for acceptable error limit. Proceeding this, a precise re-entry trajectory is designed by solving the Lambert's problem. The velocity and flight path angle during the re-entry phase are calculated.

40|$|In this study, various {{stability}} {{control systems}} are developed {{to remove the}} lateral instability of a conventional articulated steer vehicle (ASV) during the oscillatory yaw motion or “snaking mode”. First, to identify {{the nature of the}} instability, some analyses are performed using several simplified models. These investigations are mainly focused on analyzing the effects of forward speed and <b>of</b> two main <b>subsystems</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle,</b> the steering system and tires, on the stability. The basic insights into the stability behavior <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> obtained from the stability analyses of the simplified models are verified by conducting some simulations with a virtual prototype <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> in ADAMS. To determine the most critical operating condition with regard to the lateral stability and to identify the effects <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> parameters on the stability, various studies are performed by introducing some modifications to the simplified models. Based on these studies, the disturbed straight-line on-highway motion with constant forward speed is recognized as the most critical driving condition. Also, the examinations show that when the vehicle is traveling with differentials locked, the vehicle is less prone to the instability. The examinations show that when the vehicle is carrying a rear-mounted load having interaction with ground, the instability may happen if the vehicle moves on a relatively good off-road surface. Again, the results gained from the analyses related to the effects <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> parameters and operating conditions on the stability are verified using simulations in ADAMS by making some changes in the virtual prototype for any case. To stabilize the vehicle during its most critical driving condition, some studies are directed to indicate the shortcomings of passive methods. Alternative solutions, including design of different types of stability control systems, are proposed to generate a stabilizing yaw moment. The proposed solutions include an active steering system with a classical controller, an active torque vectoring device with a robust full state feedback controller, and a differential braking system with a robust variable structure controller. The robust controllers are designed by using simplified models, which are also used to evaluate the ability to deal with the uncertainties <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> parameters and its variable operating conditions. These controllers are also incorporated into the virtual prototype, and their capabilities to stabilize the vehicle in different operating conditions and while traveling on different surfaces during the snaking mode are shown...|$|R

In order to successfully meet this growing demand for efficient and green mobility, the railway sector needs to progress in terms of quality of service, energy and life cycle costs, interoperability, capacity, noise reduction and must also further develop its carbon emission advantages. Roll 2 Rail is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results {{will contribute to the}} increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (www. roll 2 rail. eu). Roll 2 Rail is one of the so called “lighthouse projects” of the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the Technical Demonstrators of Shift 2 Rail. In particular, Roll 2 Rail focuses on technological innovations in different <b>subsystems</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance. Moreover, this project will deliver a set of technical recommendations and proposals of standardisation.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the cooperative control of multiple manipulators {{attached to the}} same base as they reposition a common payload. The theory is easily applied to inertially based problems as well as space based free-floating plat-forms. The system equations of motion are developed {{as well as a}} Lyapunov based controller which ensures stability. The closed chain aspect of the problem reduces the system’s degrees of freedom resulting in more actuators than degrees of freedom. This actuator redundancy is used to minimize a weighted norm of the actuator torques. A polynomial refer-ence trajectory describes the path the payload will follow. The disturbance torque transmitted to the spacecraft center-body by the motion of the manipulators is minimized by altering the order of the reference trajectory polynomial and its coefficients. Results from a two dimensional, dual arm configuration are included. Compared to the Lyapunov point controller alone, a fifth order polynomial reference tra-jectory leads to superior performance in terms of actuator torque magnitudes, spacecraft centerbody attitude control, and payload repositioning accuracy and time. An eighth order polynomial reference trajectory results in only mini-mal improvement over the fifth order case. A modified Lyapunov controller which approximates a PD controller produces results better than the Lyapunov point controller but not as good as either reference trajectory simulation. Space based robotics platforms experience conditions unlike those of their terrestrial counterparts. With respect to the dynamics of the systems, the most notable difference is the absence of a fixed base on which to locate the manipula-tors. The consequence of this difference is that motion of the space based manipulator transmits forces and moments to its mounting base resulting in translation and rotation of the base itself. ’- 2 Generally, this motion is unwanted because the attitude control <b>subsystem</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> mus...|$|R
