5000|$|In {{secondary}} xylem - the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather {{than when it}} first appears - a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a [...] "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly [...] "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They {{have a variety of}} shapes: the most common are the <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the reticulate perforation plate (a net-like pattern, with many openings).|$|E

To understand potential constraints on K-h, xylem conduits in cut A. holosericea stems were anatomically characterised by light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessels with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> plates and tracheids were the principal water conducting cells. Bordered vestured intervessel pits were present in xylem vessel elements. The majority of conduits (89 %) were short at 1 - 5 cmlong. Only 2 % were 15 - 16 cmin length. Mean xylem conduit diameter was 77 +/- 0. 9 mu m and the diameter profile showed a normal distribution, with 29 % of diameters {{in the range of}} 70 - 80 mu m. <b>Simple</b> <b>perforation</b> plates can offer relatively low resistance to water flow.

40|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} chronic otitis media is ever evolving. This {{is also the}} case at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital where in recent times, certain new techniques were adopted and other older ones revisited. This changed surgical approach was deemed to be necessary not only in view of the limited resources available to deal with a large patient load, but also to improve surgical outcomes in the local environment. The focus was mainly on the implementation of internationally accepted surgical techniques that have been shown to not only be effective and safe, but also simple and time-saving. Changes were mostly seen in the management of patients presenting with <b>simple</b> <b>perforations</b> and cholesteatoma. It is the objective of this study to formally assess the outcome and feasibility of this changed surgical approach, as well as to assess the outcomes of surgery as a whole. A retrospective clinical chart review was undertaken over an eighteen-month period from July 2009 to December 2010. All patients undergoing single stage surgery for chronic otitis media in this period were included, and grouped in terms of procedure performed, viz. Tympanoplasty, Tympanomastoidectomy and Canal wall down CWD mastoidectomy. All data were collected from an otological database, each case independently evaluated in terms of surgical and audiological outcomes after at least a 2 month follow up period. Only data acquired at the latest follow-up date were used. The follow up period ranged from 2 to 18 months.

40|$|International audiencePremise of research. Piperales {{displays}} a wide diversity of growth forms {{that appears to}} be linked with differences in cambial activity and subsequent derived wood production. To date, no overall synthesis of the evolution of woodiness in Piperales has been done and few studies have proposed an ancestral habit (woody/herbaceous). We provide anatomical data of all lineages within Piperales and reconstruct ancestral character states, focusing on the origin of woodiness within the order and on the ecological significance of key anatomical features. Methodology. Stem anatomical observations with special emphasis on wood anatomical features were performed on 28 species of the Piperales; by combining previously published studies with original data, we conducted phylogenetic reconstructions of cambial activity and vessel element perforation plates to assess the origin of woodiness and vessel evolution in Piperales. Pivotal results. Different patterns of cambial activity are observed in Piperales, from active secondary growth in both intra- and interfascicular areas in Aristolochia, Thottea (Aristolochiaceae), Saruma (Asaraceae), Manekia, and Piper (Piperaceae) to cambial activity mainly restricted to fascicular areas in Saururaceae and a complete lack of secondary growth in Verhuellia. Vessels in Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Asaraceae present <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> plates, while those of Saururaceae are mostly scalariform. A stem endodermis bearing a Casparian band—an atypical feature in aerial stems—is reported for all genera within the Piperaceae and for Saururus and Houttuynia in the Saururaceae. Conclusions. The common ancestor of the order likely had an active cambium and woody habit, including vessel elements with <b>simple</b> <b>perforation</b> plates. All woody species share several wood features, including wide and tall rays, suggesting a single origin of wood in the order. The high diversity of growth forms observed in Piperales is linked to frequent shifts in cambial activity and changes in habit-related features within the different lineage...|$|E

The present study depicted the {{learning curve}} for endoscopic tympanoplasty and evaluated how many procedures an otologist requires to attain proficiency in this technique. Methods: We reviewed the medical charts of consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty between January 1, 2013 and June 1, 2015. We enrolled patients with <b>simple</b> <b>perforations</b> of the tympanic membrane and excluded those with ossicular chain disease.

This {{study focused on}} finding phylogenetically informative characters to help elucidate any obscure evolutionary patterns within the family. The earliest diverging subfamily Napoleonaeoideae has mixed simple/scalariform vessel perforations, scalariform vessel-ray pitting, and high multiseriate rays, all features that are also present in Scytopetaloideae. The wood {{structure of}} Napoleonaea is distinct, but its supposed close relative Crateranthus strongly resembles Scytopetaloideae. The isolated position of Foetidia (Foetidioideae) can be supported by a unique type of vessel-ray pitting that is similar in shape and size to intervessel pitting (distinctly bordered,, 5 lm). The more derived Planchonioideae and Lecythidoideae share exclusively <b>simple</b> <b>perforations</b> and two types of vessel-ray pitting, but they can easily be distinguished from each other {{by the size of}} intervessel pitting, shape of body ray cells in multiseriate rays, and the type of crystalliferous axial parenchyma cells. The anatomical diversity observed is clearly correlated with differences in plant size (shrubs vs. tall trees) : the percentage of scalariform perforations, as well as vessel density, and the length of vessel elements, fibers, and multiseriate rays are negatively correlated with increasing plant size, while the reverse is true for vessel diameter. status: publishe...|$|R

The presence of complex mycelial fossils in the earliest Silurian corroborates the likely contribution of fungi to the colonization of land {{and the establishment of}} modern sedimentological systems; their rise seemingly accompanied the diversification of early embryophytes and the vegetation of the terrestrial biosphere...|$|R
40|$|Stem {{and leaf}} anatomy of Dirachma socotrana, an endemic species from Socotra, is {{described}} in detail. The diffuse porous to semi-ring-porous wood is characterized by solitary vessels and vessels in short radial multiples with a tendency for oblique/radial vessel arrangement, <b>simple</b> vessel <b>perforations,</b> vascular tracheids, nonseptate fibers with simple to minutely bordered pits mainly confined to radial walls, axial parenchyma which is scanty paratracheal and in 1 - 2 -seriate marginal bands, and mainly 1 - 2 -seriate heterocellular rays. The inner bark shows stratified fiber groups; the outer bark has flaring rays. The dorsi-ventral leaves typically have an indumentum of small, unicellular hairs, anomocytic slomata, an adaxial epidermis largely composed of periclinally divided mucilage cells. The petiole and midrib vascular bundle is typically composed of a simple are-shaped strand. Prismatic crystals are common in the wood, bark, pith, and leaf. The systematic position of the monotypic family Dirachmaceae in a newly defined Resales sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group was established recently {{on the basis of}} molecular data and confirmed by ovule and seed characters. Vegetative anatomical features provide additional arguments for a placement of the family within this order, particularly close to the Rhamnaceae. status: publishe...|$|R
