25|$|After Habré {{was ousted}} by the rebel forces of Idriss Déby in December 1990, Nouri became a close {{ally of the}} new President and a pillar of his regime. In the {{transitional}} coalition government formed following the 1993 <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference,</b> Nouri became Minister of Health under Prime Minister Fidèle Moungar. In 1995, when Koibla Djimasta was appointed as the last transitional Prime Minister, Nouri was named Minister of the Interior; while holding this post, he also chaired the Commission Nationale Recensement Électoral (CNRE), created in 1995 to organise the voter registration for the first multiparty elections in Chad since independence. Following Déby's victory in the 1996 presidential election, Nouri was moved from his post as Minister of the Interior to that of Minister for Livestock. He kept the latter post for five years; he left it on February 24, 2001, when he was appointed as Minister of National Defence in the government chaired by Nagoum Yamassoum. He left his post and the government three years later, during a cabinet reshuffle that took place on February 2, 2004. Nouri's entourage gave ill health {{as the reason for}} his departure. He was successively posted for two years to Saudi Arabia as an ambassador, until he left his position on May 6, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The 1991 <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> (CNS) {{was a sign}} of the {{increasing}} coherence of the anti-Mobutu forces and came as the Congolese Banyarwanda were in a state of heightened tension. [...] Following the beginning of the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, many young Tutsi men in Kivu decided to cross the border to join the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its fight against the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. [...] In response, the Mobutu government implemented Mission d'Identification de Zaïrois au Kivu to identify non-Zairean Banyarwanda, using the end of the Berlin Conference as the division point. [...] Many Banyarwanda whose families had come as colonial labourers were classified as aliens, resulting in yet more youth joining the RPF. [...] The overall effect of the CNS was to strengthen the tendency of [...] "indigenous" [...] Congolese to differentiate between Tutsi from Hutu, and lump together all Tutsi Banyarwanda as [...] "Banyamulenge". [...] It also underlined the fragility of their political position to the Banyamulenge. [...] Within the Banyarwanda in the Kivus, the Hutu began defining themselves as [...] "indigenous" [...] in comparison to the Tutsis, who were increasingly seen as owing their allegiance to the foreign groups.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} rising to power on December 2, 1990, Idriss Déby {{suspended}} the 1989 constitution. This was replaced on March 1, 1991, by a transitional national charter, {{after having been}} adopted on February 28 by the National Salvation Council, that it was announced would be replaced in 30 months by a new constitution drawn up by a <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference.</b> The Charter, while if it gave vast if not exorbitant powers to the presidency, assured fundamental freedoms and rights, including the freedom of opinion and of association, {{the freedom of the}} press, the free movement of persons and property, the right to own property and the individual and collective freedoms in the frame of a pluralist democracy. The Charter also prohibited magistrates, men of the military and security services from being members of any party. The Charter also attempted to avoid a return of warlordism and sectarian politics, that had long plagued Chad: article 5 demanded parties [...] "to shun intolerance, tribalism, regionalism, religious discrimination and xenophobia and incitement to hatred, and the resource [...] violence in all its forms", while article 6 forbade parties [...] "to set up military or paramilitary organizations; to reconstitute into political parties any erstwhile politico-military bodies". To weaken tribalism, it was also added that to register, parties would need at least three members taken from each of ten prefectures. Despite this, the charter was widely seen of an attempt by a government only reluctantly committed to democracy to strictly remain in control of every part of the democratisation process.|$|E
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> of 1991 {{marked a}} turning point in the post-independence era of Niger and brought about multi-party democracy. From 29 July to 3 November, a <b>national</b> <b>conference</b> {{gathered}} all fringes of society to examine the political, economic and social situation of the country and make recommendations for the future direction of the country. The conference was presided over by Prof. André Salifou and developed a plan for a transitional government. This transitional government was installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993.|$|R
50|$|He {{also served}} as Secretary General of the Conseil Supérieur de Transition (CST), which acted as a {{provisional}} parliament from the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> in Chad. He {{was a member of}} the African Union mission to observe the parliamentary elections in Mauritius in 2005, member of the PAP mission to observe the general elections in Zimbabwe in 2008, and Head of the PAP mission to observe the parliamentary elections in Angola in 2008.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference,</b> the {{transitional}} government drafted {{a new constitution}} that eliminated the previous single-party system of the 1989 Constitution and guaranteed more freedom. The new constitution was adopted by a referendum on 26 December 1992. Following this, presidential elections were held and Mahamane Ousmane became {{the first president of}} the Third Republic on 27 March 1993. The presidency of Mahamane Ousmane was characterized by political turbulence, with four government changes and early legislative elections called in 1995.|$|R
50|$|In mid-1991, the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> {{removed the}} word populaire ("People's") from the country's {{official}} name, while also replacing {{the flag and}} anthem {{that had been used}} under the PCT government. The <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> ended the PCT government, appointing a transitional Prime Minister, André Milongo, who was invested with executive powers. President Denis Sassou Nguesso was allowed to remain in office in a ceremonial capacity during the transitional period.|$|E
50|$|Olympio {{returned}} to Togo in July 1991 {{and participated in}} the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> (Conférence Nationale Souveraine), which was held in July-August 1991. The conference {{put in place a}} new government and a transitional parliament.|$|E
50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Chad on 31 March 1996 to approve or reject the new constitutional draft meant to definitively replace the Transitional Charter established by the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> in 1993. It was approved by 63.5% of voters with a 61% turnout.|$|E
50|$|Kané led an {{important}} march protesting against the low representation {{of women in}} the <b>National</b> <b>Conference,</b> for which 13 May is celebrated as Nigerien Women Day. In 1991, she was elected to the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> {{as a member of the}} Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism. She was named Secretary of State for Planning in 1993, and fought for the upwards mobility of African women. In particular, she promoted female empowerment through the development of its activities, including crafts. Her appointment as Coordinator of the International Exhibition of Crafts for Women (SAFEM) in 2000 illustrated her efforts in women's crafts. It became a government agency in 2005 but has been independent since 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{parliamentary}} election forced cohabitation between a rival president {{and prime minister}} and ultimately led to governmental paralysis. As part of an initiative started under the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> the government signed peace accords in April 1995 with Tuareg and Toubou groups {{that had been in}} rebellion since 1990. These groups claimed they lacked attention and resources from the central government. The government agreed to absorb some of the former rebels into the military and, with French assistance, to help others return to a productive civilian life.|$|R
25|$|Before the referendum, Alingué {{had played}} a {{significant}} role during the convening of the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> (CNS) in 1993. He acted there as a spokesman for the members representing the political parties, presiding over the conclusive rounds of talks that beginning on March 7 were to define the last issues on the tables. In particular, he {{played an important role in}} putting an end to the serious deadlock that emerged regarding the composition and the size of the transitional legislature that was to remain in office until elections were held. After many fruitless votations, Alingué, speaking for the political parties, imposed a compromise proposal, on which no negotiation or debate was accepted.|$|R
50|$|Moungar {{was chosen}} as Prime Minister in April 1993 by the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference,</b> but {{subsequently}} lost an October 1993 vote of no-confidence and resigned. ACTUS joined the 13-member Coordination of Armed Movements and Political Parties of the Opposition (CMAP) coalition in December 1999.|$|E
50|$|He {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the UNDR political party in December 1992. In April 1993, following the <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference,</b> he was appointed as Minister of Trade and Industry in the government of Prime Minister Fidèle Moungar. This government lasted only six months before the Higher Transitional Council (CST) approved a censure motion against it.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Fabre edited two weekly newspapers, La tribune des démocrates and Le temps des démocrates. He {{participated in the}} 1991 <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> <b>Conference</b> and acted as {{spokesman}} for the conference. On 1 February 1992, Gilchrist Olympio founded the UFC as a federation of parties; Fabre was designated as the UFC's Secretary-General, while Olympio led the party as its President.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, she {{participated in}} the <b>National</b> <b>Sovereign</b> <b>Conference</b> (CNS), {{and was one of}} the most fervent {{defenders}} of the Arabic language. In 1994, she created an association called Women Az-Zara. On behalf of the association, she was voted among ten women candidates to be a member of the Higher Council of Transition, staying four years. In June 1996, she ran for parliament as a member of the opposition National Front of Chad party, as it was impossible to run as an independent. She was defeated but maintained the election was rigged. Halimé afterwards cared for orphans whose parents were killed in the Habré regime. She also opened an Arabic school in N'Djamena.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issues of crafting a constitution for Nigeria that would meet the criteria of being visible, sustainable, and durable for national political unity, social and economic development. Specifically, it focuses on the years 1978 — 1995 during which several high profile systematic, constitution crafting exercises were undertaken. These included {{the establishment of a}} Constitution Drafting Committee to craft a constitution, and a Constituent Assembly. Ultimately, these exercises have proven to be only partially successful. The goal of producing an endurable constitutional framework for Nigerian politics remains elusive. The two core questions pursued in this dissertation focus on: Why did the military pursue these constitution crafting activities? What are the pressing political issues that the constitutional framework will have to manage? The dissertation pursued these issues through surveys, interviews, a review of government documents and reports, participant observation, and a review of existing literature regarding constitution development, federalism and Nigerian history and politics. Key research findings uncovered pressing political concerns ranging across ethnic fears, gender and youth concern, institutional restructuring and economic subordination. Our findings also related to the elite background of participants in these constitutional exercises, and the intrusion of religion, class, and geographical interests into the deliberations of the assemblies. The continued violation of constitutional provisions by the military was highlighted. The widespread call for a <b>Sovereign</b> <b>National</b> Constitutional <b>Conference</b> to shape a new popular constitution for the country was also a prominent concern. Key recommendations focus on the need for a <b>national</b> constitutional <b>conference</b> free of political interference and constricting mandates...|$|R
