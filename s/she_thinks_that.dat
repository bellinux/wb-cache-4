5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E

She then goes to meet with a patient, when Patrick gets on the PA system and declares his love for Robin. Robin rushes to the nurses' station. Patrick proposes in front of all of their friends and other loved ones. While everyone is looking at Robin, she becomes so overwhelmed and leaves, leaving Patrick devastated. Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying.

25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife.

But later on, she would find out that her boyfriend was squatting inside the house, and had been burned alive.

500|$|Kelly {{argues that}} most {{charters}} {{were based on}} genuine originals, including the First Decimation of 844. She says: [...] "Commentators have been unkind the 844 version has not been given {{the benefit of the}} doubt". In her view Æthelwulf then gave a 10% tax reduction on bookland, and ten years later he took the more generous step of [...] "a widespread distribution of royal lands". Unlike Finberg, she believes that both decimations were carried out, although the second one may not have been completed due to opposition from Æthelwulf's son Æthelbald. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the grants of bookland to laymen in the Second Decimation were unconditional, not with reversion to religious houses as Stevenson had argued. However, Keynes is not convinced by Kelly's arguments, and thinks that the First Decimation charters were 11th or early 12th century fabrications.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor takes Clara in the TARDIS {{to examine}} their {{specific}} location at various points during Earth's history and repeatedly takes photographs of the same area. Clara is dismayed by the Doctor's lack of compassion at witnessing the whole of humanity's history during these trips, complaining that [...] "we're all ghosts to you". She also grumbles that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the TARDIS doesn't like her. [...] From his pictures the Doctor comes {{to the conclusion that}} the [...] "ghost" [...] is actually a pioneer time traveler named Hila Tacorian. Hila was trapped in a pocket dimension where time moves more slowly; for every second she is trapped in the pocket dimension one hundred thousand years pass in the normal world. The Doctor realizes that he cannot use the TARDIS to rescue her because the entropy of the pocket dimension would drain the TARDIS of its energy within seconds. Instead, the Doctor prepares a device which includes a blue crystal from Metebelis III to stimulate Emma's psychic abilities to open a gateway to this pocket dimension. Once opened, the Doctor will travel across and rescue Hila with a harness anchored in the normal world.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes lied {{that she}} has {{contracted}} HIV from Malachy who ends his relationship with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) to reunite with Mercedes. When Malachy discovered her lies, he hit Mercedes, who felt, according to Metcalfe, that she [...] "deserved it" [...] because she was [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "the lies she told were just disgusting.

After Malachy is injured in an explosion, Metcalfe explained that Mercedes regretted her affair with Calvin and she [...] "desperately" [...] wanted the chance to [...] "make things work" [...] with Malachy. She added that if he died, Mercedes would find it difficult to live with her guilt. If Malachy were to die Mercedes would be [...] "devastated" [...] as he was [...] "the only positive thing in her life. [...] <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> she's nothing without him". Malachy died. Metcalfe felt that when Malachy shielded Mercedes from the explosion by throwing himself over her it [...] "proves to her how much he loves her. She knows that's special and regrets she ever took him and his love granted". Metcalfe felt that she and Wallace [...] "had amazing storylines", opining that Malachy's death was the most emotional scene she had filmed while with the serial.|$|E
