5000|$|A zero length spring can be {{attached}} to a mass on a hinged boom {{in such a way}} that the force on the mass is almost exactly balanced by the vertical component of the force from the spring, whatever the position of the boom. This creates a horizontal [...] "pendulum" [...] with very long oscillation period. Long-period pendulums enable seismometers to sense the slowest waves from earthquakes. The LaCoste suspension with zero-length springs is also used in gravimeters because it is very sensitive to changes in gravity. <b>Springs</b> for <b>closing</b> <b>doors</b> are often made to have roughly zero length so that they will exert force even when the <b>door</b> is almost <b>closed,</b> so it will close firmly.|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

40|$|<b>Door</b> <b>closing</b> {{sound is}} one of the most {{influential}} parameters to the customer while buying a car. It {{is one of}} the first impressions one can get while interacting with the vehicle and this contributes to the overall quality perception. Thus, it is very interesting for automotive developers to understand the influence of several parameters on the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. Various experimental and simulation research has already been performed in this field. This thesis is focusing on the experimental part, where classical methodologies, such as standard vibration and acoustical measurements were applied. However, alternative methods, like the acoustic camera, have hardly ever been used. The acoustic camera is typically implemented to measure stationary sound sources. On the other hand, the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound is a transient phenomenon. In this thesis, both, the classical and the acoustic camera approach were used to develop a methodology to quantify the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. The measurements with the acoustic camera identified various sound sources, distributed over the complete door. The main hot-spots are localized at the striker and around the junction of the upper rail and the B-pillar. The other sources are less contributing to the overall <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound. These results have been used to choose adequate measurement positions for accelerometers and were ultimately verified by the classical approach. Based on that, the influence of variations of the door seal stiffness and the inclination of the car were investigated. The main outcome of this was that the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound can be damped or amplified within certain frequency ranges by changing these parameters...|$|R
