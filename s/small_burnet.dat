5000|$|Sanguisorba minor, {{the salad}} burnet, garden burnet, <b>small</b> <b>burnet,</b> burnet, is {{a plant in}} the family Rosaceae that is native to western, central and {{southern}} Europe; northwest Africa and southwest Western Asia; and which has naturalized in most of North America. [...] It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 40-90 cm tall, typically found in dry grassy meadows, often on limestone soils. It is drought-tolerant, and grows all year around.|$|E
50|$|The species {{occurs in}} {{different}} plant communities, most commonly in highly diverse Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grasslands that exist because of intense grazing by sheep or rabbits. These grasslands contain grasses, dicots, and mosses in different mixtures. The turf is short, continuous and consist of very small individual plants. Characteristic species {{that may be}} abundant in these grasslands in the UK include the grasses Sheep's fescue Festuca ovina, red fescue F. rubra, Quaking-grass Briza media, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha and Crested dog's-tail Cynosurus cristatus, the dicots ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, <b>Small</b> <b>burnet</b> Poterium sanguisorba ssp. sanguisorba, Common Bird's-foot Trefoil Lotus corniculatus, Common Cat's-ear Hypochaeris radicata, Mouse-ear hawkweed Pilosella officinarum, Rough hawkbit Leontodon hispidus and Dwarf thistle Cirsium acaule, and the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum.|$|E
40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>burnet</b> (Sanguisorba minor scop.) Is a hardy, {{relatively}} long lived evergreen forb {{native to}} Eurasia that has potential to improve grazinglands and extend grazing into late fall and winter. Trials evaluating <b>small</b> <b>burnet</b> tolerance to {{spring and fall}} postemergence herbicide applications were conducted at the Utah State University Evans farm in Millville, UT. Two <b>small</b> <b>burnet</b> genotypes were grown in a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement. Twelve treatments, clethodim, clopyralid, imazamox, 2, 4 DB, metribuzin, aminopyralid, pendimethalin, dimethenamid-P, bromoxynil, dicamba, quinclorac, and an untreated were applied at moderate field use rates either spring or fall of the establishment year. Plots were rated for visual injury on a 0 to 100 scale where 0 = no injury and 100 = complete mortality. Ratings were done 7, 14, 60 days after treatment (DAT) and the spring following treatment. Seed yield, seed viability, and dry matter yield (DMY) were determined. Fall treatments of aminopyralid reduced seed yield 65 %, seed germination 43 %, and DMY 67 %. Fall applied imazamox treatments reduced DMY by 36 %, and seed yield by 33 %, but did not impact germination. Visual injury was greatest from spring and fall applied aminopyralid treatments with ratings of 24 % and 79 %. Spring applied treatments did not impact seed yield or seed germination. Results suggest that clethodim, metribuzin, quinclorac, clopyralid, dimethenamid-P, bromoxynil, and pendimethalin cause little or no injury to <b>small</b> <b>burnet...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} and proliferation of rabbits destroyed this habitat, which {{was replaced by}} a monospecific meadow constituted of a plant resembling a <b>small</b> Salad <b>Burnet,</b> Acaena adscendens (Rosaceae). Today one can find the carpets of azorellae only on the islands and islets undamaged by rabbits. The Kerguelen cabbage underwent practically the same fate.The establishment of other mammals also had consequences on the vegetation: consumption of the seeds of the Kerguelen cabbage by mice, reducing its regeneration capacities, consumption of the lichens by reindeer, etc.|$|R
50|$|Tex Robertson {{influenced}} the Burnet community by bringing accessibility {{and the importance}} of swimming Burnet, TX. For many years he taught the youth how to swim in Inks Lake before creating his summer camp. In 1963, he brought the first public swimming pool to Burnet. For thirty years that swimming pool hosted <b>Burnet’s</b> <b>small</b> high school state championships. In 1968, the girls’ high school and college state championships were hosted there.|$|R
5000|$|Lutefisk's frontman, Don Burnet, was {{formerly}} the frontman {{of the band}} Plain Wrap during the 1980s, and led the band 3D Picnic from 1986 to 1992. Burnet had also played drums for Beck before becoming Lutefisk's guitarist. The founding of the band {{was related to the}} curing of a [...] "premature midlife artistic crisis", faced by Burnet the age of 30. [...] The name of the band refers to lutefisk, a dried fish dish prepared with lye of Scandinavian origin, which 'window of success' as a recipe is, according to Garrison Keillor's book Pontoon rather <b>small.</b> According to <b>Burnet,</b> the band's name is about playing pop songs hard to stomach.|$|R
40|$|Great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis L.) and <b>small</b> <b>burnet</b> (Sansguisorba minor Scop.) are edible, {{perennial}} weeds widely {{distributed in the}} world. These are the most widespread Sanguisorba species. The bioactive components of Sanguisorba plants include phenolics (phenolic acids, flavonoids and neolignans) and terpenoids. Large potential exists to use burnets as medicinal plants. Sanguisorba species are known to show anticancer properties, antioxidative, antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Also, Sanguisorba extracts show anti-Alzheimer and anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Small</b> <b>burnet</b> extracts {{could also be a}} useful alternative to synthetic fungicides for crop production. This review focuses on biological activities of Sanguisorba extracts and emphasizing their potential applications in pharmaceutical areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{relative}} {{degree of}} drought tolerance was studied for six populations of <b>small</b> <b>burnet</b> CSanguisorba minor), and six culti-vars of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) grown in common gardens under natural conditions {{and in the}} laboratory with different levels of moisture. Metabolic heat rate (q) and respiratory rate (RC 02) were measured weekly on fresh leaf tissue from field-grown plants from early April to early August 1997. Both species grew best in early spring but remained green and active throughout the summer. <b>Small</b> <b>burnet</b> was more drought tolerant than alfalfa. Further studies may allow specific selections of populations and cultivars {{to be made for}} growth on particular sites. Desert plants have adapted to dry climates, but differ in the degree of adaptation among species and cultivars or populations. Plants that better tolerate conditions of low water and high temperature stay green longer into a ho...|$|E
