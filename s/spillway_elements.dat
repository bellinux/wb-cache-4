40|$|Abstract: Flip buckets are {{terminal}} <b>spillway</b> <b>elements,</b> generating free jets {{for energy}} dissipation. Deflectors are {{an alternative to}} flip buckets with constructional ease yet of similar hydraulic features. A first experimental study published at the 33 rd IAHR Congress, Vancouver, investigated deflectorgenerated jets {{in terms of their}} air concentration characteristics. For jet impact onto a movable bed, the scour potential reduces as the jet air content increases. It was demonstrated that the jet air concentration development is a function of its relative black-water core length, depending on the approach flow parameters and the deflector geometry. Jet-generating structures are located at the end of spillways, where high-speed flow with considerable air transport prevails, affecting the jet parameters, such that additional experiments were conducted involving pre-aerated approach flow. The effect of pre-aeration on the air concentration development of deflector-generated jets is discussed and compared with un-aerated approach flow...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of lining damage in stilling basins and at the toe of chute spillways is the global {{instantaneous}} uplift forces due to the difference in pressure acting on the upper and the lower surface of protection slabs or rock <b>elements.</b> <b>Spillway</b> stilling basin linings can be built according to two different techniques: using sealed joints or unsealed joints. In the case of sealed joints, the pressure underneath the slab is constant and the uplift force results from the pressure fluctuations acting on the slab. In the case of unsealed joints, the pressure propagation at the lower surface of the slab, being transferred through the joints, should also be considered. The aim of the paper is to study, define, and compare the design criteria in these two cases. In the present study, the pressure field on the slab is evaluated {{according to a recent}} method based on the Taylor hypothesis, whereas the pressure propagation under the slab is computed by a new 3 D model based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media. By this approach, it is possible to consider the effect of finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the case of weirs for run-of-river power plants, earth dams, and rock-fill dams. Furthermore, to complete the presented design criteria, the dynamic behavior of anchored slabs is experimentally investigated with reference to the sealed joint case {{due to a lack of}} studies in the literature.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Many aging {{watershed}} dams require hazard classifications changes. As a result, these dams may {{no longer}} meet state and federal dam safety regulations because of inadequate spillway capacity and flood protection. Rehabilitation options for these embankments are often limited due to encroaching urban development. Roller compacted concrete (RCC) stepped spillways are a popular choice in these situations because the spillway capacity can be increased {{with little or no}} additional changes to the embankment dimensions. RCC stepped spillways are also selected because of the cost and time savings in the construction of these structures. Design engineers require more information about the inception point location and the approach velocity and energy dissipation in the <b>spillway</b> chute. These <b>elements</b> are important for properly dimensioning the spillway training walls and stilling basin. Research and more specifically design guidelines for RCC stepped spillways applied to small earthen embankments have been limited. A two‐dimensional, physical model was constructed to evaluate the inception point, velocities, air concentrations, and energy dissipation in a 4 (H) : 1 (V) slope spillway chute having 38 mm (1. 5 in.) high steps. Model unit discharges ranging from 0. 11 m 3 s- 1 m- 1 (1. 2 cfs ft- 1) to 0. 82 m 3 s- 1 m- 1 (8. 8 cfs ft- 1) were tested. The findings from this research show that a relationship developed by H. Chanson can be used to determine the inception point location on stepped chutes with Froude surface roughness (F*) ranging from 10 to 100 for slopes as flat as 4 (H) : 1 (V). Additionally, air concentrations near the inception point are approximately 0 % and rapidly increase to 10 % slightly downstream of the inception point. These air concentrations continue to increase gradually to a constant as the flo...|$|R
