40|$|This report {{presents}} the length-weight relationship parameters (a and b) for 559 Lates niloticus, size composition, sex, maturity stages, length at first maturity and food examined during February 2004 from four landing sites and four processing industries. Estimates of “b” varied between 2. 5045 and 3. 3537 with mean of 2. 8781 (+ 0. 3593). The length-weight relationship was isometric. The {{maximum total length}} (TL) recorded was 109 cm while the minimum was 35 cm. The modal length for combined data from all landing sites was 70 cm, {{which is the same}} as that observed from fish processing industries. The highest modal length (80 cmTL) in landing sites was observed at Kayenze station. Males outnumber females by the ratio of 2. 3 : 1 and mature earlier at 64 cmTL than females, which attain sexual maturity at 66 cmTL. Bwai have comparatively more food for Lates niloticus than other areas with condition factor “a” equal to 0. 0118. The main food for Lates were Haplochromines and <b>Silver</b> <b>cyprinids,</b> Rastrineobola argentea. Other food items eaten by Lates were Brycinus spp., Bagrus dockmac and Caridina nilotica.

50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> has a lake-wide {{distribution}} covering both inshore {{and offshore}} in Lake Victoria. It normally occurs between 0 and(-) 20 m in depth, although both eggs and fry can be encountered {{as deep as}} 68 m. The adult fish {{stay close to the}} bottom in daytime and rise up towards the surface at night. The juvenile fish move away from the shore where they spend their larval stage in shallow water. In Lake Kyoga this species is found in open water apparently avoiding the water-lily swamps and it is normally caught in turbulent areas of the Victoria Nile. Its diet consists mainly of zooplankton and insects caught on the water surface. It is predated on by birds and the catfish Schilbe mystus, Clarias gariepinus and Bagrus docmak. It is though that spawing occurs inshore and a mature females may have an estimated fecundity of >1,000 eggs. The eggs are planktonic. The <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> breeds throughout the year with two peaks, the first in August and the second in December-January. It is fast growingand reaches sexual maturity at ages which vary from 16 to 25 months.|$|E

50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> is parasitized by {{the fish}} cestode Ligula intestinalis and this {{parasite}} causes {{changes in the}} adult fishes behaviour in that they remain with the juveniles {{on the surface and}} undertake horizontal movements to and from the shores. In the mid-morning the parasitised fish have a tendency to move towards the shoreline, especially where there are sandy beaches, to search for food. The juveniles feed on zooplankton such as copepods and young stages of planktonic chironomids while the parasitised adults prefer insect larvae and shore dwelling adult insects such as corixid bugs. After nightfall the surface dwelling parasitised fish mix with the health adults when they move up the water column to top waters of the lake.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1940s, {{fish stocks}} were under severe pressure. The market for fish grew since {{railways}} were available to carry fish to the coast and settlements in between. Improved fishing boats and nets were introduced. British colonial authorities set out to remedy this through the introduction of exotic species, including tilapia and the Nile perch. These introductions had five main impacts. The first of these was the rise of the Nile perch. The fish took some time to establish itself, and only began to appear catch statistics in the mid-1970s. By the 1980s, the 'explosion' of this species was being referred to as the Nile perch 'boom'. Catches climbed from about 335 mt in 1975, to a peak of 380,776 mt in 1990. The second impact was the Nile perch's devastation of the haplochromine species flock, its main food source. Catches of this species crashed. The third impact related to the lake's diminutive endemic <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid,</b> the [...] Freed from competition (with haplochromine species) for food sources, this species thrived. It was not the main target of the Nile perch, and catches increased spectacularly from 13,000 mt in 1975, to an all-time high 567,268 mt in 2006. The fourth main impact of the introductions related to the exotic tilapia species. One of these, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), was to establish itself firmly in the fishery. Tilapia catches from the lake rose from about 13,000 mt in 1975, to an all-time high of around 105,000 mt in 2000. There {{can be little doubt that}} these introductions saved the fishery from collapse. With such increases, so too the entire production system on the lake changed, the fifth and final key change. Prior to the arrival of the colonial administration, the fishery was dominated by fishermen (mainly, although certain fishing techniques were reserved for women) who owned their labour and their fishing gear. Contributing to the near-collapse of the fishery in the 1940s and 1950s was the reorganisation of the fishery into fleets drawing on hired labour and much improved gear. The Nile perch 'boom' was to accelerate and massively expand this process. It coincided with an emerging European market for high-quality white fish meat, prompting the development of industrial fish processing capacity along the lake’s shores in Kisumu, Musoma, Mwanza, Entebbe and Jinja. The export of Nile perch has since expanded away from the European Union (EU) to the Middle East, the United States and Australia, and now represents large foreign exchange earnings to the lake's riparian states. In Uganda, indeed, its export is second only to coffee in the rankings of export earnings. In 2006, the total value of Nile perch exports from the lake was estimated to be US$250 million. The main market for the perch remains the EU, and the industry is, therefore, subject to the worries of EU health and safety inspectors. The EU has frequently closed its doors to the export for reasons ranging from unsatisfactory hygiene at factories to cholera outbreaks on the lake shores.|$|E

In this study we evaluate phagostimulatory effect of Zea mays pollen when given alone or together with larval diets to Anopheles arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes under laboratory conditions. Methods: Crushed <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> fish, Rastrineobola argentea and Tetramin baby fish food were given together with or without Zea mays pollen or doxycycline to An. arabiensis mosquito larvae and their effect as diet sources compared. The effects were determined against larval development time and fecundity, size and longevity of emerged adult female mosquitoes. Results: Larvae provided with maize pollen alone emerged to adults that lived for 10 days compared to 12 days for Tetramin baby fish food and 13 day for crushed <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> fish.

40|$|Two major {{goals of}} {{managers}} of Rubondo Island National Park (Rubondo), Tanzania are {{to increase the}} number of international visitors to the Park (and thereby increase revenue generated) and to increase support for the Park among residents of nearby communities. I investigated species preferences among children living around Rubondo and the wildlife viewing preferences of international visitors to Tanzania in an attempt to identify flagship species that Park management could use in marketing and outreach campaigns designed to meet their goals. I also assessed local interest in visiting the Park. As local flagships for Rubondo, the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) and <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid</b> (Rastrineobola argentea) appear to have the most potential among the species that I assessed (i. e., fish eagle [Haliaeetus vocifer], Egyptian goose, <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid,</b> little egret [Egretta garzetta], sitatunga [Tragelaphus speki], genet [Genetta tigrina], monitor lizard [Varanus niloticus], spotted-necked otter [Lutra maculicollis], vervet monkey [Cercopithecus pygerythrus], crocodile [Crocodylus niloticus], hippopotamus [Hippopotamus amphibius], giraffe [Giraffa camelopardalis], and elephant [Loxodanta africana]). However, based on either range or limited aesthetic/behavioral appeal, I considered neither species useful as an international flagship. Among species on Rubondo included in investigations of potential international flagships for the Island (including the chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes], crocodile, elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, vervet monkey, bushbuck, fish eagle, large-spotted genet, goliath heron [Ardea goliath], monitor lizard, sitatunga, and spotted-necked otter), few were concluded to have potential, either because participating visitors had limited 2 ̆ 2 awareness 2 ̆ 2 of and 2 ̆ 2 interest 2 ̆ 2 in viewing the species, local people had strong negative opinions of the species, the animals are not native to the Island, and/or the animals are more easily viewed in more readily-accessible locations. Local people generally had not visited Rubondo but wanted to visit. Not having visited the Park appeared to influence perceptions of the Park, wildlife tourism, and conservation among some participants. Recommendations for local and international marketing and outreach strategies for Rubondo are made based on the outcomes of the aforementioned investigations of local and international species preferences and interest in visiting the Park. ...|$|E
40|$|Nile perch (Lates niloticus), tilapia (Oreochromis spp), dagaa (Rastrineobola argentea, <b>silver</b> <b>cyprinid),</b> and haplochromines (Tribe Haplochromini) {{form the}} {{backbone}} of the commercial fishery on Lake Victoria. These fish stocks account for about 70 % of the total catch in the three riparian states Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. The lake fisheries have been poorly managed, in part due to inadequate scientific analysis and management advice. The overall objective of this project was to model the stocks of the commercial fisheries of Lake Victoria with the view of determining reference points and current stock status. The Schaefer biomass model was fitted to available data for each stock (starting in the 1960 s or later) in the form of landings, catch per unit effort, acoustic survey indices, and trawl survey indices. In most cases, the Schaefer model did not fit all data components very well, but attempts were made to find the best model for each stock. When the model was fitted to the Nile perch data starting from 1996, the estimated current biomass is 654 kt (95 % CI 466 – 763); below the optimum of 692 kt and current harvest rate is 38 % (33 – 73 %), close to the optimum of 35 %. At best, these can be used as tentative guidelines for the management of these fisheries. The results indicate that there have been strong multispecies interactions in the lake ecosystem. The findings from our study {{can be used as a}} baseline reference for future studies using more complex models, which could take these multispecies interactions into account...|$|E
