Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price.|$|E

500|$|Garcia {{returned}} to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, [...] "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For a big guy, he was certainly mobile." [...] One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians' rotation. [...] "Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher. I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.|$|E

[...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E

Wyden urged President George W.

Bush vetoed the act twice. In 2007, Wyden, with fellow Oregon Senator Gordon Smith, again supported the bill.|$|E

2500|$|Archaeologists like William G. Dever {{have pointed}} at archaeological {{evidence}} for the iconoclasm {{during the period of}} Hezekiah's reign. The central cult room of the temple at Arad (a royal Judean fortress) was deliberately and carefully dismantled, [...] "with the altars and massebot" [...] concealed [...] "beneath a Str. 8 plaster floor". This stratum correlates with the late 8th century; Dever concludes that [...] "the deliberate dismantling of the temple and its replacement by another structure in the days of Hezekiah is an archeological fact. I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for skepticism here." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also found}} the term itself too vague to rely on in this case. [...] "Maybe the term 'manifest disregard' was meant to name a new ground for review," [...] he speculated, echoing Posner in Bavarati, [...] "but maybe it merely {{referred}} to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them." [...] In the past, the Court had [...] "merely taken the Wilko language as we found it, without embellishment ... and now that its meaning is implicated, we <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges." ...|$|E

Purandar Singh is a young man, apparently about 25 years of age. His countenance is pleasing, and his manners extremely good.

The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, [...] "As an Irish maiden fresh from the old country, Gene Tierney in her first stage performance is very pretty and refreshingly modest." [...] That same year, Tierney appeared as Peggy Carr in Ring Two (1939) to favorable reviews. Theater critic Richard Watts, Jr. [...] of the New York Herald Tribune wrote, [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why Miss Tierney should not have an interesting theatrical career – that is, if cinema does not kidnap her away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The state {{defendants}} immediately filed {{a notice}} of appeal and applied for a stay in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 21, Circuit Judges Harris Hartz and David Ebel granted the state attorney general's application for a stay. In their order, they cited similar stays granted in Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Oklahoma upon filing of petitions for certiorari and wrote: [...] "n the interests of consistency, we <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to deviate from this approach in this case."

[...] His superior, Secretary of the Interior Zachariah Chandler agreed, adding that [...] "the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action {{on the part of the}} Army as you may deem proper under the circumstances."

2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I <b>see</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E
