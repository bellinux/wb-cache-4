40|$|Conformational {{changes in}} polymer films exposed to {{high-pressure}} CO 2 {{have been investigated}} with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The experimental setup, based on a custom-made stainless steel optical cell with CaF 2 windows, allows measurements in a CO 2 environment for pressures up to 6 MPa, in a temperature range from 293 to 353 K and in the mid-infrared (1000 - 4000 cm- 1). Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a polymer with a side group (C-type), was studied to monitor the spectral changes {{as a function of}} CO 2 pressure and was compared to poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a polymer without a side group (B-type). By monitoring the characteristic carbonyl bands, conformational changes that occur due to molecular interactions between the high-pressure CO 2 and the polymers were explored at a constant pressurization rate (0. 02 MPa/min) and temperature. Spectral changes are observed only for PMMA, where the vibrational band at 1680 cm- 1 disappears with increasing pressure. The spectra of PLGA do not show any significant change in the presence of high pressure CO 2 in the investigated range. The behavior of the absorbance peak as a function of pressure and temperature highlights the presence of dynamic cross-links (DCs) between the side groups of PMMA films obtained by solvent casting below the glass transition temperature of the polymer. The spectral features are correlated using a model that accounts for CO 2 diffusion and the relaxation kinetics of the polymer chains in the thin film. The disappearance of the vibrational band attributed to the DCs for PMMA is related to the glass transition temperature, and a retrograde vitrification phenomenon is observed. This approach can be considered a useful alternative to magnetic <b>suspended</b> <b>balance</b> for the study of polymer-gas systems...|$|E

40|$|Fine organic {{suspended}} sediments (refractory detritus) play {{an important}} role in the underwater light attenuation of large shallow lakes with a peat origin and a eutrophication history. Wind driven resuspension of this material, its flocculation in the water column and the settlement of the formed flocs are the main processes governing the dynamics of this material. For restoration of the macrophyte community in such lakes, reduction of this refractory detritus to improve underwater light climate is the key process when eutrophication reduction measures alone are not effective enough. The shallow Lake Loosdrecht (The Netherlands) was used as case study to illustrate the effects of artificially created deepenings on suspended matter concentrations and the consequences for the underwater light climate. <b>Suspended</b> sediment <b>balances</b> were created for the current situation and the situation with deepenings. Field measurements were taken to quantify various processes and results of the calculations from the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>balances</b> were used to quantify the effects on light climate and potential habitat for macrophytes. These calculations show that creating deepenings (three sections with a total surface area of 120 ha and a depth of 12 m on a 10 % section of the lake) decreases the concentration of organic detritus by 25 % and decreases attenuation coefficients from 2. 5 m- 1 to 2. 2 m- 1. P-load reductions affecting chlorophyll-a levels lead to a change of attenuation coefficients from 2. 5 m- 1 to 2. 0 m- 1.

Because of the ecological and environmental importance of organic matter, its concentration in the water column and its content in the fine-grained suspended sediment fraction was determined and its relationship with intertidal muds investigated. Since the transport of suspended material is directly related to the hydrodynamics, and because a general circulation model for the tidal basin was lacking, a two-dimensional numerical tidal flow model without wind forcing was developed.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes <b>suspended</b> in Hanks <b>balanced</b> salt solution without gelatin decreased in numbers during incubation at room temperature (approximately 50 percent after 60 min).

This surface attachment-stimulated chemiluminescence occurred in the absence of either soluble or particulate stimuli. Chemiluminescence was inhibited by either superoxide dismutase or sodium azide and did not occur with suspensions of granulocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

The amount of hemoglobin released in the medium did not differ significantly between the control (HBSS) and the test incubations with glucose or D-tagatose supplementation. In contrast, the addition of 6 and 60 mM L-sorbose resulted in significant hemolysis. At the low dose (0. 6 mM), L-sorbose did not have an adverse effect.

40|$|Study of {{arterial}} muscle reactions is {{at present}} limited to perfusion of surviving organs, and to direct observation of rings or spirals of excised arteries <b>suspended</b> in a <b>balanced</b> solution. Evaluation of results obtained by perfusion is often made difficult {{by the development}} of edema and by the presence of capillaries and veins. Suspension of excised arteries fails to approximate the normal intra-arterial tension, and gives no information as to the reactions of the smaller arteries and arteri-oles which play the major role in intact animals. Since fresh sections of lung suspended in Ringer’s solution may be used for the microscopic study of bronchiolar muscle reactions (1), Dr. Torald Sollmann suggested that this method could be used for arterioles, whose muscle is arranged similarly to that of bronchioles. Due to limitations of time, it was necessary to confine the study to a single representative type of artery, the pulmonary artery of the rabbit. Preliminary experiments indicated that only the arteries are available for this method, since the arteriolar elastic tissue closes the lumen on melting the gelatin (similar to guinea pig bronchioles (1)). The limitations of excised arterial spirals and rings are thus present in this method, but to a lesser extent, since it permits the study of preparations a good deal nearer the periphery of the arterial tree, and also of smaller animals...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{presented}} by which, with {{the diffusion of}} trypan blue into the nucleus as a criterion of cell injury, {{it is possible to}} study quantitatively the effect of various agencies upon the small thymus cells and upon the tissue lymphocytes. Preliminary studies with this method have led us to the following conclusions, which, however, unless otherwise stated, may be taken as applying only to the lymphocytes of the rat thymus. 1. The small thymus cells, when <b>suspended</b> in <b>balanced</b> phosphate solutions, show no distinct reaction to variations in hydrogen ion concentrations ranging between Ph 7. 0 and PH 7. 8. Beyond PH 7. 0 there is a sudden increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye; plasmolysis of the cells occurs when the alkalinity exceeds PH 8. 0. 2. Heating to 49 ° or 50 °C. is accompanied by a critical increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye. 3. The injury caused by lack of oxygen can be demonstrated by {{the increase in the number}} of stained cells. 4. The addition of serum to suspensions of thymus cells or tonsil lymphocytes greatly inhibits the diffusion of the trypan into the cells. The protection afforded is roughly proportionate to the amount of serum added. Gelatin also exerts a marked protective influence; egg albumin affords a partial protection; starch and gum arabic are inert. Hemoglobin and cholesterol do not modify the stainability of the cells. Arsenious sulfide in weak concentrations partially inhibits the diffusion of the dye. Colloidal iron is without effect, and is precipitated about the cells. 5. The toxicity of the photodynamic substance, hematoporphyrin, and of an impure chlorophyll solution in the presence of sunlight could be strikingly demonstrated by the greatly increased permeability of the cells to the stain. 6. Acute and chronic inanition produces an increased fragility of the cells. The protective power of the serum in acute starvation appears to be increased. 7. The small thymus cells of old animals are more readily injured than are those of young ones, as indicated by the increased proportion of stained cells. 8. The method has been applied to the demonstration of the action of cytotoxic immune sera for rat thymus cells and for human tonsil lymphocytes in vitro.

[...] We did it quite safely, by means of a plank or two, and when it was done I saw all the rest of the train, except the two baggage vans, down in the stream. I got into the carriage again for my brandy flask, took off my travelling hat for a basin, climbed down the brickwork, and filled my hat with water.|$|R

Thirty-six 5 d-old male meat-type chicks were assigned to 12 groups, each of 3 birds: a control bird (C), a bird equipped with a harness (H) and one equipped with a harness and <b>suspended</b> from a <b>balance</b> (S). The counterweights of the balance reduced the load on the legs by 50 %. Behaviour in the birds was recorded twice for a 22 -hour period. The birds were slaughtered at 19 d of age. Their legs were then weighed and the humeri, tibiotarsi and femurs were used for compu-tation of length, biomechanical stiffness and composition. Tibiotarsi were also used for histomorphometry. Body weight at 19 d of age was significantly higher in the C birds (642 g vs. 586 g in the H and S groups, P < 0. 05). The distance travelled as measured in the second week of the experi-ment was greater in S birds (338 m per 22 h vs. 246 in the C group and 252 in the H group, P < 0. 05). The length of the tibiotarsi and femora was greater in the S birds when corrected for body weight (P < 0. 05). Bone stiffness, composition and histological parameters were not significantly different in the 3 groups. We thus concluded that a reduction in load-bearing on the legs of young chicks en-hances locomotor activity and longitudinal growth of leg bones. Bone quality was not affected, prob...|$|R
