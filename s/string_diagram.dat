40|$|We {{pursue the}} {{possibility}} of using subcritical string theory in 4 space-time dimensions to establish a string dual for large N QCD. In particular we study the even G-parity sector of the 4 dimensional Neveu-Schwarz dual resonance model as the natural candidate for this string theory. Our point of view is that the open string dynamics given by this model will determine the appropriate subcritical closed string theory, a tree level background of which should describe the sum of planar multi-loop open string diagrams. We examine the one loop open <b>string</b> <b>diagram,</b> which contains information about the closed string spectrum at weak coupling. Higher loop open string diagrams will be needed to determine closed string interactions. We also analyze the field theory limit of the one loop open <b>string</b> <b>diagram</b> and recover the correct running coupling behavior of the limiting gauge theory.

40|$|<b>String</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{provide a}} {{convenient}} graphical framework {{which may be}} used for equational reasoning about morphisms of monoidal categories. However, unlike term rewriting, rewriting <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> results in shorter equational proofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally establish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal structure. Manipulating <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for large <b>string</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This can be ameliorated by using software proof assistants, such as Quantomatic. However, reasoning about concrete <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> may be limiting and in some scenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams.</b> When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete <b>string</b> <b>diagrams,</b> but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not precise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for equational reasoning about infinite families of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> which is amenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> and we will represent them using context-free graph grammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using rewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents equational reasoning about concrete <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> and context-free families of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free graph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by showing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic reasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software implementation by proving important decidability properties.

In this short tutorial, based on our accidental rediscovery of an idea by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, we explain how <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> may be extended with a notion of functorial box to depict a functor separating an inside world (its source category) from an outside world (its target category).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present an {{extension}} to the string graphs of Dixon, Duncan and Kissinger that allows the finite representation of certain infinite families of graphs and graph rewrite rules, and to demonstrate that a logic can be built on this to allow the formalisation of inductive proofs in the <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> of compact closed and traced symmetric monoidal categories. <b>String</b> <b>diagrams</b> provide an intuitive method for reasoning about monoidal categories. However, this does not negate the ability for those using them to make mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project (Quantomatic) to build a proof assistant for <b>string</b> <b>diagrams,</b> at least for those based on categories with a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a combinatorial formalisation of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams,</b> laying the foundations for this project. The prevalence of commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in quantum information theory, a major application area of these diagrams, {{has led to the}} use of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius algebra morphisms, so-called "spider notation". This notation greatly eases reasoning with CFAs, but string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this reasoning. This dissertation extends string graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to be represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation (and structures to encode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs, where the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can reason directly about !-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of string graphs. Of particular note is the presentation of a form of graph-based induction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could only be represented as a mix of <b>string</b> <b>diagrams</b> and explanatory text.
