50|$|The {{steering}} rack has a bearing {{situated at the}} yoke - the interface between the {{steering rack}} and the steering column. The yoke is designed to prevent {{the separation of the}} steering rack from the steering column, whilst allowing the steering rack to move freely the in transverse direction. The yoke determines a motorist’s ability to feel the road surface and the vehicle’s maneuverability. With their PTFE liner, composite bearings reduce friction in the <b>steering</b> <b>yoke.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dejected {{over his}} failure, Stu struggles {{to hold back}} tears. With a sigh, the {{sympathetic}} Mr. B allows him to launch the spaceship for the trip home. Stu cheerfully grabs the <b>steering</b> <b>yoke</b> and begins to maneuver; {{a moment later the}} ship slams to the ground, crushing Ernie's house. When it lifts off, its underside is covered with dirt and debris, and nothing is left of the house except a tall pillar of dirt {{in the center of a}} crater, cut out by the open cargo hatch. Atop this, Ernie is still sound asleep in bed.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with many}} popular {{series of the}} era (including The Dukes of Hazzard, The A-Team etc.), ERTL {{released}} die-cast toys of KITT in three different sizes — the common miniature model, a [...] "medium" [...] model, and a large model. These toys featured red reflective holograms on the nose to represent the scanner (however, they were located {{on the point of}} the nose, rather like the early mock-up of KITT seen in the pilot episode) as opposed to altering the basic model design to incorporate the scanner as commonly seen in the series. The toys also included round steering wheels as opposed to KITT's <b>steering</b> <b>yoke.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fury's design {{went beyond}} the domain of {{traditional}} Honda cruisers and onto full-out chopper turf, having austere bodywork on a faux-hardtail frame with a high-mounted steering head and long fork tubes that made the rake angle conspicuous at 38 degrees, The caster angle being 32 degrees with 6 degrees added into the <b>steering</b> <b>yokes,</b> A wide rear tire was paired with a narrow front wheel, and the two were spanned by the longest wheelbase for any Honda production motorcycle. Honda also offered an extra-cost version of the Fury with CBS and ABS. There were only cosmetic changes to the VT1300CX (aka VT13CX) model in years 2011 through 2013, and the Fury remains in the Honda lineup for 2014.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{require that}} the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow <b>steering</b> with the <b>yoke</b> or control stick. Some allow both. Still others have a separate control, called a tiller, used for steering on the ground exclusively.|$|R
50|$|The driver sits in {{the front}} {{on the left side}} of the hull. He has three TNPO-170 periscope vision-blocks to provide vision when his hatch is closed. The driver's center vision block can be {{replaced}} with a TVNO-2 active night binocular vision device for use in night and poor visibility conditions or with a TNPO-350B extended periscope when swimming with the trim vane erected. The BMP was the first Soviet armored vehicle to use a simple <b>yoke</b> <b>steering</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's {{design has}} traded off {{interior}} space {{in return for}} a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader. The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed. The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or <b>steering</b> <b>yoke</b> common in modern Western tanks. This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Sport bikes {{have a short}} {{wheelbase}} and an aggressive steering geometry to provide {{the ability to make}} very quick changes in direction. This has the harmful side-effect of making the bike less stable, more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces, and more difficult to control. [...] If the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down, it may cause an unwanted wobble. Steering dampers are factory installed on some high-end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours.Steering dampers are also mounted to off-road motorcycles such as motocross bikes. A damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts, rocks, and sand, and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps. They also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars.On motorcycles, one end of the damper is mounted to the <b>steering</b> <b>yoke</b> or triple tree, the other to the frame. Two main types are linear and rotary. Linear dampers resemble a telescoping shock absorber and operate in a similar manner. They can be aligned either longitudinally and {{to one side of the}} steering, or transversely across the bike. Rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot. They are mounted coaxially with the steering axis and are typically located on top of the steering head. An electronically variable damper uses a rotary damper with hydraulic fluid that flows freely at low speeds, allowing easy turning, while restricting flow at higher speeds when more damping is necessary, as determined by the engine control unit.|$|E
