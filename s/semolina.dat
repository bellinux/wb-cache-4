Cookies made with crushed dates (ma'amoul) are served with coffee or tea, as throughout the Middle East.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{complete}} characterisation of four typical durum wheat breads produced in Italy was performed, from the starting <b>semolinas</b> {{to the final}} product, also considering the intermediate dough. An evaluation {{of the quality of}} durum wheat re-milled <b>semolinas</b> was carried out by means of routine investigations, together with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analyses, that were also applied to dough ready for baking and bread to monitor the variations that occur during processing. The experimental data obtained from routine and spectroscopic determinations were investigated using multivariate statistical analysis to evaluate the possibility of differentiating flours, doughs and breads according to their geographical origin. Computerised image analysis was applied to quantify the crumb grain features of different bread types, and to try to characterise each bread type through a set of crumb morphological and colour parameters...|$|R
40|$|Re-milled {{durum wheat}} <b>semolinas</b> from Altamura, Laterza and Matera (Southern Italy), {{currently}} {{used in the}} production of traditional breads, were tested for quality. The re-milled <b>semolinas</b> exhibited variable technological quality, and different bread-making techniques were observed. Alveograph P/L ranged from 0. 34 to 2. 50 with W values from 71104 to 176104 J. The higher values were found in samples from Laterza, which gave breads with the lowest specific volumes, due to its excessive gluten tenacity. The P/L values were correlated to SDS sedimentation height; dry gluten was correlated to both wet gluten content and protein content, and was negatively correlated to P/L. Bread protein content was correlated to the protein content of the starting material and bread specific volumes were negatively correlated to alveographic P/L values. Significant differences were found between breads from different points of origin (attributable to differences in the bread-making processes), in terms of the level of total titratable acidity and the yellow pigment content of the crum...|$|R
40|$|Phytic acid was {{determined}} in cereal (brans, ¯ours and milled wheat-products) and breads. The method {{was based on}} complexometric titration of residual iron (III) after phytic acid precipitation. The cereal ¯ours showed values ranged between 3 ± 4 mg/g for soft wheats, 9 mg/g for hard wheat and 22 mg/g for whole wheat. Corn, millet and sorghum ¯ours reported a mean of 10 mg/g and oat, rice, rye and barley between 4 and 7 mg/g. Wheat brans had wide ranges (25 ± 58 mg/g). The phytic acid for oat brans was half that of wheat bran (20 mg/g) and higher value (58 mg/g) than that for rice bran. The milling products (<b>semolinas)</b> from hard wheat exhibited 10 mg/g and soft wheat a mean of 23 mg/g. The breads made with single or mixture cereal ¯ours exhibited ranges between 1. 5 and 7. 5 mg/g.

5|$|Ka'ak bi 'awja is a <b>semolina</b> shortbread pastry {{filled with}} ground dates called ajwa or walnuts. The dessert is a {{traditional}} meal for Christians during Easter, however, ka'ak bi awja is also prepared {{towards the end of}} Ramadan, to be eaten during Eid al-Fitr—a Muslim festival immediately following Ramadan, as well as during Eid al-Adha. During Mawlid—the holiday honoring the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad—Zalabieh which consists of small, crunchy deep fried dough balls in dipped in syrup, is served. The dough is made from flour, yeast and water.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian desserts include baklawa, halawa and kanafeh, as well {{as other}} <b>semolina</b> and wheat pastries. Baklawa is a pastry made of thin sheets of unleavened flour dough (phyllo), filled with {{pistachios}} and walnuts sweetened by honey. Burma Til-Kadayif, or simply Burma, especially popular in East Jerusalem, has the same filling as baklawa, but is cylndrical in shape and made with kanafeh dough instead of phyllo. Halawa is a block confection of sweetened sesame flour served in sliced pieces. Muhalabiyeh is a rice pudding made with milk and topped with pistachios or almonds.|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects on}} pasta properties of 1) varying dosages of endoxylanases (EC 3. 2. 1. 8) front Aspergillus oculeatus and Bacillus subtilis and 2) {{lower levels of}} water during pasta dough processing were studied. The A. aculeatus endoxylanase has high selectivity toward water-extractable arabinoxylan (WE-AX), whereas B. subtilis endoxylanase preferentially hydrolyzes water-unextractable arabinoxylan (WU-AX). Pasta was produced on a microscale (50. 0 g) front the <b>semolinas</b> of both a strong (AC Navigator) and a moderately strong (AC Avonlea) durum wheat cultivar. The levels of added water in endoxylanase-treated pastas were adjusted to obtain the same maximal farinograph consistencies as for the control pastas. The extruded pastas were dried with drying cycles at 40, 70, or 90 degreesC. Apart front increasing levels of solubilized arabin-oxylans, these treatments {{had little effect on}} the color, optimal cooking time, and firmness of the resulting pasta. High enzyme concentrations and low (40 degreesC) drying temperature resulted in clearly or much less checked final products for the B. subtilis and A. aculeatus enzyme, respectively. Upon cooking. the enzymically formed low molecular weight arabinoxylans were retained better in the pasta strands than their equally low molecular weight arabinogalactan Counterparts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{trials were}} carried out in a pasta factory in Bari Province and {{confirmed}} that the existent studies regarding health risks in the pasta production sector {{can be used as}} the starting point. However it is necessary to make a specific analysis of the parameters which constitute risk factors, using scientific apparatus. Evaluation of the risks deriving from noise involved a problem of interpretation. The differences found between data obtained with a phonometer and data obtained with a dosimeter may be in contrast, and the dosimeter data can be a source of concern for the workers’ health and therefore for their employers who are responsible for health and safety. In actual fact, when {{the reality of the situation}} was examined, it was seen that different plant operations involve workers’ movements which can stress the microphones differently from acoustic pressure. Therefore, the noise levels which are actually indicative of the situation in the workplace are the phonometer data. However, these too were quite high: daily exposure levels of over 80 dB(A), 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A) in one case, while the impulsive noise levels were always lower Lpk= 112 dB(C). Evaluation of the risk from exposure to particulate matter showed concentrations of inhalable particulate matter PM 10 which were constantly below the level of TLV-TWA = 0. 5 mg/m 3 adopted by the ACGIH as the maximum inhalable dose in eight hours of work. This shows the efficiency of the dust extractor system, which the firm recently upgraded. However, we looked at preventive measures which consisted of: -	working regulation defined by applying industrial health and safety procedures; -	correct and continuous maintenance of the extractor system; -	identification of workers who are more susceptible to respiratory diseases – mostly caused by <b>semolinas</b> powder - even when exposed to levels below TLW. This study has further confirmed that the risk evaluation is not an exact science; in that it does not consist only of technical and mechanical factors, but needs also to consider the many factors connected to workers’ interaction with the workplace...|$|R
40|$|During {{the filling}} of a {{container}} by a dry granular material (ex. storage in a silo, mixer container, packaging), the powder flow {{interacts with the}} side walls and {{the bottom of the}} bowl, and leads {{to the creation of a}} semi-confined free surface in the “feeding zone” and of particle jamming under the free surface. The “feeding zone” corresponds to a zone of strong energy dissipation induced by shocks and frictions between the grain bed formed, the particles in movement and walls of the bowl. The resultant free surface takes the shape of a heap and the surface rises upward the bowl with the powder filling. Once "buried" within the heap, particles are immobilized under the free surface. Particle jamming can be postponed according to the possible local mobility. The stabilization of the intergranular force network inside the heap leads to the establishment of a local stress field. The intensity and the distribution of these stresses can be very different according to the elastic and frictional properties of the particles and also according to the powder filling conditions (size of the bowl, mechanical properties of the walls, flowing properties of the particles, initial velocity of the particles, etc.). The knowledge of the local stress field is important for a mechanical stability of storages or a grain re-mobilization grains under the influence of a shear stress (mixing, flowing) or a compression stress (packing, tapping, compaction). This work concerns the experimental identification of the static mechanical state within an ensiled granular material by measuring the force applied on a sensor immersed inside the heap. The experimental analysis of the powder filling and of the stabilized bed formation is realized with granular materials of contrasted properties (durum wheat <b>semolinas,</b> agglomerates), which are poured according to a calibrated protocol in a cell in order to follow the evolution of the free surface by recording successive pictures. The results allow to characterize the formation of a heap with repose rest angle more or less important. This structure, which results from local granular arrangements, suggests the expression of two main modes of layout: the one by "layering" with a lateral homogeneity of the local stresses (at least until a certain distance of the side walls), the other one in "dune", (sloping heap) with a lateral heterogeneity of the local stresses. The joint analysis of the local vertical stresses in the granular bed, reveals a direct relation between the structure of the free surface and the distribution of the local stresses. Several modes of stress distribution could be distinguished and could be classified according to a parameter of uniformity and their gap from an ideal hydrostaticity...|$|R

Low grade durum wheat <b>semolina</b> pasta (pasta di semolato di grano duro) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (pasta di semola integrale di grano duro). Pastas made under this {{category}} {{must be made}} only with durum wheat <b>semolina</b> or durum wheat whole-meal <b>semolina</b> and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour {{as part of the}} durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{amount of}} raw {{materials}} is very important. <b>Semolina</b> dosing is done by two methods: volumetric feed (measurement by volume), and gravimetric feed (measurement by weight). In volumetric feed, a specific volume of <b>semolina</b> is measured by variable speed screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on {{the density of the}} <b>semolina.</b> In gravimetric feed, <b>semolina</b> is weighed by a variable speed transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated.|$|E
25|$|The {{measured}} {{amounts of}} water and <b>semolina</b> are mixed together in pre-mixer to form a crumbly dough. The traditional type of pre-mixer is a trough with a cylindrical section inside which rotates a mixing shaft with blades. More advanced systems use a high-speed (centrifuge) pre-mixer in which water and <b>semolina</b> are sprayed into the chamber, so that each particle of <b>semolina</b> absorbs the correct amount of water.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the mixing}} process takes place, <b>semolina</b> {{particles}} are irregularly shaped and present in different sizes. <b>Semolina</b> particles become hydrated during mixing. The {{amount of water}} added to the <b>semolina</b> is determined based on the initial moisture content of the flour and the desired shape of the pasta.

25|$|Mixing the <b>semolina</b> {{and water}} {{takes place in}} two stages. First, the {{ingredients}} are measured and added to a pre-mixer, and then they are transferred to a mixing chamber which finalizes the mixing process and produces a homogeneous mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and <b>semolina</b> flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing <b>semolina</b> flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E
