5|$|The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is {{an annual}} six-problem {{mathematical}} olympiad for pre-college students, {{and is the}} oldest of the International Science Olympiads. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. About 100 countries send teams of up to <b>six</b> <b>students,</b> plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the fall}} 1962 and spring 1963 semesters, Littleton taught {{glass in a}} garage at his Verona farm to <b>six</b> <b>students</b> under an {{independent}} study program. By the following year, based {{on the success of}} the Toledo workshops and the independent study course, he had secured University of Wisconsin funding to rent and equip an off-campus hot shop in Madison and authorization to offer a graduate level glass course.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as <b>six</b> <b>students</b> without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the current}} system {{at any given time}} there are {{altogether}} twelve student Shluchim on a two-year stay, but <b>six</b> <b>student</b> Shluchim leave each year after completing their two-year period, and <b>six</b> new <b>student</b> Shluchim arrive, usually in the month of Cheshvan. This was done in order to prevent a gap in which no student Shluchim are present. Thus, at any given time there are <b>six</b> <b>student</b> Shluchim in their first year and six in their second. It is customary for the entire Yeshiva to travel to the airport to greet the newly arrived student Shluchim.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{days after}} he was {{appointed}} Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with <b>six</b> <b>students</b> from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, {{and then returned to}} Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in , written in Swedish. Like , it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|The school {{implemented}} {{a system of}} entrance examinations starting in 1934. The examination program was later expanded to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science, and was developed {{with the assistance of}} Columbia University. During the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries and cafeterias. In 1956, a team of <b>six</b> <b>students</b> designed and began construction of a cyclotron, and a low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed <b>six</b> <b>students</b> per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the <b>six</b> <b>students</b> in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{competition}} was expanded to allow two more divisions, one for year five and <b>six</b> <b>students,</b> and another for year three and four students.|$|E
