40|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} power integrity study is described that compares {{the behavior of}} surface-mount devices and embedded components for power decoupling. Through measurements and simulations, {{it is found that}} when the layer count of the board is low, there is no significant difference between both technologies. When the number of layers increases, the short connection for the embedded components is clearly superior to the <b>surface-mount</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The resonance frequencies for the embedded capacitor do not change significantly with the increased layer count. The case with the <b>surface-mount</b> <b>capacitor</b> however, shows a large increase in parasitic inductance due to the long vias through the board...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Circuit board mounted, shunt {{capacitive}} {{filters are}} less effective at high frequencies {{because of the}} mutual inductance (M) that exists between the input and output ports. An approximate expression for the mutual inductance is M = (µh/ 2 π) ln(h/a); where h = via length and a = radius of the via connecting the capacitor to the return plane. The reduced mutual inductance associated with the new, three-terminal, <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>capacitor</b> results in more than 15 dB increased attenuation compared to two-terminal capacitors over the 0. 3 – 6. 0 GHz range with 50 Ω source and load terminations.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the Composite Right/Left-Handed (CRLH) Transmission Line (TL) {{approach}} {{this paper presents}} a 3 -band T-Junction power divider. The proposed design strategy uses a stub-loaded TL for the right-handed portion of the line; this way, {{with respect to a}} conventional CRLH line, one more degree of freedom is available. Experimental and numerical results referring to a prototype using <b>surface-mount</b> <b>capacitors</b> and inductors are reported and discussed. It is demonstrated that the artificial transmission line (ATL) here presented is an optimum candidate for designing high-added value microwave devices. Furthermore based on the use of metal-insulator-metal capacitors and short circuited stubs, a monolithic implementation is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this article, a {{miniaturized}} ultra-wideband (UWB) {{bandpass filter}} with improved out-of-band performance is presented, {{based on the}} combination of low-pass and high-pass filters. The UWB filter is realized in a semi-lumped technology, using microstrip transmission lines and <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The filter design rules {{have been carried out}} and filters having a 3 dB fractional bandwidth of 142 percent, centered at 0. 77 GHz, have been realized. The measured and simulated characteristics show a good agreement, with attractive return loss (better than 18 dB) and insertion loss (< 0. 3 dB). In addition, a technique using capacitively loaded stubs was used to extend the stopband to eight times the center frequency...|$|R
40|$|Silicon deep trench {{capacitors}} {{represent a}} promising alternative to <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which are typically used in high power applications. Using these devices, modules with significantly lower parasitic inductances {{as well as}} a lower thermal impedance can be realized. It is demonstrated that the high aspect ratio trenches enlarge the surface area of the substrate, which yields an increase in capacitance per surface area by a factor of about 39 in comparison with planar silicon capacitors of comparable design. Moreover, high temperature post-trench processing in argon atmosphere is shown to enhance the dielectric breakdown voltage of the devices and to yield a significantly lower leakage current. Only a small deviation in capacitance of about 3. 2 % across the wafer and a high voltage stability indicates the high homogeneity and the good quality both of the dielectric layer and the post-trench process...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{and future}} astronomical {{instruments}} {{are based on}} a focal plane mapped by a large array of superconducting bolometers. Cryogenic analog multiplexing readout techniques, based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), are currently developed to achieve the readout of large arrays of this kind of low noise background-limited detectors. To effectively reduce the number of cryogenic wires (particularly, SQUID biasing), line/column addressing is currently used in time-division multiplexing, i. e., same biasing is applied to a few SQUIDs (on a line) of different columns. This technique should dramatically increase power consumption if parallel biasing is applied via resistors to isolate each column; the power budget is particularly limited on this kind of front-end cryogenic readout. A design with one transformer per SQUID is also used to read out SQUID biased in series with no excess of consumption and crosstalk. We propose here a new biasing technique using simple <b>surface-mounted</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which is easier to implement. These capacitors are used to parallel bias SQUIDs without additional Joule effect while minimizing crosstalk. However, capacitors do not allow dc biasing and need a current mean value equal to zero to avoid biasing source saturation. We have then tested square current biasing through capacitors on a commercial SQUID. This measurement shows that capacitors are able to proper bias SQUID and then to perform a nondissipative addressing for time-division SQUID multiplexing...|$|R
40|$|The primary fault {{created in}} <b>surface-mount</b> MLC <b>capacitors</b> {{is related to}} flex cracking. This fault is created by a shear force applied to the ceramic element {{suspended}} between the terminations faces {{in contact with the}} PCB. The fault creation probability is proportional {{to the size of the}} ceramic chips in that smaller chips have a greater flex capability than larger chips. Utilizing this ceramic device in more circuitry requires larger chips in order to achieve higher capacitance at higher voltages. Early attempts of thicker cover plates, extended end margins, and soft terminations to mitigate this problem have not been 100 % effective as the crack is still capable of being created. We will present a review of those attempts as well as two new variations in design that can influence the levels at which the crack occurs or eliminates the crack. The ‘Flex Crack’ Figure 1. Flex crack signature The flex crack itself is denoted with a specific signature as the crack starts on the bottom side of the chip, at the end of the termination wrap that extends beneath the chip. It always, Always, ALWAYS, starts at this specifi...|$|R
40|$|Many {{portable}} power applications {{require a}} power source that has buck–boost capability with low output ripple. For this application, the REG 710 {{is a prime}} choice; however understanding the affects of the pump and output capacitors allows designers {{to take full advantage}} of the REG 710 ’s capabilities in order to minimize output voltage ripple. A fundamental step in minimizing output ripple is to optimize the PCB layout. A poor layout adversely affects device operation, resulting in increased output ripple, EMI, and poor regulation. To minimize these effects, the pump capacitor, output capacitor, and input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the REG 710 with the load connected directly across the output capacitor. For best performance, <b>surface-mount</b> ceramic <b>capacitors</b> should be used. For a recommended layout pattern, refer to the REG 710 data sheet. The REG 710 family of products, except for the REG 710 – 5, operates in both the buck and boost modes. Since the modes of operation are different, different techniques can be used to minimize the output ripple. The 2. 5 -V and 2. 7 -V versions of the REG 710 operate in the boost mode until the input voltage increases to about 0. 9 V above the nominal output voltage. At the higher inpu...|$|R
40|$|As {{microprocessors}} {{move towards}} higher frequencies, lower operating voltages and higher power consumption, supplying noise-free {{power to the}} ICs becomes increasingly challenging. Decoupling capacitors with low inductance interconnections are critical to meet the power supply impedance targets. A variety of capacitors are used today to provide decoupling at different frequencies. <b>Surface-mount</b> multi-layer ceramic <b>capacitors</b> currently used at package level provide decoupling only till about 100 MHz because of the component and lead inductances. Embedding thin film capacitors into the package can expand the operating range of package level capacitors to low GHz frequencies. Thin films with capacitance of several microfarads and organic-compatible processes are required for embedding decoupling capacitors at package level. The organic-compatible high-permittivity materials available today do not provide adequate capacitance for the application on hand. While ferroelectric thin films can provide the required capacitance, processing temperatures over 300 o C are required to achieve crystalline films with high permittivity. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop novel materials and processes to integrate decoupling capacitors into currently prevalent organic packages. To this end, hydrothermal synthesis and sol-gel synthesis of BaTiO 3 films were explored in this study. BaTiO 3 films were synthesized by low temperature hydrothermal conversion of metallic titanium. Hydrothermal process parameters such as bath molarity and temperature were optimized to obtain thin films with grain sizes close to 100 nm, at temperatures less than 100 o C. Novel post-hydrothermal treatments were developed to improve the dielectric properties of the films. Sol-gel process requires sintering at > 700 o C to obtain crystalline BaTiO 3 films. However, the films can be synthesized on free-standing copper foils and subsequently integrated into organic packages using lamination. Prevention of foil oxidation during sintering is critical. Nickel and titanium barriers explored in this study were ineffective due to instabilities at the interfaces. Hence, films were synthesized on bare copper foils by controlling the oxygen partial pressure during sintering. Using these techniques BaTiO 3 thin films with capacitances of 400 1000 nF/cm 2 and breakdown voltages of 6 15 V were demonstrated. The films synthesized via either techniques exhibited stable dielectric properties up to 8 GHz owing to fine grain sizes. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Rao R. Tummala; Committee Member: C. P.
