5|$|In the show's third act, {{the host}} conducts an {{interview}} with a celebrity guest. Guests come {{from a wide range of}} cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures. During Stewart's tenure, the show's guests tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials. In the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians. (In 1999, for an Indecision 2000 segment, Steve Carell struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate John McCain's press overflow bus and onto the <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express).|$|E
5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{focused on}} the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents. He {{traveled}} on a campaign bus called the <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express. He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of [...] "retail politics", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49percent of the vote to Bush's 30percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.|$|E
500|$|McCain was famously {{accessible}} to the press, using free media to compensate for his lack of funds.

[...] Some McCain aides saw the senator as naturally preferring the company of reporters to other politicians.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{traveled}} {{on a campaign}} bus called the <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express, whose name capitalized on {{his reputation as a}} political maverick who would speak his mind. In visits to towns he gave a ten-minute talk focused on campaign reform issues, then announced he would stay until he answered every question that everyone had. He pledged that [...] "I will never tell you a lie." [...] He conducted 114 of these town hall meetings, speaking in every town in New Hampshire in an example of [...] "retail politics" [...] that overcame Bush's familiar name. [...] His growing number of supporters became known as [...] "McCainiacs".|$|E
500|$|Still {{reeling from}} his South Carolina experience, McCain made a February 28 speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, {{including}} Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive; McCain declared, [...] "... we embrace the fine {{members of the}} religious conservative community.

[...] He also made an off-the-cuff, unserious remark on the <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express that referred to Robertson and Falwell as [...] "forces of evil", that came across as angry hostility to many Christian conservatives. [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, as well as one in Washington.|$|E

500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his <b>Straight</b> <b>Talk</b> Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush.

[...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him."

500|$|The Australian media wrote uniformly glowing {{reports that}} heaped praise on Diệm, and {{generally}} presented {{him as a}} courageous, selfless and wise leader. The Sydney Morning Herald described Diệm as [...] "One {{of the most remarkable}} men in the new Asia ... authoritarian in approach but liberal in principle". The Age compared Diệm favourably to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, the Presidents of the Republic of China and South Korea respectively. The trio were the respective leaders of the anti-communist halves of the three countries in Asia that had been divided along communist and anti-communist lines. The Age opined that Diệm was not [...] "morally equivocal" [...] but [...] "incorruptible and intensely patriotic" [...] compared to his anti-communist counterparts, and [...] "the type of Asian leader whose <b>straight</b> <b>talk</b> and courageous manner should be valued". The Canberra Times noted that Diệm's visit coincided with that of Foreign Minister Richard Casey to Malaya for that country's independence celebrations. Australia had supported Malaya's successful fight against communism and the newspaper compared the two countries, predicting that they would succeed because [...] "the leaders owe their authority to popular support". Like the politicians, the press overlooked the negative aspects and reality of Diệm's rule, such as his authoritarianism. Although Diệm was depicted as being extremely popular and democratic, he had made himself president when his brother rigged a 1955 referendum that allowed him to depose Bảo Đại; Diệm was subsequently credited with 133% of the votes in Saigon. Diệm's family regime routinely engaged in corruption, ballot stuffing and arbitrary arrests of all opposition. The newspapers also failed to mention that the South Vietnamese economy was largely being propped up by the Commercial Import Program run by the United States and that land reform had failed.|$|E
500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{wanted to}} {{contrast}} Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As {{a sequel to}} the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than {{he did when he}} voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations. During recording, Sakurai was told that [...] "o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken." [...] Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling [...] "deflated", as the [...] "exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful", Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with <b>straight</b> <b>talk.</b> Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes. According to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of VII, Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording Crisis Core, Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a Final Fantasy VII fan himself, he is happy to contribute.|$|E

500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear <b>straight</b> <b>talk.</b> We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E
