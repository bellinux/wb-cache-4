40|$|Outrigger canoes have {{outriggers}} {{on one or}} {{both sides}} to increase their seaworthiness. The canoes with one outrigger float, single riggers, are often found around the Tropical Pacific area, while double riggers with outriggers on both sides are mainly ranged in areas from the Philippines to Indonesia. A series of measuremental surveys of 14 single riggers, was undertaken at Ulithi Atoll, Yap of Micronesia and Rabaul, New Britain I. of Papua New Guinea {{in the month of}} November, 1986. Some statistic considerations, applied with 8 dimentional ratios of the hulls and outriggers of the 14 canoes, was made and their local variations in shape and size are well acertained in comparison with 145 outriggers in Philippine and Indonesia: 1) The canoes in Ulithi and Rabaul have an outrigger float of a tropical wood, "breadfruit tree", while Indonesian and Philippine canoes generally have two outrigger floats of bamboo. The Ulithi canoes with a <b>short</b> <b>float,</b> have symmetry hulls in profile and replace the foremost points of their two boomed triangle sails, knitted of "pandanus leaves", from one end to other end of the canoes as to keep wind on their float side, whenever the canoes greatly change their sailing directions. 2) The canoes have remarkable localities on their hulls and outriggers in shape and size by each location and these results are supported from some statistic considerations, including cluster analysis. One of the most distinct difference between single and double rigger canoes is found in shape and relative size of the outrigger booms held the floats and the length of the booms are relatively long on the single riggers. ﻿ 1) アウトリガーカヌーは,地域毎にそれぞれ異なった船型を持っている。このことは,クラスター分析の結果からも支持される。 2) シングルリガーとダブルリガーとは,特に浮体支持長の長さにおいて,明らかな相違があり,シングルリガーの方が長い。 3) ウルシーのカヌーは,幅の割に深さが深く,ラバウルのカヌーは,浅いが,いずれもアウトリガーカヌーの平均的な船型を持っている。 4) ウルシーとラバウルの浮体は,木製であり,他の地域は,竹製である。また,ウルシーのカヌーの浮体は,全 14 の地域の中で最も短く太い...|$|E

Preface: Rapid gastrointestinal transit could lead to incomplete drug release from the drug delivery system above the absorption zone leading to diminished efficacy of the administered dose. Methodology: The tablets were prepared by direct compression technique. Precompressional and post compressional parameters were evaluated. In vitro dissolution studies were carried out in gastric acid fluid (pH 1. 2). The mechanism of drug release from matrix tablets were analyzed kinetically using zero order, first order, Korsmeyer peppas, Higuchi and hixon Crowell models.

The {{undercarriage}} was unusual; although {{it was expected that}} the aircraft would fly from an aircraft carrier, the probability of emergency water landings was recognised. Consequently, the NiD 43 was fitted with both wheels and floats. The latter were short and stepless, each attached to the aircraft by two short pairs of N-form struts. They reached well ahead of the wing leading edge but ended just aft of the trailing edge, too short to support the rear fuselage which instead was made watertight and floated the machine in a tail down traditional landing position. This allowed surface taxiing with the propeller clear of the water. There were fixed wheels recessed into the floats below the wing mid-chord, which on ship formed a conventional undercarriage, tail down again, with the <b>short</b> <b>floats</b> clearing the deck.|$|R
40|$|Floating hydrogels were {{prepared}} from kappa carrageenan containing CaCO 3 and NaHCO 3 as pore forming agents. The effects of CaCO 3 and NaHCO 3 on hydrogel characterizations were investigated and compared. Amoxicillin trihydrate {{was used as}} a model drug. Characterizations of the hydrogels were carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). As pore forming agents concentration increases, the porosity (%) and floating properties increased. NaHCO 3 incorporated hydrogels showed higher porosity with <b>shorter</b> <b>floating</b> lag time (FLT) than CaCO 3. Hydrogel which contained CaCO 3 exhibited better gel stability over the control and NaHCO 3 containing gel. Incorporation of CaCO 3 into kappa carrageenan hydrogel showed smoother surface gels compared to those produced with NaHCO 3. CaCO 3 also showed higher drug entrapment efficiency and sustained drug release profile than NaHCO 3. The results of these studies showed that, CaCO 3 is an effective pore forming agents in κC hydrogels preparation as compare to NaHCO 3.
