5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

500|$|The third track, [...] "Planet Party", called [...] "Apple IIe funk" [...] by Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media, {{contains}} [...] "wailing guitar synths", [...] "fist-pumping bass", [...] "scattergun freestyle drums" [...] and [...] "sudden, surprisingly violent orchestral stabs". Produced in {{the summer}} of 2010 and the first song to be chosen for inclusion on That We Can Play, Ford recalled, [...] "We were making this smooth-rock, Alan Parsons Project-style <b>shit,</b> <b>and</b> then it completely got sliced and diced, mistakes happened in Pro Tools, and it became something else."

500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing critical reception. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{called the}} episode [...] "one {{of the most}} intense things I've seen in ages." [...] She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that [...] "The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have this weird duet, made me lose my <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> keeps popping into my head. It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon." [...] She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the [...] "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" [...] and allowed the viewers to see [...] "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss {{of the end of}} the entire world" [...] following the war.|$|E
500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun <b>shit.</b> <b>And</b> of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Beggars Banquet {{was delayed}} for nearly six months due to {{controversy}} over {{the design of the}} album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the walls of the stall.

I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> the beads and bells. Who knows where these things come from, but I guess [...] was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality. A spell in prison... will certainly give you room for thought... I was fucking pissed with being busted. So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.' There's a lot of anger in the music from that period." ...|$|E

500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing through clenched teeth, spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, <b>shit,</b> <b>and</b> from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga".

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E

At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed {{a version of the}} future In Rainbows track [...] "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" [...] with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with the band updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, [...] The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, [...] "we spent {{a long time in the}} studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating." [...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working [...] "because when you got beyond all the <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good." [...] They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that <b>shit.</b> <b>And</b> take your hands off me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

500|$|While She Sleeps are {{generally}} recognized by professional reviewers as a metallic hardcore band and {{are known for}} their high energy and edgy sound. The recording features technical guitar picking, big riffs, heavy bass lines, crashing drums and screaming vocals. When questioned about their sound, Welsh described the band as having a [...] "raw UK vibe," [...] adding that they like to keep their music simple and have [...] "more a party vibe." [...] Vocalist Taylor added that their sound is [...] "less pure solo and just more energy." [...] Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! suggested that the band stick to the mould of a metalcore band with the adage [...] "don’t fix what isn’t broken." [...] In an interview in 2011, vocalist Taylor stated that the title– The North Stands for Nothing– has two meanings and that it is open to interpretation. Explaining that being from the North of England; the people that the band know [...] "won't take crap" [...] while also stating that the title means that it doesn't matter where you're from (geographically) you can still [...] "get involved" [...] with the band's music. Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how people will go to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's not the way it should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime." [...] When questioned about the single [...] "Be(lie)ve", Welsh said that it was about the government and religion. Taylor explained further; [...] "we wrote about how people follow <b>shit</b> <b>and</b> don't really think about what they're following".|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of <b>shit.</b> <b>And</b> I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E
