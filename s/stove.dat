5|$|Twenty-one cabins {{can be used}} by {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen <b>stove</b> and a wood-burning <b>stove,</b> refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stoves</b> differ {{widely in}} {{their size and}} portability. The {{smallest}} models are generally termed backpacking <b>stoves.</b> They are designed for use in backpacking and bicycle touring, where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking <b>stoves</b> consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs - if any - are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol <b>stoves,</b> 11 to 14 oz for MSR-type <b>stoves</b> (without fuel weight) and canister <b>stoves</b> (with gas cartridge), and up to 1 lb for larger <b>stoves.</b> Single burner alcohol <b>stoves,</b> beverage can <b>stoves,</b> and small liquid fuel and gas canister <b>stoves</b> are well suited for backpacking.|$|R

5|$|On 2 March {{the ship}} {{departed}} for New Zealand to winter there, leaving a shore party of 10 with their provisions, equipment and 70 dogs.

5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus <b>stove</b> (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed <b>stove</b> allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E

5|$|Though {{virtually}} unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth {{can form}} distinctive, colorful hopper crystals.

5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge <b>stove,</b> {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. The barge comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{boat was}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division (escadrille) of the Light Squadron of submarines on 16 January and she joined them at Calais on 11 February. Mariotte visited Brest on 20 February and was inspected by Rear Admiral Charles Eugène Favereau. During the inspection the oil-fired galley <b>stove</b> in the forecastle exploded, lightly burning two sailors. The boat was in Calais for the visit of King Christian X of Denmark later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook <b>stove</b> programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean <b>stove,</b> known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the <b>stove,</b> trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and <b>stove</b> dominated {{the centre of the}} hut. During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.|$|E
50|$|A {{research}} {{summary of}} the development of such <b>stoves</b> was published in 1982 by Flow Research Inc. <b>Stoves</b> introduced in the 1980s burnt wood pellets rather than logs. By 1986, a directory was available listing 75 such <b>stoves</b> which had satisfied emission testing.|$|R
50|$|The United States Clean Air Act {{requires}} that wood <b>stoves</b> be {{certified by the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These devices meet a particular emissions standard {{of no more than}} 7.5 grams per hour for non-catalytic wood <b>stoves</b> and 4.1 grams per hour for catalytic wood <b>stoves.</b> Washington State has stricter requirements of a maximum of 4.5 grams per hour. However, the EPA has had no mandatory emission limits for pellet <b>stoves,</b> indoor or outdoor wood boilers, masonry <b>stoves</b> and certain types of wood <b>stoves</b> that are exempt from EPA regulation. EPA is developing new regulations and in 2015, these will begin to come into effect, establishing mandatory emission limits for almost all wood-burning appliances (fireplaces, chimeneas, and some other special appliances will still be exempt).|$|R

5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the <b>stove,</b> playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the <b>stove,</b> he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} carriages of the NSS {{were open}} to everyone, but dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant carriages. A four-course dinner cost five Norwegian kroner in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces, were usually prepared at a small <b>stove</b> in the restaurant carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. Blocks of ice were often used instead of refrigerators.|$|E
