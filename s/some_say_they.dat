2500|$|Regarding the sex scenes, Bornoff states, [...] "the {{peripherals}} in a Kuroki video {{are fairly}} violent stuff. She oscillates between abused sexual slave and {{the epitome of}} self-assertion with schizophrenic rapidity. To some, the documentary makes for a jarring experience; the feedback she gets from viewers can be surprising. <b>Some</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> almost find her frightening; that they can't get a hard-on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cantillation signs {{also provide}} {{information}} on the syntactical structure {{of the text and}} <b>some</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are a commentary on the text itself, highlighting important ideas musically. The tropes are not random strings but follow a set and describable grammar. [...] The very word ta'am, used in Hebrew to refer to the cantillation marks, literally means [...] "taste" [...] or [...] "sense", the point being that the pauses and intonation denoted by the accents (with or without formal musical rendition) bring out the sense of the passage.|$|E

50|$|A {{constant}} worry among committee leaders {{was that}} developments from their research, deliberations, and preliminary conclusions would leak to the press; Doar in particular had the junior lawyers on the inquiry working on isolated areas {{so that only}} a few of the senior counsels knew the big picture.

Russell Means had {{previously}} run for president of the Oglala Sioux tribe and twice been defeated. Several tribal governments - elected by the tribes themselves - issued statements distancing themselves from the independence declaration, with <b>some</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> were watching the independent movement closely.

5000|$|The major {{criticism}} is that David Wallace-Wells {{was trying to}} scare people. This theme was then explored by journalists and commentators with <b>some</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> thought fear was necessary given {{the reality of the}} problem, while others thought scaring people was counter-productive. For example Eric Holthaus said that [...] "scaring the shit out of people is a really bad strategy" [...] for getting them to want to address climate change.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} rumours of warlock celadrins in Cormanthor. The unique mixture of Eladrin and elven blood {{has the ability}} to create warlocks. These warlocks are usually in the service of Hanali Celanil, at least three celadrin {{becoming}} eldritch theurges (a combination of divine spellcasters and warlocks) of the goddess. These warlock/clerics have been known to wander the woods of Cormanthor, rekindling love between elves, with <b>some</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> do this to increase the numbers of elves while others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> love to see elves in love.|$|R

60|$|Here the Dutch have an {{infinite}} advantage of us, which is {{never to be}} surmounted or overcome, and for which reason {{it is impossible for}} us ever to beat them out of this trade; viz., the Dutch send yearly a very great number of ships to Dantzic, &c., to fetch corn; <b>some</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> send a thousand sail every year; and I believe they do send so many ships, or those ships going so many times, or making so many voyages in the year as amounts to the same number of freights, and so is the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{asked him}} if he would not change the church for the chapel, now he was ill and his vicar paid him no attention, while the {{minister}} came often to see and talk to him, as I had witnessed, {{he shook his head and}} said that he would never change.

60|$|Thus ended this perilous enterprise. The {{doctor and}} Mud Sam {{severally}} {{found their way}} back to the Manhattoes, each having some dreadful tale of peril to relate. As to poor Wolfert, instead of returning in triumph, laden with bags of gold, he was borne home on a shutter, followed by a rabble route of curious urchins. His wife and daughter saw the dismal pageant from a distance, and alarmed the neighborhood with their cries: they thought the poor man had suddenly settled the great debt of nature in one of his wayward moods. Finding him, however, still living, they had him conveyed speedily to bed, and a jury of old matrons of the neighborhood assembled to determine how he should be doctored. The whole town was in a buzz with the story of the money-diggers. Many repaired {{to the scene of the}} previous night's adventures: but though they found the very place of the digging, they discovered nothing that compensated for their trouble. <b>Some</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> found the fragments of an oaken chest and an iron pot lid, which savored strongly of hidden money; and that in the old family vault there were traces of holes and boxes, but this is all very dubious.|$|E
6000|$|I do not now pipe, but mourn; {{and it will}} be {{well for}} thee if thou canst graciously lament.

Read me, therefore, yea, read me, and compare me with the Bible; and if thou findest my doctrine and that book of God concur, embrace it, as thou wilt answer the contrary in the day of judgment. This awakening work--if God will make it so--was prepared for thee: if there be need, and it wounds, get healing by blood: if it disquiets, get peace by blood: if it takes away all thou hast, because it was naught (for this book is not prepared to take away true grace from any), then buy of Christ [...] "gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see."

6000|$|At {{the door}} of the Conciergerie, Philippe's {{attitude}} was erect and easy, almost commanding. It is five years, all but a few days, since Philippe, within these same stone walls, stood up with an air of graciosity, and asked King Louis, [...] "Whether it was a Royal Session, then, or a Bed of Justice?" [...] O Heaven!--Three poor blackguards were to ride and die with him: <b>some</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> objected to such company, and had to be flung in, neck and heels; (Foster, ii. 628; Montgaillard, iv. 141-57.) but it seems not true. Objecting or not objecting, the gallows-vehicle gets under way. Philippe's dress is remarked for its elegance; greenfrock, waistcoat of white pique, yellow buckskins, boots clear as Warren: his air, as before, entirely composed, impassive, not to say easy and Brummellean-polite. Through street after street; slowly, amid execrations;--past the Palais Egalite whilom Palais-Royal! The cruel Populace stopped him there, some minutes: Dame de Buffon, it is said, looked out on him, in Jezebel head-tire; along the ashlar Wall, there ran these words in huge tricolor print, REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE; LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY OR DEATH: National Property. Philippe's eyes flashed hellfire, one instant; but the next instant it was gone, and he sat impassive, Brummellean-polite. On the scaffold, Samson was for drawing of his boots: [...] "tush," [...] said Philippe, [...] "they will come better off after; let us have done, depechons-nous!" ...|$|E
