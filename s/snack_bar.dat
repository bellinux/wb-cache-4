5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by an IRA bomb that exploded close to a <b>snack</b> <b>bar</b> at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E

This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Marolo (Annona crassiflora Mart) is {{a typical}} savannah fruit that is very nutritious and highly appreciated. However, its {{consumption}} has been limited to fresh fruit. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential use of marolo flour in the production of healthy <b>snack</b> <b>bars</b> to valorise this fruit and provide an alternative ready-to-eat nutritious product. <b>Snack</b> <b>bars</b> containing increasing amounts of marolo flour (5 g 100 g- 1, 10 g 100 g- 1, 15 g 100 g- 1, 20 g 100 g- 1, expressed in w/w) were produced and the physico-chemical and sensory characteristics were determined. RESULTS: Levels up to 20 % marolo flour can be incorporated in <b>snack</b> <b>bars</b> with some minor changes in pH and moisture content but with an increase of 2. 4 -fold in dietary fibre content and also 1. 3 -fold of vitamin C, minerals and antioxidant activity. In addition, up to 10 % marolo flour improves significantly the sensory properties of the <b>snack</b> <b>bars,</b> namely appearance, taste, texture and overall acceptance. CONCLUSION: Marolo flour can be considered an alternative flour for obtaining healthy <b>snack</b> <b>bars,</b> with increased nutritional and sensory quality. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.
