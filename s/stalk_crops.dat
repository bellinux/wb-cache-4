In this study we systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of <b>crop</b> <b>stalk</b> resources, evaluated the bioenergy potential of <b>crop</b> <b>stalk</b> resources, and explored possible pathways of developing stalk-based energy strategies in Inner Mongolia. Our results show that the total <b>crop</b> <b>stalk</b> yield in IMAR increased consistently from 1980 to 2008, with an average annual increase of 16. 3 %.

At the beginning, flexural rigidity values (EI) of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> were calculated from the results of de flection test using image processing apparatus. Further, deflection values and posture of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> were predicted by analysis of Finite Element Method (FEM) using parameters of EI.

Results from these investigations have provided evidence (in terms of particle stability) on why juice particles derived from whole green sugarcane crop are relatively difficult to coagulate (and flocculate).

High priced corn has allowed for the consideration of other ingredients as replacements to reduce diet cost. In much of the Corn Belt, supplies of wet or modified distillers grains and crop residues are abundant. These ingredients were investigated as corn replacements. Studies were conducted to identify methods for treating crop residues to improve digestibility and value in finishing diets based on corn grain and corn wet distillers grain with solubles (WDGS). Digestibility and value of crop residues were improved by mild chemical treatment. Moisture and temperature affected treatment response and extending reaction times beyond 7 days did not improve digestibility. The magnitude of response to chemical treatment depends on the type of residue (i. e., straw vs. stover) and plant part within corn residue (i. e., husk vs. <b>stalk).</b> Treating <b>crop</b> residues at 50 % DM with 5 % calcium oxide fed in conjunction with wet or modified distillers grains can replace up to 15 percentage units of corn without hindering performance. It appears that moisture, storage time, and plant part affect response to chemical treatment. Feeding chemically treated crop residues and wet or modified distillers grains is an effective strategy for replacing a portion of corn grain in feedlot diets. Replacing 15 % units of corn and all of the untreated roughage with treated crop residue resulted similar nutrient supply to the animal. Reducing grind size, feeding a maximum of 20 % treated crop residue, and maintaining at least 25 % corn in the diet are strategies for optimizing cattle performance for replacing corn with treated crop residues and distillers grains. Collectively, these studies demonstrate corn replacement options which should reduce diet costs, maintain performance and ultimately increase profitability. ...|$|R

40|$|Residue {{cover is}} very {{important}} for controlling soil erosion by water and wind. Thus, the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) includes a model for the decomposition of crop residue. It simulates the fall rate of standing residue and the decomposition of standing and flat residue as a function of temperature and moisture. It also calculates residue cover from flat residue mass. Most of the data used to develop and parameterize this model have been collected in the southern U. S. We compared WEPS‐simulated residue cover with that measured in south‐central North Dakota for 50 two‐year cropping sequences from nine crops species that were grown using no‐till management. Measured data included residue mass at the time of harvest and residue cover just after seeding the next spring. Simulated residue cover significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) underestimated measured cover for 33 out of the 50 simulated cropping sequences and overestimated measured cover for five cropping sequences. Some of the differences may be explained by the fact that, for many WEPS crops, residue decomposition parameters are not based on measured field data, but on expert judgment. In addition, WEPS did not predict any stem fall for most of the crops during winter, which contradicts observations that storms flatten many residue <b>stalks</b> of <b>crops</b> such as sunflower. In addition to stem fall and residue decay by biological means, which are driven by temperature and moisture, the model needs to explicitly simulate stem fall by mechanical forces, such as wind‐ and snowstorms, which are important in northern climates. Furthermore, WEPS does not model the migration of unanchored residue caused by rain‐ or windstorms, although this does affect residue mass‐to‐cover ratios and susceptibility to erosion. This study will help improve the WEPS decomposition model and its parameterization, but more data on residue decay and stem fall are needed for different climates and crops to ensure the applicability of the model over a wide range of conditions...|$|R

40|$|Two {{years of}} field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Indonesia (East Java) to investigate damage levels and economic impact of three major sugarcane moth borers Chilo sacchariphagus, C. auricilius and Scirpophaga excerptalis. To collect such information, we created different levels of borer damage by comparing treated (biocontrol vs. insecticide applications) and untreated plots with natural infestation. In the plant cane experiment, damage levels in untreated plots were the highest {{with an average of}} 14. 5 % internodes bored by Chilo spp. and 15. 8 % stalks damaged by S. excerptalis. In comparison, the best treatment obtained with insecticides had only 4. 6 and 3. 8 % damage level respectively, followed by plots treated with Trichogramma releases. The untreated plots had lower sucrose yield, higher fibre content and lower cane yield than all treated plots, which represents a loss in cane yield of 45. 4 t/ha (? 34 %). In the ratoon crop, both yields and the percent of damaged stalks were lower (9. 5 % by top borer and 40 % by stem borers) and the yield reduction in biomass was estimated at 12. 5 t/ha (19. 2 %). In the situation of high infestation as observed in the plant <b>crop,</b> <b>stalk</b> height and other parameters were affected, particularly when damaged by S. excerptalis. For this borer, the weight loss per stalk was estimated at 40. 8 % compared to 15 % from stemborer damage (2. 7 times less). Using these figures, the overall economic impact was calculated, knowing the relationship between weighted borer damage and sucrose yield in plant cane, the cost of applications and the net value per tonne of extra sugar. Therefore, a damage threshold can be applied to trigger control strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Corn stover {{mass and}} {{moisture}} properties were identified to aid decisions regarding collection of standing corn stover dry matter with least moisture, and to aid development of moisture prediction tools for applications including harvest, transport, size reduction, and storage. Vertical distributions of mass and moisture in standing stalks and aboveground components such as leaf, husk, and ear in standing corn plants were evaluated over time. Stalks were cut into 254 mm long sections to facilitate analysis, and {{to correspond with}} billet length collected for cane-type <b>crops.</b> <b>Stalks</b> had the greatest wet mass (72. 6 %) followed by leaf (20. 7 %) and husk (6. 8 %) during the normal harvest period. Moisture profile in aboveground plant components exhibited two separate, sequential linear relationships when plotted with time. The first zone was rapid moisture reduction prior to the normal harvest period. The second zone, corresponding with but {{not the result of}} grain harvest, had slow, gradual moisture reduction and stabilization. Geometrical analyses of stalk cross-sectional area, volume, and lateral surface area to volume ratio documented physical properties for future moisture prediction tools. Considering stalks only, the bottom 1 to 4 stalk sections had 60. 6 % of total dry matter, although that was the last portion of the stalk to dry, thereby increasing the liability of added moisture on transportation and storage. An apparent drying front moved downward through the plant over time and may be explained by reduced the lateral surface area to volume ratio from stalk top to stalk bottom. Dry matter and moisture content of stalks were not significantly influenced by the observed soil and environmental parameters, including rainfall. It was hypothesized that standing stalks readily shed rainfall and allowed less opportunit...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted {{over two years}} in Indonesia (East Java) to investigate damage levels, yield decline and economic impact of three major sugarcane moth borers Chilo sacchariphagus and C. auricilius (referred to as stem borers) and Scirpophaga excerptalis (referred to as top borer). Different levels of borer damage were created to allow comparison between plots treated, i. e. biocontrol and insecticide applications and untreated plots that were naturally infested. In the plant cane experiment, damage levels in untreated plots were the highest, {{with an average of}} 14. 5 % internodes bored by Chilo spp. and 15. 8 % stalks damaged by S. excerptalis. In comparison, the level obtained with insecticides was only 4. 6 % and 3. 8 % damage respectively, followed by plots treated with Trichogramma releases at the rate of 100 000 /ha. The untreated plots had lower sucrose yield, higher fibre content and lower cane yield compared with all treated plots, which represented a loss in biomass of 45. 4 tonnes/ha or 34 % lower yield compared with the treated plots. In the ratoon crop, both yield and percent damaged stalks were lower i. e. 9. 5 % and 40 % by top and stem borers, respectively, and the biomass yield reduction was 12. 5 t/ha or 19. 2 % lower than the treated plots. Where high infestation was recorded in the plant <b>crop,</b> <b>stalk</b> height and other stalk quality parameters were adversely affected, particularly by damage due to S. excerptalis. The latter borer caused a 40. 8 % reduction in stalk mass compared to 15 % due to stem borer; a 2. 7 magnitude difference. The economic impact of these borers was calculated using the values obtained from this loss study, in addition to: information known about the relationship between weighted borer damage and sucrose yield in plant cane; the cost of applications, and the net value per tonne of sugar yield gain. It was possible thereafter to derive a damage threshold that can be consulted to determine when to apply control strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Six clones of Jerusalem artichoke, {{five new}} clones (coded as 17, 22, 56, 69 and 70) {{and the control}} {{cultivar}} “Violette de Rennes” were evaluated for variability in sugars yield, when the plant is utilised as stalk, tuber and “integral crop”. Among the above harvesting methods, the integral <b>crop</b> (<b>stalks</b> and tubers at flowering time), showed the highest yield potential of total sugars (fructose + glucose) and inulin (18. 6 and 17. 9 t/ha, respectively). This was obtained by the clone Violette de Rennes, which also had the greatest inulin chain length, in the text reported as average degree of polymerisation (DP). Clone 69 produced the highest yield of sugars and inulin, when the stalks are harvested at flowering (10. 4 and 8. 0 t/ha, respectively), while clone 17, with the conventional harvest of tubers {{at the end of}} crop cycle, reached 13. 3 and 13. 7 t/ha of total sugars and inulin, respectively. The average inulin chain length (DP) was highest at flowering time in both stalks and tubers with a range of 7. 5 – 11. 2 in the genotypes studied, while, at the final harvest of tubers, it significantly decreased reaching values ranging from 4. 8 to 6. 7. Among the organs analysed, the tubers at stalk harvest, showed both the highest inulin content and the longest inulin chain, expressed as DP. The genetic variability was very high among the clones for the other characters studied, such as flowering time, sugar content in different organs, photosynthesis activity, leaf chlorophyll content, etc. In particular, the “refractometrically measured” solids, in extracted tissue juice, expressed as the Brix-value (a very quick method), exhibited a significant positive relationship with the tuber inulin content (0. 90 ∗∗ and 0. 85 ∗∗, n = 6, in the first and second harvest, respectively), confirming its suitability as a fast screening method in breeding, avoiding time consuming and expensive laboratory analysis...|$|R
40|$|Stalk lodging {{resistance}} {{is a particularly}} important trait on maize, {{especially in terms of}} mechanized harvesting of the <b>crop.</b> <b>Stalk</b> lodging represents a major problem of corn with yield losses. Because of this reason, it takes a special attention on the breeding process. The purpose of this research was the study of maize stalk lodging resistance before the harvest time and finding the best breeding lines for this type of resistance. We used  7 breeding lines (TE 229, TE 202 B, TA 452, TE 330 A, TD 364, TE 317 and TE 335) as maternal lines and another  3 (TD 268, TC 385 A and TC 399) as testers. Lines were tested in 2011 and 2012, in compared cultures with 24  variants, where 21 of them were the experimental hybrids between tested lines and testers and the other 3 were the control hybrids Turda 201, Turda Favorit and PR 39 D 81. Variance analysis was performed according to the classical model of a two-factor system. Genic effects were calculated after 2 nd North Carolina model. Regarding the results, the highest percentage of unbroken plants was on TD 268 tester (80. 7 %) and the lowest on TD 364  tested line (70. 2 %). Tested lines that was noted for the general combining ability of lodging resistance were TA  452 and TE 335. Crossings that marked high values for non-additive effects were TA 452 x TC 385 A, TE 202 B x TC 399 and TE 202 B x TD 268. Effects values for general combining ability were between - 4. 72 % and + 4. 49 % on tested lines, - 1. 68 % and + 5. 78 % on testers; effects values for specific combining ability were between - 11. 25 % and + 7. 58 %. Regarding the tested lines was noted TA 452 inbred line and regarding the testers was noted TD 268  inbred line. On this issue, we can state that in the selection process of maize hybrids must be chosen only those hybrid combinations with stalk-lodging resistance because of the similar contribution of additive and non-additive genic effects to resistant genotypes...|$|R
