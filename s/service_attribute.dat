The research instrument, which takes the SERVQUAL model as its starting point, was developed using a comprehensive set of techniques, including a literature review of relevant topics, interviews and focus group discussions. Using a sample of 140 customers of an international hospital situated in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 14 <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> required by customers were identified. The attributes, which were further categorised into 5 attractive, 4 one-dimensional and 5 ‘must-be’ attributes, were analysed using the Kano Model. Findings: Using the integrated QFD and Kano Model, the <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> needed for improvement were identified. The results are different from those when the company used either SERVQUAL or QFD alone. This study also reveals that benchmarking with competitor might produce misleading results. The results are different when the analysis combined a comprehensive method of QFD and Kano Model.

In order to do so, service providers need to ensure their clients are continuously satisfied with their service encounters, and that they perceive the service to be of superior quality. This {{is especially true for}} advertising and promotions agencies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess perceptions of the service quality offered by agencies in South Africa, and to identify the most important <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> of the agency offerings. The study considers the industry as a whole, and focuses on specific agency types – Above the Line services (referred to as ATL agencies), Below the Line services (BTL agencies), and Full Service (FS agencies). Data was gathered through an online questionnaire based survey of 105 individuals within clients’ buying centres. The study used INDSERV, a measurement instrument specifically designed for business-to-business services (Gounaris, 2005). INDSERV is a second-order model with four quality dimensions underpinned by twenty-two <b>service</b> <b>attributes.</b> Through quantitative analysis, the study identified the relative strengths and weaknesses of agencies’ services. It also identified the more important <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> and dimensions. While all agency types display relative strength in Soft Process quality, clients assign little importance to this dimension and its constituent <b>service</b> <b>attributes.</b> Instead, clients assign greater importance to Hard Process quality and Output quality, dimensions agencies display relative weakness in. This is true regardless of the agency type. The study also included a qualitative component aimed at identifying <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> specific to the agency offering (i. e. not included in the generic INDSERV instrument).

40|$|Abstract. Customer {{satisfaction}} {{is a critical}} success factor in product and service experiences, which {{can be achieved by}} fulfilling the customers’needs as well as their emotional desires. This study is aimed to provide a schematic integration of Kano and SERVQUAL model into Kansei Engineering to measure service quality and customer satisfaction level as well as to identify the emotional needs of its customers. Meanwhile, TRIZ methodology is deployed accordingly to design the service quality improvement. For understanding the applicability of the proposed integrative model, a case study in a culinary business was chosen. It is a seafood restaurant located in Borneo Island. The research involves 20 <b>service</b> <b>attributes,</b> 10 Kansei words, and 100 targeted customers. For measuring customer satisfaction, SERVQUAL model is used to determine the <b>services</b> <b>attributes</b> that have negative customer satisfaction score. Kano model is subsequently used to determine the classification of those <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> into Attractive (A), One-dimensional (O) and Must-be (M) categories. These analyses resulted on 8 sensitive <b>service</b> <b>attributes</b> which have negative customer satisfaction with Attractive and One-dimensional Kano’s category. Those 8 attributes also effected on customer emotional needs (Kansei words) such as “welcome”, “attractive” and “assured”. Then, TRIZmethodology is utilized to describe the innovative solutions by solving the contradictions,especially, for the service attribute“the speed and accuracy of order”; some suggested solutions are as follows, (i) to determine the service standard time, (ii) to create the order checking mechanism as well as (iii) to design website for order booking. This finding should be used as a prioritization tool for service quality improvement. ...|$|R
