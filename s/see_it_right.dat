James is a good boy, and he'll <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> at last; and he is in God's hands, and we must leave him there. He overrules all." ...|$|E
60|$|Old Jeph quietly put {{his finger}} {{on the side of the}} little boat, and turned it upside down. Instead of {{remaining}} in that position it rolled over on one side so much, that the onlookers fully expected to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> itself, and Tommy gave vent to a premature cheer, but he cut it suddenly short on observing that the boat remained on its side with one of the gunwales immersed, unable to attain an even keel in consequence of the weight of water inside of it.|$|E

40|$|By now {{everyone}} has <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> <b>right?</b> The Obamas in the Oval Office, Barack in a djellabah and turban {{and his wife}} Michelle as a gun-toting Black-Panther. An approving Osama Bin Laden looks down on the couple’s fist bump as an American flag burns in the fireplace. The New Yorker’s cartoon has provoked outrage {{on the left and}} the right, with both presidential candidates condemning the depiction...|$|R

I'll take it home with me after the funeral; and, if you please, Mrs. Gordon, let me <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> away, so it can get {{accustomed}} to me. Poor Jane! I wish I could have got here {{in time to see}} her, she and I were such friends long ago. We were far more intimate and confidential than ever her and Charlotte was. Charlotte knows that, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] Jeff began, harshly, {{and with}} a note of scorn {{for himself and his}} theme in his voice, [...] "there isn't any more of it, but there's no end to her. I promised Mr. Westover I shouldn't {{whitewash}} myself, and I sha'n't. I've been behaving badly, and it's no excuse for me because she wanted me to. I began to go for her as soon as I saw that she wanted me to, and that she liked the excitement. The excitement is all that she cared for; she didn't care for me except for the excitement of it. She thought she could have fun with me, and then throw me over; but I guess she found her match. You couldn't understand such a girl, and I don't brag of it. All she cared for was to flirt with me, and she liked it all the more because I was a jay and she could get something new out of it. I can't explain it; but I could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> along. She fooled herself more than she fooled me." ...|$|E

50|$|Mr. Pitt {{has lost}} three days {{trying to see}} the image in the 3-D painting. He now <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> before going to an {{important}} meeting discussing the merger. Elaine, who has her hands covered in ink from a broken fountain pen, breaks the picture and snaps her boss from the trance. However, she spills ink on him and {{he goes to the}} meeting with a painted mustache, making him look like Adolf Hitler. Aside from the visual humor, the scene alludes to Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 through the juxtaposition of the imagery and the bottled water brand name.|$|R
50|$|Otto Funk {{described}} his epic walk as follows: “I have seen God’s country, every foot {{of it that}} I walked over. You can’t <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> from a car or a train. Sole leather express is the only way.” His trip had taken him through America’s Indian reservations, cities, small towns, forests, and deserts.|$|E

While the player can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> after joining the hacking group that offers it, the mission will remain locked until all other {{missions}} have been taken care of.

5000|$|In {{the video}} for [...] "Part 2", {{directed}} by Darren Grant in October 1997, Wyclef Jean plays his guitar as Destiny's Child sings the chorus. Beyoncé stops Wyclef, saying, [...] "that ain't right." [...] Wyclef {{says to the}} group, [...] "Nah, nah, it's phat; {{all we need to}} do is drop a phat beat for the clubs. I'm tellin' you, they gon' lose their minds; I can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> now." [...] The group begins a choreographed dance in a large gold room. Wyclef Jean also makes an appearance in a room next to the room where the group is.|$|E
50|$|The core of her {{beliefs about}} {{language}} processing {{was that it}} must reflect the coherence of language, its redundancy as a signal. This idea was a partial inheritance from the old “information theoretic” view of language: for her, it meant that processes analysing language {{must take into account}} its repetitive and redundant structures and that a writer goes on saying the same thing again and again in different ways; only if the writer does that can the ambiguities be removed from the signal. This sometimes led her to overemphasise the real and explicit redundancy she would find in rhythmical and repetitive verse and claim, implausibly, that normal English was just like that if only we could <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} view {{regarding the}} philosophy of mathematics {{in the twentieth century}} is the dogma of three schools: Logicism, Intuitionism and Formalism. The problem with this dogma is not, at least not first and foremost, that it is wrong, but that it is biased and essentially incomplete. 'Biased' because it was formulated by one of the involved parties, namely the logical empiricists - if I <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> - in order to make their own position look more agreeable with Intuitionism and Formalism. 'Essentially incomplete' because there was - and still exists - beside Frege's Logicism, Brouwer's Intuitionism and Hilbert's Formalism at least one further position, namely Husserl's phenomenological approach to the foundations of arithmetic, which is also philosophically interesting. In what follows, I want to do two things: First, I will show that the standard dogma regarding the foundations of mathematics is not only incomplete, but also inaccurate, misleading and basically wrong with respect to the three schools themselves. In doing this I hope to make room for Husserl and his phenomenological approach as a viable alternative in the foundations of arithmetic. Second, I will show how Husserl's phenomenological point of view is a position that fits exactly in between Frege's "logicism", properlyunderstood, and Hilbert's mature proof theory, in which his so called "formalism" turns out to be only {{a means to an end}} and not a goal in itself...|$|E
