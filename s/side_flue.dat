40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) {{are proven}} to possess high {{biological}} toxicity. They are formed {{in large quantities}} in industrial waste combustion processes. The formation of PCDD/F in grate-fired municipal waste incinerators (MWI) is widely investigated unlike the formation in fluidized bed (FB) boilers. This work aims to define the key differences {{in the formation of}} PCDD/Fs between grate-fired and FB boilers using solid waste as fuel. The theoretical part of the work involves a comprehensive review of the formation and reduction of PCDD/Fs in waste combustion. The experimental part consists of participating in two PCDD/F measurement campaigns at FB boiler plants and the analysis of the results. The main PCDD/F formation routes in thermal processes include the high temperature gas phase formation from precursors (pyrosynthesis), the condensation of precursors on surfaces of metal catalysts (precursor mechanism), and the formation from residual carbon in the fly ash in presence of a catalyst (de novo synthesis). Two latter pathways take place in post-combustion zone at temperatures from 200 to 500 ºC and they are suggested to be mainly responsible of the overall PCDD/F formation. The key factors promoting the formation of PCDD/Fs include incomplete combustion of the fuel, oxidizing atmosphere, presence of chlorine, residual carbon in the fly ash, favorable temperature window, and copper catalyst. Copper (chloride) is found to highly enhance the formation of PCDD/Fs. The change in different forms of copper is found to depend on temperature, which could partly explain the ‘temperature window’ of PCDD/F formation. Therefore, the flue gas residence time in this region should be minimized. Sulfur-, nitrogen-, and calcium-based compounds are found to inhibit the formation of PCDD/Fs. SO 2 in the flue gas may participate in the formation of metal sulfates from copper chlorides, thus reducing the active sites of the copper catalysts. Addition of CaO or CaCO 3 into the flue gases may reduce PCDD/Fs due to their capability to adsorb PCDD/Fs or by changing the pH of the fly ash towards the alkaline <b>side.</b> <b>Flue</b> gas cleaning devices, especially electrostatic precipitators (ESP), may offer a favorable framework for PCDD/F formation if operated at temperatures above 200 ºC. Bag house filters with prior injection of additives can effectively reduce PCDD/F emissions (up to 99. 5 %). Catalytic decomposition of PCDD/Fs is the only method that will destroy the PCDD/Fs, not only transfer the problem elsewhere. The PCDD/F congener patterns (fingerprints) from grate-fired boilers and FB boilers possess great similarity, thus the governing formation routes are similar in both cases. The main factors causing dissimilarities in the fingerprints involve fuel properties (amount of copper and chlorine) and fly ash characteristics that are influenced by the combustion technology and feeding of additives. Differences in the gas/solid partitioning between different technologies are suggested to mainly depend on the fly ash characteristics, and differences in the sampling temperatures and methods...|$|E

2500|$|Firing {{was with}} coal, at just one end through a {{conventional}} locomotive single firedoor, {{and a single}} manual fireman. Owing to the single-ended firing and the predominantly longitudinal gasflow, compared to the Yarrow's normal through-bank gasflow, there was a pronounced temperature difference between {{the front and back}} of the boiler. This led to the water circulation currents, especially in the second section, to be longitudinal through the water drums, like the Woolnough, rather than the usual Yarrow. [...] The first section, which included some water-tubes to the rear wall, was radiant heated and effectively a water-wall furnace, without any gas flow through the tube bank. Despite this, it still used four rows of tubes. The second section had its gasflow arranged by steel and firebrick baffles so that the combustion gases entered through the centre and passed through the tube banks into the <b>side</b> <b>flues,</b> giving better convective heat transfer.|$|R

Several new crops such as microalgae, macro algae, aquatic higher plants, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (insects and worms) have received growing scientific attention, because of potential high biomass yields for protein production on small surface areas. Several <b>side</b> streams (<b>flue</b> gas, residual heat, biogas slurry and solid wastes) can be valorised in their cultivation. Combining bioenergy production and its side streams with cultivation of these circular crops, improves economy and sustainability of both. At the ACRRES site, Wageningen University runs pilot facilities together with several SMEs. The research is aimed at innovating and improving economics of alternative crop production and energy use efficiency. The main focus is on utilization of microalgae and other novel crops to benchmark this with conventional feeds. Data on their value as feed ingredient and from optimized production systems are used as input for legislation matters with regard to nutrient use and feed safety. In addition to their suitable macro composition research indicates that some circular feed components have added value to improve animal health and final quality of the animal end products. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|An early {{proponent of}} the {{cylindrical}} form was the British engineer John Blakey, who proposed his design in 1774. Another early proponent was the American engineer, Oliver Evans, who rightly recognised that the cylindrical form was the best {{from the point of}} view of mechanical resistance and towards the end of the 18th Century began to incorporate it into his projects. Probably inspired by the writings on Leupold's [...] "high-pressure" [...] engine scheme that appeared in encyclopaedic works from 1725, Evans favoured [...] "strong steam" [...] i.e. non condensing engines in which the steam pressure alone drove the piston and was then exhausted to atmosphere. The advantage of strong steam as he saw it was that more work could be done by smaller volumes of steam; this enabled all the components to be reduced in size and engines could be adapted to transport and small installations. To this end he developed a long cylindrical wrought iron horizontal boiler into which was incorporated a single fire tube, at one end of which was placed the fire grate. The gas flow was then reversed into a passage or flue beneath the boiler barrel, then divided to return through <b>side</b> <b>flues</b> to join again at the chimney (Columbian engine boiler). Evans incorporated his cylindrical boiler into several engines, both stationary and mobile. Due to space and weight considerations the latter were one-pass exhausting directly from fire tube to chimney. Another proponent of [...] "strong steam" [...] at that time was the Cornishman, Richard Trevithick. His boilers worked at [...] and were at first of hemispherical then cylindrical form. From 1804 onwards Trevithick produced a small two-pass or return flue boiler for semi-portable and locomotive engines. The Cornish boiler developed around 1812 by Richard Trevithick was both stronger and more efficient than the simple boilers which preceded it. It consisted of a cylindrical water tank around 27 ft long and 7 ft in diameter, and had a coal fire grate placed at one end of a single cylindrical tube about three feet wide which passed longitudinally inside the tank. The fire was tended from one end and the hot gases from it travelled along the tube and out of the other end, to be circulated back along flues running along the outside then a third time beneath the boiler barrel before being expelled into a chimney. This was later improved upon by another 3-pass boiler, the Lancashire boiler which had a pair of furnaces in separate tubes side-by-side. This was an important improvement since each furnace could be stoked at different times, allowing one to be cleaned while the other was operating.|$|R

[...] On the north wall of the nave is the frame of a lancet window; there are two similar window frames in the chancel.

40|$|As large floor-fired {{furnaces}} {{have many}} applications in refinery and (petro-) chemical units and about 80 % of heat transfer in these furnaces is by radiation, the accurate description of {{radiative heat transfer}} is of the most importance for accurate design and optimization. However, the impact of using different radiation models in coupled furnace/reactor simulations has never been evaluated before. Therefore, coupled furnace/reactor simulations of an industrial naphtha cracking furnace with a 130 kt/a capacity have been conducted. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for the furnace side, while the one-dimensional reactor model COILSIM 1 D {{was used for the}} reactor simulations. The Adiabatic, P- 1, discrete ordinates model (DOM), and discrete transfer radiation model (DTRM) were evaluated for modeling the radiative heat transfer. The results with DOM and DTRM are very similar both on the furnace and the reactor <b>sides.</b> The <b>flue</b> gas temperature using DOM is higher than when using the P- 1 radiation model, resulting in higher incident radiation. Comparing the simulated results of all radiation models to the industrial product yields and run lengths shows that DOM and DTRM outperform the others. As DOM has a broader application range than DTRM, and because the current implementation of DTRM in FLUENT/ 14. 0 cannot be run in parallel yet, DOM is the recommended radiation model for run length simulations of steam cracking furnaces...|$|R
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} landmark {{to the north}} of the summit is the ruins of the flue chimney of the former lead works at Ballycorus. Open-cast mining began at this site, just below the western <b>side</b> of the <b>flue</b> chimney, around 1807 and the site was taken over by the Mining Company of Ireland (MCI) in 1826 who undertook underground mining in the area intermittently up until 1863. Two veins of lead and a vein of silver were worked during this period. However, most of the activity at Ballycorus occurred at the smelting facility constructed by MCI in the valley below the mine workings. Here, lead from Ballycorus, as well as lead from mines in counties Donegal, Wicklow and Wexford, was processed using a reverberatory furnace. After the mine was exhausted in the 1860s, the smelting facilities continued to receive and process ore from MCI's mines at Glendalough, County Wicklow. In the 1880s it was no longer commercially viable to process Irish ores and the smelter was put to work processing ore from the Great Laxey mine in the Isle of Man up until closure in 1913.|$|R
40|$|Fixed-bed {{reactors}} for partial oxidation {{of methane}} to produce synthetic gas bear a hot-spot problem. To avoid this problem, an alternative reactor, {{which is called}} shell and tube type microreactor, has been developed in this work. Combustion and reforming reactions are integrated in this reactor. The microreactor used in this work consists of a 1 cm outsidediameter, 0. 8 cm inside-diameter and 11 cm length tube, and a 1. 8 cm inside-diameter shell. The tube is made of dense alumina and the shell of quartz. Two different methods ? dip and spray coating ? were performed to coat the tube side with LaNixOy catalyst. Gaseous reactants burn in the tube <b>side</b> to produce <b>flue</b> gases which in turn flow countercurrently and react in the shell side to yield reforming products.

40|$|The Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W) has {{completed}} {{a program to}} design, construct, install, and field test a ceramic-based high-temperature burner-duct-recuperator (HTBDR) in an industrial setting. The unit was capable of operating in corrosive, high temperature (2250 oF) flue gas streams. The HTBDR was successfully tested in a steel soaking pit at B&W's Tubular Products Division in Koppel, Pennsylvania. The ceramic stage consisted of 50 bayonet style ceramic tube-in-tube assemblies supported by an insulated metallic tubesheet and sealed with a ceramic fiber product. The heat exchanger was designed to take maximum advantage of radiation heat transfer, minimize pressure drops on both the air and <b>flue</b> <b>sides,</b> and minimize thermal stresses and fouling. Modeling of the bayonet assemblies determined the outer-to-inner tube spacing to optimize the air-side pressure drop and heat transfer within the tubes. During the 1400 hour operation prior to plant closing, the ceramic stage performed well with no material related problems or air-to-flue leakage. Maximum preheat air produced was 1425 ?F with a flue gas temperature of 2250 oF. Measured fuel savings of 17 - 24 % were obtained over the previous recuperated (metallic heat exchanger) system. This projects a savings of 41 % for an unrecuperated furnace.

40|$|In {{our modern}} society {{there is a}} great need for the {{production}} of food, feed and raw materials from alternative sources of biomass. In the search for answers to the future food challenges and for sustainable production of raw materials, insects and microalgae offer excellent opportunities. Thomas More provides, in cooperation with KU Leuven, multidisciplinary research on the growth and use of insects and microalgae for various applications. Both insects and microalgae possess numerous of interesting properties to serve as resources in a biobased economy. Insects are omnivorous animals with a high fecundity. They can be reared easily on a relatively small surface. They feature excellent feeding conversions and can be grown on organic side streams obtained from industry and farming. Additionally, insects are high value biomass, considering their protein and lipid composition and the presence of chitin. Microalgae are another promising source for a sustainable supply of high-value biomolecules such as fatty acids, anti-oxidants, vitamins and essential amino acids which can be used as food additives, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well as in aquaculture, feed and the chemical industry. Algae doesn’t require fertile farmland, they can be cultivated in salt water not suitable for drinking and they are able to process various aqueous <b>side</b> streams and <b>flue</b> gases. In Thomas More, research on insects as well as algae is performed on both laboratory scale and pilot scale. The insect research focuses on testing the processing of different organic side streams with different insect species. The effect of the different diets on the nutritional composition of the insects can be further investigated. Moreover, different compounds can be extracted, both on laboratory scale and pilot scale. Together with the industry, we look for interesting applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Currently, Thomas More, together with KU Leuven, investigates also the possibilities to process insects into human food and as a protein source in broiler feed. The algae research focuses on the optimization of the cultivation conditions for different algae strains, to stimulate different metabolic pathway, to valorize different side streams and above all to obtain a sustainable and economic viable production process with high yields.

40|$|General Electric (GE) has {{developed}} an approach whereby native mercury reduction on fly ash can be improved by optimizing the combustion system. This approach eliminates carbon-rich areas in the combustion zone, making the combustion process more uniform, and allows increasing carbon content in fly ash without significant increase in CO emissions. Since boiler excess O{sub 2 } can be also reduced {{as a result of}} optimized combustion, this process reduces NO{sub x} emissions. Because combustion optimization improves native mercury reduction on fly ash, it can reduce requirements for activated carbon injection (ACI) when integrated with sorbent injection for more efficient mercury control. The approach can be tailored to specific unit configurations and coal types for optimal performance. This report describes results of a U. S. DOE sponsored project designed to evaluate the effect of combustion conditions on 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and integrate combustion optimization for improved mercury and NO{sub x} reduction with ACI. The technology evaluation took place in Lee Station Unit 3 located in Goldsboro, NC and operated by Progress Energy. Unit 3 burns a low-sulfur Eastern bituminous coal and is a 250 MW opposed-wall fired unit equipped with an ESP with a specific collection area of 249 ft{sup 2 }/kacfm. Unit 3 is equipped with SO{sub 3 } injection for ESP conditioning. The technical goal of the project was to evaluate the technology's ability to achieve 70 % mercury reduction below the baseline emission value of 2. 9 lb/TBtu, which was equivalent to 80 % mercury reduction relative to the mercury concentration in the coal. The strategy to achieve the 70 % incremental improvement in mercury removal in Unit 3 was (1) to enhance 'naturally' occurring fly ash mercury capture by optimizing the combustion process and using duct humidification to reduce flue gas temperatures at the ESP inlet, and (2) to use ACI in front of the ESP to further reduce mercury emissions. The program was comprised of field and pilot-scale tests, engineering studies and consisted of eight tasks. As part of the program, GE conducted pilot-scale evaluation of sorbent effect on mercury reduction, supplied and installed adjustable riffle boxes to assist in combustion optimization, performed combustion optimization, supplied mobile sorbent injection and flue gas humidification systems, conducted CFD modeling of sorbent injection and flue gas humidification, and performed mercury testing including a continuous 30 -day sorbent injection trial. Combustion optimization was the first step in reduction of mercury emissions. Goals of combustion optimization activities were to improve 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and reduce NO{sub x}. Combustion optimization included balancing of coal flow through individual burners to eliminate zones of carbon-rich combustion, air flow balancing, and burner adjustments. As part of the project, the original riffle boxes were replaced with Foster-Wheeler's adjustable riffle boxes to allow for biasing the coal flow between the coal pipes. A 10 -point CO/O{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} grid was installed in the primary superheater region of the back pass to assist in these activities. Testing of mercury emissions before and after combustion optimization demonstrated that mercury emissions were reduced from 2. 9 lb/TBtu to 1. 8 lb/TBtu due to boiler operation differences in conjunction with combustion optimization, a 38 % improvement in 'native' mercury capture on fly ash. Native mercury reduction from coal was {approx} 42 % at baseline conditions and 64 % at optimized combustion conditions. As a result of combustion optimization NO{sub x} emissions were reduced by 18 %. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed to study the flow distribution and sorbent injection in the post air heater duct in Lee Station Unit 3. Modeling of the flow pattern exiting the air pre-heater demonstrated that because of the duct transition from a circular opening at the exit of air-pre-heater to a rectangular ESP inlet duct, flow separation occurred at the corners after the transition. Modeling also demonstrated that the flow was severely biased from the South side to the North side due to the bend of the duct. Results of CFD modeling were used to design lances for better sorbent distribution across the ESP inlet duct. Modeling of water injection demonstrated that because of flue gas temperature biasing, the droplet evaporation rate was slower on the North side than that on the South side of the duct. Modeling suggested that an improvement of water droplet evaporation could be achieved by closing the lance on the North <b>side</b> where <b>flue</b> gas temperatures were lower. Preliminary evaluation of the effect of carbon-based sorbents on mercury reduction took place in a 1 MBtu/hr (300 kW) Boiler Simulator Facility using the same coal as fired at Lee Station...|$|R
