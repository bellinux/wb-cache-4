[...] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it's the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique's movies, and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame." [...] Ella Taylor of L.A.

[...] The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling effect of individual thought and expression. [...] That danger is especially real in the University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. [...] In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and to learn. [...] The quality and creative power of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and attainment. [...] For the University, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the Nation's intellectual life, its college and university campuses.|$|E

In addition, focusing on firm level characteristics we find that the exporting firms attract foreign owners, who acquire controlling equity stakes.

40|$|A {{continuing}} goal {{of experiments}} {{is to understand}} risky decisions when the decisions are important. Often a decision’s importance {{is related to the}} magnitude of the associated monetary stake. Khaneman and Tversky (1979) argue that risky decisions in high stakes environments can be informed using questionnaires with hypothetical choices (since subjects have no incentive to answer questions falsely.) However, results reported by Holt and Laury (2002, henceforth HL), as well as replications by Harrison (2005) suggest that decisions in “high ” monetary payoff environments are not well-predicted by questionnaire responses. Thus, a potential implication of the HL results is that studying decisions in high stakes environments requires using high <b>stakes.</b> <b>Here</b> we describe and implement a procedure for studying high-stakes behavior in a low-stakes environment. We use the binary-lottery reward technique (introduced by Berg, et al (1986)) to induce preferences {{in a way that is}} consistent with the decisions reported by HL under a variety of stake sizes. The resulting decisions, all of which were made in a low-stakes environment, reflect surprisingly well the noisy choice behavior reported by HL’s subjects even in their high-stakes environment. This finding is important because inducing preferences evidently requires substantially less cost than paying people to participate in extremely high-stakes games. ...|$|R

40|$|In this piece, Rob Kass {{brings to}} bear his {{insights}} {{from a long}} career in both theoretical and applied statistics {{to reflect on the}} disconnect between what we teach and what we do. Not content to focus just on didactic and professional matters, the focus of his 2009 article (Brown and Kass, 2009), in this commentary he proposes a remake of the foundations of inference. He proposes to replace two fundamental “isms”—frequentism and Bayesianism—with a new “ism”—“pragmatism; ” an approach that he puts forward as more ecumenical and practical, enshrining in foundations what good statisticians already do. There is a lot to commend in this piece, particularly the emphasis on the subjunctive nature of all modelbased inference, and I am sure the other commentators will do justice to its strengths. But in spite of its clarity and initial promise, I found Kass’s proposal ultimately unsatisfying. It seems less a new foundational philosophy than a call for a truce, one of many over the years. It is telling that all of the examples show practical equivalence between Bayesian and frequentist estimates, so the biggest <b>stakes</b> <b>here</b> seem to be what people think, not what they do. The difficulty with “big tent ” foundations is that in circumstances where different philosophies within the tent dictate different actions, there is no guidance as to what route to take. It is interesting to contrast this with the philosophic version of “pragmatism, ” originally put forth by the polymath C. S. Peirce in the late 1800 s [also credited with proposing the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of evidence (Hacking, 1965) ], whose intellectual heirs include...|$|R
40|$|This project {{comprises}} of {{a response}} much recent ecocriticism that has, in a polemical move, dismissed nature writing {{and the notion of}} “nature” as uncritical. In what follows, I attempt to outline a symptomatic method of reading that critiques these texts while at same time insisting on their relevance to contemporary critical thought. My primary theoretical approach consists of an active repositioning of the work of deconstructive literary critic Paul de Man. I use de Man’s rhetorical critique of hermeneutics to argue that reading texts of nature writing—Henry David Thoreau’s “Ktaadn,” Jack London’s The Call of the Wild, and Edward Abbey’s Desert Solitaire—succeed in producing the experience of alterity commonly attributed to the “natural” in the ways they force us to examine the nexus of language and meaning. Put simply, reading these texts “wildly,” which is to say rhetorically {{in such a way that}} they begin to disarticulate themselves, produces an encounter with otherness in that which is most human—language. In doing so, I argue that the close reading of literature has a crucial place in critical environmental studies because it problematizes the very position with which it begins, the human. What is typically lost in the contemporary critical humanities is otherness. The <b>stakes</b> <b>here</b> are high. Without an insistence on the otherness of the nonhuman, what we call nature, we struggle—as do many in the critical humanities—to articulate a case for both active conservation and non-intervention in the nonhuman world. Without an ability to articulate such a case, we seem doomed to continue down the road of the Anthropocene—the road of extinction and environmental crisis...|$|R
