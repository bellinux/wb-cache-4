The template design problem involves printing several variations of a design onto one or more <b>stencil</b> <b>sheets,</b> where the aims are to minimize the number of stencils {{as well as the}} overproduction of prints of a particular design.

Creating {{physical}} stencils from 3 D meshes {{is a unique}} rendering challenge {{that has not been}} previously addressed. The task is a problem of two competing goals: forming a single, well-connected and stable <b>stencil</b> <b>sheet,</b> while simultaneously limiting the error introduced by pieces of bridging material. Under these conflicting goals, it can often be difficult to create visually pleasing stencils from complicated imagery by hand. Even for well-behaved images, expressive stencils can be time-consuming to craft manually. We present a method for generating expressive stencils from polygonal meshes or images. In our system, users provide input geometry and can adjust desired view, lighting conditions, line thickness, and bridge preferences to achieve their final desired stencil. The stencil creation algorithm makes use of multiple metrics to measure the appropriateness of connections between unstable stencil regions. These metrics describe local features to help minimize the distortion of the abstracted image caused by stabilizing bridges. The algorithm also uses local statistics to choose a best fit connection that maintains both structural integrity and local shape information. We demonstrate our algorithm on physical media including construction paper and sheet metal...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{template}} design {{problem is}} a constrained optimization problem originated from the printing industry. It involves printing several variations of a design onto one or more <b>stencil</b> <b>sheets,</b> where the aims are to minimize the number of stencils {{as well as the}} overproduction of prints of a particular design. Over the years, exact solution methods have been used to solve the problem. These methods could be useful for small to moderate-sized problem instances. However, when the problem instances are huge, the search space may easily grow too large for the systematic approaches. To date, no meta-heuristic or soft computing techniques have been used for this problem. In this paper, we propose the use of Extremal Optimization (EO) with multiple search operators for solving the template design problem. Different combinations of the search operators are tested via extensive numerical experiments. The results show that EO is indeed a feasible approach for template design optimization. The hybridization of EO with a deterministic local search has proven to be particularly effective. I...|$|R

One folder contains inward wartime cables {{from the}} British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (WINCH) to the Australian Prime Minister, dated December 1941 to April 1945. The other folder holds outward cables from John Curtin (JOHCU) sent in response, dated December 1941 to January 1945. This folder {{also contains a}} cable dated 4 October 1941 from Arthur Fadden (ARDEN) to Prime Minister Churchill.

5000|$|A.B. Dick owned {{a patent}} on a {{mimeograph}} machine, {{which was designed to}} print multiple paper copies of papers by exuding ink through apertures in a <b>stencil</b> onto paper <b>sheets.</b> Dick sold one of the patented machines to Miss Christina B. Skou. A plate had been fastened to the machine, reading that the machine was [...] "sold by the A.B. Dick Company with the license restriction that it may be used only with the stencil, paper, ink, and other supplies made by A. B. Dick." [...] Sidney Henry then sold to Miss Skou a can of ink suitable for use upon the mimeograph machine, with knowledge of the license agreement, and with the expectation that she would use the ink with the machine.|$|R
25|$|Special {{permission}} {{was given}} to only three families to produce bingata. Each family had their own designs which they passed onto future generations. There were a total of 45 dyers, the best residing {{in the capital of}} Shuri. To make the <b>stencils,</b> thin <b>sheets</b> of mulberry paper were glued together with persimmon tannin, making them thick and durable. Then they were smoked and aged, and finally the designs were drawn onto the paper and cut. Making bingata kimonos was labor-intensive, and only royalty or the wealthy could afford them. The designs were held under strict control, and the distinction between classes was easily recognized by the kimono worn. Patterns for the royal household were very bold and colorful, while the general public wore simple and dark patterns of indigo or black. Only the royal family wore the yellow, while nobility wore pale blue. On special occasions, the commoners were given permission to wear certain special colors. The women in the royal family were very particular about their kimonos and forbade anyone to copy the same kimono pattern style. The patterns painted on the kimono were usually birds, flowers, rivers, and clouds on silk, linen, and bashofu (a cloth woven from musa basjoo fiber).|$|R
