40|$|Background. Sunscreens usually {{protect the}} skin against {{harmful effects of}} sunlight. These {{products}} contain two effective physical and chemical components, which protects the skin from sunlight. Sun protection factor (<b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F)</b> is a critical factor indicating the effect of sunscreen against sunlight. &# 13; Methods. To measure <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> of sunscreens, various in-vivo and in-vitro methods have been established. In this study, two in-vitro methods were used. In 'Transpore tape' method, sunscreen product was dispersed uniformly on the substrate to obtain a surface coverage of 2 mg/cm 2 of the product. Transmittance measured spectrophotometerically, and then <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> was calculated. In the second method (solvent method) different concentrations of test products were prepared in methanol. The sample's transmittance were measured to evaluate <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F.</b> &# 13; Results. Results of the first method indicated a good linear relationship between measured <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> and the labled <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> (r= 0. 97). Results of the second method indicated that relatively a good relationship exisit between log of measured <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> and labled <b>S.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>F</b> (r= 0. 88). &# 13; Discussion. The transport tape method is fairly simple, feasible and importantly {{the surface of the}} tape {{is similar to that of}} the skin.

40|$|The {{absorption}} spectra of the hydrated electron in 1. 0 to 4. 0 M LiCl or LiClO 4 deuterated water solutions were measured by pulse radiolysis techniques from room temperature to 300 °C {{at a constant}} pressure of 25 MPa.

Quantum classical molecular dynamics (QCMD) simulations of an excess electron in bulk water and {{in the presence of a}} lithium cation have been performed to compare with the experimental results. According to the QCMD simulations, the change in the shape of the spectrum is due to one of the three p-like excited states of the solvated electron destabilized by core repulsion. The study of <b>s</b> <b>f</b> <b>p</b> transition energies for the three p-excited states reveals that for temperatures higher than room temperature, there is a broadening of each individual <b>s</b> <b>f</b> <b>p</b> absorption band due to a less structured water solvation shell. 1...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the effect of radiotherapy on testicles with different treatment positions and plans for rectal cancer patients. Settings and Design: Mono-institutional prospective study. Patients and Methods: Three different plans; supine 4 -fields (<b>s</b> 4 <b>f),</b> prone 4 -fields (<b>p</b> 4 <b>f),</b> and prone 3 -fields (<b>p</b> 3 <b>f)</b> of 15 male patients with rectal carcinoma receiving 45 Gy pelvic radiotherapy were evaluated. Testicular doses in each plan were calculated. Since the localizations of the primary tumor may affect testicular dose, boost doses were not taken into account. Statistical Analysis Used: Kruskal Wallis test, Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis. Results: Median cumulative testicular doses of <b>s</b> 4 <b>f,</b> <b>p</b> 4 <b>f,</b> and <b>p</b> 3 <b>f</b> plans were 19. 8, 69. 3, and 100. 8 cGy, respectively (P = 0. 013). Median V 0. 5 (Volume receiving more than 0. 5 Gy) and V 1 (Volume receiving more than 1 Gy) for testicles were also significantly lower in <b>s</b> 4 <b>f</b> plans (3 %, 60. 7 %, and 78. 1 % for V 0. 5 and 0. 3 %, 35. 8 %, and 52. 3 % for V 1 in <b>s</b> 4 <b>f,</b> <b>p</b> 4 <b>f,</b> and <b>p</b> 3 <b>f,</b> respectively) (<b>P</b> = 0. 001).

40|$|Genomic {{analysis}} has revealed {{the existence of}} a large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with different functions in a variety of organisms, including yeast. Cells display dramatic changes of gene expression upon environmental changes. Upon osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are induced by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) p 38 /Hog 1. Using whole-genome tiling arrays, we found that Hog 1 induces a set of lncRNAs upon stress. One of the genes expressing a Hog 1 -dependent lncRNA in antisense orientation is CDC 28, the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK 1) that controls the cell cycle in yeast. Cdc 28 lncRNA mediates the establishment of gene looping and the relocalization of Hog 1 and RSC from the 3 ′ UTR to the + 1 nucleosome to induce CDC 28 expression. The increase in the levels of Cdc 28 results in cells able to reenter the cell cycle more efficiently after stress. This may represent a general mechanism to prime expression of genes needed after stresses are alleviated.

40|$|First {{published}} online: September 15, 2011 BACKGROUND The {{relation between}} Chlamydia trachomatis infection and subsequent tubal damage is widely recognized. As such, C. trachomatis antibody (CAT) testing {{can be used}} to triage women for immediate tubal testing with hysterosalpingography (HSG) or laparoscopy. However, once invasive tubal testing has ruled out tubal pathology, CAT serology status is ignored, as its clinical significance is currently unknown. This study aimed to determine whether positive CAT serology is associated with lower spontaneous pregnancy rates in women in whom HSG and/or diagnostic laparoscopy showed no visible tubal pathology. METHODS We studied ovulatory women in whom HSG or laparoscopy showed patent tubes. Women were tested for C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with either micro-immunofluorescence (MIF) or an ELISA. CAT serology was positive if the MIF titre was ≥ 1 : 32 or if the ELISA index was > 1. 1. The proportion of couples pregnant without treatment was estimated at 12 months of follow-up. Time to pregnancy was considered censored at the date of the last contact when the woman was not pregnant or at the start of treatment. The association between CAT positivity and an ongoing pregnancy was evaluated with Cox regression analyses. RESULTS Of the 1882 included women without visible tubal pathology, 338 (18 %) had a treatment-independent pregnancy within 1 year [estimated cumulative pregnancy rate 31 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 27 – 35 %]. Because of differential censoring after 9 months of follow-up, regression analyses were limited to the first 9 months after tubal testing. Positive C. trachomatis IgG serology was associated with a statistically significant 33 % lower probability of an ongoing pregnancy [adjusted fecundity rate ratio 0. 66 (95 % CI 0. 49 – 0. 89) ]. CONCLUSIONS Even after HSG or laparoscopy has shown no visible tubal pathology, subfertile women with a positive CAT have lower pregnancy chances than CAT negative women. After external validation, this finding could be incorporated into existing prognostic models. <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> <b>P.</b> J. Coppus, J. A. Land, B. C. Opmeer, P. Steures, M. J. C. Eijkemans, P. G.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of interaction dynamics in signaling pathways can {{shed light on}} pathway architecture and provide insights into targets for intervention. Here, we explored the relevance of kinetic rate constants of a key upstream osmosensor in the yeast high-osmolarity glycerol-mitogen-activated protein kinase (HOG-MAPK) pathway to signaling output responses. We created mutant pairs of the Sln 1 -Ypd 1 complex interface that caused major compensating changes in the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants (kinetic perturbations) but only moderate changes in the overall complex affinity (Kd). Yeast cells carrying a Sln 1 -Ypd 1 mutant pair with moderate increases in kon and koff displayed a lower threshold of HOG pathway activation than wild-type cells. Mutants with higher kon and koff rates gave rise to higher basal signaling and gene expression but impaired osmoadaptation. Thus, the kon and koff rates of the components in the Sln 1 osmosensor determine proper signaling dynamics and osmoadaptation.

40|$|First {{published}} online: November 18, 2010 BACKGROUND Laparoscopy {{has been}} {{claimed to be}} superior to hysterosalpingography (HSG) in predicting fertility. Whether this conclusion is applicable to a general subfertile population can be questioned as data {{in support of this}} claim were collected in third line centres. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prognostic capacity of HSG and laparoscopy in a general subfertile population. METHODS In 38 centres, we prospectively studied a cohort of patients referred for subfertility between 2002 and 2004, who underwent HSG and/or laparoscopy as part of their subfertility work-up. Follow-up started immediately after tubal testing and ended 12 months thereafter. Time to pregnancy was censored at the of date last contact, when the woman was not pregnant or at the start of treatment. Kaplan–Meier curves for the occurrence of spontaneous intrauterine pregnancy were constructed for patients without tubal pathology, for those with unilateral tubal pathology and for patients with bilateral tubal pathology at HSG or laparoscopy. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to calculate fecundity rate ratios (FRRs) to express associations between tubal pathology and the occurrence of an intrauterine pregnancy. RESULTS Of the 3301 included patients, 2043 underwent HSG only, 747 underwent diagnostic laparoscopy only and 511 underwent both. At HSG, 322 (13 %) patients showed unilateral tubal pathology and 135 (5 %) showed bilateral tubal pathology. At laparoscopy, 167 (13 %) showed unilateral tubal pathology and 215 (17 %) showed bilateral tubal pathology. Multivariable analysis resulted in FRRs of 0. 81 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 59 – 1. 1] for unilateral, and 0. 28 (95 % CI: 0. 13 – 0. 59) for bilateral, tubal pathology at HSG. The FRRs at laparoscopy were 0. 85 (95 % CI: 0. 47 – 1. 52) for unilateral, and 0. 24 (95 % CI: 0. 11 – 0. 54) for bilateral, tubal pathology. CONCLUSIONS Patients with unilateral tubal pathology at HSG and laparoscopy had a moderate reduction in pregnancy chances, whereas those with bilateral tubal pathology at HSG and laparoscopy had a severe reduction in pregnancy chances. This reduction was similar for HSG and laparoscopy, suggesting that HSG and laparoscopy have a comparable predictive capacity for natural conception. H. R. Verhoeve, <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> <b>P.</b> J.

40|$|L'auteur résume les derniers développements survenus dans le secteur public québécois depuis la grève générale de 1972. Après avoir effectué une brève rétrospective des {{incidents}} rencontrés dans cette négociation, il décrit les principales orientations qui se dégagent tant du point de vue des structures de négociation que de celui des mécanismes de règlement des conflits en vue de la prochaine ronde de négociation. No major {{development has}} taken place in Quebec, since 1972, regarding public service staff relations. Some minor events and important discussions are worth mentioning for they will have a definite impact on future negotiations. It must be recalled that, except on a few points that will be mentioned in due course, public service staff relations in Quebec fall under the general law of labour relations as contained in the Quebec Labour Code, especially in section 99 regarding strikes in public services. BARGAINING STRUCTURESThese are eight bargaining units, one of which, subdivided between white and blue collar workers, contains more than 75 % of all public servants (see Table 1). The union representing these employees was certified in the Stature itself. The other units comprise special groups such as professionals, teachers employed by the government and peace officiers; these groups were certified by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, on the recommendation of a joint committee. Practically all Quebec public servants are unionized. Any conflict respecting the bargaining unit is decided, since 1969, by the Labour Court. An important case is now pending concerning all casual workers, white and blue collar workers. Having signed up more than 1000 of them, the union (the « Syndicat des fonctionnaires provinciaux du Quebec » — <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> <b>P.</b> Q.) has applied, in March 1973, to represent them all; the investigation commissioner dismissed the case, in January 1974, on the ground that he had no jurisdiction, because the Civil Service Commission had withdrawn these employees from the application of theCivil Service Act, and placed them under special regulations. On appeal, the Labour Court ruled that such withdrawal did not deprive these employees from their rights under theLabour Code. The file has been returned to the investigation commissioner to complete his enquiry. All collective agreements in the Quebec public service will terminate on June 30, 1975, except that of the peace officers (prison guards and the like) which expired June 30, 1974. Bargaining for these employees has been going on since the Spring of 1974, and an agreement has been reached in principle (September 1974) waiting to be ratified by the members. Through a labour relations committee, amendments have been made to the other agreements, on points such as sick leave banks and travel expenses. The government has refused to reopen the agreements on the cost-of-living problem; he agreed to pay earlier than foreseen in the agreement part of a cost-of-living bonus, on a lump-sum basis, scheduled for a later date. As for the bargaining structure of the next round, all interested unions are favouring sector bargaining rather than common front bargaining at one single table. Even at the sector level, interunion cartels are not guaranteed. Coordinated bargaining is much more likely to occur than any other form centralized bargaining. Greater centralization could come through government decision, either by legislation — present Bill 46 has to be replaced before June 30, 1975 — or by pressure on bargaining agents to agree on another unit. There is also the possibility of a multi-tier system, some subjects or general rules being bargained at a central table, other matters at various level sector tables. IMPASSE RESOLUTION AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKEThe Civil Service Act contains only two provisions regarding impasse resolution and the right to strike. Peace officers are forbidden to strike, and no other group of government employees may go out on strike unless the essential services to be maintained have been determined by mutual agreement or by decision of the Labour Court. For the rest, the Labour Code applies to civil servants as for all other public service employees. Common front experience of 1972 had raised forcefully the problem of essential services. To try to solve this problem with general rules, Bill 89 — « An Act to ensure public well-being in case of labour conflict » — was introducedin the National Assembly in December 1972. It would give the government great powers in public service disputes. Following a decision by a three-person committee that a work stoppage would endanger public health, safety, welfare or education, the Cabinet could, {{in the case of a}} government public service, suspend the right to strike, while the dispute was referred to the proper parliamentary committee. A secret vote on the last offers was to be held afterwards by a poll commissioner; if accepted by a majority of employees, these offers would become the collective agreement; otherwise the government would then remove the strike prohibition or refer the dispute to the National Assembly for settlement. In non-government public services, the same procedure could be followed, or the case could be referred to « commissioners on disputes » for a last-offer-selection type of arbitration. The reaction from all sides was so bad that the Minister of Labour finally withdrew the Bill. In July 1974, Bill 24 was tabled containing many amendments to various parts of the Labour Code, but nothing on section 99. The Advisory Council on Labour and Manpower had discussed possible formulas for impasse resolution without coming to a consensus, mainly on essential services. The union members of the Council advocated mediation board intervention, on the essential services to be maintained, if the parties could not agree; the board recommendations would be published to enlist public pressure on the parties, but there would be no compulsory decision. The management members considered such decision by an out-side body necessary for the protection of the public. The Labour Minister has endorsed publicly the no-coercion position, both on the determination of essential services and on the content of the collective agreement. He underlined that compulsory intervention with binding decision, brings no solution to labour disputes; it leads the parties to refuse to shoulder their responsibilities and often induces them to reject such decisions. It is not clear however how much support the Minister will be able to secure on such a position in his own party caucus. The civil servants union has come up with different recommendations. It suggests that mediation services should be granted only on joint application, but that arbitration should be available at the request of one party; the arbitration award should be made public but it would not be binding. On the question of essential services the <b>S.</b> <b>F.</b> <b>P.</b> Q. considers that a list should be maintained up-to-date by a joint permanent committee; in case of a strike, failing agreement of the parties on the list, a decision should be made by the Labour Court. What will finally come out of such conflicting opinions is hard to know. The no-coercion approach is appealing to labour experts; the apparent security of a legal way to determine at least essential services may be more palatable to the public in general and probably to most of the National Assembly members. SCOPE OF BARGATNINGAs in all other jurisdictions, scope of bargaining for public servants is restricted in Quebec mainly on questions that fall in the realm of the Civil Service Commission, especially on classification and promotion. Classification is the sole responsibility of the Commission, but the very first collective agreement, in 1966, stated that the forthcoming new classification would abide by certain principles, some of them were spelled out in the agreement. The new classification was approved in 1967, but difficulties grew out immediately. A consultative committee for its revision was soon in operation; it was made up of government, union and Commission representatives. Following this revision, the government and the union signed a formal agreement determining the process for the integration of civil servants into the new classification; an appeal procedure was included, with binding arbitration as the final step. 14, 000 cases were appealed, and 2, 000 submitted to arbitration, nearly half of which were won by the union. In its next round of bargaining, the union plans to go after joint decision on any modification or new classification. According to the current agreement, a joint committee was to make recommendations on rules that would permit an unsuccessful candidate to a higher class to be informed of the reasons of his failure, and to have the right to appeal any discriminatory decision. No progress has been made on this point, and the union will try to have these rights written out in the next agreement. To protect the merit principle, seniority cannot be considered for appointment or promotion of a white collar civil servant ; for blue collar morkers, it can be used only in cases of equal competence among two or more candidates. With the progressive encroachment of the collective agreement and joint committee activities on its various responsibilities, the Civil Service Commission progressively loses its decision powers and looks more and more as an administrative arm of the Civil Service Department; it might eventually become simply a division of the Department, the agreement and the union taking up the duties the Commission had to protect the civil servant against arbitrary decisions. CONCLUSIONSIn trying to extend the scope of bargaining and to obtain more accurate definitions of the bargaining units — as in the case of casual workers — the civil servants unions carry on the work of bringing greater rationalization in the whole structure and general rules of the Civil Service itself. The future bargaining structures are uncertain. No one wishes to reenact the chaotic situation of the 1972 common front. But the most important actor, the government, remains silent for the time being concerning its intentions. The impasse resolution system is in the process of being changed. Conflicting opinions on very basic approaches appear to block any proposal, at this point, for revision of the all-important section 99 of theLabour Code...|$|E
