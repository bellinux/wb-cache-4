Applying the resulting grid to German data from the Socio-economic Panel shows that a structural change in the production process is driving the skill composition of the German labor force. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a decomposition of productivity gap between South-Korea and Estonia {{for the year}} 2006. After presenting stylised facts related to income conver-gence, we apply shift-share analysis to explain the patterns of structural disparities both at aggregated sectoral level and within the manufacturing sector. We propose an extension to conventional shift-share analysis with using relative productivity indi-cators. Decomposition shows that the overall productivity gap is mainly related to the manufacturing sector. The results show that at <b>sectoral</b> <b>view,</b> discrepancies in productivity levels of individual sectors (within-effect) play the dominant role in productivity gap formation, whereas we find some support for the structural-bonus hypothesis within the manufacturing sector. In line with the previous studies, relative-ly high productivity in financial intermediation and real estate sector as a feature of young market economies was confirmed...|$|E

40|$|A {{major goal}} {{concerning}} the energy transition in Germany is {{the reduction of}} energy usage. In Germany in 2011, private households consumed 2194 PJ and {{have been identified as}} a sector with high energy reduction potential. The energy demand of this sector is dependent on many linked quantitative and qualitative factors (e. g., number of persons and demographic structure, expenditures, cost of energy-saving measures, willingness to invest, and level of coordination in international climate policy). In our study, we introduce a multilevel cross-impact approach which allows for the definition and quantification of data for scenario analysis while taking the interdependences between different factors on the global, national and sectoral levels into account. This approach makes it possible to overcome limitations that conventional energy models are usually confronted with. By applying a trend analysis in combination with information on the interdependence of relevant factors on the global and national levels, consistent <b>sectoral</b> <b>views</b> of the private household's future are created...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses legal, methodological and political frameworks {{for the development}} of the proposed Portuguese Marine Spatial Plan initiated in 2008. It considers lessons learned and is informed by discussions that have taken place since publication of the ‘Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: Achieving Common Principles in the EU’. New goals are based on horizontal planning tools that cut across sea-related sectoral policies and support joined up policy making. It is in this context that Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) emerged as an essential process for sustainable decision making. The OSPAR Commission undertook an overview of national planning systems within its administrative boundaries, which confirmed spatial plans reduced conflicts. However, problems exist accessing good quality data and dealing with entrenched <b>sectoral</b> <b>views.</b> Furthermore, the transboundary nature of marine resources requires cooperation between neighbouring states. In 2006, Portugal developed a ‘National Sea Strategy’ that recognized the importance of developing its maritime space while valuing marine habitats and biodiversity. MSP development of the Portuguese sea commenced in 2008 and findings are now evaluated. They showed adaptation of existing tools to be possible and desirable, provided undertaken cautiously and found conceptual ambiguities were barriers to conflict resolution. Furthermore they showed management strategies should be designed and analysed on a case by case basis, recognising temporal and spatial variations...|$|R

In this context, concerns have arisen that poor government policies and inadequate donor coordination have reduced the effectiveness of such assistance. The paper discusses the sources of policy success and policy failure of such international assistance programmes within a principal-agent framework that models the influence of misaligned objectives, differing incentive structures, asymmetric information and moral hazard facing the different actors in the institutional structure of assistance programmes. In this political economy approach the varying influences on multiple principals and agents are key determinants {{of the effectiveness of}} policy. The paper takes a <b>sectoral</b> <b>view</b> in examining assistance programmes in the vocational education sector, where large donor effort has been applied in the Western Balkans over the last decade to modernise and reform the education system.

This process of improving the structural aspects of the industry was initiated in the 1985 Textile Policy, which {{for the first time}} took a <b>sectoral</b> <b>view</b> of the industry.

Although the funds policy wasdriven by the opportunity of entailing new resources to ST&I, {{it has become a}} significantfunding tool, representing nowadays as much as 30 % of the MCT investments. The above notwithstanding, there is evidence that resources from the funds onlyrestores MCT investments back to the historical level. Available data also indicatesa low participation of the productive sector, which is attributed to a failure of the usedmechanisms to engage firms, particularly SMEs, in the programme. In addition sharedmanagement between the agencies was not achieved due to asymmetries in the controlof resources, operational capacity and established practices used to support ST&I. Finally, the text comments the restructure of the funds management in 2003,which concentrated power in the recently created Comissão de Coordenação dosFundos Setoriais.

40|$|Why did EC {{enlargement}} {{negotiations with}} Spain take so long? This thesis argues that agricultural issues dominated negotiations despite {{the political and}} strategic aims of stabilizing Western Europe's southern flank that underpinned the raison d'être of this enlargement. The framework of Historical New Institutionalism is used to argue that several 'biases' operating at three levels account for the length and nature of these negotiations. At the first level, the 'bilateral' format of the negotiation procedure between Spain and the EC favoured existing EC members and protected the acquis communautaire. The Community's negotiating positions, as bargains in themselves, tended to be inflexible, and reduced Spain's input in the discussions and in the agenda-setting process. At the EC level, the CAP exhibited an unusual capacity to withstand the changes required by enlargement. This was because the EC's decisionmaking structure was fragmented into sectors and levels which allowed a closely knit 'policy community' to run the CAP {{in a way that}} was relatively insulated from other issue-areas. Change in the CAP occurred to cope with enlargement, but in a path-dependent way, passing the cost of adaptation on to Spain. At the national level, member states' so-called national interests with regard to enlargement were mixed, with no clear priority, and conflicting <b>sectoral</b> <b>views.</b> This resulted from the mechanisms of interest intermediation and inter-departmental co-ordination, which shaped the formulation and representation of national views in Brussels. Spain's accession was finally made possible when new redistributive policies for the Mediterranean and fresh budgetary resources were agreed. These were approved as part the wider package-deals surrounding the Single Market project and the Single European Act. HNI provides a new and persuasive framework with which to understand the difficulties of institutional change associated with enlargement negotiations. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{enactment}} of ocean-related legal and policy instruments {{and the establishment}} of ocean-mandated institutions driven by the United Nations in the past 30 years have not succeeded in protecting the oceans and their resources as the continuing depletion of ocean resources and deterioration of marine ecosystems attest. It is assumed that the overall system of ocean governance is plagued by problems characterised by a sectoral approach towards management and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments as well as institutional organisations. This thesis utilises principles of international law as analytical tools to argue that their introduction in the legal and institutional frameworks for ocean governance can contribute to reducing these governance problems. These principles are cooperation, integration, ecosystem and precautionary approaches. The selected principles of international law were chosen because all of them are compatible with the notion that ocean problems are interrelated and multi-dimensional in their nature. It is argued that the negative effects of the governance problems can be reduced if the interrelated and multi-dimensional nature of the oceans is recognised through the inclusion of the principles of international law within the text of ocean-related legal and policy instruments and in the practice of ocean-mandated institutions. It is concluded that the inclusion of the above-referred principles in several of the ocean-related policy and legal instruments and in the practice of some institutions contributed to a shift in paradigm in ocean governance from a prevalence of <b>sectoral</b> <b>views</b> and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments and institutions to a more holistic approach in ocean management. The thesis gives particular consideration to linkages (or their absence) among sectoral management initiatives from a legal and institutional perspective. The results suggest that despite the shift to a more holistic approach in ocean management, there still remain problems due to the prevalence of a dichotomy in ocean governance between the widespread approach towards single use and sectoral management and new approaches that support more integrated, cooperating, ecosystem and precautionary approaches towards ocean governance. This thesis also offers suggestions on how some of the persisting governance problems can be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{integration}} and mainstreaming {{is the process}} that ensures consideration of environmental sustainability in development projects. The agenda for promoting environmental sustainability has been firmly set at the local, regional and national levels {{through a variety of}} conventions and legislation. However, mechanisms for developing the capability and capacity to realize these goals remain elusive. Natural scientists have one <b>sectoral</b> <b>view</b> of coastal resources, embedded in a numeric and reductionist framework, whereas social scientists take the opposite approach. Policymakers and other stakeholders will have their own perspectives. A more holistic view of stakeholders ’ perceptions of the coast from those charged with determining coastal policy and implementation can permit sources of conflict to be identified by managers and appropriate action to be taken. Capacity building is one tool that can lead to an increase in the perceptions of stakeholders ’ needs and coastal resource issues in coastal managers. However, much training in integrated coastal management (ICM) focuses on increasing scientific knowl-edge rather than providing a robust framework for management. Recent work in developing capacity in state-level Indian coastal managers has had a more holistic approach, encompassing not just science, but socio-economic and governance issues also. In addition, this capacity-building approach uses a ‘virtual scenario ’ approach, in which groups of delegates are required to develop a strategic ICM plan for a local 20 – 40 km stretch of coast. An ICM matrix is used to provide a framework for understanding the coast and the impact of management interventions. This ‘virtual scenario ’ approach, coupled with experience in conflict reduction matrices, has been shown to provide coastal managers with a wider appreciation of stakeholder conflict in the coastal zone...|$|E

Inter- and intra-livelihood diversification dynamics and effects on choice and intensity of participation in farm and nonfarm activities have been analysed using a three-period panel dataset on 464 households located in 8 villages of two distinct geoeconomic and agroecological zones of Ghana. This research is situated within the debate {{of whether or not}} the agriculture-led rural poverty reductionrenaissance is pragmatic in terms of both analytical and policy thinking of rural economic development. Almost every conclusion reached depends on isolation or proximity to "national capital, anti agro-productive potential of study area under rain- fed conditions. First of all, the notion of a shift from farm to nonfarm oriented rural livelihoods is rather a hyperbole. Quality of human capital, access to other productive assets, price and income risk sensitivity are the most important determinants of choice of, and returns to rural livelihood activities. Second, in high agro-potential zones, both farm and nonfarm oriented livelihood strategies produce similar welfare outcomes. Third, concerning diversification within agriculture, resource allocation to high-value crops enhances household food security in high agro- productive potential zones. Fourth, farm productivity is decreasing in pluriactivity, suggesting that returns to nonfarm labour supply must more than offset the value of productivity loss from agriculture if a household is to maintain a given level of welfare. Finally, neither farm nor nonfarm productivity was responsible for rural poverty exit in the 2000 s; spatial location of household, living in a female headed household, human capital quality and rural - urban linkages through urban social network capital were the drivers of poverty exit. So, 'livelihood-led poverty reduction policy thinking' appears more pragmatic than a <b>sectoral</b> <b>view</b> of rural development policy and practice.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{component}} of my conceptual foundation paper due to PhD field work in Indonesia to understand the possibility and the chance for developing country such as Indonesia to strengthen cluster building alongside The Triple Helix model within the region of Java. This paper is a conceptual paper based on case study in Indonesia related to the Triple Helix and cluster approach for chosen Industrial Clusters in Java. In this paper, the {{focus will be on}} six selected industrial clusters across the Java region. They are Gresik Industrial District in East Java, Tugu Wijaya Semarang in Central Java, Sentul Bogor in West Java, Jababeka in Bekasi, Kujang Industrial District, and Kawasan Berikat Nusantara in Jakarta. In conjunction with the fact in Indonesian industrial condition, Indonesian government initiated the setting up of industrial district which later known as 2 industrial cluster to make existence easier for both domestic and international investors by providing all necessary infrastructure, facilities and housing in one safe location - at a reasonable cost - thus providing a secure base for industry and manufacturing. Regarding clustering approach, Indonesia has a very long tradition of SMEs (Small and Medium Sized Enterprises) cluster around similar activities. In 2002, the cluster comprised approximately 3700 firms mostly SMEs employing 58. 000 permanent workers (Loebis and Schmitz, 2005). They are usually craft industries and export oriented driven. About 70 % of the cluster production is exported while the rest is sold on the domestic markets. However, {{little is known about the}} critical success factors that determine economic development of cities and regions and empirical studies that draw lessons for policy are scarce (Tichy, 1998), specifically for implementing cluster approach in industry/manufacturing sector in Indonesia. Moreover, there are good reasons to doubt to what extent a purely <b>sectoral</b> <b>view</b> is adequate to analyse region economic growth and to design policies. There are many indications that urban economic growth increasingly seems to emerge from fruitful cooperation between economic actors, who form innovative networks. It is in these geographically concentrated network configurations, or ‘cluster’ that value-added and employment growth in urban regions is realised. This demands a new policy approach in urban economic development, specifically for Indonesian study. Accordingly, it is motivating to investigate the process of cluster building in industrial district in Java region as the important region due to economic, social, and political condition. Thus, details can be read in the following section within this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of accounting for {{the role played by}} institutions in the dynamics of technical change and growth in a policy oriented perspective.

Approaches like that of the National Systems of Innovation starts from a <b>sectoral</b> point of <b>view,</b> i. e. science and technology, and progressively extend the range of institutions considered in the analysis with a logic of connection between institutions and fields. Other institutionalist approaches consider the whole range of institutions affecting economic behaviour and make no a-priori restrictions. This paper pleads for an intermediate approach where the selection of relevant institutions is guided by the concept of complementarity of institutions. We distinguish two types of institutional complementarities, and we indicate some possible developments relevant for economic policy. ...|$|R

In many areas a strict integration emerges between manufacturing production and endowment of tertiary functions; in other regions the sparse presence of services may result in belated development or slow growth.

From a geographical point of view, a territorial grid based on local labour market areas as proposed by Istat [1997] is adopted. The long-term analysis - based on Census data from 1981 to 1996 - allows to identify territorial regularities in development patterns across LLMAs, with respect to manufacturing and services and to different growth paths (convergence, externalisation, integration, [...] .) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the euro}} area wage structure {{and its potential}} determinants from a <b>sectoral</b> point of <b>view.</b> Merging information from the OECD Structural Analysis database with data from the EU Labour Force Survey, we construct a cross-country panel of 22 industries in eight euro area countries for the period 1991 - 2002. Descriptive inspection of this data set confirms {{the existence of a}} stable inter-industry wage structure which is rather similar across euro area countries and which exhibited fairly small changes over the 1990 s. We then apply panel data techniques in order to identify factors explaining inter-industry wage differentials in the euro area. Both workforce characteristics (e. g., human capital variables) and firm-related characteristics (e. g., capital intensity or apparent productivity) contribute significantly. However, considerable wage heterogeneity across sectors remains. Idiosyncratic country and in particular sector specifics implying different socio-cultural and institutional backgrounds, such as the extent of unionisation or the degree of centralisation of collective bargaining, bear a major role. In some sectors, unobservable specifics even overcompensate for the influence of observable determinants...|$|R

A variety of river engineering works such as large-scale dike shifting, channel dredging, and large-scale retention are in a planning or implementation stage.

In order to examine different strategies for sustainable management the German Federal Institute of Hydrology (Bundesanstalt für Gewässerkunde) initiated a project to develop a prototype tool for integrated management of the Elbe catchment, which includes functionalities related to inland navigation, water quality, flood safety, and vegetation ecology. From the beginning of the project onwards great value was attached to the involvement of end-users in the design process. The experience of the project is that internal consistency of models and data, effective communication, and functional flexibility are essential to find a proper balance between scientific standards, the availability of models, and the requirements of users...|$|R

Microfiche. xii, 153 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe {{unemployment rate}} in Japan has increased after the first oil crisis. Though its level is still low compared to other industrialized countries, the upward trend is significant. It is widely held that changes in labor supply, especially extensive female labor force participation are primarily responsible for this trend. This study uses sectoral shift theory to investigate the effects of rapid changes in labor demand across sectors on the Japanese unemployment rate. Sectoral shifts such as large relative price changes, rapid technological changes and shifts in output demand require reallocation of labor across sectors. If labor is specific to a sector, sectoral shift disturbances could increase the unemployment rate. The <b>sectoral</b> shift <b>view</b> differs much from conventional view of the business cycle. They explain aggregate fluctuations by aggregate demand movements. The sectoral shift argument attributes aggregate fluctuation primarily to allocative disturbances across sectors. In this study, the distinction between these two disturbances is essential. Previous methods developed in macroeconomics and the sectoral shift literature are employed. The two oil crisis and volatile exchange rate movements generated large variations among industrial sectors. Firms are now quicker to adjust their employment level. Regional imbalances of labor markets are observed. However, statistical tests using unemployment rate equations {{do not support the}} sectoral shift hypothesis. Japanese-specific aspects of labor markets are posited as reasons for this rejection. Japanese firms tend to avoid dismissals by utilizing various measures such as changes in hours worked, personnel transposition within a firm, loaning workers to related or new businesses, and hiring newly graduates in expanding sectors. They do not dismiss workers until other alternatives are exhausted and a demand decline is found to be persistent. In general, the flexibility of Japanese labor markets mitigates the effect of sectoral shifts...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyLatin American {{manufacturing}} industry has undergone various changes in recent years. It has registered a favourable performance {{as far as}} exports are concerned, but production and investment have grown only slowly {{in a context of}} sluggish recovery of domestic demand and greater foreign competition. Other features are greater specialization in natural resource-based intermediate goods characterized by the importance of economies of scale, relatively long lead times for the heavy investments required, and the presence of privatized and transnational enterprises. At the same time, there are signs of the emergence of a varied range of competitive manufacturing activities of a scale which is as yet too small to be clearly reflected in the aggregate indicators. This article reviews some of these cases and concludes {{that it is necessary to}} establish a favourable environment for this type of activities: to this end, higher productivity needs to be promoted at the enterprise level. Finally, from a <b>sectoral</b> point of <b>view,</b> emphasis is placed on the need to continue to promote exports, adding new products and exploring new markets, while it is also noted that competitiveness on the domestic market needs to be raised, as this market continues to be the main source of demand for industry in the region...|$|R

40|$|Mainly {{approached}} from a <b>sectoral</b> point of <b>view,</b> {{the process of}} administrative convergence {{is first and foremost}} structurally supported by the European procedures governing the European decision-making process. The paper argues that the ordinary legislative procedure itself has acted as a transversal vector of the administrative convergence process both on the formal and informal levels. The ordinary legislative procedure provides very sophisticated tools that contribute throughout the whole cycle of a legislative proposal to the administrative convergence. The impact assessments and the compliance tests with the Charter of Fundamental Rights including the right to a good administration ensures ex ante that the draft legislative proposals meet the basic requirements for a good administrative final act. On an institutional level, the active national experts defending their interests in various structures of the Council of the EU have the possibility to add real national value to each European piece of legislation and thus to play the part of convergence agents. At the same time, the interplay of the European institutions {{within the framework of the}} ordinary legislative procedure, formerly known as the codecision procedure, had triggered sophisticated strategies that also directly contributed to the administrative convergence in the European Union. It is in this realm, on the basis of some concrete examples, through the analysis of some tools provided by the ordinary legislative procedure that the paper shows how the rules underlying the very creation of the EU law have horizontally contributed to the process of European administrative convergence.
