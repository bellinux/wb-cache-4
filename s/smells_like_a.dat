We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet, {{according to}} reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant {{portrayal of the}} districts and streets of London, and Waters' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women's Review of Books. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty's hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan's hands are covered with [...] "those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and whelks, which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family {{for so many years}} we had ceased, entirely, to notice them." [...] Nan is mortified that she <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are [...] "breathlessly and wittily detailed".|$|E
500|$|Roque Strew of Pitchfork Media found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a [...] "liability", {{specifically}} noting {{difference in}} pronunciation between the studio versions of [...] "Destiny" [...] and [...] "Distractions" [...] and the live performances. Strew complimented [...] "Pictures" [...] and [...] "Lentil", {{the latter of}} which shined through the [...] "fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants". Popmatters' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was [...] "robotic" [...] and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels [...] "infuriating", even unintelligible at times. Schiller did, however, favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice [...] "occasionally transcendent". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY appreciated [...] "Pictures" [...] but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for [...] "incomprehensible" [...] vocals due to her slurring of words. McCaighy concluded that, like other live albums, Lady Croissant was redundant but would be appreciated by fans. The Australian publication DNA published a mixed review of the album in 2010 following the release of We Are Born, complimenting Sia's vocals but suggesting that [...] "Pictures" [...] sounded like a B-side and that the album's release <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cash-in" [...] on her [...] "recent success".|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

In 2003, Garcia and Owens's relationship turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public {{praise for the}} play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic [...] "we can not let the sickness spread" [...] remark, prompting Owens to wear a surgeon's mask at the following practice. Following Owens's trade to Philadelphia, Owens was asked in a Playboy interview if he thought Garcia was gay, to which he responded, [...] "If {{it looks like a}} rat and <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rat, by golly, it is a rat."

2500|$|In {{the first}} episode, [...] "Forever Ware'" [...] Marshall says, [...] "Dad's job {{is one of}} the reasons we moved here, because, {{statistically}} speaking, Eerie's the most normal place in the entire country". [...] This is a reference to the Middletown studies which served as a sociological case study of Muncie, Indiana in the 1920s and 1930s. Several references are also made to the popular children's show Sesame Street. For example, the two twin boys are named Bertram and Ernest, or Bert and Ernie for short. Also, when Marshall is testing a baloney sandwich made in 1974, he says, [...] "It <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baloney sandwich. It looks like a baloney sandwich." [...] This is in reference to the Sesame Street character the Cookie Monster.|$|E
2500|$|By late 1963, Clay {{had become}} the top {{contender}} for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knock outs, Clay was a 7–1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him [...] "the big ugly bear". [...] "Liston even <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bear", Clay said. [...] "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo." [...] Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that [...] "someone {{is going to die}} at ringside tonight". Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.|$|E
2500|$|Television {{advertisements}} {{are also}} parodied. As an example {{there is a}} song and visual sequence in the episode [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust" [...] that was modeled after Ford commercials. The sequence is a parody of a commercial for a sport utility vehicle, and Hank Williams Jr. sings a song about the fictional [...] "Canyonero" [...] accompanied by country guitar music and whip cracks. The song [...] "Canyonero" [...] closely resembles the theme to the 1960s television series Rawhide. The first verse of the song is: [...] "Can you name the car with a four-wheel drive / <b>Smells</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> steak and seats thirty-five? / Canyonero! / Canyonero!" [...] Turner wrote positively of the Canyonero spoof piece in Planet Simpson, calling it [...] "a brilliant parody of an SUV ad". In {{an article in the}} journal Environmental Politics Steve Vanderheiden commented that the Canyonero reflected an [...] "anti-SUV" [...] stance by The Simpsons. In an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about SUV owners, Vicki Haddock wrote [...] "SUV owners have become something of a punch line, succinctly captured in a [...] "Simpsons" [...] parody touting the apocryphal Canyonero [...] " ...|$|E

They had bad <b>smells,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beetle cupboard or a scented old man. I read on of witchcraft and devils, yet hated the cloud they cast over me--like some horrible treacle in the mind. But as for the authors who just reasoned about Time and God and Miracles, and so on, I poked about in them willingly enough; but my imagination went off the other way--with my heart in its pocket. Possibly without knowing it. But I do know this: that never to my dying day shall I learn what a common-sized person with a pen or a pencil, can not make shocking, or be shocked at. It seemed to me that to some of these authors the whole universe was nothing better than a Squid, and a very much scandalized young woman would attempt to replace their works on the shelves.|$|E

You can also forget them, and leave them there. Then people complain of a smell of burning, and hope the house is not on fire, and you ease their mind by explaining to them that it is probably only your boots. Complicated internal arrangements are worked by a key. If you put on too much fuel, and do not work this key properly, the thing explodes. And if you do not put on any coal at all and the fire goes out suddenly, then likewise it explodes. That is the only way it knows of calling attention to itself.

Eats a candied roseleaf. Lies at rest in the silence and solitude of his room for hours; mustn't read, mustn't smoke. The doctor comes and feels of his heart, now, and his pulse, and thumps his breast and his back and his stomach, and listens for results through a penny flageolet; then orders the man's bath--half a degree, Reaumur, cooler than yesterday. After the bath another egg. A glass of sewage at three or four in the afternoon, and promenade solemnly with the other freaks. Dinner at 6--half a doughnut and a cup of tea. Walk again.

He was the heart of all the scene; On him the sun looked more serene; To hill and cloud his face was known,-- It seemed the likeness of their own; They knew by secret sympathy The public child of earth and sky.

The watercourses were my guide; I travelled grateful by their side, Or through their channel dry; They led me through the thicket damp, Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp, Through beds of granite cut my road, And their resistless friendship showed. The falling waters led me, The foodful waters fed me, And brought me to the lowest land, Unerring to the ocean sand. The moss upon the forest bark Was pole-star when the night was dark; The purple berries in the wood Supplied me necessary food; For Nature ever faithful is To such as trust her faithfulness. When the forest shall mislead me, When the night and morning lie, When sea and land refuse to feed me, 'T will be time enough to die; Then will yet my mother yield A pillow in her greenest field, Nor the June flowers scorn to cover The clay of their departed lover.' ...|$|E
