Further changes were made in 1845, and in 1864 bowlers were finally free to bowl overarm.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{gravitational waves}} are those with constant frequency. The waves given {{off by a}} spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron star would be approximately monochromatic: a pure tone in acoustics.

However, there would be <b>some</b> <b>change</b> in the measured signal, because of Doppler shifting caused by {{the motion of the}} Earth. Despite the signals being simple, detection is extremely computationally expensive, because of the long stretches of data that must be analysed.|$|E
25|$|Resultative constructions are set {{syntactic}} patterns used {{to express}} resultativeness. Within these structures, the object NP is viewed as having undergone <b>some</b> <b>change</b> of state, and the change {{is viewed as a}} result achieved through the action expressed by the combination of the verb and the result phrase. The word order of the elements is said to be constant and crucial in conveying the resultative meaning; under this analysis, the output in its entirety is regarded as having a more complex meaning {{than the sum of its}} components' individual meanings. This constructional approach has been proposed in order to account for the semantic differences between standalone verbs that have no intrinsic resultative meaning and their resultative counterparts (e.g. hammer versus hammer flat).|$|E
25|$|Following their {{performance}} in 2003 Cork {{were regarded as}} one of the favourites to take the championship title in 2004. <b>Some</b> <b>change</b> to the team saw star forward Setanta Ó hAilpín depart while former star Brian Corcoran made a dramatic comeback. Cork's plan came unstuck in the Munster final when 14-man Waterford defeated O'Grady's side by a single point. This game is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest provincial finals ever played. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final via the qualifiers and, for the second year in-a-row, Kilkenny provided the opposition. After a poor first-half the sides were evenly matched, however, the final 23 minutes saw Cork score nine points without reply from Kilkenny. O'Grady had led Cork out of the doldrums and to an All-Ireland title.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} the 101 Bison Film Company. On August 23, 1910, the New York Clipper announced that J. W. Kerrigan had joined Universal Studios and would {{star in a}} new series of films directed by Allan Dwan. The first film listed was titled [...] "A Restless Spirit" [...] (The Restless Spirit) and the second film would be Shon the Piper. It is unknown if there was <b>some</b> <b>change</b> in Shon the Pipers production or if the Clipper was mistaken because neither Kerrigan or Dwan are credited. Instead, Otis Turner would direct the film and the film would star Robert Z. Leonard and Margarita Fischer. Prior to his motion picture debut, Leonard previously had a noted stage career in the California Opera Company in a variety of roles and sung in over a hundred light operas. Joseph Singleton played The Laird of the Isla and would be credited through and answer column in The Photo-play Journal. The cast of the film was not billed or credited in the production. Michael Blake credits Lon Chaney in a role in this film in his book, The Films of Lon Chaney. Jon C. Mirsalis states that he cannot confirm or deny an appearance by Lon Chaney, but notes that the surviving film still does not show Lon Chaney.|$|E
500|$|Four main {{strategies}} {{have been used}} by translators. The first leaves all characters' names unchanged and in their original spelling: thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting, but the liveliness of the pun is lost. Eva Malagoli varied this source-oriented approach by using both the English Christian names and the adjective earnest, thus preserving the pun and the English character of the play, but possibly straining an Italian reader. A third group of translators replaced Ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language, favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original. For instance, in Italian, these versions variously call the play L'importanza di essere Franco/Severo/Fedele, the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety, and loyalty. French offers a closer pun: [...] "" [...] is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness, so the play is commonly known as De l'importance d'être Constant, though Jean Anouilh translated the play under the title: Il est important d'être Aimé ("" [...] is a name which also means [...] "beloved"). These translators differ in their attitude to the original English honorific titles, <b>some</b> <b>change</b> them all, or none, but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of Englishness. Lastly, one translation gave the name an Italianate touch by rendering it as Ernesto; this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages.|$|E

Marriage ceremonies, which can be more or less formal, include rituals which are universal in nature and hold sociological importance.

2500|$|Oncogenes promote cell growth {{through a}} variety of ways.
