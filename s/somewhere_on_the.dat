It was found <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It {{was moved to}} a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then toughened {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, sometimes as few as ten rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There were also a few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E

5|$|Leif {{was the son}} of Erik the Red and {{his wife}} Thjodhild, and the {{grandson}} of Thorvaldr Ásvaldsson, and distant relative of Naddodd, who discovered Iceland. He was a Viking in the early days. His year of birth is most often given as c. 970 or c. 980. Though Leif's birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas, it is likely he was born in Iceland, where his parents met—probably <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of Breiðafjörður, and possibly at the farm Haukadal where Thjóðhild's family {{is said to have been}} based. Leif had two brothers, whose names were Thorsteinn and Thorvaldr, and a sister, Freydís.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets were worth an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no longer so lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E
5|$|The current {{construction}} of the al-Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in Palestine. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell, referring to a testimony by Arculf, a Gallic monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes {{the possibility that the}} second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Umar ibn al-Khattab, erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Mu'awiyah I, and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by Ealdred son of Eadulf since 913. Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and {{this led to a}} battle <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the River Tyne, probably at Corbridge where Dere Street crosses the river. The Battle of Corbridge appears to have been indecisive; the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is alone in giving Constantine the victory.|$|E
5|$|The one militia man {{killed in}} battle, Thomas Jefferson Short, was later buried <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site where the}} battle occurred. The battle was devastating for Black Hawk and his band, {{despite the fact that}} much of his band escaped across the Wisconsin River; {{casualty}} estimates were as high as 70 dead Sauk and Fox, including those killed in action and those drowned. Even so, at least one source called the battle, along with Stillman's Run, one of Black Hawk's major military triumphs.|$|E

According to the stone tablets, the actual location of the Crystal is hidden <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ancient map. Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches the map. As the two struggle for the map, the map is torn to shreds.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{invasion}} of Wales, {{the area around}} the village of Raglan was granted to William FitzOsbern, the Earl of Hereford. Some historians, such as John Kenyon, suspect that an early motte and bailey castle may have been built on the Raglan site during this period: the location had strategic importance and archaeologists have discovered the remains of a possible bailey ditch on the site. The local manor was held by the Bloet family from the late 12th century until the late 14th century, and the family built a manor house <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site during this period, surrounded by a park. By the late medieval period the Raglan site was surrounded by the large deer parks of Home Park and Red Deer Park, the latter being enclosed {{at the end of the}} period.|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} on the arduous journey {{south along the}} western slopes of the Maya Mountains, during which he lost most of his horses. The expedition became lost in the hills north of Lake Izabal and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, and crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E

5|$|Narseh {{declared}} war on Rome in 295 or 296. He appears to have first invaded western Armenia, where he seized the lands delivered to Tiridates in the peace of 287. Narseh moved south into Roman Mesopotamia in 297, where he inflicted a severe defeat on Galerius in the region between Carrhae (Harran, Turkey) and Callinicum (Raqqa, Syria) (and thus, the historian Fergus Millar notes, probably <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Balikh River). Diocletian {{may or may not}} have been present at the battle, but he quickly divested himself of all responsibility. In a public ceremony at Antioch, the official version of events was clear: Galerius was responsible for the defeat; Diocletian was not. Diocletian publicly humiliated Galerius, forcing him to walk for a mile at the head of the Imperial caravan, still clad in the purple robes of the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1525 the {{expedition}} {{arrived at the}} Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the next week.

5|$|Hernán Cortés only {{received}} sporadic {{reports of}} developing events in Honduras, and became impatient for its incorporation into his command. Hopeful of discovering new riches, {{he decided to}} travel to Honduras in person. Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. En route, he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. During the arduous journey from Lake Petén Itzá to Lake Izabal, both now in Guatemala, Cortés lost many men and horses. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, where he found the near-starving remnants of González Dávila's colonists, who received him joyfully. Cortés waited there {{for the rest of}} his army to regroup over the next week, and explored the local area for supplies. By this time the remnants of Cortés' expedition were reduced to a few hundred. Cortés sent some of González Dávila's colonists south to the Naco Valley, which was swiftly pacified under the command of Gonzalo de Sandoval, one of Cortés' lieutenants. Cortés then abandoned attempts to colonise Nito, and sailed to Puerto de Caballos with his entire company.|$|E

By this time the remnants of {{the expedition}} had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés constructed an improvised brigantine and, accompanied by canoes, he ascended the Dulce River to Lake Izabal, with about 40 Spaniards, and a number of Indians. He at first believed he had reached the Pacific, but soon realised his error. At the western end of the lake, he marched inland and engaged in battle with the Maya natives at the city of Chacujal, on the Polochic River. He seized plentiful supplies of food from the city and sent supplies back to Nito in the brigantine. He had rafts built to ferry supplies back downriver, and returned to Nito with them, while most of his men marched back overland. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} John occurs in 1188 {{when he was}} {{teaching}} at Oxford. This record notes that he witnessed a legal case decided by delegated judges for the Bishop of Lincoln. Along with a few other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John {{was among the first}} securely attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani {{and was one of the}} teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers. Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law, but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied <b>somewhere</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not securely attested. By the late 1190s, John was a member of the household of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides Walter, another of his patrons was Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen.|$|E

Old loggers who worked for him, such as Stewart Holbrook, claimed that Johnson had few equals as a woodsman at a time when a man working in the woods was judged by the smoothness of the scarf of his axe’s undercut.
