25|$|Many {{animals are}} capable of perceiving some of the {{components}} of the polarization of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear polarization of <b>sky</b> <b>light</b> is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun. This ability is very common among the insects, including bees, which use this information to orient their communicative dances. Polarization sensitivity has also been observed in species of octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and mantis shrimp. In the latter case, one species measures all six orthogonal components of polarization, and is believed to have optimal polarization vision. The rapidly changing, vividly colored skin patterns of cuttlefish, used for communication, also incorporate polarization patterns, and mantis shrimp are known to have polarization selective reflective tissue. Sky polarization was thought to be perceived by pigeons, which was assumed to be one of their aids in homing, but research indicates this is a popular myth.|$|E
500|$|In Albrecht Altdorfer's The Battle of Alexander at Issus, one of {{the most}} famous {{paintings}} produced by the Danube School, a composition similar to Vädersolstavlan renders the battle scene in a detailed landscape under a sky crowded with celestial symbols and messages. Just as in Vädersolstavlan, the view is not depicted as it would really appear, but is rather a composite of factual elements as known by the artist. In The Battle of Alexander at Issus the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Africa, and the Nile River are represented as known from contemporary maps, while the knights and soldiers are dressed in 16th century armours and the battle is depicted as retold in sources from Antiquity. [...] The frame suspended over the scene, a device which appears in many other German Renaissance battle scenes, is mirrored by the 17th century inscription in Vädersolstavlan. [...] In both paintings, Apocalyptic symbols in the sky are given a contemporary political significance. The realistically rendered <b>sky,</b> <b>light,</b> and clouds, in both paintings, are emblematic of the Danube School.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, two paintings, {{including}} Watusi (Hard Edge), [...] by Alma Thomas {{were chosen}} by First Lady Michelle Obama, White House interior designer Michael Smith and White House curator William Allman to be exhibited during the Obama presidency. Watusi (Hard Edge) was eventually {{removed from the}} White House due to concerns with the piece fitting into the space in Michelle Obama's East Wing office. <b>Sky</b> <b>Light,</b> on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, hung in the Obama family private quarters. In 2015, the Obamas hung Thomas's work Resurrection in the Old Family Dining Room. The painting is the first work by an African-American woman to hang in the public spaces of the White House {{as part of the}} permanent collection. The choice of Thomas for the White House collection was described as an ideal symbol for the Obama administration by New York Times art critic Holland Cotter. Cotter described Thomas' work as [...] "forward-looking without being radical; post-racial but also race-conscious." [...] Thomas' papers were donated in several periods between 1979 and 2004 to the Archives of American Art by J. Maurice Thomas, Alma Thomas' sister.|$|E

40|$|Light {{sources are}} an {{important}} part of physically-based rendering when accurate imagery is required. High-fidelity models of sky illumination are essential when virtual environments are illuminated via the sky as is commonplace in most outdoor scenarios. The complex nature of <b>sky</b> <b>lighting</b> makes it difficult to accurately model real life skies. The current solutions to sky illumination can be analytically based and are computationally expensive for complex models, or based on captured data. Such captured data is impractical to capture and difficult to use due to temporally inconsistencies in the captured content. This thesis enhances the state-of-the-art in <b>sky</b> <b>lighting</b> by addressing these problems via novel sky illumination methods that are accurate, practical and flexible. This thesis presents two novel sky illumination methods where; the first of which focuses on clear <b>sky</b> <b>lighting</b> and the second one deals with illumination from cloudy skies. The first approach compactly and efficiently represents sky illumination from both existing analytic sky models and from captured environment maps. For analytic models, the approach leads to a low, constant runtime cost for evaluating lighting. When applied to environment maps, this approach approximates the captured lighting at a significantly reduced memory cost, and enables smooth transitions of <b>sky</b> <b>lighting</b> to be created from a small set of environment maps captured at discrete times of day. This makes capture and rendering of real world sky illumination a practical proposition. Results demonstrate less than 4...|$|R
