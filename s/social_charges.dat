Trade liberalization for commodities intensifies the rural development challenge for OECD countries, such as depopulation, aging and economic stagnation.

A System Dynamics Model (SD model) is used to investigate effects of alternative rural revitalization strategies for Iitate.

Globalization is about access to and intrusion by new technology and ways of organizing business and knowledge. Liberalization is about trade. Lower input and output prices are first and foremost a trade issue. Thus, as border measures are reduced, the Iitate economy is exposed to lower priced foreign suppliers in both input and output markets, especially for raw materials (granite), electronics and clothing from China at this point in history.

40|$|In social scenes, humans {{interact}} with each other by sending visible social signals, such as facial expressions, body gestures, and gaze movements. Social cognition, the ability to perceive, model, and predict such social signals, enables people to understand social interactions and to plan their behavior in accordance with the understanding. Computational social cognition is a necessary function allowing artificial agents to enter the social spaces because it enables a socially acceptable behavior. However, two key challenges preclude developing computational social cognition: (1) the core attributes of social cognition such as attention, emotion, and intent are latent quantities that cannot be directly measured by existing sensors; (2) social behaviors are interdependent to each other, i. e., a unified representation is required to understand social behavior as wholes. In this thesis, we address these challenges by establishing a computational foundation towards social scene understanding from social cameras. A social camera is a camera held or worn by a member of a social group that inherits his/her gaze behavior. This social camera is an ideal sensor to capture social signals for three reasons: (1) social cameras naturally secure the best view because the wearers or holders intelligently localize the best view point to attend to what they find interesting; (2) social cameras produce more views of events of greater interest; (3) social cameras efficiently capture socially important events by following social behaviors when the scenes are dynamic. We leverage these advantages of social cameras to understand social scenes. We present a framework to develop social cognition by perceiving social signals, modeling the relationship between them, and predicting social behaviors. Social Signal Reconstruction: Reconstructing social signals in a unified 3 D coordinate system provides a computational basis to analyze social scenes, e. g., to build a model, reason about relationships, and predict social behaviors. We leverage social cameras to reconstruct three types of social signals: gaze movement, body motion, and general scene motion. (1) Gaze is a strong indicator of attentive behaviors. We model the gaze using the primary gaze direction that is emitted {{from the center of the}} eyes and aligned with the head orientation. This gaze model is reconstructed in 3 D by leveraging ego- and exo-motion of social cameras. (2) Human body motion such as gestures often conveys intent of social interactions. We model skeletal motion using a set of articulated joint trajectories where the distance between the trajectories of adjacent joints remains constant. This articulation constraint in conjunction with a temporal constraint is applied to reconstruct human body motion without an activity specific prior. (3) We further relax the articulation constraint to model general scene motion occurring in social interactions. We represent a 3 D trajectory using a linear combination of predefined trajectory basis vectors. We solve for the parameters of each trajectory by formulating it as a linear least squares system that allows us to reconstruct topology-independent motion and handle missing data. Social Behavior Understanding: Social behaviors are interactive by definition and therefore, an individual behavioral analysis in isolation cannot fully account for the fundamental relationship between behaviors. For instance, a social signal transmitted by one person can trigger responses in other and the responses can, in turn, affect the behavior of the person. A relational analysis between the signals is needed to characterize the social interactions. We exploit the reconstructed social signals in a unified coordinate system to understand the relationship between them. In particular, our analysis focuses on joint attention, the primary social attribute that is strongly corv related with attentive behaviors. We present a method to reconstruct 3 D joint attention modeled by social charges—latent quantities that form at locations where primary gaze directions of members in a social group intersect. Inspired by the study of electric fields, we model the relationship between gaze behaviors using a gradient field induced by the <b>social</b> <b>charges.</b> This gradient field allows us to predict gaze behaviors given <b>social</b> <b>charges</b> at any location in the scene. Our overarching goal is to develop computational social cognition that will enable artificial agents to accomplish their tasks in a socially acceptable way. This thesis takes a first step towards the goal by leveraging social cameras. We present a 3 D representation of social signals and based on the reconstructed signals, we build a relational model of social behaviors, which allows us to predict the behaviors. We apply our frameworks in real-world social scenes including sporting events, meetings, and parties...|$|E

Com isso, a indÃstria tÃxtil do Brasil vem perdendo participaÃÃo na economia do paÃs assim como no mercado mundial. Este comportamento tambÃm vem sendo verificado na indÃstria tÃxtil do CearÃ, onde as pesquisas conjunturais indicaram uma perda acima da mÃdia nacional. Diante desse contexto, este estudo tem a finalidade de investigar a competitividade da indÃstria tÃxtil brasileira e cearense. Para avaliar a competitividade do setor tÃxtil cearense, utilizou-se a teoria das Cinco ForÃas, de Michael Porter, com a construÃÃo de Ãndices em comparaÃÃo com os principais estados que compÃem o setor tÃxtil brasileiro. Para analisar a competitividade da indÃstria tÃxtil brasileira, foram mensurados os lucros do setor atravÃs de metodologia estatÃstica de dados em painel. Para esse trabalho foram utilizados os dados da Pesquisa Anual Industrial realizada pelo IBGE e os dados do Aliceweb. Os resultados indicaram que a indÃstria tÃxtil cearense apresenta elevada produtividade por trabalhador e um dos menores custos de produÃÃo. Mas o setor no estado indicou fragilidade no fornecimento de insumos pelo mercado externo e pouca diversidade de produtos. Quanto Ã indÃstria tÃxtil brasileira, percebeu-se que os lucros apresentam uma relaÃÃo positiva com relaÃÃo aos custos com matÃria-prima e salÃrio, e inversa com relaÃÃo Ãs despesas com encargos sociais. No Ãmbito macroeconÃmico, mostrou-se que o mercado externo influencia o setor tÃxtil em menor magnitude que os custos industriais.

In this way Brazilâs textile industry has been losing share in the economy on the country and also in the world market. This performance has also been observed in the textile industry of CearÃ, where the conjunctural researches indicated a loss above the national average. In this context, this study aims to investigate the competitiveness of textile industry of Brazil and CearÃ. It was used the PorterÂs five forces theory, with the construction of indexes compared with the main states comprising Brazilian textile sector to evaluate the competitiveness of the textile sector of CearÃ. Profits were measured through statistical methodology in a panel data, to analyse the competitiveness of Brazilian textile industry.

The results indicated that the textile industry of CearÃ showed elevated productivity per worker and one of the lowest production costs. But the industry in this state showed fragility in the supply of inputs by foreign market and little product diversity. As for Brazilian textile industry, we realized that the profits are positively related to the cost of raw material and wages and inverse expenses with <b>social</b> <b>charges.</b> In the macroeconomic extent, the results showed that the foreign market has less influence on the textile sector than the industrial costs...|$|E

40|$|Non-wage {{labour costs}} are {{relatively}} high in Austria. This is due, above all, {{to the level}} of employer contributions to social security, payroll-dependent charges, and the extent of non-productive times. If – in the interest of logical coherence – bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries) are added to base pay, the rate of non-wage labour costs amounts to 61. 4 percent of the hourly wage. Relative to the yearly income (corrected for non-productive times), non-wage labour costs (<b>social</b> <b>charges)</b> account for approximately one third of total labour costs. If the anticipated surpluses of the existing funds in the field of social security are used to reduce contributions rather than increase spending, there ought to be some scope for a lowering of non-wage labour costs in the years to come. This applies, in particular, to contributions to the family relief fund, the fund to secure wage and salary payments in the event of insolvency, accident insurance, subsidised housing construction, and – in view of the expected economic upswing – unemployment insurance. Reducing non-productive times is yet another way to lower non-wage labour costs. If all possibilities to reduce contributions are fully utilised in the coming years, non-wage labour costs can be cut by up to ATS 16 billion. In addition, the related reduction of employees' contributions by up to ATS 6 billion would not only result in higher net wages and stronger consumer demand, but also have a moderating effect on the increase of gross wages. However, a reduction of contributions requires a departure from the past practice of using potential surpluses to increase spending and/or transfer payments or redistributing them to the old-age pension system – which in turn limits the scope for budget consolidation. Moreover, the margin available for reductions of contributions cannot be fully utilised, unless appropriate reforms are implemented {{at the same time to}} take account of the changing priorities of economic and social policy. Reducing contributions has the added benefit of imposing a more stringent spending discipline, whereas surpluses from earmarked revenues tend to generate further expenditure increases. The effects of a reduction of non-wage labour costs on the economy and the labour market have been calculated on the basis of the WIFO macro-model: • The impact largely depends on whether and to what extent enterprises are willing to pass on the reduction of non-wage labour costs in the form of lower prices, which in turn would have a moderating effect on collective bargaining agreements. If the entire ATS 16 billion margin is used to lower non-wage labour costs and enterprises partly adjust their prices accordingly (as assumed in the model), this will translate into a growth of real GDP by 0. 3 percent and an increase in the number of persons in employment by 6, 400 (over baseline) after no more than two years. These effects continue to increase in subsequent years. • If the reduction of non-wage labour costs were passed on fully to prices, the effect would be about twice as strong: after two years, real GDP would be about 0. 7 percent higher, and the number of jobs would increase by 12, 300. The faster the cost reduction is passed on to buyers in Austria and abroad, the more favourable the effects on economic growth and employment.

O propósito foi analisar a relação existente entre os gastos do governo estadual e os principais índices econômicos e sociais – PIB, PIB Per Capita, IDH e GINI. A pesquisa iniciou-se com uma análise sobre a evolução do conceito de desenvolvimento, trazendo-o a uma abordagem contemporânea, onde se identificou, à luz do paradigma da complexidade e do critério de justiça social, que o termo desenvolvimento representa mais do que o simples crescimento econômico, abarcando as melhorias sociais da população. O procedimento metodológico {{principal}} consistiu da agregação das despesas públicas não-financeiras, realizadas no período de 1991 até 2005, por natureza e por função, que foram comparadas estatisticamente, através das técnicas de correlação e regressão, com os índices econômicos e sociais do estado de Pernambuco. Observou-se a existência de correlação positiva e significante entre os indicadores econômicos e sociais do Estado e as despesas públicas, classificadas por grupo de despesa e agrupamento por função. Para os indicadores econômicos, destacaram-se: Educação, Previdência Social, Segurança Pública, Trabalho e Pessoal e Encargos. Com relação ao IDH, destacaram-se Outras Despesas Correntes, Pessoal e Encargos Sociais, Segurança Pública e Previdência Social. O índice de GINI não apresentou correlação significativa e os modelos de regressão foram invalidados por problemas de ajustamento. Acredita-se que este trabalho significou mais um passo na busca pelo melhor conceito de desenvolvimento da sociedade; bem como, que contribuiu para demonstrar a possibilidade da utilização de métodos quantitativos, aliado a informações contábeis, econômicas e sociais, na análise da efetividade dos gastos públicos, buscando fornecer aos gestores e a sociedade em geral diretrizes eficazes e úteis na aplicação dos recursos públicos. This dissertation {{focuses on}} fiscal aspects, financial, {{economic and social}} State of Pernambuco, with focus on {{the actions of the}} public administration involved in local development. The purpose was to analyze the relationship between State Government spending and the main economic and social indices-GDP, per Capita GDP, HDI and GINI. The search began with an analysis of the evolution of the concept of development, bringing it to a contemporary approach, where identified, {{in the light of the}} paradigm of complexity and the criterion of social justice, that the term development represents more than simple economic growth, embracing the social improvements of the population. A theoretical framework was drawn up soon after, focusing on the role of the State in development, the evolution of thought political-economic regional, regional disparities in Brazil, the dynamics of the State of Pernambuco and the fiscal transfers in the Brazilian Federation. The main methodological procedure consisted of aggregation of non-financial, public expenditure made during the period from 1991 until 2005, by nature and by function, which were compared statistically through the techniques of correlation and regression, with the social and economic indices of the State of Pernambuco. A large part of the accounting data was extracted and treated in the General Accounting of the State, due to the fact that during this period were not reflected in the database, and the form of classification has been changed in several financial years. The economic and social indicators were obtained in the Department of information disclosure of IBGE, UNDP consultancy area and site of the IPEA. It was observed the existence of significant and positive correlation between economic and social indicators of the State and public spending, classified by expenditure group and group functions. For economic indicators, were: education, Social Security, public safety, work and personal charges. With respect to the HDI, stood out other current expenditure, personnel and <b>social</b> <b>charges,</b> public security and Social Security. The GINI index has not presented significant correlation and regression models were invalidated by adjustment problems.

40|$|Confiscated Growth Département des {{diagnostics}} de l'OFCE In 1986 {{both the}} price of oil and the exchange rate of the dollar have come back to levels more in line with market equilibrium. But these have not had the expected stimulating effects. The improvements in the terms of trade — particularly large in Europe and Japan [...] have slowed down the growth of general government and corporate net debt {{at a time when many}} developing countries have been forced to adopt severe financial measures. The flow of capital to the OECD countries has been balanced by a sharp reduction of the demand from the rest of the world, while important losses of market shares were conceded to the newly-industrialising countries. The recovery of private consumption has been significant, but not enough to stimulate investment. An important portion of corporate resources has continued to flow to the financial markets, contributing to keeping real interest rates high. In 1987 and early 1988 the slackening of demand in the United States and then its contraction, will dominate the international environment. In such a context the persistence of the American external deficit will aggravate monetary, trade and financial tensions. Faced with increased external competition and weak world demand, Japan and above all Europe will suffer seriously from any additional drop of the dollar. In France the likelihood of significant growth appears limited. Household consumption growth will slow down because of low wage increases, not fully compensated by a strong growth in non-wage income. The recovery of private investment will accelerate but its pace will remain slower than the improvement in profits. The growth of final domestic demand will tend to benefit foreign more than French suppliers, who are facing hightened competition in domestic and world markets from the South-East Asian countries. The trade balance could turn negative. A 1. 7 per cent GDP growth in 1987 will not be enough to stop unemployment from rising. A more expansionist economic policy could curb this upward trend, but there is a continuing risk of any surge in demand being captured largely by foreign competitors. expected slowdown of household consumption, the near-stagnation of investment, and the weakness of exports. Destocking following involuntary stockbuilding in the second quarter of 1986 is expected to depress activity in the first part of this year, notwithstanding some strengthening of final demand. A modest pick-up is therefore not likely until the second quarter, led by investment and exports. Household consumption is likely to recover only moderately, given the weak growth of real incomes. The slowdown in the growth of world demand, projected for around the end of this year, will again limit growth in 1988. Overall, GNP seems likely to grow by 1. 7 per cent in 1987 and 1. 3 per cent in 1988. As a result only part of the considerable increase in profits in 1985 - 86 seems likely to be used for productive investment. The risk of an upturn in inflation in France in the coming quarters seems small. The policy of strict control of public sector salaries, combined with rising unemployment, seems likely to lead to moderation in the overall growth of incomes : hourly wage rates are likely to increase by a modest 2. 8 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Output prices seem likely to stop growing faster than unit costs, except in the tertiary sector, which has not yet restored its margins to the levels of the 1970 s. On the assumption that {{the price of}} oil will stabilize around $ 16 per barrel at the end of the second quarter, the growth of the consumer price index will be around 2. 7 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Under the assumption of a progressive increase in the oil price to $ 20 by the end of 1988, inflation could be around 3 per cent both this year and next. In either case disinflation, as measured by the GNP deflator, will continue, with inflation falling from 5 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent in 1987 and 2. 5 per cent in 1988. Despite the modest growth of domestic demand and inflation, the external surplus of goods and services recorded in 1986 (around FF 21 billion) seems likely to be smaller this year because of a reduction in the manufactures balance of FF 15 billion. The decline in international competitiveness, due to the fall of the dollar since 1985, could be expected to result in some loss of market share. Nevertheless this is likely to be limited to 1. 5 points in 1987 and 1 point in 1988, compared with 3 points over the course of the last two years. The slow growth of employment in the market sector seen in 1986 risks being interrupted because of modest growth of production and the perverse effect of the youth employment scheme "Emploi des Jeunes". It seems that a number of people were taken into employment in 1986 in anticipation of an exemption from <b>social</b> <b>charges.</b> Despite the recent new measures in respect of long-term unemployed, unemployment will continue to grow significantly. The number of unemployed could reach 2. 8 million in the spring of 1988. The pick-up of investment in industry in 1984 - 1985 seems likely to continue in the next two years (6. 5 per cent in 1987 and 5. 4 per cent in 1988 in 1970 prices for the total of non-financial enterprises). Is this likely to be sufficient ? It would seem to be so if compared with the likely growth of internal and external demand, but not if considered in relation to the now considerable capacity to finance productive investment out of retained earnings. The study reported in the last part of this article suggests that the reduction of corporation tax would probably not be effective in sparking off a significant increase in investment. For given budgetary cost a direct subsidy to productive investment in the form of a tax credit would be ten times as effective. But the benefits would be realised only over the medium term.
