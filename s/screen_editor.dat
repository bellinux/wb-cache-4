500|$|Mini Metro {{received}} [...] "generally favourable" [...] reception from critics {{according to}} aggregate review website Metacritic. Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and found {{playing the game}} an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had a relaxing tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early access phase, noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill <b>Screen</b> <b>editor,</b> Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a [...] "mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it [...] "elegant even in disaster". He also thought that Mini Metro was {{a good example of}} how to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought that the use of geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became [...] "surprisingly engaging".|$|E
