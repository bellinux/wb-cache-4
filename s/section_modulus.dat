The study was based on the estimation of Modulus of elasticity and Modulus of rupture under static bending and Maximum Crushing Stress and Modulus of elasticity under compression parallel to grain of finger jointed sections and comparing them with the values measured for clear wood sections from the same lot. For joining the sections, the Poly Vinyl Acetate and Urea Formaldehyde adhesives were used. It was found that the Modulus of elasticity of the sections joined by either adhesive showed significantly better values than that of unjointed clear wood <b>sections.</b> The <b>Modulus</b> of rupture values of sections joined with Urea Formaldehyde were similar to those of unjointed clear wood sections.

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of the porous architecture of synthetic scaffolds for tissue engineering, their mechanical properties, and their interrelationship was obtained in a nondestructive manner. Image analysis of microcomputed tomography (μCT) sections of different scaffolds was done. The three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the scaffold allows one to quantify scaffold porosity, including pore size, pore distribution, and struts' thickness. The porous morphology and porosity as calculated from μCT by image analysis agrees with that obtained experimentally by scanning electron microscopy and physically measured porosity, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the scaffold were evaluated by making use of finite element modeling (FEM) in which the compression stress–strain test is simulated on the 3 D structure reconstructed from the μCT <b>sections.</b> Elastic <b>modulus</b> as calculated from FEM is in agreement with those obtained from the stress–strain experimental test.

The application to pavements so far has {{come in the form}} of joint reinforcement (dowels and tie bars). FRP resistance to salt corrosion in dowels has made it an alternative to standard epoxy-coated steel dowels for pavements. Iowa State University has completed a large amount of laboratory research to determine the diameter, spacing, and durability of FRP dowels.

40|$|Purpose - This paper, {{by taking}} {{randomness}} and uncertainty of structural systems into account aims {{to implement a}} combined reliability-based robust design optimization (RRDO) formulation. The random variables to be considered include the cross <b>section</b> dimensions, <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, yield stress, and applied loading. The RRDO problem is to be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where the construction cost and the standard deviation of the structural response are the objectives to be minimized. Design/methodology/ approach - The solution of the optimization problem is performed with the non-dominant cascade evolutionary algorithm with the weighted Tchebycheff metric, while the probabilistic analysis required is carried out with the Monte Carlo simulation method. Despite the computational advances, the solution of a RRDO problem for real-world structures is extremely computationally demanding {{and for this reason}} neurocomputing estimations are implemented. Findings - The obtained estimates with the neural network predictions are shown to be very satisfactory in terms of accuracy for performing this type of computation. Furthermore, the present numerical results manage to achieve a reduction in computational time up to four orders of magnitude, for low probabilities of violation, compared to the conventional procedure making thus feasible the reliability-robust design optimization of realistic structures under probabilistic constraints. Originality/value - The novel parts of the present work include the implementation of neurocomputing strategies in RRDO problems for reducing the computational cost and the comparison of the results given by RRDO and robust design optimization formulations, where the significance of taking into account probabilistic constraints is emphasized. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a lever type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer. This information gave good support to the theoretical work, whereby the behaviour of these steels in flexure can be correlated with the tensile properties.

We use scale normalization on the continuous wavelet transform, allowing analysis of the gravity field {{in order to determine}} the sources at different depths. By focusing on homogenous standard sources, such as sphere or cube, horizontal cylinder or prism, sheet and infinite step, we derive the relationships between the source depth and pseudo-wavenumber. Then the source depth can be recovered from tracing the maximal values of the modulus of the complex wavelet coefficients in the CWT-based scalograms that are function of the pseudo-wavenumber. The studied area includes a central gravity high up to 75 km wide, and a secondary high that occurs at the southern part of the anomaly. The interpretation of the depth slices and vertical <b>sections</b> of the <b>modulus</b> maxima of the complex wavelet coefficients allows recognition of a relatively dense terrane located at middle crustal levels (10 – 25 km depth).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplified model of buckling mechanism which occurs in slender steel column elements under compressive axial loading. This {{model has been}} used to predict buckling capacities of certain structures, and comparisons have been made with test results. The method presented is not as accurate as the current finite element methods which use complete large displacement elasto-plastic analysis. However, it provides a reasonable upper bound load very economically, and with reasonable accuracy. It will be argued that it is pointless striving for a 1 % accuracy when material parameters and load target values themselves can only be accurate to, say, 10 %. The study has used software developed by Meek [3 DBUCKLE-eigenvalue analysis program for buckling of steel columns, University of Queensland (1973) ], which uses eigenvalue analysis by iteration to determine the Euler (theoretical) value of the buckling load of a column structure. This program was adapted to include the possibility that, during buckling, a reduced <b>modulus</b> <b>section</b> develops at the central portion of the critical column length. The reduction in the second moment of area of the section over a given length ensures that the revised estimate of the failure load is less than that predicted by the Euler formula for the undamaged column.
