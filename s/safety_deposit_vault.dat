5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a <b>safety</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>vault</b> and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

40|$|Today in the United States, {{virtually}} every commercial bank makes safe deposit services {{available for a}} small fee, either through a department of the bank or through a subsidiary or affiliated safe deposit company. Never before has the demand for safe deposit services been so great. More than ever before, Americans are turning to safe deposit companies and bank safe <b>deposit</b> <b>vaults</b> for the storage of their assets. This increased demand has caused increased concern among legislators and bankers about whether to regulate further the day-to-day affairs of the safe deposit business. Increased use of safe <b>deposit</b> <b>vaults</b> and boxes will predictably lead to more litigation concerning the rights and responsibilities of banks and their customers. It is therefore important to examine {{the legal status of}} the relationship of the bank to its safe deposit customer.
