40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report a}} case of {{bilateral}} central crystalline keratopathy in the anterior stroma occurring 4 years after Intacs implantation. METHODS: A 45 -year-old woman underwent bilateral uncomplicated Intacs implantation for myopia. The postoperative course was uneventful. However, between 3 and 4 years after surgery, the patient developed central opacifications of the anterior stroma in both eyes, reducing best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. RESULTS: Intacs were explanted. Confocal microscopy, electron microscopy of the explanted ring segments, and microbiology studies were performed. Opacities were still detectable at the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> up to 8 months after explantation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on central corneal opacifications after Intacs implantation for myopia. The opacities could {{be the result of}} chronic metabolic stress or the beginning of lipid-like changes in another more central corneal localization...|$|E

40|$|HYALINE or glassy ridge {{formation}} on {{the posterior}} corneal surface {{appears to be}} a not uncommon phenomenon, the recognition of which may be missed without careful examina-tion with the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> Normally, Descemet's membrane is secreted as a hyaline tissue by the endothelial corneal cells during intra-uterine life; the exact point of development at which it appears is not definitely known, but may be at the 49 mm. stage (Mann, 1964). In some pathological conditions, these endothelial cells may exhibit exuberant hyaline formation, so that elevated plaques or ridges may form on the posterior corneal surface. Elsewhere in the eye, similar abnormal hyaline formation has long been recognized as occurring in circumstances of chronic irritation affecting ocular cellular layers, such as the lens and retinal epithelium and iris endothelium, and in such conditions as simple glaucoma and chronic iridocyclitis (Herbert, 1927). Hyaline ridges or membranes on the cornea are of two kinds: the first and more common is closely applied to the cornea throughout its extent and the second lies mainly in the anterior chamber but is attached to the cornea at one or more extremities.

METHODS: Seventeen rabbits underwent mechanical or ethanol debridement, and the opposite eye of each rabbit served as an unwounded control. In both groups, the epithelium was removed with a spatula and discarded. A - 9. 00 -diopter PRK was performed in each eye. The level of haze in each cornea at 4 weeks was graded at the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> according to the Fantes scale. Myofibroblast generation was detected with immunocytochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and cells were quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: No difference was noted {{between the two groups}} in alpha-SMA + myofibroblasts 4 weeks after surgery (43. 6 +/- 2. 0 / 400 X field and 45. 7 +/- 4. 8 / 400 X field in ethanol and mechanical groups, respectively) (P=. 10). A slight difference was noted but did not reach statistical significance with regard to stromal haze between ethanol and mechanical groups (2. 0 +/- 0. 5 and 2. 3 +/- 0. 4, respectively, P=. 063).

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between the high activity of aldose reductase (AR) and diabetic cataract formation has been previously investigated. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine the preventing effect of melatonin on streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic cataract in rats. Methods: 34 adult healthy male Sprague-Dawely rats were divided into four groups. Diabetic control and diabetic+melatonin received a single dose of STZ (50  mg/kg, intraperitoneally), whereas the normal control and normal+melatonin received vehicle. The melatonin groups were gavaged with melatonin (5  mg/kg) daily for a period of 8  weeks, whereas the rats in the normal control and diabetic control groups received only the vehicle. The rats’ eyes were examined every week and cataract formation scores (0 - 4) were determined by <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> At the end of the eighth week, the rats were sacrificed and markers of the polyol pathway and antioxidative (Glutathione, GSH) in their lens were determined. The levels of blood glucose, HbA 1 c and plasma malondialdhyde (MDA), as a marker of lipid peroxidation, were also measured. Results: Melatonin prevented STZ-induced hyperglycemia by decreased blood glucose and HbA 1 c levels. Slit lamp examination indicated that melatonin delayed cataract progression in diabetic rats. The results revealed that melatonin feeding increased the GSH levels, decreased the activities of AR and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and sorbitol formation in catractous lenses as well as plasma MDA content.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} tear film spreading {{and central}} lid position in spontaneous blinks and {{to propose a}} model of the central lid position of the closed eye in such blinks. METHOD: In vivo: lid margin position and geometry of 15 subjects (9 female; median age= 45 years) were evaluated by high-speed video and <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> video in consecutive spontaneous blinks. Upper lid (UL) tear meniscus (TM) depth was observed in the open and almost closed eye. Eyelid geometry, position and UL TM depth were analysed by Image-J Software. Lid margin thicknesses were measured with a Scheimpflug camera. In vitro: tear film spreading and lipid layer formation were simulated on a lubricated glass plate and videoed by high-speed camera (JVC, GZ-GX 1 BE, Japan). RESULTS: In vivo: the median central lid margin thickness was not significantly (p= 0. 258) different between UL (1. 8 mm) and LL (1. 7 mm) in the opened eye. During blinking, UL remained perpendicular to the corneal surface, while LL tilted in and thinned. A scaled model diagram was created and revealed an over-blink of the UL over the LL (> 0. 7 mm) and a height offset of the posterior lid margin of > 0. 7 mm. In vitro: the LL TM fused with the UL TM even before full lid touch due to capillary bridge building. CONCLUSIONS: The central UL overlaps the central LL during spontaneous blinking.

40|$|Purpose. To {{develop a}} mouse model of limbal stem cell {{deficiency}} (LSCD) by topical administration of benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Methods. BAC solutions (0 %– 0. 5 %) {{were applied to}} the mouse ocular surface for 4 weeks. Corneal neovascularization, inflammation, and epithelial status were observed under <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> The eyeball and ocular surface tissues were collected at 4 and 12 weeks and labeled {{with a series of}} antibodies. Limbal structure was evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Corneal impression cytology was performed at 12 weeks, and specimens were labeled with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reagents. Results. BAC (0. 5 %) four times per day for 28 days successfully induced the typical manifestations of LSCD, including corneal neovascularization, severe inflammation in the stroma, and diffuse epithelial defect (P < 0. 001). Conjunctival epithelium markers K 19 and K 13 were positive on the corneal surface. Expression of the putative limbal stem cell markers P 63 and ABCG 2 was abolished in the limbal epithelium. β-catenin was negative in the basal layer. TEM revealed the irregular basement membrane and the loss of stem cell–specific ultrastructure in the limbal basal epithelium. In the 0. 5 % BAC group, goblet cells could not be observed on day 28 but emerged after the cessation of BAC, and remained over the cornea after 8 weeks.

40|$|Cataract {{surgery is}} one of the most common {{surgical}} procedures performed worldwide. Posterior capsul opacification (PCO) remains the most common postoperative complication that can deteriorate vision. Development of glistenings in the artificial intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract surgery is a phenomenon with the potential to reduce the outcome of an otherwise excellent final surgical result. Phacoemulsification has been the most common surgical technique performed to remove cataracts during the previous 25 years. The settings controlling the fluidics in the eye intraoperatively can affect the postoperative convalescence. Since many people undergo cataract surgery annually and all of the previously mentioned issues can affect the final outcome, a better understanding and more studies comparing different IOLs and phacoemulsification settings will help surgeons choose better IOLs and surgical techniques and decrease postoperative complications. In study I, we compared the development of PCO and glistenings associated with two hydrophobic acrylic IOLs, the Sensar AR 40 e (Abbott Medical Optics) and AcrySof SA 60 AT (Alcon), 5 to 7 years after cataract surgery. Both IOLs had a sharp posterior edge design. We also evaluated if there were correlations between the amount of glistenings and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) or contrast sensitivity and if subjective gradings of glistenings were correlated with the objective quantification of glistenings with Scheimpflug images. Eighty patients were included in this prospective randomized study. Fifty-six patients completed the follow-up visit from 5 to 7 years postoperatively. Glistenings were graded at the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> and the amount of glistenings was quantified objectively using Scheimpflug images with subsequent processing in computer software. There were no significant differences in PCO area and severity or neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) capsulotomy rates between the IOLs. Significantly more glistenings were found in the AcrySof hydrophobic IOLs 5 to 7 years postoperatively. The glistenings were not correlated with the CDVA or contrast sensitivity. In study II, we evaluated in a prospective randomized trial if there were any correlations between the amount of glistenings and CDVA or contrast sensitivity and compared the development of glistenings in two acrylic IOLs, a hydrophilic IOL (BL 27, Bausch & Lomb) and a hydrophobic IOL (AcrySof SA 60 AT), 9 years after cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty patients were recruited, 78 completed the 9 -year follow-up visit. The amount of glistenings was quantified objectively using Scheimpflug images with subsequent processing in computer software. Glistenings were also subjectively graded at the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> The hydrophobic IOL had significantly more glistenings at the 9 -year follow-up visit. The glistenings were not correlated with the CDVA or contrast sensitivity. In study III, we compared the PCO area, severity, and survival time without Nd:YAG capsulotomy between a hydrophilic (BL 27) and a hydrophobic (AcrySof SA 60 AT) acrylic IOLs 9 years after cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty patients were recruited, 78 completed the 9 -year follow-up visit. The PCO area and severity were higher in the hydrophilic IOL. The survival time without Nd:YAG capsulotomy was longer in the hydrophobic IOL. In study IV, we compared low and standard fluidics settings during phacoemulsification cataract surgery and evaluated the impact on the eye postoperatively by measuring parameters indicating surgical trauma. Forty-three patients were recruited and randomized into two groups, i. e., those that underwent phacoemulsification with low or standard fluidics settings. The central corneal thickness, macular thickness, and intraocular pressure were measured preoperatively, 1 day, 3 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. The CDVA was measured preoperatively, 3 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Anterior chamber flare was measured preoperatively, 1 day and 3 weeks postoperatively. Endothelial cell density was measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic potential of a newly synthesized calpain inhibitor, CAT 0059, using a naturally occurring in vivo sheep cataract model. Methods: The selectivity of CAT 0059 was investigated by an in vitro protease assay. The efficacy of CAT 0059 in preventing proteolysis of lens cytoskeletal proteins by calpain 2 was investigated using a lens-based cell-free method. The cytotoxicity and stability of CAT 0059 in physiological conditions were examined using cultured sheep lenses. Protein binding of CAT 0059 by ocular proteins was assessed and quantified by a modified high-performance liquid chromatography assay. CAT 0059 was formulated in an eye drop solution and as an eye ointment. These were applied in vivo daily to one eye of the cataract lambs, over a 67 - and 97 -day trial period, respectively. The progression of cataracts in the treated and untreated eyes was assessed by an independent veterinary ophthalmologist using a <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> Results: In vitro assays revealed that CAT 0059 was selective for cysteine proteases and also protected lens cytoskeletal proteins from degradation. CAT 0059 was stable in physiological conditions and non-toxic to the lens. Only 15 % of CAT 0059 is bound to proteins in the aqueous humour but > 90 % bound to lens homogenate. The 67 -day CAT 0059 eye drop treatment was not effective in slowing the rate of cataract development. However, application of CAT 0059 in an eye ointment initially slowed cataract development compared with the untreated eye. This effect was temporary. Conclusions: In vitro assays confirmed CAT 0059 to be a potent calpain inhibitor. The two in vivo trials addressed the ability of CAT 0059 to reach the lens and established its limitations as a therapeutic molecule for cataract treatment.

40|$|This thesis has {{two main}} parts. The first part treats the {{construction}} and use of a laser flare meter (Papers A and B). The second part deals with applications of kinoforms and consists of the sections "Kinoforms in laser machining" (Papers C and D) and "Diffractive retroreflectors" (Paper E). Visible light scattering (flare) from a light beam passing through the anterior chamber of the eye has long {{been used as a}} sign - and sometimes the only sign - of an intraocular inflammation. The amount of light scattering is subjectively assessed through a <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> and used as a qualitative measure of the degree of inflammation. To achieve accurate quantitative in vivo measurements of the light scattering, a laser flare meter was constructed, the design, calibration and testing of which are described {{in the first part of}} this thesis. Measurements were performed in normal human eyes as well as in eyes with uveitis. Flare measurements and subjective assessments were compared. How different parameters affect the measurements were studied. In particular, we studied the flare in the eyes of patients suffering from Fuchs heterochromic uveitis. Experiments incorporating phase only diffractive optical elements (kinoforms) were carried out with the aim to make laser machining more efficien: in excimer laser machining by steering the laser power to the pattern of the mask and thus avoid to waste power on the blocking parts of the mask; in Nd:YAG laser machining by splitting up the laser beam into several equal beams that are used for simultaneous machining of patterns. Diffractive optical elements can be mass produced at a low cost by hot embossing replication. A suggested application for such elements is thin diffractive retroreflecting sheets for traffic signs. Computor simulations of the optical performance of diffractive retroreflector designs was carried out, with particular emphasis on dispersion and angular dependence. Some manufacturing considerations are also discussed. Both ray tracing and wave optics analysis were performed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{report the}} {{long-term}} clinical outcomes of accelerated trans-epithelial corneal cross-linking(CXL) protocols using KXL System(Avedro, USA) {{in the treatment}} of progressive keratoconus. METHODS: Totally 52 patients(102 eyes) with progressive keratoconus between December 2014 and February 2017 maximum keratometry values(Kmax) ≤ 60. 0 D, minimum corneal thickness(Thk) ≥ 400 m were treated with an accelerate trans-epithelial CXL protocol(UV-A irradiation intensity 45 mW/cm 2 with a total fluence of 7. 2 J/cm 2) using KXL system(Avedro, USA) in Southwest Hospital. The average follow-up time was 11. 65 mo(range: 9 - 26 mo). Uncorrected distance visual acuity(UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity(CDVA), intra-ocular pressure(IOP), <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope</b> examination, Kmax and average keratometry values(AveK), corneal stromal demarcation line depth and endothelial cell density(ECD) were evaluated. RESULTS: The 52 patients(102 eyes) were included in this research, male 36 (70 eyes) and female 16 (32 eyes), average age was 19. 5 ± 4. 6 years. Preoperative CDVA was 0. 84 ± 0. 89 (LogMAR), postoperative CDVA was 0. 69 ± 0. 72 (P = 0. 398). Preoperative UDVA was 1. 02 ± 0. 62 (LogMAR), postoperative UDVA was 0. 85 ± 0. 59 (P = 0. 154). Preoperative IOP was 12. 95 ± 4. 40 mmHg, postoperative IOP was 11. 92 ± 3. 66 mmHg(P = 0. 272). No statistical difference(P = 0. 552) has been found between preoperative and postoperative ECD. Nevertheless, on the Sirius anterior system(Sirius, CSO, Itlay), significant statistical difference(P = 0. 017) was confirmed between preoperative Kmax(50. 83 ± 3. 48 D) and postoperative Kmax(52. 05 ± 3. 63 D). Meanwhile, the postoperative Avek(47. 74 ± 2. 51 D) was significantly lower(P = 0. 041) than the preoperative Avek(48. 73 ± 4. 33 D). The average corneal stromal demarcation line depth(192 ± 23. 6 μm) was detected by the anterior segment OCT. No statistical difference(P = 0. 816) has been found between preoperative and postoperative Thk. No severe complication was observed in all cases. CONCLUSION: Accelerated trans-epithelial CXL was effective in decreasing keratometry values for progressive keratoconus in this research, and the outcomes remained stable during the follow-up time. No endothelium damage or other severe complications were observed in this clinical research. The accelerated trans-epithelial CXL is as effective as the standard CXL...|$|E
40|$|The {{adenocarcinoma}} which commonly {{occurs in}} the kidney of leopard frogs has been transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye where its growth characteristics have been studied by direct observation with the <b>slit-lamp</b> <b>microscope.</b> Such observations have been amplified by photographs taken at intervals to furnish permanent and objective records of the mode of development and progress of the growths, from earliest to advanced stages. The fifteen tumors which fumished the transplants were typical large invasive adenocarcinomas having the usual irregular and apparently anarchic arrangement of their component tubules and acini. However, the transplanted tumors developed according to definite and well defined structural patterns, their type depending on the immediate physical environment. Three such morphogenetic patterns were observed. Unimpeded outgrowths into the aqueous tumor characteristically assumed a tubulo-papillary arrangement; the earliest formation consisted of solid, purely epithelial cylinders, many of which at later stages acquired a lumen and thus became tubular; generally only the coarser projections developed vascular stalks. Further growth was made by repeated branching, and lateral outpouching of the tubules. Where the tumor grew in contact with firm, even surfaces, such as lens or cornea, differentiation was lost and broad membranes formed which gradually spread over the surfaces; secondarily, new cylindrical or tubular processes arose from such indifferent cellular carpets. Where the tumor made contact with loose tissue such as iris, it invaded this organ, and, supported by the stroma, assumed an acinar pattern quite {{like that of the}} original adenocarcinoma of the kidney. All three types of growth were sometimes found coexisting in different portions of the anterior chamber. The rate of growth of transplanted tumors was followed by photographic records taken periodically. A fairly constant mode of progress was noted: after a variable period of lag and a period of gradual outgrowth, there followed rather abruptly a short period of rapid growth, after which growth increments gradually became smaller. Variations in growth rate due to season and to temperature were evident, but further experiments are required to evaluate the part played by these factors. Attempts to transplant normal kidney in the anterior chamber were unsuccessful. The manner of growth in the vitreus was found to be similar to that in the anterior chamber. The factors that determine the manner of tumor growth are as yet imperfectly understood. Evidence is however accumulating to the effect that neoplastic growth is not as anarchic as is suggested by histologic sections of some tumors (26). The present experiments support the view that cancers are much more responsive to the laws governing growth and organization than is generally supposed...|$|E
