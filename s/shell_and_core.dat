40|$|In the paper, {{investigation}} {{results of}} microwave heating application for incinerating waste <b>shell</b> moulds <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> made of moulding sands with thermosetting resins are presented. It {{was found that}} waste shell cores or shell moulds left after casting, separated from moulding sand, can be effectively incinerated.

Incineration of waste moulds <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> made of commercial grades of resin-coated moulding sand using microwave heating {{was found to be}} an effective way of their utilisation. It was determined that the optimum burning time of these wastes (except those insufficiently disintegrated and not mixed with an activating agent) is maximum 240 s at the used magnetron power of 650 W. It was noticed that proper disintegration of the wastes and use of suitable additives to intensify the microwave heating process guarantee significant reduction of the process time and its full stabilisation. Application of microwave heating for incinerating waste <b>shell</b> moulds <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> ensure substantial <b>and</b> measurable economic profits due to shorter process time and lower energy consumption...|$|R
50|$|The {{simultaneous}} oscillation can {{be called}} plasmon hybridization where the tunability of the oscillation is associated with mixture of {{the inner and outer}} shell where they hybridize to give a lower energy or higher energy. This lower energy couples strongly to incident light, whereas the higher energy is an anti-bonding and weakly combines to incident light. The hybridization interaction is stronger for thinner shell layers, hence, the thickness of the shell and overall particle radius determines which wavelength of light it couples with. Nanoshells can be varied across a broad range of the light spectrum that spans the visible and near infrared regions. The interaction of light and nanoparticles affects the placement of charges which affects the coupling strength. Incident light polarized parallel to the substrate gives a s-polarization (Figure 1b), hence the charges are further from the substrate surface which gives a stronger interaction between the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>core.</b> Otherwise, a p-polarization is formed which gives a more strongly shifted plasmon energy causing a weaker interaction and coupling.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to drug rewards, non-drug rewards also {{increase}} the level of extracellular dopamine in the NAcc shell. Drug-induced dopamine release in the NAcc shell and NAcc core is usually not prone to habituation (i.e., the development of drug tolerance: a decrease in dopamine release from future drug exposure {{as a result of}} repeated drug exposure); on the contrary, repeated exposure to drugs that induce dopamine release in the NAcc <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>core</b> typically results in sensitization (i.e., the amount of dopamine that is released in the NAcc from future drug exposure increases as a result of repeated drug exposure). Sensitization of dopamine release in the NAcc shell following repeated drug exposure serves to strengthen stimulus-drug associations (i.e., classical conditioning that occurs when drug use is repeatedly paired with environmental stimuli) and these associations become less prone to extinction (i.e., [...] "unlearning" [...] these classically conditioned associations between drug use and environmental stimuli becomes more difficult). After repeated pairing, these classically conditioned environmental stimuli (e.g., contexts and objects that are frequently paired with drug use) often become drug cues which function as secondary reinforcers of drug use (i.e., once these associations are established, exposure to a paired environmental stimulus triggers a craving or desire to use the drug which they've become associated with).|$|E
5000|$|The complex {{dielectric}} constant is , where [...] is the {{dielectric constant}}, [...] is the electrical conductivity, [...] is the field frequency, and [...] is the imaginary unit. [...] This expression has been useful for approximating the dielectrophoretic behavior of particles such as red blood cells (as oblate spheroids) or long thin tubes (as prolate ellipsoids) allowing the approximation of the dielectrophoretic response of carbon nanotubes or tobacco mosaic viruses in suspension.These equations are accurate for particles when the electric field gradients are not very large (e.g., close to electrode edges) or when the particle is not moving along an axis in which the field gradient is zero (such as {{at the center of}} an axisymmetric electrode array), as the equations only take into account the dipole formed and not higher order polarization. When the electric field gradients are large, or when there is a field null running {{through the center of the}} particle, higher order terms become relevant, and result in higher forces.To be precise, the time-dependent equation only applies to lossless particles, because loss creates a lag between the field and the induced dipole. When averaged, the effect cancels out and the equation holds true for lossy particles as well. An equivalent time-averaged equation can be easily obtained by replacing E with Erms, or, for sinusoidal voltages by dividing the right hand side by 2.These models ignores the fact that cells have a complex internal structure and are heterogeneous. A multi-shell model in a low conducting medium can be used to obtain information of the membrane conductivity and the permittivity of the cytoplasm. For a cell with a shell surrounding a homogeneous core with its surrounding medium considered as a layer, as seen in Figure 2, the overall dielectric response is obtained from a combination of the properties of the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
50|$|The wire now {{exhibits}} {{a very large}} magnetic hysteresis: If a magnet is brought near the wire, the high coercivity outer shell excludes the magnetic field from the inner soft core until the magnetic threshold is reached, whereupon the entire wire — both the outer <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> inner <b>core</b> — rapidly switches magnetisation polarity.
