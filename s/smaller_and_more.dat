5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} or Danube newt (Triturus dobrogicus) is {{a species of}} newt found {{in central and eastern}} Europe, along the basin of the Danube river and some of its tributaries and in the Dnieper delta. It has a <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> slender body than the other crested newts in genus Triturus but like these, males develop a {{conspicuous}} jagged seam on back and tail during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} recognisable, the Australian magpie is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E

5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, {{give way to}} vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> numerous red blood cells, {{allowing it to}} process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} to replace the galleys {{that made up the}} core of the fleets that operated along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus {{from the middle}} Miocene of France. First {{described}} in 2002, it is known only {{from the site of}} La Grive M, where it occurs with another fossil Miniopterus species, the <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> common Miniopterus fossilis. M.zapfei is known from five mandibles (lower jaws) and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M.fossilis and the cingulum shelf surrounding the P4 is less well-developed than in living Miniopterus. The length of the first lower molar is 1.57 to 1.60mm.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War {{began when}} the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered {{a steady stream of}} defeats that pushed them back to the Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls first {{appeared}} in the Early Carboniferous around 330 million years ago (Mya). During the Carboniferous, temnospondyls included basal medium-sized forms such as Dendrerpeton or large semiaquatic forms such as Cochleosaurus. Other, more derived temnospondyls, such as the amphibamids, were <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> terrestrial. They resembled salamanders, and some taxa, such as the genus Branchiosaurus, even retained external gills like the modern-day axolotl. During the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian around 300 Mya, several groups, such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong, robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the eryopids, developed into large semiaquatic predators. The dvinosaurs, a group of small aquatic temnospondyls, evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late Carboniferous.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed {{the events leading}} to the sinking.

Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.|$|E

5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} general {{appearance}} of A.bisporigera {{are similar to}} those of A.verna and A.virosa. A.bisporigera is at times <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> slender than either A.verna or A.virosa, but it varies considerably in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. A.virosa fruits in autumn—later than A.bisporigera. A.elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while A.ocreata is found on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include Amanita magnivelaris, which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and A.virosiformis, which has elongated spores that are 3.9–4.7 by 11.7–13.4μm. Neither A.elliptosperma nor A.magnivelaris typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of A.virosiformis has not been reported.|$|E
