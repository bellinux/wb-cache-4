40|$|International audienceSupercritical fluid {{synthesis}} {{offers an}} attractive and unique method to produce metal oxide nanoparticles such as barium strontium titanate (Ba 1 −xSrxTiO 3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). This synthesis pathway {{has the advantage}} of producing high quality, highly crystalline nanoparticles in a narrow size range, with accurate control of the elemental composition not easily afforded by other methods of production. Coupled with moderate reaction temperatures and short reaction times, this method could be an environmentally preferred synthesis route compared to conventional synthesis pathways. This paper examines the potential environmental impacts leading from the lab-scale supercritical synthesis of 1 kg of Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 TiO 3 nanoparticles of an average size 16 nm using the approach of an anticipatory life-cycle assessment. A cradle-to-gate assessment was completed, estimating the impacts across resource extraction, material processing, and production of the nanoparticles, while excluding any associated use-phase or end-of-life considerations. The life-cycle assessment highlights a number of ways by which the environmental profile of the supercritical synthesis of barium strontium titanate nanoparticles could be improved. Lab-scale synthesis was bound by physical constraints of the reactor, whereby the precursor concentration was kept artificially low. Being able to synthesize nanoparticles with precursor concentrations of 0. 1 and 1. 0 molar would reduce the average life-cycle impacts by nearly 81 % and 95 %, respectively. Additionally, the recovery and reuse of solvents at high recycling rates (e. g. 90 %) could reduce average life-cycle impacts by 56 %. At high precursor concentrations and solvent recycling rates, the environmental performance was further limited by the precursors, namely barium and titanium alkoxides, which have high upstream life-cycle demands (i. e. isopropanol production and metal processing). General impact reductions were seen as the ratio of strontium : barium increased. Further reductions could be achieved by replacing the barium, strontium and titanium alkoxides with precursors having better life-cycle profiles such as barium and strontium acetates or barium and <b>strontium</b> <b>hydroxides...</b>|$|R

40|$|Removal of {{radioactive}} strontium and transuranic elements from Hanford Envelope C waste solutions {{can be accomplished}} by the sequential addition of sodium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>strontium</b> nitrate, and sodium permanganate solutions. This multistep precipitation process is the baseline technology in the River Protection Project -Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP) for the removal of these radioactive species from Hanford Waste Tanks. Decontamination targets are easily met using these precipitation technologies and current work in this area focuses on optimization to minimize reagent levels. Downstream treatment processes require filtration of the precipitate slurry. In order to avoid further precipitation after filtration, it is necessary to know the precipitation reaction time-scale. In addition, precipitate slurry filter flux is a primary parameter of interest to plant design personnel. Optimization of the filtration process is benefited by an understanding of the parameters that impact particle size distribution. Filter cake packing and, hence, filter flux are often sensitive to small changes in the particle size distribution. However, traditional methods of particle size analysis often are not sufficiently sensitive to develop correlations to filterability. Focused Beam Reflectance Measurements (FBRM) are a relatively new chord length analysis method with extremely high sensitivity. The method is suited for continuous monitoring of chord length distributions in the process medium. The instrument is equipped with statistical data analysis software for the identification of small shifts in the population. Reported herein are the results of FBRM analysis of strontium and manganese precipitation tests with Hanford AN- 107 simulant. The objectives of the testing were to: (1) evaluate the impacts of precipitation parameters (temperature and reagent levels) upon the strontium and manganese particle chord length distributions; (2) evaluate the stability of the particles under shear; (3) determine the general time-scale of the precipitation reactions; (4) identify correlations of the chord length distribution statistics to other measured experimental parameters such as slurry filterability; (5) monitor the filtered samples for post-filtration precipitation in order to identify the parameters that lead to solids formatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} gas-phase <b>strontium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> complexes are quantum chemically calculated using density functional theory, {{and the effects}} of hydroxyl groups on strontium coordination are studied. It is found that the presence of a single hydroxyl group results in the near-degeneracy of complexes with a coordination number (CN) of 5, 6 and 7. The presence of a second hydroxyl group destabilises the heptacoordinated complexes, and marks the onset of a weakening of the Sr-O-H 2 O bonds, as evidenced by analysis via the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and measurements of the average angle between the Sr-O-H 2 O bond and the H 2 O dipole moment. A third hydroxyl group strongly destabilises both CN = 6 and 7 complexes through significant weakening of the Sr-O-H 2 O interaction; here, hydrogen bonding interactions between hydroxyl groups and water molecules begin to dominate. The tetrahydroxide complex is found to be electronically unstable in the gas phase, but can be stabilised by coordination of explicit water molecules.
