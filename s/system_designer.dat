5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat <b>system</b> <b>designer.</b> Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be offended by the Primal and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E

The AWD Alliance (a consortium of the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO), shipbuilder ASC, and combat <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> Raytheon) was created to oversee the acquisition project. In August 2005, Gibbs & Cox's Evolved Flight II Arleigh Burke-class destroyer concept and the Navantia-designed Álvaro de Bazán-class frigate were selected from the initial round of tendering for further study. Although the Arleigh Burke concept was larger, better-armed, and more capable on paper, the Álvaro de Bazán class was selected June 2007 {{as the basis of}} the AWD as they had seen active service, could be in Australian service earlier and were cheaper. Three ships were ordered on 4 October 2007, with an unexercised option for a fourth.|$|E
500|$|The {{desire to}} move away from random {{encounters}} was present since the beginning of development. This desire fueled the development of the Active Dimension Battle system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this change. Battle <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> Hiroshi Tomomatsu states that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in {{the final version of the}} game. Ito drew inspiration for gambits from plays in American football where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions and desired outcome. As for the license system, he explained that needing [...] "licenses" [...] to perform certain actions was a natural extension of the rigid structured society of Archadia, as epitomized by its Judges.|$|E

2500|$|All {{electronic}} systems emit some unwanted radio frequency energy. [...] Various regulatory agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) put {{limits on the}} emitted energy and any interference caused by it. [...] The emitted noise generally appears at sharp spectral peaks (usually at the operating frequency of the device, and a few harmonics). [...] A <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> can use a spread-spectrum PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. [...] For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of megahertz can spread its interference evenly over a few megahertz of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of kilohertz.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives {{other than}} solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it {{inherited}} from the classic Mac OS. Operating <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is [...] "probably the worst file system ever", whose design is [...] "actively corrupting user data". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode. Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data. These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which is used for file systems on SSDs in macOS High Sierra.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{plans for}} the Littoral Combatant (3B1) were revived under the SC-21 banner. It was {{initially}} renamed the Power Projection Ship, and then DD-21, Destroyer for the 21st century. Influenced by the Arsenal Ship, {{it would have a}} stealthy hull with a significant land attack capability. At first the plan was to install a twin-barreled Vertical Gun for Advanced Ships (VGAS), developed from experiments on advanced projectiles for the Iowa battleships, but this was dropped in favour of a conventional 5" [...] gun and two 64-cell VLS. It would also feature a revolutionary cross-layer active sonar. An Operational Requirements Document was signed in November 1997, and an Advanced Development Memorandum on 11 December. A Program Executive Office was established on 25 February 1998. As with the Burke class, the construction of the DD-21 ships would be split between Bath Iron Works and Ingalls to preserve the industrial base. However, there would be a competition between the two yards to design DD-21 and to be the full-service contractor for the class, which would mean the winning team receiving 85% of the total program costs of around $70 billion. BIW partnered with Lockheed Martin as the combat <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> and integrator, forming the [...] "Blue" [...] team; Ingalls partnered Raytheon in the [...] "Gold" [...] team.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{satellite}} communications systems (SatCom) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, {{the need for}} broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically {{in the past few}} years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, satcom system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real world operational conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SatCom <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> or planner to simulate real world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a [...] "safe" [...] virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.|$|E
2500|$|Production for {{the game}} began in 2014, {{including}} six months of pre-production. It included many of the staff from the original Nier. During production, the team took both fan and critic feedback on Nier and their later opinions on the game into account. The points they felt needed addressing ranged from character designs to gameplay to graphics. While improving on these points, they also carried over aspects that were well-received, such as the complexity of story and the game's music. The majority of development was handled by PlatinumGames at their offices in Osaka and Tokyo, while outside staff such as Yoko were also brought in. As Nier: Automata was a role-playing action game as opposed to Taura's previous pure action games, the development presented new challenges for him. While Taura handled the action combat <b>system,</b> <b>designer</b> Isao Negishi created the RPG elements. According to Negishi and programmer Ryo Onishi, a major difficulty was creating a title faithful to Nier, which required a shift away from the style of their earlier titles. While designing the game's RPG elements, the staff at PlatinumGames were at least partially inspired by [...] {{in the design of}} their sidequests, which they felt they {{would never be able to}} match.|$|E
2500|$|Nomura {{considers}} Yoshitaka Amano one of {{his biggest}} inspirations when doing artwork. His four [...] "seniors" [...] Hironobu Sakaguchi, Yoshinori Kitase, Hiroyuki Ito and Tetsuya Takahashi were also described as major influences. He even compared Sakaguchi to something [...] "like a godly figure" [...] during his early days at Square. At that time, Nomura was also taught the basics of game design by Ito. He told Nomura never to stick to existing concepts but rather to reuse just specific ideas and explained concepts such as ease of control and effortless accessibility of magic spells. Ito's work as a battle <b>system</b> <b>designer</b> inspires Nomura when thinking of the gameplay system for the Kingdom Hearts games. When designing characters, Nomura wants their names and outfits to be related with their personalities. An example occurs in Final Fantasy X where the protagonist Tidus was given a colorful uniform in order to reflect his cheerful personality and to contrast with the previous moody Final Fantasy characters. His name as well as Yuna's, another character appearing in the game, also have a common theme, the former being Okinawan for [...] "Sun" [...] and the latter Okinawan for [...] "night". Various characters such as Squall Leonheart and Lulu are given multiple accessories, making the games more challenging for the programmers. When directing Advent Children, Nomura explained how the film was different from Western films {{due to the lack of}} direct answers from the plot. He added that he wants viewers to interpret certain scenes themselves and then discuss them with friends as another way to enjoy the film. The same occurs within the Kingdom Hearts series where the scenes that show unknown characters are left to the player's imagination until the following scene reveals it.|$|E
