The tendency of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> containing {{two or more}} immiscible segments to undergo microphase separation and form periodic, compositionally pure domains on the nanometer length scale makes these types of materials attractive {{for a variety of}} applications. Through the judicious choice of the constituent chains, <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> with desirable properties can be fabricated. In particular, this thesis will focus on using these types of materials a nanolithographic templates. We have employed two distinct strategies for the formation of nanoscale arrays: (1) incorporating etch-resistant segments directly into the <b>block</b> <b>polymer,</b> and (2) using external reagents that are resistant to etching as a mask for selected regions of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer.</b> The first half of this thesis will focus on the synthesis and use of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> containing both poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as nanolithographic templates.

40|$|Epps, Thomas H. <b>Block</b> <b>polymers</b> have {{garnered}} significant {{attention in}} the past few decades due to their ability to self-assemble into a boundless array of structures such as spheres, cylinders, gyroid, and lamellae. The sizes of the periodical structures typically are ~ 5 – 100 nm, making them ideal for emerging nanotechnologies, such as nanolithography, nanotemplating, nanoporous membranes, and photonics devices. Many of these applications require thin film geometries, in which the <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> form well-ordered nanostructures and precisely controlled domain orientations. Understanding the factors that affect thin film phase behavior and being able to control the nanostructures, domain orientation, and domain ordering in thin film is essential to realizing the full potential of these unique materials. In this dissertation, I describe significant efforts to manipulate the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> thin film structures, direct the nanostructure ordering, and understand the connection between the macromolecular molecular structures and the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> properties. First, substrate surface modification with chlorosilane was employed to manipulate the nanostructure of poly(styrene- b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS) thin films. A morphological transformation from parallel cylinders to hexagonally perforated lamellae (HPL) was identified, in a high-throughput fashion, using gradient methods. The gradient methods are highly adaptable for the possible universal manipulation of thin film nanostructures. Second, rastering solvent vapor annealing – soft shear method was developed and demonstrated as a simple, yet highly effective method to achieve macroscopic alignment of SIS cylinders. This method substantially improves on previous approaches by using simple instrumentation to unlock an array of alignment patterns with a variety of self-assembling polymers and provides feasibility and flexibility for practical industrial production. Next, the interfacial mixing characteristics of tapered <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> were explored quantitatively for the first time, and the tapered interfacial modification has led to unique and diverse self-assembly behavior and properties. Finally, XPS depth profiling with C 60 + sputtering was used to determine the lithium ion distribution in a lamellae-forming <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> electrolyte film. The results provide useful insights for the future design and optimization of <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> structures for high efficiency energy storage devices. Additionally, the unique capabilities of C 60 + depth profiling XPS are demonstrated as a method to determine the nanoscale distributions of molecules in a myriad of polymer thin film systems.

40|$|A {{ruthenium}} meso-tetra[4 -(vinylbenzoxy) benzyl]porphyrin catalyst {{with four}} meso-polymerizable side chains was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. The polymerizable side chains allowed {{the incorporation of}} this complex in various types of highly cross-linked mesoporous co-polymers. Core-shell microspheres were prepared in a two-step precipitation polymerization procedure. The porous shell contains the Ru-catalyst and divinylbenzene while the dense core is constituted only of divinylbenzene. A <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and molecularly imprinted polymers containing the Ru-catalyst were prepared by co-polymerization with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. The imprinted polymers were prepared {{in the presence of}} primary amines as templates, which create a free substrate pocket next to the catalytically active center upon removal of the template. All polymers displayed high catalytic activity for the oxidation of alcohols and alkanes to the corresponding ketones with 2, 6 -dichloropyridine-N-oxide as the oxidant. A comparison of the catalytic activity of the Ru-catalyst, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> and the imprinted polymer was made. While the homogeneous Ru-catalyst showed no activity, the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> was moderately active and the imprinted polymer displayed the highest activity. The increase of activity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> compared to the homogeneous Ru-catalyst {{can be explained by the}} site-isolation effect which prevents the irreversible dimerisation of the ruthenium porphyrin catalysts upon oxidation. The further increase of activity displayed by the imprinted polymer can be attributed to the free substrate pocket next to the active site which allows a better access of the substrates to the ruthenium center. With the polymer imprinted with 1 -adamantylamine, a substrate selectivity of 1. 4 in favor of 2 -adamantanol was observed for the oxidation of 2 -adamantanol in competition with 2 -octanol. However, with the other polymer imprinted with aminodiphenylmethane no such selectivity was recorded. It was possible to modulate both the activity and the selectivity of the <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> using a fluorous solvent, perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFMC). A large increase of catalytic activity was measured upon use of PFMC as a reaction co-solvent. Some substrate selectivity was also observed for substrates with different polarities.

This thesis describes an experimental investigation of a class of materials we call short diblock copolymers—block polymers that self–assemble into ordered mesophases even at low molecular weight {{as a result of}} high thermodynamic incompatibility between the constituent blocks. The low molecular weight of short diblock copolymers enables accessing the ever-smaller features sizes required by applications such as nanolithography. However, the behavior of short diblock copolymers is dominated by fluctuations and consequently is not well described by the classical mean-field theoretical framework used to understand <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> phase behavior. This thesis involves the synthesis of a series of model short diblock copolymers and detailed characterization of their thermodynamics and dynamics using a variety of experimental tools including small-angle scattering, rheology, and thermal analysis techniques. The phase behavior is documented, including the discovery of an ordered phase with dodecagonal quasicrystalline symmetry. Taking advantage of opportunities afforded by the low molecular weight of short diblock copolymers, an expansion of the experimental toolkit for <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> characterization was achieved through the adaptation and application of relaxation calorimetry in conjunction with the development of new approaches for exploiting established tools like differential scanning calorimetry.

This polymer is cast into thin film nanoporous membranes by the self-assembly and nonsolventinduced phase separation (SNIPS) process. Synthesis of these polymers and subsequent fabrication of membrane materials has been widely studied. However, the early selfassembly of PI-PS-PDMA in solution is still poorly understood, despite characterization of this solution behavior being critical for application of these materials to commercial processes. ^ The early self-assembly of triblock polymers in solution can be investigated through a combination of dynamic light scattering, small-angle x-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Elucidation of this solution behavior provides for the development of relationships between polymer solution properties and polymer assembly prior to SNIPS membrane fabrication. These guiding relationships can then be employed to interrogate the solution behavior of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> for membrane fabrication and optimize the casting solutions and membrane microstructure for SNIPS-cast membranes. ^ A particular benefit of the PI-PS-PDMA triblock polymer is the facile conversion of the pore-forming <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> to a chemical functionality of interest for specific separations.

As such, alternative C-block chemistries are being investigated. The C-block poly(tert -butyl methacrylate) (PtBMA) is of particular interest due to the ease with which one can apply protocols developed for PI-PS-PDMA to the PIPS- PtBMA system.

Polymeric membranes {{are used for}} many separations. Some act as selective filters, separating viruses and other undesirable solutes from drinking water. Others perform chemical separations, separating air to make an atmosphere which extends fruit shelf-life. The ability of a membrane to perform a separation is determined by its chemistry and microstructure. <b>Block</b> <b>polymers</b> are macromolecules composed {{of two or more}} chemically incompatible <b>polymers</b> (<b>blocks)</b> covalently bonded together. Depending upon the relative amounts of each <b>block,</b> the <b>polymer</b> forms different ordered structures 5 - 50 nm in scale. This control over the constituent polymers and microstructure will be used to produce membranes with different transport properties. Ammonia selective membranes which retain selectivity in mixed gas systems are made from poly(cycloocetene-b-styrene sulfonate). Using poly(styrene-b-lactide) as a template, ultrafiltration membranes with a monodisperse pore size distribution are formed...|$|R

Pressure driven membrane filtrations are a facile means of performing aqueous separations. The efficiency {{of these processes}} depends on the permeability and selectivity of a membrane, which is determined by its structure. This dissertation describes research investigating nanoporous thermosets templated by reactive <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> as alternatives to current ultrafiltration membranes. The goal of the research was to develop materials with narrow pore size distributions and high void fractions for forming membranes with increased selectivity and permeability. The flux, filtration and fouling characteristics of membranes formed by selective removal of poly(lactide) from crosslinked films of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and the reactive <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> poly(norbornenylethyl styrene-s-styrene) -b-poly(lactide) (PNS-PLA) were first explored. The results suggest that thin film composite membranes could achieve permeabilities and selectivities greater than current ultrafiltration membranes without excessive fouling characteristics. Additionally, hydrophilic and stimuli responsive membranes templated by reactive triblock terpolymers exhibited environmentally dependent fluxes demonstrating the ease of creating functionalized membranes using reactive triblock terpolymers. Further investigation into the compositional influences on the morphology of nanostructured PNS-PLA/PDCPD materials revealed that nanoporous bicontinuous structures form over a wide composition range and that different pore sizes are achievable by varying the PLA block size. Extension of reactive <b>block</b> <b>polymer</b> templating to vinyl crosslinking systems was demonstrated by crosslinking a poly(lactide) -b-poly(cyclooctene-s-norbornenylmethacrylate) -b-poly(lactide) reactive triblock copolymer {{with a variety of}} vinyl monomers. Although the soft nature of the poly(cyclooctene) prevented removal of polylactide due to collapse of the pores, nanoporous vinyl thermosets were realized by crosslinking a polylactide-b-poly(styrene-s-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-s-ethylene glycol dimetacrylate) reactive diblock copolymer with styrene and divinyl benzene...|$|R

The intermolecular addition to unactivated alkenes, in particular, provides tremendous opportunities for synthesis: various functional groups can be brought together under mild, neutral conditions. Since the adduct is also a xanthate, iteration allows the formation of <b>block</b> <b>polymers</b> through a controlled radical polymerisation (the RAFT/MADIX technology).
