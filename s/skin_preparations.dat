40|$|Objective: Site marking is {{essential}} to prevent wrong-site surgery, {{and there are many}} skin markers commercially available. However, preoperative <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> can erase the site mark, especially when a chlorhexidine <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution that requires skin scrubbing is used. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that some markers can withstand <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> with a chlorhexidine-based <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution {{in a manner similar to}} that of an iodine-based solution. Methods: On each of 5 cadaveric skin flaps, we made 2 rows of site markings with 9 types of markers. We then subjected one row of markings on each flap to a chlorhexidine-based solution and the other row to an iodine-based solution. A digital photograph was taken before and after each <b>skin</b> <b>preparation.</b> Using imaging software, the contrast in grayscale between the skin and skin marking was measured on each photograph. The effect of the type of marker and <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution on the difference in grayscale contrast was evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis and significant differences were determined (P <. 05). Results: In all cases, the chlorhexidine-based <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution significantly decreased the contrast measured. No marker was significantly better than another. Conclusions: We conclude that all 9 skin markers are significantly erased with the chlorhexidine-based <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution. The development of a better skin marker or a chlorhexidine-based <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solution that does not erase site markings {{is essential}} to prevent wrong-site surgeries and promote patient safety...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> and conductive gel application. However, a series of <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 spring contact probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe head, plunger, spring, and barrel. The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 spring contact probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|R

The studies that were published in English and that examine relationship between <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> and development of surgical area infection in patients who had cranial surgery were included.

40|$|Background. Immobilizing skin {{microbes}} is {{a rational}} approach to reducing contamination of surgical sites by endogenous microorganisms. Methods. This randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, open-label clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00467857) enrolled 300 adults scheduled for elective {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery. Patients received iodine-based <b>skin</b> <b>preparations</b> followed by a cyanoacrylate-based skin sealant or <b>skin</b> <b>preparations</b> alone. Microbiological samples collected from sternal and graft incision sites immediately before any skin preparation, at the wound border after skin incision, and at the incision after fascial closure were evaluated quantitatively. Results. In evaluable patients, mean microbial counts in collected samples increased at the sternal site after fascial closure compared with after skin incision by 0. 37 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) /mL in the skin sealant group (n = 120) and by 0. 57 log 10 CFU/mL in the control group (n = 132) (p = 0. 047, Wilcoxon rank sum test). At the graft site, mean microbial counts increased by 0. 09 (n = 119) and 0. 27 (n = 127) log(10) CFU/mL, respectively (p = 0. 037). There was a 35. 3 % relative risk reduction in surgical site infection (SSI) occurring in the skin sealant group (9 of 146 patients, 6. 2 %) versus the control group (14 of 147 patients, 9. 5 %). In obese patients (body mass index [BMI] > 30. 0 to <= 37. 0 kg/m(2)), the relative risk reduction for SSI associated with skin sealant was 83. 3 %. Conclusions. Pretreatment with skin sealant protects against contamination of the surgical incision by migration of skin microbes.

The effects of 2 common types of <b>skin</b> <b>preparation</b> solutions on surgical site markings were compared. Methods: Fasciocutaneous skin flaps were harvested and 20 random combinations of 3 letters were written on the skin flaps with a black permanent marker. Ten of the 3 -letter combinations received Chloraprep (chlorhexidine gluconate, 2 % w/v, plus isopropyl alcohol, 70 % v/v) and the other 10 received Duraprep (iodine povacrylex [0. 7 % available iodine] and isopropyl alcohol [74 % w/w]), both according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The skin flaps were photographed digitally before and after application of the solutions. The final pictures were assessed subjectively by 10 surgeons and then objectively to determine the change in visibility of the marking on each specimen. Results: Of the 300 letters in each group, the number of correctly identified letters was 254 (84. 7 %) in the Chloraprep group and 284 (94. 7 %) in the Duraprep group.
