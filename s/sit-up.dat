25|$|In {{the main}} event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was {{revealed}} to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. During the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on an announce table on Reigns, who then performed a spear through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who performed a chokeslam on Reigns onto a chair for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns executed another spear but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with a chair, and performed two spears - both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature <b>sit-up,</b> but suddenly collapsed. After another spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania, after Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat, and hat {{in the center of}} the ring, hinting that this was possibly his last match. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character and kissed his wife, Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked at the crowd and raised his arm as he was lowered below the stage to the sound of his music and his signature gong sounded three times as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening, and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring as the production crew cleaned up, only taking his clothing articles when it was time to disassemble the ring.|$|E

Even one's own heart seemed to be drawn in by those beckoning arms, and the slow enchantment of that tinkling voice, and the look in those eyes, which, lost in the unknown, were seeing no mortal glen, but only that mazed wood, where friendly wild things come, who have no sound to their padding, no whirr to the movement of their wings; whose gay whisperings have no noise, whose eager shapes no colour--the fairy dream-wood of the unimaginable.|$|E

40|$|In {{exercise}} prescription and training, {{a simple}} test that accurately evaluates abdominal strength {{without the use}} of a special device is required. This study aimed to examine the relationships between <b>sit-ups</b> and abdominal flexion strength tests and between both the above tests and the thickness of each abdominal muscle. Subjects comprised 13 healthy young males (age: 18. 9 ± 0. 64 yr, height: 170. 2 ± 0. 70 cm, and weight: 64. 9 ± 8. 80 kg). <b>Sit-ups</b> and abdominal flexion strength tests as well as muscle thickness measurements of rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles were performed. The relationships between the measured values were examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. A significant correlation (r = 0. 75) was found between <b>sit-ups</b> and abdominal flexion strength tests. In addition, both tests showed significant correlations (r > 0. 65) with thicknesses of the rectus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. From the present results, the relationship between <b>sit-ups</b> and abdominal flexion strength tests is very strong, and both tests are related to muscle thicknesses of rectus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. The <b>sit-ups</b> test can evaluate not only muscle endurance of abdomen but also static strength. </p...|$|R

40|$|I tested 80 {{male and}} 80 female {{subjects}} {{between the ages}} of 3 and 7 years on two exercises of isometric trunk flexor muscle strength (half-hold hooklying position and supine flexion position) and one exercise of isotonic trunk flexor muscle strength (hooklying <b>sit-ups)</b> to establish normative data for trunk flexor musculature capabilities. Measurements included the length of time the half-hold hooklying and supine flexion positions were maintained and the number of repetitions of <b>sit-ups.</b> I found {{no significant differences between the}} sexes in performance of the isometric tests. I did find, however, a significant difference between age groups for half-hold hooklying and supine flexion tests (p <. 0001), indicating that the ability to perform isometric trunk flexion improves with age. Height was another significant variable contributing to test results (p <. 0001). Children were able to perform <b>sit-ups</b> consistently at age 6 years only; the male subjects performed an average of 20 more <b>sit-ups</b> than the female subjects (p <. 04). I discuss in this article the possible contribution of neuromuscular maturation and physical growth to the development of normal trunk flexion. The results may be useful to clinicians to assess abnormal trunk flexion accurately in childre...|$|R
