5|$|A <b>superphylum</b> – TACK – {{has been}} {{proposed}} that includes the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota. This <b>superphylum</b> {{may be related to}} the origin of eukaryotes. More recently, the <b>superphylum</b> Asgard has been named and proposed to be more closely related to the original eukaryote and a sister group to TACK.|$|E
5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined Platyhelminthes are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a <b>superphylum</b> that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a <b>superphylum</b> that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E

25|$|Hemichordata, which {{includes}} the acorn worms, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the Echinodermata ({{which includes}} starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and crinoids), form the Ambulacraria, the sister taxon of the Chordates. The Chordata and Ambulacraria form the <b>superphylum</b> Deuterostomia, composed of the deuterostomes.|$|E
25|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the nematodes and their close relatives among the protostomian Metazoa are unresolved. Traditionally, {{they were held}} to be a lineage of their own but in the 1990s, they were proposed to form the group Ecdysozoa together with moulting animals, such as arthropods. The identity of the closest living relatives of the Nematoda has always been considered to be well resolved. Morphological characters and molecular phylogenies agree with placement of the roundworms as a sister taxon to the parasitic Nematomorpha; together they make up the Nematoida. Together with the Scalidophora (formerly Cephalorhyncha), the Nematoida form the clade Cycloneuralia, but much disagreement occurs both between and among the available morphological and molecular data. The Cycloneuralia or the Introverta—depending on {{the validity of the}} former—are often ranked as a <b>superphylum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the <b>superphylum</b> will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

These cousin languages are all spoken in Western Alaska and Eastern Chukotka, Russia. It is not discernibly related to other indigenous languages of the Americas or northeast Asia, although some have proposed that it is related to the Uralic languages such as Finnish and the Sami languages in the proposed [...] "Uralo-Siberian" [...] grouping, or even Indo-European languages as part of the hypothetical [...] "Nostratic" [...] <b>superphylum.</b> Some consider it a Paleosiberian language, although that is more a geographic than a linguistic grouping.|$|E

50|$|Previously, Deuterostomia also {{included}} the phyla Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Chaetognatha, and Phoronida based on embryological characteristics. However, <b>Superphylum</b> Deuterostomia was redefined in 1995 based on DNA molecular sequence analyses when the lophophorates {{were removed from}} it and combined with other protostome animals to form <b>superphylum</b> Lophotrochozoa. The phylum Chaetognatha (arrow worms) may belong here, but molecular studies have placed them in the protostomes more often.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{analyses of}} DNA sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods {{as members of}} a <b>superphylum</b> labelled Ecdysozoa ("animals that moult"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and brachiopods in another <b>superphylum,</b> Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5000|$|With advancements in genomics, the eocyte {{hypothesis}} {{experienced a}} revival {{beginning in the}} mid-2000s.
