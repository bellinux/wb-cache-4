500|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected {{in some way to}} salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The book says Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis [...] "who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light’s end, if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life." [...] In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies {{he will be able to}} see her <b>shining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness of the underworld and worship her there.|$|E

500|$|Zeng Liansong, {{a citizen}} from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, {{was working in}} Shanghai {{at the time the}} {{announcement}} came out; he wanted to create a flag design to express his patriotic enthusiasm for the new country. In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design comes from the stars <b>shining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb [...] "longing for the stars, longing for the moon", ( [...] , pàn xīngxīng pàn yuèliàng) which shows yearning. He viewed the CPC as the great saviour ( [...] , dà jiùxīng [...] "great saving star") of the Chinese people, being represented by a larger star. The idea for four small stars came from On the People's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (...) shi, nong, gong, shang ("the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie"). [...] Yellow also implies that China belongs to the Chinese people, a [...] "yellow race". After working out the details of the placement of the stars and their sizes (he had tried to put all of the stars in the center, but believed it would be too heavy and dull), he sent his [...] "Five Stars on a Field of Red" [...] ( [...] , hóng dì wǔxīng qí) design to the committee in the middle of August.|$|E
500|$|Observing {{that the}} show's main {{characters}} are each {{based on a}} stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Rachel as [...] "the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags." [...] According to Reign Magazine, Rachel is [...] "a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure." [...] Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for [...] "the world as an adult", Rachel's personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming [...] "more self-sufficient and sympathetic." [...] According to <b>Shining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s author Murray Pomerance, [...] "The more boundary collapsed between the 'real' Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more 'authentic' Aniston became." [...] Pomerance {{also noted that the}} character's [...] "well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability" [...] is similar to Aniston's, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking [...] "with [...] hands a good deal." [...] In her book How To Write For Television, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although [...] "Rachel grew {{within the context of the}} series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy's girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot." [...] Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel [...] "eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [...] the most image-centric among the six", while Vogues Edward Barsamian opined, [...] "She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show." [...] TV Land summarized the character's arc and development in the website's biography of her, writing, [...] "Rachel is a born shopper, but... she’s not necessarily a born worker. In fact, before moving in with Monica, she’s never had to work at all, thanks to the generosity of her parents. Luckily, Rachel is smart, resourceful and chic, so her future is bright, both as a member of the workforce and with her newfound tribe." [...] Examining the character's sexuality, Splitsider's Mike D'Avria determined that Rachel has had the third most sexual partners, 14, as well as the highest percentage of serious monogamous relationships at 71%. D'Avria opined, [...] "Throughout the whole series Rachel is continually meeting men she wants to impress. Her flirtations typically fail, but she somehow winds up in a serious relationship with them." [...] Additionally, Rachel is also the only character to admit to having had a homosexual experience.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{offering}} a good viewer experience, traditional star ball projectors suffer several inherent limitations. From a practical point of view, the low light levels require several {{minutes for the}} audience to [...] "dark adapt" [...] its eyesight. [...] "Star ball" [...] projection is limited in education terms by its inability to move beyond an earth-bound view of the night sky. Finally, in most traditional projectors the various overlaid projection systems are incapable of proper occultation. This means that a planet image projected {{on top of a}} star field (for example) will still show the stars shining through the planet image, degrading the quality of the viewing experience. For related reasons, some planetaria show stars below the horizon projecting on the walls below the dome or on the floor, or (with a bright star or a planet) <b>shining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of someone in the audience.|$|E
