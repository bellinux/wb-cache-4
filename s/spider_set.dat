5|$|Uniquely among chelicerates, {{the final}} {{sections}} of spiders' chelicerae are fangs, {{and the great}} majority of spiders can use them to inject venom into prey from venom glands in the roots of the chelicerae. The families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae, and some Liphistiidae spiders, have lost their venom glands, and kill their prey with silk instead. Like most arachnids, including scorpions, spiders have a narrow gut that can only cope with liquid food and <b>spiders</b> have two <b>sets</b> of filters to keep solids out. They use one of two different systems of external digestion. Some pump digestive enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species, the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|R
40|$|We {{employed}} a novel parametric <b>spider</b> picture <b>set</b> {{in the context}} of a parametric fMRI anxiety provocation study, designed to tease apart brain regions involved in threat monitoring from regions representing an exaggerated anxiety response in spider phobics. For the stimulus set, we systematically manipulated perceived proximity of threat by varying a depicted spider's context, size, and posture. All stimuli were validated in a behavioral rating study (phobics n[*]=[*] 20; controls n[*]=[*] 20; all female). An independent group participated in a subsequent fMRI anxiety provocation study (phobics n[*]=[*] 7; controls n[*]=[*] 7; all female), in which we compared a whole-brain categorical to a whole-brain parametric analysis. Results demonstrated that the parametric analysis provided a richer characterization of the functional role of the involved brain networks. In three brain regions-the mid insula, the dorsal anterior cingulate, and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex-activation was linearly modulated by perceived proximity specifically in the spider phobia group, indicating a quantitative representation of an exaggerated anxiety response. In other regions (e. g., the amygdala), activation was linearly modulated in both groups, suggesting a functional role in threat monitoring. Prefrontal regions, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were activated during anxiety provocation but did not show a stimulus-dependent linear modulation in either group. The results confirm that brain regions involved in anxiety processing hold a quantitative representation of a pathological anxiety response and more generally suggest that parametric fMRI designs may be a very powerful tool for clinical research in the future, particularly when developing novel brain-based interventions (e. g., neurofeedback training).

40|$|Baby Monitor {{consists}} of twelve essays and nine journal entries about my new experience of motherhood {{and the first}} year and half of my first child, Benjamin's life. The essays and journal entries range from a mother's internal struggles of the stress of being a new mom to the encapsulation of the frozen moments that take my breath away as a mother. Hovering Between Two Worlds is about a mother's reflection on the prism that beams in her heart as light spills through a floor to ceiling Victorian window. The Her I Knew, the She I Know is a reflection on who I was before motherhood and who I am becoming as a mother. Mullets and Mohawks is about meeting a mother in line at Target and looking for confirmation from another mother that motherhood is difficult. Mom Insecruity Top Ten List is a list of ten insecurities I felt as a new mom. Heat Rising is about watching my son hold up our wedding itinerary against the curry yellow wall of our hallway. This reflection details some of the struggles my husband and I had after years of infertility. I'm Not Alone is an essay about the isolation, loneliness, and boredom of being a stay-at-home mom and adjusting to the transition of working full-time to staying home with my son after quitting my job as a school teacher. Tug Tug Tug is about the thick silk strings of a mother's heart as it feels the tug and connection to her husband and son. It is also about a writing <b>spider</b> that <b>sets</b> up a home in my backyard. Totin' is about stranger germ phobia, baby fingertip kisses, infertility, and the magic you can share with a stranger while waiting in line at CVS. Bored Baby - Bored Mama is an essay about a mother's guilt of not wanting to swoon over my baby every minute, as I try to find balance in the sliced pie of motherhood. Mum - Is He British?

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a number of}} new results on the topological and geometric properties of certain invariant sets in the dynamics of entire functions, inspired by recent work of Rippon and Stallard. First, we explorethe intricate structure of the spider's web fast escaping sets associated with certain transcendental entire functions. Our results are expressed in terms of the components of the comple- ment of the set (the 'holes' in the web). We describe the topology of such components and give a characterisation of their possible orbits under iteration. We show that there are uncountably many compo- nents having each of a number of orbit types, and we prove that components with bounded orbits are quasiconformally homeomor- phic to components of the filled Julia set of a polynomial. We prove that there are singleton periodic components and that these are dense in the J ulia set. Next, we investigate the connectedness properties of the set of points K(f) where the iterates of an entire function f are bounded. We describe a class of transcendental entire functions for which K(f) is to- tally disconnected if and only if each component of K (f) containing a critical point is aperiodic. Moreover we show that, for such functions, if K(f) is disconnected then it has uncountably many components. We give examples of functions for which K(f) is totally disconnected, and we use quasiconformal surgery to construct a function for which K(f) has a component with empty interior that is not a singleton. Finally we show that, if the Julia set of a transcendental entire func- tion is locally connected, then it must {{take the form of a}} spider's web. In the opposite direction, we prove that a <b>spider's</b> web Julia <b>set</b> is always locally connected at a dense subset of buried points.

Wolf spider mortality after feeding on ground crickets [...] General discussion [...] Appendices. Cotton bollworm larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae, Helicoverpa spp.) that survive on genetically modified ‘Bt cotton’ contribute {{to the risk of}} widespread resistance to Bt toxins. A resistance management technique in cotton fields involves deep tilling of the soil to kill overwintering pupae ('pupae busting'), which is incompatible with the agronomic practice of minimum tillage. As a biological control alternative in minimum-tillage cotton fields, ground predators can kill Helicoverpa spp. larvae as they descend from the plant to pupate in the soil, or moths emerging from underground. In this thesis, I examine the impact of biological control from wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae on ground-dwelling stages of Helicoverpa spp., as a strategy for Bt resistance management in minimum-tillage fields. Wolf spider diversity was higher in complex minimum-tillage cotton plots compared to simple tilled cotton plots. Predation events of general prey were rare to obseve in the field, and gut-content tests that a low proportion of wolf spiders (2. 1 %) potentially killed IgG-marked Helicoverpa spp. larvae, bu this is likely due to the low rate of spider recapture in cotton plots due to migration. In encosed containers, the three largest and abundant species of wolf spiders Tasmanicosa leuckartii, Hogna crispipes, and Hogna kuyani all kill high proportions of the 5 th instar Helicoverpa spp. larvae on the soil. Tasmanicosa killed Helicoverpa before and after pupation; in glasshouse enclosures, a single Tasmanicosa can reduce by 38 % the number of larvae surviving to pupation, and by 66 % the number of larvae surviving to moth emergence. The increase in abundance (one or two Tasmaniacosa or Hogna individuals) in glasshouse enclosures did not increase Helicoverpa mortality. Increasing spider abundance and diversity (Tasmanicosa + Hogna) in glasshouse enclosures reduced Helicoverpa survival compared to one Tasmanicosa only, but this effect was not additive, suggesting that antagonistic interguild interactions between wolf spiders can limit biological control on Helicoverpa. In the presence of the ground cricket Teleogryllus commodus (a prey commonly observed in the field), Tasmanicosa still killed high proportions of Helicoverpa larvae in laboratory containers. However, transience acquired toxicity by Teleogryllus which led to spider mortality can disrupt biological control of Helicoverpa. In addition to consumptive effects of direct predation, wolf spiders also exerted non-consumptive effects on Helicoverpa in laboratory containers, Helicoverpa larvae spent less time on a cotton boll and more time on the soil {{in the presence of a}} spider. Additionally, increased loss of cotton boll mass likely reflects changes in Helicoverpa foraging behaviour induced by the presence of <b>spiders.</b> Considering the <b>setting</b> (laboratory, glashouse, field), and the interactions with intraguild predators and alternative prey, wolf spiders showed various strengths and limitations in their capacity to control Helicoverpa. Given the high diversity and abundance of wolf spiders in cotton fields throughout the cropping season, and the high proportion of Helicoverpa spp. larvae and moths that spiders kill even in the presence of alternative prey, wolf spiders should be considered important biological control agents when implementing pest and Bt resistance management strategies.
