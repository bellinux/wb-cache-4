In addition, supply risk mitigation and <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> process maturity positively influence <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> performance, the latter having the strongest influence. Furthermore, supply risk monitoring, supply risk mitigation and <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> process maturity all moderate the effect of environmental uncertainty, whereas only risk monitoring has an influence on the relationship between behavioral uncertainty and <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> performance. This research identified not only the antecedents of <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> performance, but also the moderating effect of different <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> principles on the relation between uncertainty and <b>supply</b> risk <b>management</b> performance.

The program aims to take place over six years, supporting measures that reduce Kiribati's vulnerability to the effects of climate change and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change, assessing and protecting available water resources, and managing inundation. At the start of the Adaptation Program, representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20–40 years and proposed coping mechanisms to deal with these changes under four categories of urgency of need. The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas. Initiatives include improving water <b>supply</b> <b>management</b> in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.|$|E

25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} Syria is confronted with numerous challenges. First, {{all of the}} country's major rivers are shared with neighboring countries, and Syria depends {{to a large extent}} on the inflow of water from Turkey through the Euphrates and its tributaries. Second, high population growth and urbanisation increase the pressure on water resources, resulting in localized groundwater depletion and pollution, for example in the Ghouta near Damascus. Third, there is no legal framework for integrated water resources management. Finally, the institutions in charge of water resources management are weak, being both highly centralized and fragmented between sectors, and they often lack the power to enforce regulations. Water resources policies have been focused on the construction of dams, the development of irrigated agriculture and occasional interbasin transfers, such as a pipeline to supply drinking water to Aleppo from the Euphrates. There are 165 dams in Syria with a total storage capacity of 19.6km³. Demand management through metering, higher tariffs, more efficient irrigation technologies and the reduction of non-revenue water in drinking water supply has received less emphasis than <b>supply</b> <b>management.</b> The government implements a large program for the construction of wastewater treatment plants including the use of reclaimed water for irrigation.|$|E
