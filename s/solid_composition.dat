Therefore, the validity of both groups of theories is in doubt, and irreversible thermodynamics as currently applied is untrustworthy.

This thesis investigates the constant pressure cake filtration of interacting cellulose fibre/TiO 2 (rutile) mixtures, and involved experimental studies using an automated pressure filtration apparatus. The influence of suspension composition, filtration pressure and solution environment on filtration has been discussed in relation to cake properties such as average cake porosity and specific resistance. To help interpret the filtration results, sedimentation data were also obtained. The average porosities of filter cakes formed from pure rutile and fibre suspensions in deionised water were approximately 0. 6 and 0. 75, respectively, and a steady and progressive increase in porosity with fibre fraction was generally observed. With filtrations at 450 kPa, the average specific cake resistances for pure fibre and rutile in deionised water were approximately 9. 4 x 1013 and 4. 2 x 1012 m kg- 1 respectively, with the variation of specific resistance with <b>solids</b> <b>composition</b> showing a minimum. Similar trends were observed at other tested filtration pressures with suspensions in deionised water but not with filtrations of suspensions in 0. 2 M NaCl and 0. 1 M CaCl 2 solutions. The minima in average specific cake resistance with <b>solids</b> <b>composition</b> for feeds in deionised water was attributed to rutile-fibre interactions. Abrupt transitions in cake structure were evident part way through some filtrations, and resulted in unexpected filtrate flow behaviour. This is an interesting phenomenon, and {{not only were the}} changes in cake structure relatively reproducible, but also the nature of the change could be altered by changes in filtration pressure, <b>solids</b> <b>composition</b> and/or solution environment. The study of fibre/particle binary filtration behaviour, in particular the porosity and specific cake resistance trends, were substantiated by relevant theoretical treatment and modelling analysis. With the porosity trends, an additive porosity concept seemed to represent the data better than interparticle penetration models. With the specific cake resistance trends, a semi-empirical equation was proposed which appeared to represent a wide range of binary mixture filtration data.

This study examines {{the effects of the}} regular use of oxitropium bromide in such patients. METHODS [...] The study was conducted in a parallel, double blind, placebo controlled fashion. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group (n = 17) received oxitropium bromide from a metered dose inhaler (two puffs three times daily; 100 micrograms/puff) for eight weeks, and the second group (n = 16) received placebo. Lung function was measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and vital capacity. In evaluating airway secretion, daily amount of expectorated sputum, percentage <b>solid</b> <b>composition,</b> viscoelastic properties including elastic modulus and dynamic viscosity, and sputum microbiology were determined. RESULTS [...] Oxitropium bromide increased FEV 1 and decreased the mean (SE) sputum production from 61 (4) to 42 (3) g/day after treatment, whereas placebo had no effect.
