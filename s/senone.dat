25|$|The First, Second, and Third Samnite Wars (343–341 BC, 326–304 BC and 298–290 BC) were fought {{between the}} Roman Republic and the Samnites, {{who lived on}} a stretch of the Apennine Mountains {{to the south of}} Rome and the north of the Lucanians. The first of these wars was the result of Rome's {{intervening}} to rescue the Campanian city of Capua from a Samnite attack. The second one was the result of Rome's intervention in the politics of the city of Naples and developed into a contest over the control of much of central and southern Italy. The third war also involved a struggle over the control of this part of Italy. The wars extended over half a century and the peoples to the east, north and west of Samnium (land of the Samnites) as well as the peoples of central Italy north of Rome (the Etruscans, Umbrians and Picenti) and the <b>Senone</b> Gauls got involved to various degrees and at various points in time. The Samnites were one of early Rome's most formidable rivals.|$|E
25|$|In 299 BC, the Etruscans, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} Roman colony set up at Narnia in next-door Umbria, {{prepared for}} war against Rome. However, the Gauls invaded their territory, so, the Etruscans offered them money to form an alliance. The Gauls agreed, but then objected to fighting against Rome, claiming that the agreement was only about them not devastating Etruscan territory. So, instead, the Etruscans paid the Gauls off and dismissed them. This incident led the Romans to ally with the Picentes (who lived on the Adriatic coast, {{in the south of}} modern Marche) who were concerned about their neighbours, the <b>Senone</b> Gauls to the north, and the Pretutii to the south. The latter had allied with the Samnites. The Romans sent an army to Etruria led by the consul Titus Manlius Torquatus, who died in a riding accident. The Etruscans saw this as an omen for war. However, the Romans elected Marcus Valerius Corvus Calenus as suffect consul (an office which lasted {{for the remainder of the}} term of a deceased or removed consul) and he was sent to Etruria. This led the Etruscans to remain in their fortifications, refusing battle even though the Romans ravaged their land. Meanwhile, the Picentes warned the Romans that the Samnites were preparing for war and that they had asked them for help.|$|E

[...] When the Senones appeared, the Clusians felt threatened and asked Rome for help. The Romans sent the three sons of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, one of Rome’s most powerful aristocrats, as ambassadors. They told the Gauls not to attack Clusium and that if they did, the Romans would fight to defend the town. They then asked to negotiate a peace. The Senones accepted a peace on condition that the Clusians would give them some land. There was a quarrel and a battle broke out. The Roman ambassadors joined in. One of them killed a <b>Senone</b> chieftain. This was a violation of the rule that ambassadors have to be neutral.

5000|$|Forsythe {{maintains}} {{that at the}} battle of Arretium the Romans suffered a crushing defeat resulting in the death of the general, seven military tribunes seconded to the commanders and thirteen thousand Roman soldiers. He draws these figures from St Augustine and Orosius. However, it has to be noted that these two authors wrote in the early fifth century AD, some seven hundred years after the battle. Both were clergymen and Christian writers. The Books of both authors in which they mentioned this battle were apologetic of Christianity and were aimed at showing that the world had improved with Christianity and that many disasters had happened in the pagan days. Orosius also collaborated with Augustine on the latter's book (The City of God) and his text is remarkably similar to that of St Augustine's. Both authors also wrote of a coalition of Lucanians, Brutians, Samnites, Etruscans, and <b>Senone</b> Gauls. This never happened, there had been a coalition of Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians and <b>Senone</b> Gauls (but not Lucanians or Brutians) which fought Rome at the Battle of Sentinum 11/12 years earlier (in 295 BC), during the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC). Both this and the purpose of their writing may cast doubts on their accuracy. Moreover, although the consuls for the year are mentioned, Arretium is not. [...] St Augustine wrote: [...] "... at one time, the Lucanians, Brutians, Samnites, Tuscans, and Senonian Gauls conspired against Rome, and first slew her ambassadors, then overthrew an army under the prætor, putting to the sword 13,000 men, besides the commander and seven tribunes." [...] Orosius wrote... during the consulship of Dolabella and Domitius, the Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites made an alliance with the Etruscans and Senonian Gauls, who were attempting to renew war against the Romans. The Romans sent ambassadors to dissuade the Gauls from joining this alliance, but the Gauls killed the envoys. The praetor Caecilius was sent with an army to avenge their murder and to crush the uprising of the enemy. He was, however, overwhelmed by the Etruscans and Gauls, and perished. Seven military tribunes were also slain in that battle, many nobles were killed, and thirty thousand soldiers likewise met their death.|$|E
50|$|According to Livy, in Rome {{no special}} {{measures}} were taken and the levy “was not larger {{than had been}} usual in ordinary campaigns.” The Gauls marched on Rome so quickly that “Rome was thunderstruck by the swiftness at which they moved, which is shown both by the haste in mustering the army, {{as if it were}} meeting a spur-of-the moment emergency and the difficulty in getting any further than the eleventh milestone.” The Romans were greatly outnumbered. They did not set up camp or build a defensive rampart and they did not divine the gods as they were supposed to. They extended the wings in order not to be outflanked, but this made their line thin and weakened such that the centre could hardly be kept together. They placed the reserves on a hill on the right. Brennus, the <b>Senone</b> chieftain, suspected that this was a ruse and that the reservists would attack him from the rear while he was fighting the Roman army in the plain. He therefore attacked the hill.|$|E
