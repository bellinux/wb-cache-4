5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the <b>Seeker</b> ball, fired by the opponent. The <b>Seeker</b> will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the <b>Seeker</b> at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the <b>Seeker</b> is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E

5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman. Yajnavalkya acknowledges her motivations, and that her questions are evidence she is a <b>seeker</b> of ultimate knowledge and a lover of the Atman.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{when the story}} first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy the <b>Seeker,</b> popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822. The tale continues to be told {{as part of the}} local oral tradition.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has found}} that {{generally}} Australians hold negative attitudes towards asylum <b>seekers.</b> These negative attitudes appear {{to be influenced by}} perceptions of threat and false beliefs. The current study explored the attitudes of Anglo-Australians towards asylum <b>seekers</b> and how attitudes are related to the concept of Australian egalitarianism and fair go. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted for this study. Three main themes were identified through thematic content analysis: characterising asylum <b>seekers,</b> responses to asylum <b>seekers</b> in Australia, and constructing fairness. 2 ̆ 7 Characterising asylum <b>seekers</b> represented the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of asylum <b>seekers</b> as being genuine asylum <b>seekers,</b> or boat people and illegal immigrants. The latter two are stereotypes commonly used by the media and political figures which appear to influence most of the informants 2 ̆ 7 constructs of asylum <b>seekers.</b> Responses to asylum <b>seekers</b> in Australia reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 discussions of intercultural racist attitudes, competition for resources, and perceptions of threat. These appeared to be guided by in-group and out-group relations. Constructing fairness reflected the informants 2 ̆ 7 definitions of fairness and how it is applied to asylums <b>seekers.</b> It appears the allocation of fairness is distinguished by in-group favouritism. This study adds to the prior knowledge of attitudes towards asylum <b>seekers</b> within an Australian context...|$|R
50|$|While some of {{the work}} {{conducted}} by the ASRC is the provision of services to asylum <b>seekers,</b> the ASRC main purpose is to advocate for the rights of asylum <b>seekers</b> and runs several campaigns at any one time. The ASRC has run campaigns on healthcare access for asylum <b>seekers,</b> the perception of asylum <b>seekers</b> (Just Like Us), ending mandatory detention and getting kids out of detention (End Mandatory Detention - get kids out of detention), the Malaysia people swap, and the provision of a safety net for all asylum <b>seekers</b> (Safety Net for All Asylum <b>Seekers).</b>|$|R
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena is a 2D {{overhead}} shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Parker Brothers in 1983 for the Atari 2600. It is the first Star Wars video game to feature lightsaber action.

5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's <b>seeker</b> for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.|$|E
5|$|The asylum <b>seeker</b> debate {{returned}} during August 2012 {{following the}} report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, led by retired Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston. Accepting the panel's recommendation, Gillard on 12 August 2012 announced that a bill then before Parliament would be amended to allow the Government to choose sites for off-shore processing. At the same time she announced the Government would nominate Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea to be re-opened. The amended bill passed {{with the support of the}} Opposition on 16 August 2012.|$|E

5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a <b>seeker</b> must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar <b>seeker</b> in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone <b>seeker,</b> making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the <b>Seeker</b> since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|Escape from Woomera is an {{unfinished}} point-and-click adventure video game, intended to criticise {{the treatment of}} mandatorily detained asylum seekers in Australia {{as well as the}} Australian government's attempt to impose a media blackout on the detention centres. In the game, the player assumes the role of Mustafa, an Iranian asylum <b>seeker</b> being held at Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. Mustafa's request for asylum has been denied, and, fearing that he will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation to Iran, he decides to attempt to escape Woomera. Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan.|$|E
5|$|Praetor Karass was a protoss high templar. His {{mastery of}} psionic powers was {{considered}} legendary. On {{the eve of}} the Second Great War, Karass and his troops journeyed to Ulaan in pursuit of Infested Kerrigan. There he met the Prelate Zeratul; the dark templar was seeking information on the hybrids. The praetor put himself at Zeratul's disposal and the pair broke through zerg patrols and found the prophecy Zeratul and Kerrigan sought. Kerrigan attacked the outnumbered protoss shortly afterward. Karass instructed Zeratul to escape with the information; the praetor and his troops proceeded to buy Zeratul time with their lives. The dark templar reluctantly withdrew aboard Void <b>Seeker,</b> and swore Karass' sacrifice would not be in vain.|$|E
50|$|Historically, most asylum <b>seekers</b> {{arrived by}} plane.

In 2011-2012, asylum <b>seekers</b> arriving by boat outnumbered those arriving by plane for the first time. Three waves of asylum <b>seekers</b> arriving by boat have been identified: Vietnamese between 1976 and 1981; Indochinese asylum <b>seekers</b> from 1989 to 1998; and people of Middle East origin, and the use of people smugglers, from 1999.|$|R

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target <b>seeker</b> (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal <b>seeker</b> mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.|$|E
