40|$|Observations have {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} cyclonic eddies embedded in the landward border of the southern Agulhas Current. These <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> eddies are most prevalent in the Agulhas Bank shelf bight, have a diameter of about 50 – 100 km and are represented by a thermal dome and a surface warm plume inshore. In an attempt to better understand their generation and behavior, {{we have used a}} high-resolution model designed for the general region. The ocean model employed is the Regional Ocean Modeling System that solves the free surface, hydrostatic, primitive equations over variable topography using stretched, terrain-following coordinates in the vertical, orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal, and featuring high-order schemes. The model simulates the creation of cyclonic <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> eddies and their attendant surface plumes of warm water {{along the edge of the}} Agulhas Bank with a high degree of verisimilitude. The dimensions of the model features, their hydrographic structure and their velocities bear a strong resemblance to what has been observed. The simulation suggests that <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> eddies remain trapped in the Agulhas Bank shelf bight and that eddies that subsequently travel downstream represent leakages from the resident shear eddy. This intermittent but frequent leakage of cyclonic motion downstream propagates at roughly 8 km day 1 at intervals of roughly 20 days, and may trigger the detachment of a cyclonic eddy at the tip of the Agulhas Bank...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been recognised that cyclonic motion on the landward border of the Agulhas Current is inherent in meanders such as Natal Pulses and <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> eddies. To date no directed measurements {{have been made to}} study such cyclonic features. We present observations on the characteristics and the behaviour of the cyclones that are generated {{at the edge of the}} Agulhas Current using altimetry, RAFOS floats on two surfaces, hydrographic data as well as thermal infrared satellite images. It is shown that cyclones associated with Natal Pulses as well as with <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> features move downstream, are shed into the South Atlantic and often are instrumental in triggering the occlusion of an Agulhas ring. The surface thermal expression as well as the sea surface height of Agulhas cyclones are shown to be very closely tied to their Lagrangian movement at depth. The speed of downstream translation of cyclones lies between 10 km d- 1 for a Natal Pulse and 17 km d- 1 for a <b>shear</b> <b>edge</b> eddy. The tangential speeds are up to 100 cm s- 1 on the 26. 8 sq surface and up to 80 cm s- 1 on the 27. 2 sq surface; the rotational period lies between 5 and 7 days (mesoscale pulses) and is around 2 - 3 days for sub-mesoscale pulses. Float pressure records indicate across-stream vertical displacements of more than 500 m. Once shed south of Africa Agulhas cyclones seem rapidly to disintegrate in the Cape Basin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A direct {{punching}} of inclined ultra-high strength {{steel sheets}} having low ductility {{was carried out}} {{to improve the quality}} of the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge.</b> In the direct punching of an inclined sheet, the contact between the sheet and punch became gradual because of touch from the bottom edge of the punch, and thus the sheared portion tended to bend in the latter half of punching. As the strength of the sheet increased, defects such as burr and secondary burnished surface were occurred around the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> due to the low ductility. The range of direct punching for <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> without defects was shown for the high strength steel sheets. To prevent the occurrence of defects, a punch having inclined bottom was used. In this punch, the contact with the sheet was changed, the uniform contact with the inclined bottom was given.

40|$|The role of {{microstructural}} {{damage in}} controlling the edge stretchability of Complex-Phase (CP) and Dual-Phase (DP) steels was evaluated using hole tension experiments. The experiments considered a tensile specimen {{with a hole}} {{at the center of}} specimen that is either <b>sheared</b> (<b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> condition) or drilled and then reamed (reamed edge condition). The damage mechanism and accumulation in the CP and DP steels were systematically characterized by interrupting the hole tension tests at different strain levels using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and optical microscopy. Martensite cracking and decohesion of ferrite-martensite interfaces are the dominant nucleation mechanisms in the DP 780. The primary source of void nucleation in the CP 800 is nucleation at TiN particles, with secondary void formation at martensite/bainite interfaces near the failure strain. The rate of damage evolution is considerably higher for the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> in contrast with the reamed <b>edge</b> since the <b>shearing</b> process alters the microstructure in the shear affected zone (SAZ) by introducing work-hardening and initial damage behind the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge.</b> The CP microstructures were shown to be less prone to shear-induced damage than the DP materials resulting in much higher <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> formability. Microstructural damage in the CP and DP steels was characterized to understand the interaction between microstructure, damage evolution and edge formability during edge stretching.

40|$|In recent years, Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) {{have been}} used for the {{lightweight}} structural design and manufacturing in automotive industry. This class of sheet metals are prone to edge fracture during stamping production, and the fracture often occurs at much lower strain than that predicted based on the forming limit curves. The uncertainty in predicting edge fracture represents a great challenge in the application of AHSS. This dissertation is focused on the better understanding of edge fracture phenomenon through experimental observation and computer modeling with the consideration of microstructure effect. In this dissertation, Hole Expansion (HE) test was used to investigate the mechanisms of edge fracture of two AHSS, Dual Phase DP 780 and DP 980. The HE test includes two processing steps: hole punching and hole expanding. The punching process creates holes of various <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> morphologies, which are the input to the hole expanding process, along with the intrinsic property of material, produce a joint effect on the crack initiation and propagation on the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> during HE test. The hole punching process was first investigated. The <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> were analyzed with image processing, and the relative heights of <b>sheared</b> four <b>edge</b> zones were measured, which were used to determine the strain distributions of <b>sheared</b> <b>edges.</b> The punching process was further simulated with FEA, and referenced with the experimental observations. Fracture mechanism of hole punching process was deduced. The process of crack initiation and propagation in hole expanding process was studied the next. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe cracks on the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges.</b> FEA simulation was applied to investigate the effect of <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> geometry on the stress evolution in the hole expanding process. The interaction of two neighboring parallel cracks in the crack propagation process was analyzed to explain the effect of crack population on the main crack propagation. To investigate the microstructure effect on the edge fracture, the dual phase grain structure and its effect on mechanical properties and fracture behavior of DP steels were analyzed. Based on HE test results and observed DP steel grain structures, a criterion to predict edge fracture was proposed. This criterion includes mesoscale grain structure features of DP steels, and it can be applied to predict the HE test results of DP steels. The heterogeneous microstructures of DP steels were built into the Representative Volume Element (RVE) models to study the effects of microstructure parameters and fracture mechanisms on macroscale mechanical properties of DP steels, with damage based failure criteria applied to constituent ferritic and martensitic phases...|$|R
40|$|An {{excellent}} {{quality of}} <b>shearing</b> <b>edge</b> implies that a smooth cutting edge without tearing will be observed {{on the whole}} edge surface. This {{is one of the}} most significant features of the fine-blanking process. To achieve this good blanking edge quality in fine-blanking, quite a large number of factors need to be considered simultaneously during the operation, such as blanking speed, processing material, product shape, lubrication and tool geometry. Thus, the objective of this paper is mainly to study the influence of tool geometry change in fine-blanking for different materials. This is because the nose radius usually seriously deteriorates with increasing service period in mass production, which eventually causes the entire loss of the specific features of the fine-blanking process. Therefore, a tailor-made experimental study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the punch nose radius and the <b>shearing</b> <b>edge</b> quality, such as the <b>shearing</b> <b>edge</b> surface finish, burr height and die-roll height, during fine-blanking for different types of materials. Consequently, findings show that an increase in the punch nose radius produces a higher percentage of fracture of the blanked edge and increases the amount of burr height.

This push has created research in which the 3 -D surface profile of two different marks are characterized and the marks 2 ̆ 7 cross-sections are run through a comparative statistical algorithm to acquire a value that is intended to indicate the likelihood of a match between the marks. The aforementioned algorithm has been developed and extensively tested through comparison of evenly striated marks made by screwdrivers.

40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash compression mould tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug compression mould tool with a vertical <b>shear</b> <b>edge.</b> This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|E

In this process, a moving die was employed in order to correct the eccentricity between the punch and die and to ease the setting of tools. The gap between the die and holder allowed the eccentric die to move, and thus the die became concentric after several strikes. For the moving die, the depth of the shiny burnished surface on the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> increased and that of the rough fracture surface decreased.

40|$|Dual-Phase (DP) steels, part of {{the group}} of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS), are used by car {{manufactures}} due to its large strength to weight ratio. The high strength of the DP steel does {{have a negative impact on}} the formability during sheet metal forming and stretch forming, e. g. fractures often appear in <b>shear</b> cut <b>edges</b> during forming of blanks made of DP steel.   The main objective with this thesis is to develop a new punch for Volvo Cars that concentrates the strain to the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> of a test specimen made from different types of DP steel. This is done to be able to measure and obtain maximum fracture strain during stretch forming tests in a press. The newly developed test method is called CTEST (Concentrated Trim Edge Strain Test).   The tests are performed with DP steel specimens with three different qualities of the shear cut edges; fine cut, medium cut and worn cut. DP steels tested are DP 600 GI, DP 600 UC and DP 800 GI from three different suppliers. 10 different types of DP steels are tested in this study with different thickness. Thickness of specimens tested are 1 mm, 1. 1 mm, 1. 5 mm and 2 mm and all specimens tested have a lengthwise (RD) rolling direction.   The quality of the <b>sheared</b> cut <b>edge</b> has a great impact to the formability and maximum fracture strain of the specimen. A specimen with a fine cut endures higher fracture strain than medium cut and a worn cut for all types of DP steel with different thickness. A 1 mm thick specimen endures a lower fracture strain than 1. 5 mm and 2 mm specimen for all cut qualities.   Further, the impact of the orientation of the burr zone of a <b>shear</b> cut <b>edge</b> is studied. With the burr zone facing upwards from the CTEST punch the formability of the specimens is decreased compared to a burr zone facing downwards, especially for a worn cut specimen with micro cracks and imperfections in the edge surface.   ARAMIS Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system is used to analyze the specimen edges during press experiments. The ARAMIS results unveil that several small fractures appear in the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> of a specimen just before the specimens split into two pieces. This phenomenon was seen for specimen with worn and medium shear cut qualities.   Finite Element (FE) simulations of the CTEST is performed in AutoForm to determine maximum values of the true strain for the three different cut qualities.

Other than five omnivorous species, one herbivore (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), one carnivore (Ursus maritimus) and one insectivore (Melursus ursinus) exist. To define morphological similarities and differences in skull and dentition within the {{family of the}} Ursidae, the following method was developed. First the different feeding types are characterized by the parameters that are measured. Furthermore {{it may be possible to}} detect food preferences within the omnivorous species. Finally a comparison of fossil with extant tooth material takes place to find similarities and differences between the species in the Plio-Pleistocene and nowadays. Thus morphological features can suggest the type of diet of the fossil animals and the habitat they lived in. Parameters that are measured in the material of the extant species are the distance between occlusal plane and temporomandibular joint, tooth sizes and size ratios as well as <b>shearing</b> <b>edges</b> of the postcanine teeth. The specialized species among the Ursidae all show different values of these characteristics. The herbivore bear shows strong adaptations to masticatory activity such as a large distance between occlusal plane and temporomandibular joint, teeth with a large surface and pronounced <b>shearing</b> <b>edges</b> on the postcanine teeth. The carnivore and the insectivore bear however distinguish from this by a short distance between occlusal plane and temporomandibular joint and smaller teeth in general. The carnivorous member of the Ursidae family possesses generally long, narrow teeth, the insectivorous short and narrow teeth. Furthermore they distinguish by the distribution of <b>shearing</b> <b>edges</b> on the postcanine teeth. Within the omnivorous species tendencies to the one or the other specialist can be found, but in general they are a very heterogeneous group with diverse development of the characteristics, which display hybrids of the specialized forms. The comparison of the fossil material with the extant material shows partial significant differences and tendencies to different values. This may suggest that the measured Plio-Pleistocene species fed partially differently than their relatives living nowadays...|$|R
