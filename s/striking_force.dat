5|$|During the Pacific War, the US Navy's fast battleships had mainly {{been used}} to escort the groups of {{aircraft}} carriers that formed the United States Pacific Fleet's main <b>striking</b> <b>force.</b> They had also occasionally bombarded Japanese positions near the shore, and had fought some actions with Japanese warships.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 1942, the Japanese carrier <b>striking</b> <b>force,</b> {{consisting}} of aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, and Soryu {{under the command}} of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, launched 189 planes to attack Darwin. The carrier planes rendezvoused with 54 land-based bombers from Kendari and Ambon.|$|E

In {{the same way}} that 1990's Smash TV is a modernized reimagining of Robotron: 2084 with two-player simultaneous play, <b>Strike</b> <b>Force</b> is a modernized reimagining of Defender with two-player simultaneous play. <b>Strike</b> <b>Force</b> was not widely distributed and was not ported to any home systems.|$|R
5|$|The ship figured {{prominently}} {{in the development of}} the IJN's carrier <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, {{which was}} led by Admiral William Halsey, {{conducted}} a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's <b>striking</b> <b>force,</b> Task Force38 (TF38), which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain and included nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers. On 10July TF38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air. No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large-scale suicide attacks on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945. Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground. The American warships then sailed south and on 16July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's (BPF's) main <b>striking</b> <b>force,</b> which was designated Task Force37 (TF37), and comprised three aircraft carriers and their escorts.|$|E
5|$|During mid- to late-1943 the Home Fleet, the Royal Navy's main <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> {{stationed}} in the United Kingdom, was augmented by two forces of United States Navy warships to replace British ships dispatched to the Mediterranean and Pacific. These reinforcements were considered necessary {{to ensure that the}} fleet remained able to counter the German battle group based in Norway, which was built around the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst, and the heavy cruiser Lützow.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 February, the ABDA <b>strike</b> <b>force</b> was spotted by a {{squadron}} of about 30 Japanese bombers reported as heading toward Surabaya. Seven of the bombers showed special interest in the <b>strike</b> <b>force</b> and started circling above the ships. The ships initially dispersed to deeper water, but the planes left without attacking, and the <b>strike</b> <b>force</b> resumed taking on supplies.|$|R

5|$|New Jerseys next war cruise, 13 April– 4 May 1944, {{began and}} ended at Majuro. She {{screened}} the carrier <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> which gave air {{support to the}} invasion of Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay and Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, 22 April, then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April– 30 April. New Jersey and her formation shot down two enemy torpedo bombers at Truk. Her 16-inch salvos pounded Ponape 1 May, destroying fuel tanks, badly damaging the airfield, and demolishing a headquarters building.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1942, Akagi set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> {{in the company of}} {{carriers}} Kaga, , and , which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Once again, Nagumo flew his flag on Akagi. Because of damage and losses suffered during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Fifth Carrier Division with carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku was absent from the operation. Akagis aircraft complement consisted of 24 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1942, Sōryū set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> {{in the company of}} Kaga, Akagi, and Hiryū, which {{constituted}} the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Her aircraft complement consisted of eighteen Zeros, sixteen D3As, eighteen B5Ns, and two prototypes of the new Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. Also aboard were three A6M Zeros of the 6th Kōkūtai intended as a portion of the aerial garrison for Midway.|$|E

5|$|The main German <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> was the XLVII Panzer Corps, {{with one}} and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Heer Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the {{defending}} U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack. Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.|$|E
5|$|Akagis {{aircraft}} {{served in}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. Upon {{the formation of the}} First Air Fleet or Kido Butai (<b>Striking</b> <b>Force)</b> in early 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In March and April 1942, Akagi aircraft helped sink a British heavy cruiser and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier <b>Striking</b> <b>Force,</b> reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions, Akagi supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. She provided 20 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which Akagi contributed 9 A6M Zeros and 18 D3As. On the 22nd, Akagis D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul before returning to Truk on 27 January. The Second Carrier Division, with Sōryū and Hiryū, had been detached to support the invasion of Wake Island on 23 December 1941 and did not reunite {{with the rest of the}} carrier mobile <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> until February 1942.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 Mutsu, {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Gunji Kogure, {{was assigned to}} the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with Yamato, Nagato, Hosho, the light cruiser Sendai, nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and Mutsu saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu. She arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May, in {{response}} to Belgian pressure and necessity, the Royal Air Force and the Armée de l'Air undertook several air attacks on the German-held Maastricht and Meuse bridges to prevent German forces flowing into Belgium. 74 sorties had been flown by the Allies since 10 May. On 12 May, eleven out of eighteen French Breguet 693 bombers were shot down. The RAF Advanced Air <b>Striking</b> <b>Force,</b> which included the largest Allied bomber force, was reduced to 72 aircraft out of 135 by 12 May. For the next 24 hours, missions were postponed as the German anti-aircraft and fighter defences were too strong.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{assembled}} {{a powerful force}} for Operation Tungsten. The main <b>striking</b> <b>force</b> {{was made up of}} two wings of Barracudas: 8 Wing comprising 827 and 830 Naval Air Squadrons, and 52 Wing with 829 and 831 Naval Air Squadrons. While 8 Wing was normally based on board Furious and 52 Wing on Victorious, Moore chose to station a squadron from each of the wings on each carrier so they could launch simultaneously and go into battle as formed units. The 163 Fleet Air Arm airmen in the attacking units included 28 New Zealanders, three Canadians, two Australians, and one South African; the remainder were British.|$|E
5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the <b>Striking</b> <b>Force</b> of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on {{a more active role in}} the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of this was her participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much of a role as she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E
5|$|No. 103 Squadron and No. 150 Squadron RAF of the RAF Advanced Air <b>Striking</b> <b>Force</b> (AASF) flew 10 sorties {{against the}} {{targets in the}} early morning. In the process they {{suffered}} only one loss in a forced landing. Between 15:00–16:00, 71 RAF bombers took off escorted by Allied fighters. The impressive escort was offset {{by the presence of}} German fighter units that outnumbered the Allied escort fighters by 3:1. No. 71 Wing RAF lost 10 Fairey Battles and five Bristol Blenheims. No. 75 Wing RAF lost 14–18 Battles and No. 76 Wing RAF lost 11 Battles. Out of 71 bombers dispatched, 40–44 bombers were lost, meaning a loss rate of 56–62 percent. The AASF lost a further five Hawker Hurricanes. The AASF flew 81 sorties and lost 52 percent of its strength. No 2 Group RAF also contributed with 28 sorties. The bombing results were poor, with three bridges damaged and one possibly destroyed.|$|E
