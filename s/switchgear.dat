5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, <b>switchgear</b> {{exploded}} in the South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station could not take the extra load and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption of work and services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 megawatts of electricity.|$|E
5|$|The Denny Substation {{will have}} an initial {{capacity}} of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions. An underground distribution network, scheduled {{to be completed in}} 2020, will direct electricity from the substation to the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union neighborhoods. The substation will be connected to the Massachusetts Substation in SoDo via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line through Downtown Seattle. The use of a gas-insulated <b>switchgear</b> in the Denny Substation will allow for a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad <b>switchgear</b> at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' <b>switchgear</b> was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women working in the factories. The resulting painting {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison <b>Switchgear</b> in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged <b>switchgear</b> due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{magnetic}} field produced by alternating currents flowing in the bus-bars of <b>switchgears</b> induces eddy currents {{in the metal}} parts nearby. The metal enclosure around these bars is also exposed to this {{magnetic field}}, therefore currents, namely power losses within it are ineluctable. Depending on the material and the <b>switchgear’s</b> geometry, the non-uniform current density-, hence the power loss distribution and the total loss can be different in the different phase conductors and in the enclosure. As the analytical modeling of a complex geometry is practically impossible, another approach should be adopted to determine these parameters. This can be the finite element (FE) calculation method. The results of such calculations on the 2 D models of one high voltage and one medium voltage GIS are presented in this paper...|$|R
