5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of TCR diversity {{is similar to}} that for antibodies and B cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation,</b> and T cells do not express Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} highly {{adaptable}} because of <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> (a process of accelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows {{a small number}} of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Since the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all progeny (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the memory B cells and memory T cells that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity.|$|E
25|$|Autoreactive B {{cells can}} accidentally emerge during <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> and migrate into the {{germinal}} center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally {{do not receive}} survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence.|$|E

25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino acid level {{as well as on the}} disulphide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E
500|$|Many viruses undergo {{frequent}} mutations {{that result}} in changes in amino acid composition of their important proteins. Epitopes located on the protein may also undergo alterations in the process. Such an altered epitope binds less strongly with the antibodies specific to the [...] unaltered epitope that would have stimulated the immune system. This is unfortunate because <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation</b> does give rise to clones capable of producing soluble antibodies that would have bound the altered epitope avidly enough to neutralize it. But these clones would consist of naive cells which {{are not allowed to}} proliferate by the weakly binding antibodies produced by the priorly stimulated clone. This doctrine is known as the original antigenic sin. This phenomenon comes into play particularly in immune responses against influenza, dengue and HIV viruses. This limitation, however, is not imposed by the phenomenon of polyclonal response, but rather, against it by an immune response that is biased in favor of experienced memory cells against the [...] "novice" [...] naive cells.|$|E
500|$|A naive (or inexperienced) B cell is {{one which}} {{belongs to a}} clone which has never {{encountered}} the epitope {{to which it is}} specific. In contrast, a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory [...] B cell. The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell, most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells; the rest survive as memory B cells. So, when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells, and also leave a few memory cells, this is known as the primary immune response. In the course of proliferation of this clone, the B cell receptor genes can undergo [...] frequent (one in every two cell divisions) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies. These frequent mutations are termed <b>somatic</b> <b>hypermutation.</b> Each such mutation alters the epitope-binding ability of the paratope slightly, creating new clones of B cells in the process. Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope (leading to the selection of the clones possessing them), which is known as affinity maturation. Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation. Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen. <b>Somatic</b> <b>hypermutation,</b> thus, makes the B cell receptors and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens, more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes, apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place. When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells (just like in the clone's primary response), and leave even more memory cells in the process, this is known as a secondary immune response, which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods. The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it (i.e., greater affinity of binding) owing to affinity maturation. The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding.|$|E

We studied the editing activity of APOBEC- 1 and AID in yeast using the selectable marker Gal 4 linked to its specific inhibitor protein Gal 80 via an apo B cassette (Gal 4 -C) or via the variable region of a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (Gal 4 -VH). Expression of APOBEC- 1 induced C to U editing in up to 15 % of the Gal 4 -C transcripts, while AID was inactive in this reaction even {{in the presence of}} the APOBEC- 1 complementation factor. After expression of APOBEC- 1 as well as AID approximately 10 (- 3) of yeast cells survived low stringency selection and expressed beta-galactosidase.
