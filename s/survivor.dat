40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} personality, coping styles, and psychosomatic characteristics and their relationships in bereaved and non-bereaved earthquake <b>survivors.</b> Study design: Cross-sectional surveyMethods: A {{survey was conducted}} {{with a sample of}} 102 non-bereaved <b>survivors</b> and 79 bereaved <b>survivors</b> from Mianyang, Anyang, and similar districts 2 weeks after Wenchuan earthquake. <b>Survivors</b> completed questionnaires including items about demographics, personality characteristics, coping styles, and psychosomatic status. Results: Bereaved <b>survivors</b> had lower scores for gregariousness, trust, and optimism, but higher scores for depressed mood, loneliness, becoming easily fearful, irritation, and anxiety than non-bereaved <b>survivors.</b> In addition, bereaved participants scored higher for avoiding problems, self-blame, and fantasy coping styles than non-bereaved ones. Personality and coping styles significantly correlated with psychosomatic status in bereaved and non-bereaved <b>survivors.</b> Optimism and openness to feelings personality characteristics, and self-blame, avoiding problems, and rationalization coping styles significantly predicted psychosomatic status of bereaved <b>survivors,</b> while openness to fantasy, optimism, order, and trust personality characteristics, and self-blame and avoiding problems coping styles significantly predicted psychosomatic status of non-bereaved <b>survivors.</b> Conclusion: Earthquake <b>survivors</b> experienced PTSD symptoms and negative emotions. Bereaved <b>survivors</b> experienced more serious PTSD symptoms and negative emotions relative to non-bereaved <b>survivors.</b> Appropriate psychological crisis interventions should be conducted for earthquake <b>survivors,</b> especially bereaved <b>survivors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} cancer <b>survivors</b> {{experiencing}} disease progression (DP) is increasing {{with the number}} of cancer <b>survivors.</b> However, little is known whether DP affects health-related quality of life (HRQL) of long-term cancer <b>survivors.</b> We aimed therefore to compare the health status (HS) and HRQL of DP and disease-free (DF) <b>survivors</b> up to 15 years after initial diagnosis. Methods 232 cancer <b>survivors</b> with DP identified through the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were matched with 232 DF <b>survivors</b> of similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients completed generic HS (SF- 36) and cancer-specific HRQL (QOL-CS) questionnaires 5 - 15 years after diagnosis. Results Compared with DF <b>survivors,</b> DP <b>survivors</b> exhibited significantly lower scores on all SF- 36 and QOL-CS (except spiritual well-being) dimensions. DF <b>survivors</b> had better scores than the normative population on all SF- 36 dimensions. Among <b>survivors</b> with DP, those with short survival (< 5 years) had significantly poorer HS scores on all dimensions except bodily pain compared with the normative population. Comparatively, the long survival (≥ 5 years) DP group had better HRQL than the short DP group but poorer HRQL than the normative population. In multivariate analyses, DP and DF survival time were independently associated with aspects of HS and HRQL in cancer <b>survivors.</b> Discussions/Conclusions DP cancer <b>survivors</b> have poorer long-term HS and HRQL compared with DF <b>survivors.</b> However, there is suggestion that HS and HRQL does improve over time following DP. Implication for Cancer <b>Survivors</b> Although DP <b>survivors</b> report poorer long-term HRQL compared with DF cancer <b>survivors,</b> results suggest that time can attenuate the distress of DP on HRQL. Psycho-educational programs could help to increase patients' sense of empowerment and personal control should DP occur...|$|R

5|$|The Sole <b>Survivor</b> investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the Sole <b>Survivor</b> after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the Sole <b>Survivor</b> must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the Gauntlet, which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the Gauntlet. Gage aids the Sole <b>Survivor</b> by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive the Gauntlet. Following the death of Colter, Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and the Gauntlet to find possible replacements. The Sole <b>Survivor</b> is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, the Sole <b>Survivor</b> sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E
