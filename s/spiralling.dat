5|$|Grayson (Josh Hopkins) {{decides that}} he wants to spend a day away from Jules for some space, sending Jules <b>spiralling.</b> She starts {{tracking}} down Glenn outside of therapy sessions to talk. Eventually, Jules discovers that Gabriel is not Glenn's son, but rather a pet dog; after the resulting argument, Glenn tells Jules to find another therapist. Jules then reverts to relying on Ellie for advice.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} BBC production, but after they lost faith in the project, due to <b>spiralling</b> costs, production was halted. The scripts were taken by Euston Films and Kneale, then working for Independent Television, was commissioned to rewrite the scripts into two versions: a four-part television serial and The Quatermass Conclusion, a 100-minute film, intended for international theatrical release.|$|E
50|$|The normal Archimedean <b>spiral</b> {{occurs when}} c = 1. Other <b>spirals</b> falling into this group include the {{hyperbolic}} <b>spiral</b> (c = -1), Fermat's <b>spiral</b> (c = 2), and the lituus (c = -2). Virtually all static <b>spirals</b> appearing in nature are logarithmic <b>spirals,</b> not Archimedean ones. Many dynamic <b>spirals</b> (such as the Parker <b>spiral</b> {{of the solar}} wind, or the pattern made by a Catherine's wheel) are Archimedean.|$|R
50|$|A {{hyperbolic}} <b>spiral</b> is a transcendental plane curve {{also known}} as a reciprocal <b>spiral.</b> A hyperbolic <b>spiral</b> is the opposite of an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> and is a type of Cotes' <b>spiral.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Approximate {{logarithmic}} <b>spirals</b> {{can occur}} in nature (for example, the arms of <b>spiral</b> galaxies or phyllotaxis of leaves); golden <b>spirals</b> are one special case of these logarithmic <b>spirals.</b> A recent analysis of <b>spirals</b> observed in mouse corneal epithelial cells indicated that some can be characterized by the golden <b>spiral,</b> and some by other <b>spirals.</b> It is sometimes stated that <b>spiral</b> galaxies and nautilus shells get wider {{in the pattern of}} a golden <b>spiral,</b> and hence are related to both [...] and the Fibonacci series.In truth, <b>spiral</b> galaxies and nautilus shells (and many mollusk shells) exhibit logarithmic <b>spiral</b> growth, but at a variety of angles usually distinctly {{different from that of the}} golden <b>spiral.</b> [...] This pattern allows the organism to grow without changing shape.|$|R
5|$|The speed {{restrictions}} and track replacement works caused significant disruption on {{a majority of}} the national network for more than a year. The disruption and Railtrack's <b>spiralling</b> costs eventually caused the company to enter administration at the insistence of Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and its replacement by the not-for-dividend company Network Rail under Byers's successor Alistair Darling.|$|E
5|$|Waterspouts {{have similar}} {{characteristics}} as tornadoes, {{characterized by a}} spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water. These <b>spiralling</b> columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.|$|E
5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was <b>spiralling</b> out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, the <b>spiral</b> of Theodorus (also called {{square root}} <b>spiral,</b> Einstein <b>spiral</b> or Pythagorean <b>spiral)</b> is a <b>spiral</b> {{composed}} of contiguous right triangles. It was first constructed by Theodorus of Cyrene.|$|R

5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the <b>spiralling</b> stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{aircraft}} was to conduct flight tests at Gostomel {{for three months}} before transferring to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, near Moscow. However, the first prototype was lost when it was making its fourth flight on 10 February 1995. During the flight, {{the aircraft}} suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with the An-72 chase plane before <b>spiralling</b> into the ground, erupting into flames; the test crew of seven were killed. Although there were initial allegations of technical issues with the aircraft, it was later determined that the crash had been caused by human error.|$|E
5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, <b>spiralling</b> tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E

When Rogue attempted {{to use her}} power-and-psyche-stealing ability to steal <b>Spiral's</b> mind and powers, <b>Spiral</b> stole Rogue's instead, laughing that she had danced in many people's souls. Nocturne was fooled by <b>Spiral</b> into thinking <b>Spiral</b> had been possessed while <b>Spiral</b> remained in control.|$|R

40|$|Theories {{of stellar}} <b>spiral</b> arms in disk galaxies can be grouped into two classes {{based on the}} {{longevity}} of a <b>spiral</b> arm. Although the quasi-stationary density wave theory supposes that <b>spirals</b> are rigidly-rotating, long-lived patterns, the dynamic <b>spiral</b> theory predicts that <b>spirals</b> are differentially-rotating, transient, recurrent patterns. In order {{to distinguish between the}} two <b>spiral</b> models from observations, we performed hydrodynamic simulations with steady and dynamic <b>spiral</b> models. Hydrodynamics simulations in steady <b>spiral</b> models demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar <b>spiral</b> arms (hereafter, arm-gas offsets) depend on radius, regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the <b>spiral</b> and the model of the inter-stellar medium (ISM). In contrast, we found that the dynamic <b>spiral</b> models show no systematic radial dependence of the arm-gas offsets. The arm-gas offset radial profile method, together with the other test methods, will help us to distinguish between the two <b>spiral</b> models in observed <b>spiral</b> galaxies.

5|$|The butcher Allen of Mayfair {{was founded}} in a shop on Mount Street in 1830. It {{was one of the}} most {{well-known}} butchers in London and held a Royal warrant of appointment to supply meat to the Queen, as well as supplying several high-profile restaurants in the area. Following <b>spiralling</b> debts, it was sold to Rare Butchers of Distinction in 2006. The Mayfair premises closed in 2015, but the company retains an online presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and <b>spiralling</b> horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E
5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of thermic siphons, bogies and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding <b>spiralling</b> development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of hypercycle <b>spirals</b> in a two-dimensional cellular automaton model is analyzed. Each of these <b>spirals</b> can {{be approximated by}} an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> and the center, width, and phase of the hypercycle <b>spiral</b> change according to Brownian motion. A barrier exists between two <b>spirals</b> if the phase synchronization hypothesis is taken into account, and the occurrence rate of pair decay (the simultaneous disappearance of two <b>spirals)</b> {{can be explained by}} the random walk simulation with the barrier. Adjacent species violation is shown to be a necessary condition for creating new <b>spirals.</b> A hypercycle system can live long if the <b>spirals</b> in the system are somewhat unstable, since new <b>spirals</b> cannot emerge when existing <b>spirals</b> are too stable...|$|R

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a <b>spiralling</b> leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} <b>spiralling</b> around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Around Wschodnia street, workers {{opened fire}} on a company of {{soldiers}} and cavalry, and on Południowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Częstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite that, the situation was <b>spiralling</b> into a full blown uprising. On 23 June, all industries, workshops, shops and offices were closed, as the workers and government forces clashed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{logarithmic}} <b>spiral,</b> equiangular <b>spiral</b> or growth <b>spiral</b> is a self-similar <b>spiral</b> curve {{which often}} appears in nature.

50|$|Not {{only was}} BX442 {{revealed}} to be a genuine <b>spiral</b> galaxy, but part of a sub-class known as 'grand-design' <b>spirals.</b> Most <b>spiral</b> galaxies have subtler features and {{the arms of the}} <b>spiral</b> are not necessarily well-defined. A grand design <b>spiral</b> galaxy has very clearly well-formed and distinct arms that significantly stretch out around the galaxy center.

As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a <b>spiralling</b> freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo {{combined}} to prepare Town Planning Scheme No.26 (Hamersley Development Scheme), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, {{was presented to}} both councils for consideration. A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme {{in an effort to}} prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in <b>spiralling</b> prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep <b>spiralling</b> or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} the {{properties}} of multiarmed <b>spirals</b> show that they can form spontaneously in low excitability media.

Multiarmed <b>spirals</b> are formed due to attraction of single <b>spirals</b> if these <b>spirals</b> rotate in the same direction and their tips are less than one wavelength apart, i. e., a <b>spiral</b> broken not far from its tip can evolve into a 2 -armed <b>spiral.</b> We propose this mechanism to be responsible for the formation of multiarmed <b>spirals</b> in mounds of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} is considered {{that there are}} two types of <b>spiral</b> for each <b>spiral</b> galaxy: an underlying <b>spiral</b> of relatively old stars seen in red and IR photographs and a <b>spiral</b> outlined by H II regions and young bright blue stars. The origin of the first <b>spiral</b> is attributed to large-scale <b>spiral</b> density waves, and the second <b>spiral</b> is identified as a stochastic <b>spiral.</b> It is suggested that there is a physical or causal connection between the two <b>spirals</b> and that dust lanes play the role of intermediary.

50|$|In {{microwave}} systems, a <b>spiral</b> antenna {{is a type}} of RF antenna.
