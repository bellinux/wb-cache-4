The heat source was modeled in three space dimensions coupling thermal fluid mechanics with electromagnetism. Two approaches were considered for calculating the magnetic field: i) three-dimensional, and ii) axi-symmetric. The anode and cathode were treated as boundary conditions. The model was implemented in the open source CFD software OpenFOAM- 1. 6. x. The electromagnetic part of the solver was tested against analytic solution for an infinite electric rod.

The shielding gas was argon with thermodynamic and transport properties covering a temperature range from 200 to 30 000 K. The numerical solutions then depend greatly on the approach used for calculating the magnetic field. The axi-symmetric approach indeed neglects the radial current density component, mainly resulting in a poor estimation of the arc velocity.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of our NASA Theory Program is {{to study the}} coupling, time delays, and {{feedback}} mechanisms between the various regions of the solar-terrestrial system in a self-consistent, quantitative manner. To accomplish this goal, it will eventually be necessary to have time-dependent macroscopic models of the {{different regions of the}} solar-terrestrial system and we are continually working toward this goal. However, our immediate emphasis is on the near-earth plasma environment, including the ionosphere, the plasmasphere, and the polar wind. In this area, we have developed unique global models that allow us to study the coupling between the different regions. Another important aspect of our NASA Theory Program concerns the effect that localized structure has on the macroscopic flow in the ionosphere, plasmasphere, thermosphere, and polar wind. The localized structure can be created by structured magnetospheric inputs (i. e., structured plasma convection, particle precipitation or Birkeland current patterns) or time variations in these inputs due to storms and substorms. Also, some of the plasma flows that we predict with our macroscopic models may be unstable, and another one of our goals is to examine the stability of our predicted flows. Because time-dependent, three-dimensional numerical models of the solar-terrestrial environment generally require extensive computer resources, they are usually based on relatively simple mathematical formulations (i. e., simple MHD or hydrodynamic formulation). Therefore, another long-range goal of our NASA Theory Program is to study the conditions under which various mathematical formulations can be applied to specific solar-terrestrial regions. This may involve a detailed comparison of kinetic, semikinetic, and hydrodynamic predictions for a given polar wind scenario or it may involve the comparison of a small-scale particle-in-cell (PIC) <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plasma</b> expansion event with a similar macroscopic expansion event.

We suggest that this insulating state {{may be due to}} a charge density wave phase, as has been expected in electron-hole bilayers from the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjölander approximation based calculations of L. Liu et al [Phys. Rev. B, 53, 7923 (1996) ]. Our results are also in qualitative agreement with recent Path-Integral-Monte-Carlo <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two component <b>plasma</b> in the low temperature regime [P. Ludwig et al.

40|$|Cell {{membranes}} {{are complex}} multicomponent systems, which are highly heterogeneous in the lipid distribution and composition. To date, most molecular simulations have focussed on relatively simple lipid compositions, helping to inform {{our understanding of}} in vitro experimental studies. Here we describe on <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> complex asymmetric plasma membrane model, which contains seven different lipids species including the glycolipid GM 3 in the outer leaflet and the anionic lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphophate (PIP 2), in the inner leaflet. Plasma membrane models consisting of 1500 lipids and resembling the in vivo composition were constructed and simulations were run for 5 µs. In these simulations the most striking feature was the formation of nano-clusters of GM 3 within the outer leaflet. In <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> protein interactions within <b>a</b> <b>plasma</b> membrane model, GM 3, PIP 2, and cholesterol all formed favorable interactions with the model α-helical protein. <b>A</b> larger scale <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> model <b>plasma</b> membrane containing 6000 lipid molecules revealed correlations between curvature of the bilayer surface and clustering of lipid molecules. In particular, the concave (when viewed from the extracellular side) regions of the bilayer surface were locally enriched in GM 3. In summary, these simulations explore the nanoscale dynamics of model bilayers which mimic the in vivo lipid composition of mammalian plasma membranes, revealing emergent nanoscale membrane organization which may be coupled both to fluctuations in local membrane geometry and to interactions with proteins...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to the <b>simulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{strongly}} magnetized <b>plasma</b> considered as <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ion fluid and an electron fluid. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the model is isothermal and described by Euler equations coupled with a term representing the Lorentz force. Moreover we assume that both Euler systems are coupled through a quasi-neutrality constraint. The numerical method which is described in the present document is based on an Asymptotic-Preserving semi-discretization in time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variant <b>of</b> this two-fluid Euler-Lorentz model with <b>a</b> small perturbation <b>of</b> the quasi-neutrality constraint. Firstly, we present the two-fluid model and the motivations for introducing a small perturbation into the quasi-neutrality equation, then we describe the time semi-discretization of the perturbed model and a fully-discrete finite volume scheme based on it. Finally, we present some numerical results which have been obtained with this method...|$|R
40|$|Context. Coronal rain {{composed}} of cool plasma condensations falling from coronal heights {{is a phenomenon}} occurring in footpointheated coronal loops as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> thermal instability. High resolution coronal rain observations suggest that condensations move with less than free fall speed and can sometimes undergo longitudinal oscillations. Aims. We investigate the evolution and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>plasma</b> condensations in <b>a</b> gravitationally stratified coronal loop. Methods. We carry out 2. 5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cool <b>plasma</b> condensation in <b>a</b> gravitationally strati- fied coronal loop and analyse its evolution, kinematics {{and the evolution of}} the forces acting on the condensation. We further propose one-dimensional analytical model of the condensation dynamics. Results. Motion of plasma condensations is found to be strongly affected by the pressure of the coronal loop plasma. Maximum downward velocities are in agreement with recent coronal rain observations. High coronal magnetic field or low condensation mass can lead to damped oscillatory motion of the condensations caused by the pressure gradient force and magnetic tension force resulting from bending of the magnetic field in {{the lower part of the}} coronal loop. Period and damping scaling time of the oscillatory motion seen in the simulations are consistent with values predicted by the model. Conclusions. The combined effect of pressure gradients in the coronal loop plasma and magnetic tension force resulting from changes in magnetic field geometry can explain observed sub-ballistic motion and longitudinal oscillations of coronal rai...|$|R
