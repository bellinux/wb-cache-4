40|$|Background: Footwear {{remains a}} prime {{candidate}} for the prevention and rehabilitation of Achilles tendinopathy as it is thought to decrease tension in the tendon through elevation of the heel. However, evidence for this effect is equivocal. Purpose: This study used an acoustic transmission technique to investigate the effect of running shoes on Achilles tendon loading during barefoot and shod walking. Methods: Acoustic velocity was measured in the Achilles tendon of twelve recreationally–active males (age, 31 ± 9 years; height, 1. 78 ± 0. 06 m; weight, 81. 0 ± 16. 9 kg) during barefoot and shod walking at matched self–selected speed (3. 4 ± 0. 7 km/h). <b>Standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes incorporating a 10 – mm heel offset were used. Vertical ground reaction force and spatiotemporal parameters were determined with an instrumented treadmill. Axial acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was measured using a custom built ultrasonic device. All data were acquired {{at a rate of}} 100 Hz during 10 s of steady–state walking. Statistical comparisons between barefoot and shod conditions were made using paired t–tests and repeated measure ANOVAs. Results: Acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was highly reproducible and was typified by two maxima (P 1, P 2) and minima (M 1, M 2) during walking. Footwear resulted in a significant increase in step length, stance duration and peak vertical ground reaction force compared to barefoot walking. Peak acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon (P 1, P 2) was significantly higher with running shoes. Conclusions: Peak acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was higher with footwear, suggesting that <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes with a 10 –mm heel offset increase tensile load in the Achilles tendon. Although further research is required, these findings question the therapeutic role of <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes in Achilles tendinopathy...|$|R

40|$|Rocker profile shoes (rocker shoes) {{are one of}} the {{treatment}} options of metatarsalgia and forefoot stress fractures. The efficacy of rocker shoes in unloading the forefoot pressure has been shown in walking. In running, however, the effect of rocker shoes on forefoot pressure is unknown. Eighteen healthy female runners participated in this study. In-shoe plantar pressures were recorded during <b>running</b> with the <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes and rocker shoes. Shoe comfort was assessed after each shoe measurement. Peak pressure (PP), maximum mean pressure (MMP) and force-time integral (FTI) were determined for seven foot areas. The effects of shoes on the different outcome variables were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model. Running with the rocker shoes caused a significant reduction (p < 0. 001) in all pressure parameters in the central and lateral forefoot. FTI and MMP were also reduced by 11 % and 12 % in the medial forefoot while running with rocker shoes. Running with rocker shoes resulted in a significant increase in all pressure parameters at the heel region (p < 0. 001). Running with rocker shoes received a significant (p < 0. 01) lower comfort rate than <b>running</b> with <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes. Rocker shoes might be beneficial for runners who are recovering from metatarsalgia or stress fractures of the forefoot region, as it reduces plantar pressure in the forefoot region.

40|$|Background: The Achilles tendon is {{the most}} common site of tendon overuse injury in humans. There has been a recent {{interest}} in running with a forefoot strike pattern and in minimal shoes, yet evidence is currently limited regarding the combined influence of foot strike and footwear on Achilles tendon loading. Purpose: To investigate the influence of both foot strike and footwear on Achilles tendon loading in habitual rearfoot strike runners. Study Design: Crossover study design Methods: Synchronised kinematic and force data were collected from 22 habitual rearfoot strikers (11 male), who habitually run in non-minimal running shoes, during overground running at 3. 6 m. s- 1. Participants ran in three different footwear conditions (<b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoe; minimal running shoe; barefoot) with both a rearfoot strike (RFS) and an imposed forefoot strike (FFS) in each footwear condition. Achilles tendon loading was estimated using inverse dynamics, where the Achilles tendon moment arm was determined using a regression equation. Conditions were compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Achilles tendon impulse was greater when running with a FFS than a RFS in minimal shoes. Achilles tendon loading rates were higher when running either in minimal shoes or barefoot than in standard shoes, regardless of foot strike. Conclusions: In runners who habitually rearfoot strike in <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> shoes, running in minimal shoes or barefoot increased the rate of tendon loading, and running with a forefoot strike in minimal shoes increased the magnitude of tendon loading. Transitioning to these running conditions may increase the risk of tendinopathy. What is known about this subject? It has been shown that when running with a forefoot strike compared with a rearfoot strike, the internal ankle plantar flexor moment increases, but there are conflicting findings regarding whether this results in an increase in Achilles tendon force. Some of these findings may have been confounded by footwear. What this study adds to existing knowledge This study considered the influence of both foot strike and footwear on Achilles tendon loading during running, as well as their interactive effect. It has added to the knowledge in this area by identifying that foot strike influences the magnitude of loading, whereas footwear influences the rate, amongst habitual rearfoot strikers who are accustomed to <b>running</b> in <b>standard</b> <b>running</b> footwear...|$|R
