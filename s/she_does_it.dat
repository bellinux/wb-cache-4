5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E

Naturally, when you adapt a story, your vision also comes in it. But I have remained honest to its essence". He included Keemat Lal (who plays {{a police officer in}} all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits.

500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan.

500|$|Micevski, the album's producer, is {{also one}} of the people who had had a long-time {{professional}} relationship with the singer and who had contributed for the arrangement of the songs included on Makedonsko Devojče (2008); the start of the professional ties with Gočeva began when he joined her live band which performed during her concerts in the past. He said that due to the mutual understanding between the two of them, the process of setting a music direction with the album was without any difficulties, but moved slowly because of their intention to create high quality material. During an interview with the journal Republika, Micevski said that his work on Makedonsko Devojče 2 represented both responsibility and pressure to a certain extent. He elaborated that the requirement with the album was to create something that would resemble the first project, but will not be identical to it and would maintain the same level of quality or even surpass it. He added: [...] "To me, that represented a big challenge and maybe a life chance to express myself differently, uniquely, with a different mark, with all my knowledge and spirit. It was an additional pleasure working with my close friend and collaborator Dejan Momirovski... In the end we all managed to do what we had had in mind." [...] Micevski also revealed that the songs included on the album were originally custom-made for Gočeva, adapted to her vocal capabilities and musical maturity, adding that she is a [...] "world performer" [...] and a singer who can sing in different styles: [...] "She can simply find her way anywhere and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> on a very high level. The mark she left on the material of 'Makedonsko Devojče 1 and 2' is a really unique, original style of performance which leaves traces in the history of Macedonian vocal-instrumental music." ...|$|E
