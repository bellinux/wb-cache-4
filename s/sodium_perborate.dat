5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E

50|$|The {{peroxide}} anion is {{a stronger}} nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. <b>Sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> and sodium percarbonate are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below). The peroxide anion forms an adduct with urea, hydrogen peroxide-urea.|$|E
50|$|Bocasan was {{packaged}} in a 1.7 gram envelope, and contained 69.72% <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> monohydrate and 29.68% sodium hydrogen tartrate anhydous. To use, the contents were dissolved in 30 cubic centimetres of warm water.

50|$|Louis Jacques Thénard first {{produced}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} in 1818 by reacting barium peroxide with nitric acid. Hydrogen peroxide {{was first used}} for bleaching in 1882, but did not become commercially important until after 1930. <b>Sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> as a laundry bleach {{had been used in}} Europe since the early twentieth century, but did not become popular in North America until the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Bleach {{activation}} is {{also known}} as perhydrolysis. Persalts are inorganic salts that are used as hydrogen peroxide carriers (examples include sodium percarbonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate).</b> Persalts and bleach activators are included together in powder laundry detergents that contain bleach. In the wash, both compounds dissolve in the water. When dissolved in water, the persalt releases hydrogen peroxide (e.g. from sodium percarbonate): 2Na2CO3∙3H2O2 → 2Na2CO3 + 3H2O2 ...|$|E
50|$|Several common {{detergent}} {{ingredients are}} surfactants, builders, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants {{can be classified}} into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) {{are the most important}} substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> and sodium percarbonate. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents.|$|E
50|$|Cystamine (2,2--Dithiobisethanamine) is {{an organic}} {{disulfide}} which is formed when Cystine is heated {{as a result}} of decarboxylation. It is often used as sulfhydryl reagent, enzyme inhibitor and radiation-protective agent. Thiols can be synthesized to disulfides like cystamine through chemical oxidation with various oxidizing agents (molecular oxygen, metal ion, metal oxide, DMSO, nitric oxide, halogen and <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate),</b> through electrochemical oxidation and through borohydride exchange resin (BER)-transition metal salts systems (like BER-CuSo4).|$|E
5000|$|Invented in 1907, Persil {{is notable}} {{because it was}} the first commercially {{available}} [...] "self-activated" [...] laundry detergent. (A self activated detergent is one which contains bleach combined with the soap components.) The creation of Persil was a significant chemical breakthrough. The name, [...] "Persil", is derived from two of its original ingredients, <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> and silicate. However, the original name was deemed unsuitable as an international brand, as it is hard to pronounce in some languages; coincidentally, it is the French word for the herb, parsley.|$|E
50|$|Bleaching is {{a process}} for {{whitening}} fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes {{it was simply a}} matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach, including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate.</b> While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite.|$|E
5000|$|Persil is a {{brand of}} laundry {{detergent}} made by Henkel; but which is now also licensed for manufacture, distribution, and marketing in several countries by Unilever. Henkel and Unilever both manufacture their own formulations. Introduced in 1907, Persil is notable {{because it was the}} first commercially available [...] "self-activated" [...] laundry detergent. The name, Persil, is derived from two of its original ingredients, <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> and sodium silicate. It is Unilever's premium brand in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Persil is sold in many forms, with several [...] "environment friendly" [...] products.|$|E
50|$|After chlorine-based bleaches, the {{peroxide}} bleaches {{are most}} commonly encountered. Peroxides are compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond, O-O. This {{is a fairly}} weak bond so reactions of peroxides often involve breaking this bond, giving very reactive oxygen species. Most peroxide bleaches are adducts of hydrogen peroxide. They contain hydrogen peroxide, HOOH in combination with another material like sodium carbonate or urea. An exception is <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate,</b> which has a cyclic structure containing two O-O single bonds. All peroxide-based bleaches release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. Peroxide bleaches are often used with catalysts and activators, e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamine or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate.|$|E
5000|$|It {{serves as}} a source of active oxygen in many detergents, laundry detergents, {{cleaning}} products, and laundry bleaches. It is also present in some tooth bleaching formulas. It is used as a bleaching agent for internal bleaching of a non vital root treated tooth. The <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> is placed inside the tooth and left in place {{for an extended period of}} time to allow it to diffuse into the tooth and bleach stains from the inside out. It has antiseptic properties and can act as a disinfectant. It is also used as a [...] "disappearing" [...] preservative in some brands of eye drops.|$|E
5000|$|The {{oxidation}} of pyridine can {{be achieved}} {{with a number of}} peracids including peracetic acid and perbenzoic acid in a reaction that affords the protonated derivative. Subsequent treatment with heating under low pressure removes acids as gases to liberates the neutral oxide. [...] More recent reported approaches include a modified Dakin reaction using a urea-hydrogen peroxide complex, and oxidation by <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> or, using methylrhenium trioxide (...) as catalyst, with sodium percarbonate. [...] Pyridine N-oxide is five orders of magnitude less basic than pyridine, but it is isolable as a hydrochloride salt, C5H5NOHCl, via a synthesis reported in Organic Syntheses: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{main targets}} of bleaches are oxidisible organic stains; {{which are usually}} of {{vegetable}} origin (e.g. chlorophyll, anthocyanin dyes, tannins, humic acids, andcarotenoid pigments). Despite the name, modern beaching agents do not include household bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Laundry bleaches are typically stable adducts of hydrogen peroxide, such as <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate</b> and sodium percarbonate, these are inactive as solids but will react with water to release hydrogen peroxide which performs the bleaching action. [...] "Bleach activators" [...] such as tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) may also be used, these react with hydrogen peroxide to produce peracetic acid, which is an even more effective bleach.|$|E
5000|$|Bleach is a {{chemical}} that whitens clothing.The bleaching {{process has been}} known for millennia, but the chemicals currently used for bleaching resulted from the work of several 18th century scientists. Chlorine is the basis for the most common bleaches: for example, the solution of sodium hypochlorite, which is so ubiquitous that most simply call it [...] "bleach", and calcium hypochlorite, the active compound in [...] "bleaching powder". Oxidizing bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine are usually based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate.</b> While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, some are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite and sodium borohydride.|$|E
5000|$|TAED is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents that use [...] "active oxygen" [...] bleaching agents. Active oxygen bleaching agents include <b>sodium</b> <b>perborate,</b> sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide. These compounds release hydrogen peroxide during the wash cycle. Hydrogen peroxide is however an inefficient bleach below 60 C. TAED and hydrogen peroxide react to form peroxyacetic acid, a more efficient bleach, allowing lower temperature wash cycles, around 40 C. TAED was first used in a commercial laundry detergent in 1978 (Skip by Unilever). Currently, TAED is the main bleach activator used in European laundry detergents and has an estimated annual consumption of 75 kt.|$|E
