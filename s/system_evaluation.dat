25|$|Units {{operating}} these specially equipped aircraft {{were designated}} Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadrons (DSES). The 4713th Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron was stationed for {{training in the}} Northeast. The 4713th also deployed frequently to USAFE in West Germany for training of NATO forces. The other was the 4677th Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron, which concentrated on Fighter Interceptor Squadron training for units in the Western United States. In 1974, the 4713th DSES was inactivated and its EB-57s were divided between two Air National Guard units and the 4677th DSES was redesignated as the 17th Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron. This unit was inactivated in July 1979 and {{was the last to}} fly B-57s in the active duty USAF. It shared the Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> mission with the Kansas and Vermont Air National Guard. Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> operations were also carried out by the 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron, Yokota AB, Japan; later the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron and moved to Kadena AB, Okinawa. EB-57s were also deployed to Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, frequently.|$|R
50|$|The 4758th Defense <b>Systems</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Squadron started life at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas in 1962.

These evaluations include operational effectiveness and suitability, command and control, performance of aircraft hardware and software systems, employment tactics, and accuracy and reliability of associated precision weapons. These weapons include air-launched cruise missiles, standoff missiles, and gravity bombs. Results and conclusions support acquisition decisions and development of war plans. The unit also performs operational testing on new systems and tactics development for the B-52.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Smith was {{reassigned to}} be Commander, Third Coast Guard District based at New York City in August 1945 with {{additional}} duties as Commander, Eastern Area being assigned after May 1946. As a collateral duty he was also Captain of the Port of New York during this assignment and also oversaw all Captain of the Port activities within the Third District. From 1946 to 1949 Smith also served {{on the staff of}} the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University. Beginning in 1949 he served as a project leader for the Weapons <b>System</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Group at the Department of Defense and worked in that capacity until his retirement on 30 June 1950.|$|E
25|$|External {{security}} {{involves a}} request from outside the computer, such as a login at a connected console {{or some kind of}} network connection. External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the Trusted Computer <b>System</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Criteria (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information.|$|E
