5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a <b>standard</b> <b>cost</b> plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

25|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>cost</b> {{accounting}} {{can hurt}} managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's performance evaluation. Increasing inventory requires increased production, {{which means that}} processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.|$|E

Researchers argue that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> does not easily {{fit in with}} the modern idea of continuous improvement. The benefits and limitations of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> and other modern alternative approaches in Eastern Cape manufacturing organisations are examined. Furthermore the factors affecting the accuracy of standards are investigated. Lastly, it is concluded that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is used in Eastern Cape manufacturing organisations and those organisations using <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> have considered the benefits and limitations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>costing</b> {{systems are}} no longer {{adequate}} or effective costing systems for U. S. companies employing statistical process control, total quality control, and just-in-time inventory systems. The four purposes for which <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems are used have been identified by Charles T. Horngren as follows: 1. Financial statement preparation. 2. Cost management 3. Price-making and price policy 4. Budgetary planning and control The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the inadequacies of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems {{for use in the}} above purposes. Although several alternatives to <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems are proposed, it {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper to deliniate methods for implementing these alternatives. Supporting research was performed in the Northern Illinois University library. References cited include periodicals, textbooks, and a study by the Institute of Management Accountants. Past articles have questioned the effectiveness of traditional <b>standard</b> <b>costing,</b> however, no works were found which challenged the use of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems for the four purposes named earlier nor which proposed alternatives to <b>standard</b> <b>costs.</b> The proposal that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> systems {{are no longer}} sufficient to support today's manufacturing environment is a fairly new idea. However, research has led to the conclusion that the era of <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> is coming to an end. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{literature}} on <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing environment. It examines the changes in the manufacturing environment in Japan that has lowered the significance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese firms and investigates the current level of its applicability in Japanese firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper systematically categorizes the relevant literature and reviews it methodologically. Findings – The paper finds that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still being used by a large number of firms both in developing and developed countries. Overall, the research suggests that the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> has not declined to such a low level despite the technological changes. In Japan <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still used for different purposes despite its apparent weaknesses. Research limitations/implications – This is not an empirical investigation of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing firms. Originality/value – The paper will be useful to researchers, cost accountants and others concerned with product costing to understand the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing.</b> It is also expected that the current research will help reveal whether or not one should continue teaching <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the classroom...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this case study is to understand and explain fundamental difficulties of employing <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the case company operating globally in manufacturing industry. It is crucial to understand the problematic areas since <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system is used for product costing, decision-making and operational control. The secondary objective is to analyse findings and develop solution suggestions for the identified challenging areas. The research used mainly foreign literature and articles from scientific publications to build a sound theoretical framework. The empirical {{part of the study}} used the case company's internal material, interviews, observations, informal discussions and information systems. The data was gathered in 2013 - 2014. The results of this thesis suggest that operational factors, <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system and <b>standards</b> maintenance are the areas where most of the <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> difficulties stem from. Based on the case study, the main problems within the areas are complex operating conditions, lack of tools to control operations, standardized SCS, <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> deviations from actuals, non-optimal system use, lack of variance analysis on product group level, partial negligence of <b>standards</b> thorough <b>cost</b> audit, and <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> inadequateness with continuous improvement. Based on the analysed findings of the case study, <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> improvement suggestions are presented to provide assistance in the difficult areas. The suggestions are concentrated to <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system and <b>standards</b> maintenance. In addition, a product cost simulator is introduced to support <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> system in the areas where it's mostly struggling. The product costing simulator is assessed to be valuable for evaluating new and existing product level <b>costs,</b> improving <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> design, seeking cost reductions, steering sales, and improving operational control...|$|R
40|$|In {{their study}} of the shipbuilding, {{engineering}} and metals industries of the West of Scotland, c. 1900 - 1960, Fleming et al. (2000 : p. 196) concluded that 'standard costing and budgetary control hardly made any impact {{at all in the}} engineering-related industries of the West of Scotland and that this … was correlated with the non-adoption of Scientific Management'. Fleming et al. encouraged further research to determine if this pattern of adoption was replicated elsewhere during the period. In this manner, the current research focuses on the post-Second World War development of <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Sunderland, a shipbuilding town of international importance on the north-east coast of England. Although the availability of company archives is somewhat limited, we nevertheless found evidence that at least one leading shipbuilding firm undertook major modernisation and reorganisation programmes, comprising the adoption of the new technology of welding, during the study period. Allied with these radical changes, the firm employed scientific management methods and utilised <b>standard</b> <b>costs,</b> but it did not employ full systems of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> and variance analysis. These costing developments were built into shipbuilders' traditional information systems based on the use of cost and output curves.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the relationship between the}} understanding and practice of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in both the U. S. and the U.

Based on a detailed review of the post-war literature, the authors conclude that {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> and related scientific management practices (time study, variance analysis, etc.) reached a level in practice that many accounting historians have felt should have been achieved at an earlier point in time. Another principal finding is that <b>standard</b> <b>costing,</b> initially promulgated in the late 1910 s, continued to develop in both the U. S. and the U.
