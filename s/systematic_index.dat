40|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20 th century, Julius Otto Kaiser (1868 â 1927), a special {{librarian}} and indexer of technical literature, developed a method of knowledge organization (KO) known as <b>systematic</b> <b>indexing.</b> Certain elements of the method - its stipulation that all indexing terms be divided into fundamental categories "concretes", "countries", and "processes", which are then to be synthesized into indexing "statements" formulated according to strict rules of citation order - have long been recognized as precursors to key principles of the theory of faceted classification. However, other, less well-known elements of the method may prove no less interesting to practitioners of KO. In particular, two aspects of <b>systematic</b> <b>indexing</b> seem to prefigure current trends in KO: (1) a perspectivist outlook that rejects universal classifications in favor of information organization systems customized to reflect local needs and (2) the incorporation of index terms extracted from source documents into a polyhierarchical taxonomical structure. Kaiserâ s perspectivism anticipates postmodern theories of KO, while his principled use of polyhierarchy to organize terms derived from the language of source documents provides a potentially fruitful model that can inform current discussions about harvesting natural-language terms, such as tags, and incorporating them into a flexibly structured controlled vocabulary...|$|R

30|$|To analyze dynamic {{processes}} of mitochondrial movement, we introduced a transient velocity analysis method into the MPA algorithm. The transient velocity analysis {{was achieved by}} computing the sustained component and the transient component of the velocity {{within a short time}} window (see MATERIALS AND METHODS for more details). Here, “sustained speed” was considered equivalent to the short-term average speed. As a result, a 2 -D parameter space, in which motion states were visualized and identified, was established by two components of velocity to define the motion states (see Figs.  2 K and 3 D). For instance, the state of ST was mapped to the original point of the space. On the other hand, points near the x-axis (with a low sustained speed) were defined as the DP state. This transient model of movement made it possible to quantify and analyze mitochondrial movement using <b>systematic</b> <b>indices,</b> including velocity of movement, percentage of “active” mitochondria and proportion of mitochondria in each state.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{beginning}} of 1990 s, Finland has experienced rapid growth rates in population fractions of non-native residents, with almost half of all immigrants eventually settling in Helsinki metropolitan area. This thesis studies immigrant settlement patterns in the capital region, with the purpose of reliably quantifying and documenting dynamics of ethnic residential segregation. Formation of 'ethnic enclaves' is a widely-debated issue which might have ambiguous impact on immigrants’ economic and social outcomes. Robust inference on segregation dynamics is a prerequisite for furthering understanding of the issue. However, qualitative inference on segregation dynamics is often hindered by the fact that different spatial unit sizes and/or immigrant population fractions generate random segregation of varying magnitudes. This thesis overcomes the problem by employing index of systematic segregation which is expressed as a fraction of maximum excess dissimilarity (net of random) that could possibly occur. Index of dissimilarity (Duncan index) is chosen as a baseline measure for calculating <b>systematic</b> <b>index,</b> ensuring comparability of my research to the existing body of knowledge on the phenomenon. While index of dissimilarity reports only marginal growth in segregation, systematic measure reports almost two-fold increase in ethnic residential segregation. Employing <b>systematic</b> <b>index</b> allows reliable comparison of segregation across various immigrant groups and localities. Thus, I find that immigrants from Balkan and African countries are more segregated than other foreign-born individuals. Comparison of systematic indices across largest Finnish cities reveals that Turku has been substantially more segregated than its counterparts starting from year 1995. Eventually, I isolate the measure of segregation along ethnic lines from sorting along other dimensions, such as income. I find no evidence that increase in residential segregation is driven by widening income gap between native and immigrant population. Finally, all the findings are presented compactly in two web applications, allowing flexible controls over the choice of locality of interest, immigrant group, statistics and map-types...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although general {{categories}} {{are an important}} feature of many KOSs, they are difficult to define. If we are to understand the factors that render category definition difficult, we should consider how designers of past KOSs have defined the categories in their systems. This paper presents, as a case study, {{an analysis of the}} formulation of categories in J. Kaiser’s theory of <b>systematic</b> <b>indexing,</b> which was designed for the indexing of commercial literature. Kaiser’s theory posited three categories: concretes, countries, and processes. Close examination of his writings reveals semantic tensions in the definition of each category. Concretes were defined both in general terms as things-in-the-world and in domain-specific terms as commodities; Countries were defined as political units but included geographical regions that were not politically unified; and Processes were defined alternately as conditions of concretes or actions associated with them. Tensions also appear in the categorial scheme comprising these categories, of which there were dyadic (Concrete-Process) and triadic (Concrete-Country-Process), the former of which was grounded on a theoretical model and the latter, on pragmatic, domain-specific considerations. Kaiser’s attempts to harmonize these models by deriving countries from concretes faltered because of his narrow construal of concretes. The tensions in Kaiser’s definition of categories are due to semantic overdetermination, while those associated with his categorial scheme are ascribable to the general tension between theory and practice...|$|R
