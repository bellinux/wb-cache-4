The Authors studied the effectiveness of daylight in low-birth-weight newborns. The results obtained show that the reduction of bilirubin induced by phototherapy is related with gestational age and intra-uterine growth. The very low-birth-weight infants, at higher risk of kernicterus, as they are more responsives to phototherapy, as well they are, probably, more <b>susceptibles</b> <b>to</b> side-effects.

40|$|Unfortunately, Dr. Goihman-Yahr {{took our}} last {{publication}} in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology [1] as disrespectful {{to his work}} on the role of PMN leukocytes in paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) because his previous articles on the subject were not cited. No offense was intended by not mentioning his important contribution about the interaction between polymorphonuclear phagocytes and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The main objec-tive of our paper was to study the immunoprotective and immunomodulatory role of PMN cells in pulmonary PCM de-veloped by genetically resistant and <b>susceptible</b> mice <b>to</b> P. brasiliensis infection [2, 3]. We verified that PMN cells are more important <b>to</b> <b>susceptible</b> than <b>to</b> resistant mice since in vivo PMN depletion at an early phase of the infection induced increased mortality, more severe lesions, higher fungal loads, and a huge fungal dissemination <b>to</b> organs in <b>susceptible</b> bu...|$|R

30|$|Two SIRS {{alcoholism}} {{models with}} relapse on networks with fixed and adaptive weight are introduced. The spread of alcoholism threshold R_ 0 is calculated {{by the next}} generation matrix method. For the model with fixed weight, we prove that when R_ 0 < 1, the alcohol free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, then the drinking crowd gradually disappear. When R_ 0 > 1, the alcoholism equilibrium is global attractivity, then the density of alcoholics will remain in a stable value. For the model with adaptive weight, we only make some numerical simulations. We also give two effective strategies. Our {{results show that the}} treatment of recuperator for stopping relapsing and preventing the <b>susceptible</b> people <b>to</b> drink are two effective measures to eliminate alcoholism problem, and preventing the <b>susceptible</b> people <b>to</b> drink is more effective when the proportion of recuperator to accept treatment is equal to the proportion of <b>susceptible</b> people <b>to</b> refuse drinking alcohol.|$|R

40|$|To {{access the}} {{relative}} potency of pesticides to control adult mosquitoes, 19 pesticides with various modes of action were evaluated against Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say. On {{the basis of}} 24 -h LD 50 values after topical application, the only pesticide that had higher activity than permethrin was fipronil, with LD 50 values lower than permethrin for 107 -, 4, 849 -, and 2 -fold against Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, and An. quadrimaculatus Say, respectively. Abamectin, imidacloprid, spinosad, diazinon, and carbaryl showed slightly lower activity than permethrin (3 ̆c 20 -fold). However, bifenazate showed very low activity against the three mosquito species tested, with LD 50 values higher than permthrin for 3 ̆e 1000 -fold. On the basis of 24 -h LD 50 values, Cx. quinquefasciatus was the least <b>susceptible</b> species <b>to</b> nine pesticides tested (DNOC, azocyclotin, chlorfenapyr, carbaryl, spinosad, imidaclorid, diazinon, abamectin, and permethrin), whereas Ae. aegypti was the least <b>susceptible</b> species <b>to</b> six pesticides tested (dicofol, amitraz, propargite, hydramethylnon, cyhexatin, and diafenthiuron), and An. quadrimaculatus was the least <b>susceptible</b> species <b>to</b> four pesticides tested (bifenazate, pyridaben, indoxacarb, and fipronil). Our results revealed that different species of mosquitoes had different susceptibility to pesticides, showing the need to select the most efficacious compounds for the least <b>susceptible</b> mosquito species <b>to</b> achieve successful mosquito control...|$|R
