50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, St Mary's Bay was {{a popular}} {{destination}} for vacationers. 'The Bay' {{had a number of}} holiday camps, among them Maddieson's Golden Sands at Dunstall Lane, the <b>School</b> <b>Journey</b> Centre at Jefferstone Lane, and the Rugby Club camp on the opposite (sea) side of the A259 main road between Jefferstone Lane and Taylor's Lane.

40|$|We {{compared}} independent mobility (freedom to {{move around}} the neighbourhood – or similar – without adult accompaniment) among English and Australian schoolchildren. Parents reported mobility licences granted to their children (e. g. allowing them to cross main roads alone) and accompaniment on local trips. Children reported travel mode to school. We examined associations between mobility licences and independent <b>school</b> <b>journeys,</b> and accompaniment on local trips. Among 10 – 12 -year-olds, English children had more licences than Australian children. Mobility licences were directly associated with independent <b>school</b> <b>journeys</b> among primary but not among secondary schoolchildren who travelled further; and inversely associated with parental accompaniment to other destinations. Influences on parental restrictions should be examined to promote children’s independent mobilit...|$|R
40|$|Safe Routes to Schools is a {{practical}} initiative to reduce traffic danger on <b>school</b> <b>journeys</b> by encouraging more walking and cycling and reducing car use. The initiative involves children, teachers, traffic engineers, road safety professionals and public health workers. Several {{countries around the world}} are now implementing safe routes to schools and establishing strong links between transport, education and health policies. Sustrans is a UK based civil engineering charity which builds safe cycling and walking routes. Over the last 5 years, it has been pioneering safe routes to schools projects in the UK in collaboration with schools and local authorities. This paper gives a brief overview of the policy background in the UK and describes some of the key reasons why <b>school</b> <b>journeys</b> are a vital place to start to encourage cycling, especially in countries where cycling levels are low. One prerequisite for a successful project is the close involvement of young people. Three students from the UK and Denmark will describe how they came to become involved in the project, their own <b>school</b> <b>journeys,</b> their <b>school</b> exchange visit and subsequent presentations to traffic planners and local politicians which was the catalyst for changes at their schools. They will also describe latest best practice in the UK and Denmark and give their views on th...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} children's independent mobility (CIM) among primary school students during their home. <b>school</b> <b>journeys</b> in Hong Kong. It represents an empirical study {{to assess the}} impact of individual, family and environmental determinants in influencing the level of CIM. Using territory-wide travel diary data from the Travel Characteristic Survey 2002 (TCS 02), logistic regression modeling is used to understand the key factors associated with an increased level of CIM among children in the city. The present study found that approximately one-third of <b>school</b> <b>journeys</b> were conducted by children on their own. CIM was highly associated with the distance to school, the age group of children, median household income, family structure, working status of mothers, employment of domestic helper, neighborhood settlement types and density of school places. These findings can provide input to strategies for promoting an increased level of CIM to improve children's well-being. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|When {{the buses}} {{were not in}} use for school journeys, {{and in the last}} year of the {{companies}} operations when it no longer operated school services, some were used on the handful of normal routes the company ran in various rural and estate locations that would not be commercially viable for the main operator, Southern Vectis to run. This initially started with Wightbus taking on a much larger share of evening and weekend services from October 2004 as tendering these services to Southern Vectis would be much more expensive and would have to result in service cuts. Eventually however, all these services were timetabled separately from any of Southern Vectis' services. Some of these (notably the 16, which had a dedicated vehicle running in a modified Wightbus livery) are operated during <b>school</b> <b>journey</b> periods and so additional buses were required beyond those purely for school purposes.|$|E
