I was establishing the subjective <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life with Diener&# 39;s Combined <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> Life Scale. For establishing the mothers&# 39; relationship <b>with</b> <b>their</b> adolescents I used The Questionnaire about the Relationship with Adolescent.

Mothers who express higher <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> life assess <b>their</b> relationship <b>with</b> adolescent more positively and are more satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> parental role. The frequency and intensity of positive affects are positively connected with openness in communication with adolescent and negatively with fear of loosing control over adolescent.

25|$|In {{more recent}} {{nationwide}} surveys, several {{researchers found that}} about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair. A survey conducted in 1990 found 2.2% of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year. In general, national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15-25% of married Americans reported having extramarital affairs. Treas and Giesen {{found that people who}} had stronger sexual interests, more permissive sexual values, lower subjective <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> partner, weaker network ties to their partner, and greater sexual opportunities {{were more likely to be}} unfaithful. Studies suggest around 30–40% of unmarried relationships and 18–20% of marriages see at least one incident of sexual infidelity.|$|E
25|$|The usual breast {{augmentation}} {{patient is}} a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body (self image), {{and a history of}} having endured criticism (teasing) about the aesthetics of her person. The studies Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients (2003) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone psychotherapy, suffered low self-esteem, presented frequent occurrences of psychological depression, had attempted suicide, and suffered body dysmorphiaa type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and {{the quality of life of}} the women, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory sexual functioning.

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} whether {{the belief in}} good luck of stock traders influences <b>their</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> and <b>their</b> loyalty to a stock trading service.

40|$|Many older Latinos use spirituality to {{navigate}} the challenges associated with hospitalization. Although spiritual assessments are typically recommended in such settings, little, if any, research has sought to identify factors that predict <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the process of addressing clients’ spiritual needs. Using a national sample of recently hospitalized older Latinos (N = 227), this secondary analysis identified predictors of older Latinos’ <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> how well <b>their</b> spiritual needs were addressed during their hospitalization. Among the eight predictors examined, room quality, nursing staff, and physicians were positively associated <b>with</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> while the discharge process was negatively associated <b>with</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> By understanding the factors that predict satisfaction, practitioners are better positioned to provide culturally relevant and effective services to older Latinos...|$|R

2500|$|Job {{characteristics}} are {{attributes of the}} job that people traditionally find important, including {{the extent to which}} they identify with the tasks they are doing (identity), {{the extent to which they}} are assigned diverse tasks (variety), extent to which they feel their work affects others (significance), extent to which they receive productive feedback from their job (feedback), and the extent to which they feel they are allowed to make their own decisions at their job (autonomy). [...] These characteristics play an important role in influencing the relationship between an individual's core self-evaluations and their <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> job. [...] Studies have found that perceived job characteristics partially mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] In other words, a person who appraises themselves positively (i.e., has high core self-evaluations) and has acquired a job which encompasses the aforementioned characteristics of identity, variety, significance, feedback, and autonomy, will be more likely to be satisfied with the job.|$|E
6000|$|April 16th.--. [...] . Since I last wrote, {{there has}} been an {{addition}} to our community of four gentlemen in sables, who promise to be among our most useful and respectable members. They arrived yesterday about noon. Mr. Ripley had proposed to them to join us, no longer ago than that very morning. I had some conversation with them in the afternoon, and was glad to hear them express much <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> new abode and all the arrangements. They {{do not appear to be}} very communicative, however, --or perhaps it may be merely an external reserve, like my own, to shield their delicacy. Several of their prominent characteristics, as well as their black attire, lead me to believe that they are members of the clerical profession; but I have not yet ascertained from their own lips what has been the nature of their past lives. I trust to have much pleasure in their society, and, sooner or later, that we shall all of us derive great strength from our intercourse with them. I cannot too highly applaud the readiness with which these four gentlemen in black have thrown aside all the fopperies and flummeries which have their origin in a false state of society. When I last saw them, they looked as heroically regardless of the stains and soils incident to our profession as I did when I emerged from the gold-mine. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|As the {{manufactures}} of England, {{particularly those}} of wool (cotton wool included), and of silk, are the greatest, and amount to the greatest value of any single manufacture in Europe,[39] so they not only employ more people, but those people gain the most money, that is to say, have the best wages for their work of any people in the world; and yet, which is peculiar to England, the English manufactures are, allowing for their goodness, the cheapest at market of any in the world, too. Even France itself, after all the pains they are at to get our wool, and all the expense they have been at to imitate our manufactures, by getting over our workmen, and giving them even greater wages than they had here, have yet made so little proficiency in it, and are so far from outselling us in foreign markets, that they still, {{in spite of the}} strictest prohibitions, send hither, and to Holland and Germany, for English broad-cloths, druggets, duroys, flannels, serges, and several other sorts of our goods, to supply their own. Nor can they clothe themselves to their <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> own goods; but if any French gentleman of quality comes over hither from France, he is sure to bring no more coats with him than backs, but immediately to make him new clothes as soon as he arrives, and to carry as many new suits home with him at his return, as he can get leave to bring ashore when he comes there--a demonstration that our manufacture exceeds theirs, after all their boasts of it, both in goodness and in cheapness, even by their own confession. But I am not now to enter upon the particular manufactures, but the general trade in the manufacture; this particular being a trade of such a magnitude, it is to be observed for our purpose, that the greatness of it consists of two parts:-- ...|$|E
