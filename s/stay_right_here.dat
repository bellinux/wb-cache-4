5000|$|One Pope, in the Dark Ages, {{decreed that}} all Jews {{had to leave}} Rome. The Jews {{did not want to}} leave, and so the Pope {{challenged}} them to a disputation to prove that they could remain. No one, however, wanted the responsibility... until the synagogue sexton, Moishe, volunteered.As there was nobody else who wanted to go, Moishe was given the task. But because he knew only Hebrew, a silent debate was agreed.The day of the debate came, and they went to St. Peter's Square to sort out the decision. First the Pope waved his hand around his head. Moishe pointed firmly at the ground.The Pope, in some surprise, held up three fingers. In response, Moishe gave him the middle finger.The crowd started to complain, but the Pope thoughtfully waved them to be quiet. He took out a bottle of wine and a wafer, holding them up. Moishe took out an apple, and held it up.The Pope, to the people’s surprise, said, [...] "I concede. This man is too good. The Jews can stay." [...] Later, the Pope was asked what the debate had meant. He explained, [...] "First, I showed him the Heavens, to show that God is everywhere. He pointed at the ground to signify that God is <b>right</b> <b>here</b> with us. I showed him three fingers, for the Trinity. He reminded me that there is One God common to both our religions. I showed him wine and a wafer, for God's forgiveness. With an apple, he showed me original sin. The man was a master of silent debate."In the Jewish corner, Moishe had the same question put to him, and answered, [...] "It was all nonsense, really. First, he told me that this whole town would be free of Jews. I told him, Go to Hell! We’re <b>staying</b> <b>right</b> <b>here!</b> Then, he told me we had three days to get out. I told him just what I thought of that proposal." [...] An older woman asked, [...] "But what about the part at the end?" [...] "That?" [...] said Moishe with a shrug, [...] "Then we had lunch!" ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first draft}} was {{completed}} in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon's unfurnished Community office. The duo had broken the story that day, sold the pilot, and then sat down to write. Roiland, while acknowledging a tendency for procrastination, encouraged Harmon to stay and write the entire first draft. [...] "We {{were sitting on the}} floor, cross-legged with laptops and I was about {{to get up and go}} home and he said, 'Wait, if you go home, it might take us three months to write this thing. <b>Stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>right</b> now and we can write it in six hours.' He just had a premonition about that," [...] recalled Harmon. Adult Swim was initially unsure of Roiland doing both voices, partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty. Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike Lazzo. Adult Swim placed a tamer TV-14 rating on the program, which initially was met with reluctance from the show's staff. The network's reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime-time, competing with major programs.|$|R
