40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the economic impact of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in the textiles and apparel industry in Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> answers three consecutive questions. First, has AGOA been successful in reinforcing Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> reform efforts? Second, has AGOA been successful in facilitating the integration of Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> economy into the global economy? Finally, has AGOA been successful in promoting employment and poverty reduction in Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa?</b> Using the textiles and apparel industry of the two countries as a case study, it was realised that AGOA has achieved much success in contributing to the reformation and integration of the economy of Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> into the global economy. However, it was found that AGOA’s success in promoting poverty reduction through economic activities such as trade, investment and employment in the two countries has been mixed. While AGOA has contributed positively to the promotion of economic activities in the textiles and apparel industry in Kenya, the economic problems facing the textiles and apparel industry in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> has been exacerbated by AGOA. This study is important because it draws attention to the economic achievements of AGOA in the textiles and apparel industry in Kenya <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa...</b>|$|R
