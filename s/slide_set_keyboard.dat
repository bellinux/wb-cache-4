40|$|The {{family of}} Filippov systems {{constituted}} by planar discontinuous piecewise linear systems with two half-plane linearity zones is considered. Under generic conditions that amount to the boundedness of the <b>sliding</b> <b>set,</b> some changes of variables and parameters {{are used to}} obtain a Li´enard-like canonical form with seven parameters. This canonical form is topologically equivalent to the original system if one restricts one’s attention to orbits with no points in the <b>sliding</b> <b>set.</b> Under the assumption of focus-focus dynamics, a reduced canonical form with only five parameters is obtained. For the case without equilibria in both open half-planes we describe the qualitatively different phase portraits that can occur in the parameter space and the bifurcations connecting them. In particular, we show the possible existence of two limit cycles surrounding the <b>sliding</b> <b>set.</b> Such limit cycles bifurcate at certain parameter curves, organized around different codimension-two Hopf bifurcation points. The proposed canonical form will be a useful tool in the systematic study of planar discontinuous piecewise linear systems, in which this paper is a first step...|$|R

40|$|A {{main goal}} of a {{laboratory}} involved in cervical cancer screening {{is to keep the}} rate of false negative interpretations at the lowest possible level. 5, 11 A good level of diagnostic reproducibility is fundamental to obtaining good performance but is not a sufficient condition to ensure high accuracy. Circulating a <b>slide</b> <b>set</b> is part of many quality improvement programs in cytopathology and is a method of evaluating interobserver/interlaboratory reproducibility. 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 Some general rules have to be followed when preparing such a <b>slide</b> <b>set</b> (1) the choice of representative cases in all diagnostic categories, (2) the features of a predefined report for each test result, and (3) the pertinent clinical information for each case, available to the slide reader. The importance of such a procedure to estimating concordance has been previously reported. 1 - 4, 10 More recently, continuous quality improvement based on a dynamic and interactive quality control process is increasingly used among laboratories. The circulation of a <b>slide</b> <b>set</b> does not fit such a model due to medicolegal aspects (using original slides) and to slow circulation among laboratories. A digital image-based set bypasses these problems since a digital image can be easily duplicated and circulated. All laboratories or observers involved could read the same set within a short time frame, with evident advantages. Today the digital image quality is very high, approaching the resolution of the optical microscope. Digital image interpretation, in some respects, can be an ideal modality, permitting quality control of smear interpretation and continuous professional training. ...|$|R
40|$|This article proposes {{methods to}} trace media history through {{material}} objects that build on archival practices. It discusses {{the character of}} information derived from the object and other related sources, to outline possibilities for media-historical research connecting multiple collections to create large sets of data. The aim {{of this article is}} twofold: first, I share practical knowledge about identifying lantern slides of commercially distributed <b>slide</b> <b>sets,</b> to generalize an understanding of identification and evaluation from both an archival and a scholarly perspective. Combined documentation of information from various sources (catalogues, lantern slides, trade press, lecture material, readings, related media) is often necessary to correctly identify lantern slides. Second, I propose criteria for research infrastructures to incorporate data documentation towards comparative research designs. The enormous dispersion of lantern slides over many collections leads scholars to build their own corpora from objects held in various collections, which can be ameliorated with standardised descriptors across collections. Further, new research questions tracing synchronic and diachronic dispersion could be asked with the collaborative documentation of a larger set of data, for example, assessing the geographic distribution and popularity of <b>slide</b> <b>sets,</b> reconstructing trade networks or the migration of images across various media forms. Altogether, collaborative documentation and search could lead to knowledge about the formation of canons of shared visual knowledge. Research into the dissemination of <b>slide</b> <b>sets</b> and the popularity of displayed motifs cannot be restricted to either ‘distant readings’ or ‘close readings’ exclusively, and benefits from the ability to switch between close inspections of the object as well as networked sources...|$|R
