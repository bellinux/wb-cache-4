40|$|The {{transition}} {{into the twenty-first}} century brought about important changes in society, including the areas of education and teaching. The establishment of the European Higher Education Area represents an effort to face these changes together in Europe. The changes in the teaching and learning models <b>in</b> higher <b>education</b> led to the institutional promotion of extensive interventions in order to alter the status quo that has prevailed for decades. The need for a cultural renewal of the teaching <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> higher <b>education,</b> attending to the centrality of studentâ€™s learning rather than knowledge per se, is also a challenge to be overcome. This study intends to highlight the central elements concerning the Bologna Process and the topics connecting the objec- tives and their intrinsic principles. This initial approach is the basis for the design of a proposal for monitoring the implementation of the Bologna Process in an institution of higher <b>education</b> <b>in</b> Portugal. The results suggest a proposal consistent with the needs in terms of monitoring the implementation of the Bologna Process.

Because of a state-initiated plan in Texas, the "Indicators of Program Quality for Adult Education and Literacy," extensive professional development for instructional <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> adult <b>education</b> and literacy became crucial, especially for English-as-a-Second-Language teachers. Two objectives of the study were: 1) assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of professional development programs and 2) investigation of attitudinal change resulting from interactive, hands-on, and experiential staff development modeling indicators of program quality using,a process transformative approach. Professional development consists of several formats tailored to local program needs. Issues of second language acquisition, thinking and problem solving, reading, and process writing were considered in the context of learner-centered participatory instruction engaging learners in meaningful interaction in both oral and written English. Findings from the study indicate participants found the sessions highly useful and effective and that significant attitudinal changes occurred in favor of an interactive process approach to critical literacy for adults.

Previous research on national and local policies surrounding this phenomenon has identified different discourses of internationalisation which may have an effect on practices such as student mobility. In order to understand better the role of student mobility in practice, the article analyses responses to an inquiry about internationalisation to a group of academic <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> intercultural <b>education</b> from universities around the world. Informants, all members of the research network Cultnet, working at 28 different universities in 15 countries, describe internationalisation within their practice, and their understanding of the role which student mobility plays in relation to this. Data were collected through questionnaires and interviews over a period of six months. The findings locate student mobility within discourses of internationalisation. They also raise questions in relation to the need for an intercultural dialogue approach in internationalisation. We argue that institutions and their staff {{should be aware of the}} discursive field of internationalisation in HE, take a critical stance and analyse their own role in student mobility. How mobility fits within the field of intercultural education for incoming, outgoing and Â´homeÂ´ students should be highlighted and clarified in internationalisation agendas.

This paper draws on the data collected during the ethnography of Indigenous students (as well as Indigenous and non-Indigenous <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> Indigenous <b>education)</b> at The University, consisting of 27 interviews and 12 months of part-time participant-observation with students and staff. I argue that while support is indeed a significant factor influencing student success, the way it is perceived and interpreted by Indigenous students differ greatly depending on the way support is offered and delivered to the students and also on the students&# 8217; backgrounds and previous interactions with the support structures. Departing from the Bourdieuian ideas of cultural capital and its role in student achievement and bringing in Critical Race Theory-centered critique of the traditional interpretation of cultural capital, I propose a typology of Indigenous students&# 8217; perceptions of support. The typology offers a new perspective on the role Indigenous support in student achievement and feeds into a larger conceptual framework of my doctoral research explaining how Indigenous academic success is constructed...|$|R
40|$|Enterprise is {{becoming}} a more important part of UK Higher Education Institution (HEI) activity {{as a source of}} revenue, added value to students, and broader demonstration of the contribution of HEIs to the economy. Despite this there is little information on the overall provision of business services by HEIs in the UK and even less on that which involves students engaging with consultancy. In this paper, our focus is on the latter: the role of students in university business consultancy within the disciplines of marketing, media and creative industries. In this report we present: - An overview of how involved students are engaging in knowledge exchange through consultancy via a comprehensive audit of all 164 UK HEIâ€™s. Here, we identify different models of student consultancy in terms of their links to research and education, and offer some more broader reflections on the way that UK universities are engaging with business. - Through four case studies (with a total of 32 interviews and 3 focus groups), an analysis of the key tensions, barriers and motivations (both internal and external) in integrating students in consultancy in ways what benefit them, academic staff, HEIs and external organisations. - The implications for the management of such projects, and a series of recommendations for those who wish to <b>involve</b> students <b>in</b> university consultancy services.

40|$|The {{internationalisation}} {{of higher}} <b>education</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{over the past}} two decades has brought about dramatic changes in Australian universities. Growing numbers of international students have enrolled in Australian universities and the number of students studying offshore has also increased dramatically. While considerable material has been published on the ramifications of the increased numbers of onshore international students studying at Australian universities, there is relatively little published research on the specific challenges facing academics participating in offshore programs. The aim of this project was to examine the current pre-departure cross-cultural training taking place in the business faculties of three Australian universities in order to gain a better understanding of the adequacy of the support given to Australian academics teaching offshore. Twenty <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> offshore <b>education</b> were interviewed as part of this project, including academics with considerable offshore teaching experience, senior academic managers and cross-cultural trainers. While these institutions engage in little formal preparation for offshore teaching, a great deal of informal mentoring and briefing is taking place. We consider the implications of the new quality assurance framework for Australian universities, which requires that institutions be able to demonstrate the ways in which they ensure the quality of teaching and learning. Under this new system, universities are bound by the Australian Vice Chancellors&# 039; Committee&# 039;s guidelines for the provision of education to international students. It appears that Australian universities will need to establish more formal mechanisms to ensure that offshore staff are adequately prepared for offshore teaching posts...|$|R

40|$|For {{a variety}} of {{socio-economic}} and educational reasons, Entrepreneurship Education has become a critical aspect of the Indonesian higher education system. Contemporary Indonesia is characterised by high levels of youth and adult unemployment, low rates of business competitiveness, lack of entrepreneurial skills amongst graduates and negative attitudes towards entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Most universities in Indonesia that have adopted entrepreneurship education {{view it as a}} traditional subject, lacking innovation in its design, delivery and assessment. As a new phenomenon, entrepreneurship education remains an under-researched topic of academic endeavour. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand students' and faculty members' perceptions, aspirations and expectations as a basis for the development of entrepreneurship education models for Higher <b>Education</b> Institutions (HEIs) <b>in</b> Indonesia. Developing models of entrepreneurship education specific to the Indonesian context is of great importance for those who are in charge of establishing this new type of education initiative. It also will benefit the Indonesian government as they can use these informed models to make effective decisions on entrepreneurship education policy. The purpose of this study is to discover the different ways students and faculty members conceptualise entrepreneurship education and the logical relationship between these various conceptions. Focussing on this structural framework has been proven to contribute to new understandings of entrepreneurship education field. The research study upon which this thesis is based has employed a phenomenographic approach to the collection, analysis and interpretation of primary data obtained from seven Indonesian HEIs, including seventy semistructured interviews with students and faculty members. To complement the phenomenographic approach, face-to-face interviews were carried out with a sample of seven members of senior management, one in each institution. Due to the relatively small sample size, interpretive analysis rather than phenomenography was employed to analyse the results of these interviews. There are a number of important results emerging from this research study. Students indicated more variation in the ways <b>in</b> which entrepreneurship <b>education</b> is being experienced. Interestingly, faculty members appear to share with students the â€˜dimensions of variationâ€™ upon which the â€˜outcome spaceâ€™ was constituted. Regarding respondentsâ€™ aspirations of entrepreneurship education, variations emerged between students and faculty members in relation to 'themes of expanding awareness'. Both sample groups, however, seemed to accept that preparing students to become successful entrepreneurs should be considered a common aspiration of students and <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> entrepreneurship <b>education.</b> <b>In</b> terms of expectations, students felt that a market-driven strategy would be the best way to enhance the effectiveness of entrepreneurship <b>education.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, faculty members highlighted the importance of being part of, and contributing to, an entrepreneurial university. Based upon the result of this research study, three models of entrepreneurship education have been identified in relation to Indonesian HEIs: (i) â€˜Traditional Universityâ€™; (ii) â€˜Entrepreneurial Universityâ€™; and, (iii) â€˜Transitional Universityâ€™. Students' and faculty members' perceptions, aspirations and expectations of entrepreneurship education are the basis upon which these models have been developed. These models offer an original and innovative perspective on how entrepreneurship education should be conceptualised <b>in</b> a higher <b>education</b> context, <b>in</b> developing countries in general and Indonesia in particular...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{comparison}} of distance and conventional education programs at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. It is assessed in terms of access, delivery modes and output. The purpose is to investigate and to compare the impact of distance and conventional education on the performances of learners in a postgraduate degree program (B. Ed. (Hons) with specialization <b>in</b> <b>Education</b> Management, assessed <b>in</b> terms of access, delivery and output. It explored documents that were both at the macro (Government Policy documents) and macro (Universityâ€™s / Faculty documents) {{with the aim of}} answering the main research question, with other identified sub-research questions that have been raised. : What is the comparison between the impact of distance and conventional education on the performances of learners in a postgraduate BEd (Hons) degree program with specialization <b>in</b> <b>Education</b> Management, when assessed in terms of access, delivery mode and output? A review of relevant literature exposed and compared the essence of both modes of delivery. Data were collected from identified key role players on the program, which included administrators, module coordinators, course presenters, and tutors, some of the students on the program, and some of those that had discontinued their studies with the university. These were done using one-on-one semi-structured and focus group interviews, telephone interviews and questionnaires in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative data. A sample of 127 distance education students, 45 conventional students, 6 module coordinators, 10 course presenters, 4 tutors, 4 administrators, 1 instructional designer and 10 students that had discontinued their studies participated in the investigation. The data collected were analysed through the use descriptive and inferential statistics, and tabulation for the quantitative data, while the computer assisted qualitative data analysis software [CAQDAS] (Atlas. ti) was employed for the analysis of the transcribed interviews. From the data obtained, it was confirmed that there is a myriad of possible factors that may be responsible for the divergences in the performances, throughput and output rates of enrolled students on the BEd (Hons) Education Management, Law and Policy at the University of Pretoria. It was further revealed that South Africa has identified distance education as a tool of redressing past inequalities <b>in</b> higher <b>education,</b> a process, which the university was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> by starting relevant programs to this end. However, even though equal access is the focus of the country, but it appeared as if little is being said about financially supporting distance education as for instance, there was no financial assistance to distance education students on the program. Due to the incursion of the university into areas, where the impact of university education had not previously being felt, its choice of the mode of delivery was limited to the print, the first generation, which was expected to bring all students on the program at par since all would have access to it. However, despite the efforts made by the university, it was discovered that there existed some gaps between the qualities of the learning experiences, which students from both modes were exposed to. Examples of those identified were lack of designated counseling unit for distance education students, and inadequate number of administrative staff {{to meet the needs of}} the ever increasing number of distance education students. However, it appeared that there were no prominent discrepancies that could be found between the two modes, and one could assume that both modes were guided by a similar underpinning philosophy, which drove the ethos of the programs that impacted on the instructional design. It was also found that there were challenges faced by the academic <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the program under investigation, who felt that there might be the need for the institution to demarcate between academe interested <b>in</b> distance <b>education,</b> and those that were not, and the need for the institution to review its stand on rewards and incentives systems for <b>staff</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> distance <b>education.</b> It was believed by them that this would be the way out of the dearth of research presently facing the university on this delivery mode. The study suggests that quality issues especially in relation to an African setting should be looked into, since a large percentage of the students <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the program were from the rural areas. Finally, the study identified various limitations, and made suggestions for further research, and recommendations for improvement and immediate action.
