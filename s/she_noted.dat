5|$|Meanwhile, Potter {{continued}} to distribute her privately printed edition {{to family and}} friends, with the celebrated creator of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle, acquiring a copy for his children. When the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, another 200 were prepared. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> in an inscription in one copy that her beloved pet rabbit Peter had died.|$|E
5|$|According to Voigt, the coven {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> {{that they did not}} worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E
50|$|Silverman {{notes that}} the play should not contain an intermission. As well as this, <b>she</b> <b>notes</b> {{explicitly}} that actors should refrain from ever crying unless specifically stated. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that all crying must, instead, be understated and subtle. Silverman also remarks that actors should find humor in the dark moments of the play {{as well as the}} moments of joy.|$|R

5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, <b>she</b> <b>noted</b> that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; <b>she</b> <b>noted</b> that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
50|$|Nancy Gilgoff {{describes}} many {{differences in}} the way she was taught ashtanga to the way it is taught now. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that Pattabhi Jois originally left out seven postures in the standing sequence, but later assigned Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana and Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana before the Intermediate Series was given. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that Utkatasana, Virabhadrasana A and B, Parivritta Trikonasana, and Parivritta Parsvakonasana were not in the series at this point.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, Ratajkowski {{prominently}} {{defended the}} First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, after overhearing Jacob Bernstein (son of Nora Ephron and Carl Bernstein) of The New York Times make what she considered was a derogatory remark about the president's wife {{at a party}} for Diane von Furstenberg. The following month, she became the face of DKNY intimates. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that by July 2017, her sex appeal, especially her cleavage, has caused her to lose jobs. The following month she became the face of DL1961 jeans. In August 2017, she also became {{the face of the}} entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role in}} preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|Among Berlin's contemporaries was Cole Porter, whose music {{style was}} often {{considered}} more [...] "witty, sophisticated, [...] dirty," [...] according to musicologist Susannah McCorkle. Of the five top songwriters, only Porter and Berlin wrote both {{their own words}} and music. However, <b>she</b> <b>notes</b> that Porter, unlike Berlin, was a Yale-educated and wealthy Midwesterner whose songs were not successful until {{he was in his}} thirties. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> further that it was [...] "Berlin [...] got Porter the show that launched his career." ...|$|R
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, <b>she</b> <b>noted</b> that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} folklorist Adrienne Mayor {{has proposed}} that the griffin of mythology is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the Gobi Desert. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that griffins were said to inhabit the Scythian steppes that reached from the modern Ukraine to central Asia. Mayor draws a connection to Protoceratops, a frilled dinosaur that was commonly found in the Gobi. This dinosaur has features associated with griffins: they share sharp beaks, four legs, claws, similar size, and large eyes (or eye sockets {{in the case of}} the fossils), and the neck frill of Protoceratops, with large open holes, is consistent with descriptions of large ears or wings. However, the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron.|$|E
50|$|Lola Williamson interviewed TM-practitioners. In {{contrast}} to Forman's statements <b>she</b> <b>notes</b> that those transcendent experiences show variations between various TM-practitioners, {{and are also}} not contentless.|$|R
5000|$|Ellen Rosand {{remarks that}} by the mid-seventeenth-century Venetian public opera had {{developed}} a number of musical and dramatic conventions, several of which Giasone exhibits. For example: the three-act format, with the first act being the longest; dances conclude the first two acts; the Faustini lieto fine (happy ending) with concluding love duet; and an emotional climax with a lament. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that several aria and scene types had also been conventionalized by this point, and <b>she</b> <b>notes</b> that Giasone provides a model for several of them.|$|R
2500|$|Yaffa Zilbershats agrees {{and further}} argues {{against those who}} say that on May 15, 1948 Arabs living in Israel (who would later flee as refugees) must be {{considered}} Israeli citizens. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that most international treaties do not obligate a state to give citizenship to its inhabitants, and that the state (Israel) can decide to whom citizenship shall be given. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that while Article 15 of the UDHR does say [...] "Everyone has the right to a nationality", that right is [...] "ambiguous" [...] and [...] "weakly drafted".|$|R
5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which <b>she</b> <b>noted</b> that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.|$|E
5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, <b>she</b> <b>noted</b> that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 Edmonds {{identified}} 44 {{herds of}} Woodland Caribou in seven jurisdictions in western North America (west of Ontario/Manitoba border) {{with an estimated}} total maximum population of 61,090 caribou. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that by 1991 caribou was a threatened species in Alberta and an endangered species in Washington/Idaho.|$|E
5000|$|Objets Trouvé (1982-1988) {{stems from}} Crane’s {{interest}} in discarded objects, their life cycles and transformations. <b>She</b> <b>notes</b> that the series “embodies {{a suggestion of}} human evolution and human fatalities”.|$|R

25|$|In 2009, Birch {{noted that}} the Green's strongest areas of support were Labour-held seats in {{university}} towns or urban areas with relatively large student populations. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that there were also strong correlations between areas of high Green support and high percentages of people who define themselves as having no religion.|$|E
25|$|Ringer {{charged that}} the Librarian of Congress failed to follow {{personnel}} regulations and appointed Cary because of sex discrimination and race discrimination. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> to her superior qualifications, including her experience and performance reviews, as evidence of sex discrimination. Ringer also pointed to her willingness to speak openly about racial problems and her advocacy {{for the rights of}} African American employees as evidence of racial discrimination.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{an agent}} of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Ken Lanning, {{revealed}} that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and found no evidence for Satanism or ritualistic activity in any of them. In the UK, the Department of Health commissioned the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine to examine the allegations of SRA. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> that while approximately half did reveal evidence of genuine sexual abuse of children, none revealed any evidence that Satanist groups had been involved or that any murders had taken place. <b>She</b> <b>noted</b> three examples in which lone individuals engaged in child molestation had created a ritual performance to facilitate their sexual acts, with the intent of frightening their victims and justifying their actions, but that none of these child molestors were involved in wider Satanist groups. By the 21st century, hysteria about criminal religious groups had switched focus from Satanism to extremist Islam in Western countries, although allegations of Satanic ritual abuse continued to surface in parts of continental Europe and Latin America.|$|E
