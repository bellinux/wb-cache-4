5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on Russia's Cold War arch-rival, the United States, {{which had been}} courting the Somali government for some time. The U.S. eventually gave extensive military support. Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'Ã©tat. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force. Among these opposition movements were the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a Gadabuursi group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> (SNM) Isaaq militia.|$|E

Following a meeting of the <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> and northern clans' elders, the northern former British portion of the country declared its independence as Somaliland in May 1991.

In 1991, when the <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> took control of northern Somalia, they dismantled and sold the only publicly owned industry in the whole Somali northern region, a cement factory near Berbera, which was shipped off to help expand the cement factory in Dire Dawa. Both the Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front and the Oromo Liberation Front claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes {{between the two groups}} from 1991 until 1993. When the Somali Regional State was being established in 1993, it wanted Dire Dawa to be its capital. This was opposed by the Oromia Region, so the federal government placed the city under its own jurisdiction to avoid territorial conflict between the two regions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Siad Barre, the {{president}} of Somalia, frustrated by lack of success of the army against insurgents from the <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> {{in the north of}} country, offered the Ethiopian government a deal in which they stop sheltering and giving support to the SNM in return for Somalia giving up its territorial claim over Ethiopia's Somali region. Ethiopia was in agreement and a deal was signed on 3 April 1988 that included a clause confirming agreement not to assist rebel organisations based in each other's territories. The SNM felt the pressure to cease their activities on the Ethiopia-Somalia border, and decided to attack the northern territories of Somalia {{to take control of the}} major cities in the north. The brutal nature of the Siad Barre government response was unprecedented, and led to what Robin Cohen described as one of the [...] "worst civil wars in Africa".|$|E
2500|$|According to Abou Jeng {{and other}} scholars, the Barre regime rule {{was marked by}} a {{targeted}} brutal persecution of the Isaaq clan. Mohamed Haji Ingiriis and Chris Mullin state that the clampdown by the Barre regime against the Hargeisa-based <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> targeted the Isaaq clan, to which {{most members of the}} SNM belonged. They refer to the clampdown as the Isaaq genocide or Hargeisa holocaust.A United Nations investigation concluded that the crime of genocide was [...] "conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somali Government against the Isaaq people". The number of civilian casualties is estimated to be between 50,000-100,000 according to various sources, while some reports estimate the total civilian deaths to be upwards of 200,000 Isaaq civilians. Along with the deaths, Barre regime bombarded and razed the second and third largest cities in Somalia, Hargeisa and Burao respectively. This displaced an estimated 400,000 local residents to Hartasheikh in Ethiopia; another 400,000 individuals were also internally displaced.|$|E

They captured the town in two hours and immediately took over the military compound at the airport (where {{the largest number of}} soldiers were stationed), the Burao central police station and the prison, where they freed political prisoners (including schoolchildren) from the city's main jail. The government forces retreated, regrouped at Goon-Ad just outside the city, and in the late afternoon, entered the centre of town. According to reports by Human Rights Watch's Africa Watch, the soldiers, upon entering the city, went on a rampage on 27 and 28 May. This included [...] "dragging men out of their houses and shooting them at point blank range" [...] and summary killing of civilians, the report also noted that [...] "civilians of all ages who had gathered in the centre of town, or those standing outside their homes watching the events were killed on the spot. Among the victims were many students." [...] There was also widespread looting by the soldiers, and some people were reportedly killed as a result.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{constitution}} was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre's Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party politburo continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. By that time, {{the moral authority}} of Barre's ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council had begun to weaken. Many Somalis were becoming disillusioned with life under military dictatorship. The regime was further weakened in the 1980s as the Cold War {{drew to a close}} and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre's regime and the disbandment of the Somali National Army (SNA). Among the militia groups that led the rebellion were the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), United Somali Congress (USC), <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> (SNM) and the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the Somali Democratic Movement (SDM), the Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).

It led a group of Isaaq businesspeople, students, former civil servants and former politicians who lived in the United Kingdom to found the <b>Somali</b> <b>National</b> <b>Movement</b> in London in April 1981. Initially, the aim of the various groups that merged to create the SNM was not to create an armed liberation front, but rather these groups formed as a direct response to the harsh policies enacted by the Barre regime against the Isaaqs. However, the official position changed following the meeting of the newly formed SNM Congress in October 1981 to one of liberation 'with the expressed aim of ridding Somalia of Barre and instituting a democratic government in Somalia that would be inclusive of and based on the clan system."
