Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the <b>solemn</b> <b>declaration.</b> He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E

The Declaration of Principles in the General Synod Handbook contains: the <b>Solemn</b> <b>Declaration</b> 1893; the Basis of Constitution; and the Fundamental Principles previously adopted by the Synod in 1893 and these constitute the foundation of the Synod structure. The General Synod meets triennially and consists of lay people, clergy, and bishops from each of the 29 dioceses. In-between General Synods, the day-to-day affairs of the ACC are administered by a group elected by General Synod, called the Council of General Synod (COGS), which consults with and directs national staff working at the church's headquarters in Toronto.|$|E

The point is to form the typical sings of the <b>solemn</b> <b>declarations</b> style based on the used stylistic and pragmatic analysis. The starting material of the analysis builds together 30 harangues (15 civil and 15 church), from which are the exhibits used and are part of the enclosure. The work is divided in four chapters. In the first chapter we deal with the characterization of wedding <b>solemn</b> <b>declarations</b> of wedding <b>solemn</b> <b>declarations</b> and with the structure of the ceremony (how civil as church), too. The second chapter The civil cermony and church draws out understanding institution of marriage with laws of the Czech Republic and it speaks aqbout civil and church wedding cermony generaly.

The OPEC Special Fund was conceived in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975, and was formally established the following January. [...] "A <b>Solemn</b> <b>Declaration</b> 'reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment,' and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries... resources are additional to those already made available by OPEC states through a number of bilateral and multilateral channels."

The first Canadian synods were established in the 1850s, giving the Canadian church a degree of self-government. As {{a result of the}} UK Privy Council decision of Long v. Gray in 1861, all Anglican churches in colonies of the British Empire became self-governing. Even so, the first General Synod for all of Canada was not held until 1893. That first synod made the <b>Solemn</b> <b>Declaration</b> 1893, which describes how the Church of England in Canada is related to [...] "the Church of England throughout the world" [...] and [...] "the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church".

In St. Petersburg it declares its territorial disinterestedness; us it leaves wholly in the dark as to its programme; Rome it puts off with empty phrases about the question of compensation; in London, Count Mensdorff (the Austrian ambassador) hands out part of Serbia to Bulgaria and Albania and places himself in contradiction with Vienna's <b>solemn</b> <b>declaration</b> at St. Petersburg. From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement." ...|$|E

Good God! my Lords, what shall we say in this stage of the business? The prisoner put in an elaborate defence: he now disclaims that defence.

Petrolia is a half-Russian space orphan whose inventiveness seems to cause just as many problems as it solves. She is {{in a relationship with}} Flavien.
