25|$|A {{good run}} in the League Cup saw the Mariners knock holders Leicester City and fellow Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday out of the {{competition}} before finally losing out to Liverpool. A decent run of form had ignited the careers of such younger players as Daryl Clare, Danny Butterfield and Jack Lester who were becoming {{an integral part of}} the Blundell Park set-up. The Mariners went on to dump Burnley out of the Football League Trophy Northern <b>section</b> <b>area</b> final, which would see the club book its first trip to Wembley Stadium. The club were drawn against Southern section champions AFC Bournemouth and in a tight game, an equaliser from substitute Kingsley Black took the game into extra time, and in the 112th minute Grimsby secured the game courtesy of a golden goal from Wayne Burnett. This was the first major trophy awarded to the club following its first appearance at Wembley. It took only four weeks for Grimsby to return to the stadium though, this time to face Northampton Town in the Division Two play-off Final. Town won the game 1–0 thanks to a first half Kevin Donovan goal which gave the club a historic Wembley double and the Mariners promotion back to Division One.|$|E

Histochemical analy-sis of calcification and the expression of proteins involved in mineralization are usually based on whole section analysis, thereby often ignoring regional differences in atheroscle-rotic lesions. At present, limited information is available about factors involved in the initia-tion and progression of atherosclerosis. Aim of This Study This study investigates the intra-section association of micro-calcifications with markers for atherosclerosis in randomly chosen <b>section</b> <b>areas</b> of human coronary arteries. Moreover, the possible causal relationship between calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells and inflammation was explored in vitro. Technical Approach To gain insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we performed analysis of the dis-tribution of micro-calcifications using a 3 -MeV proton microbeam. Additionally, we per-formed systematic analyses of 30 to 40 regions of 12 coronary sections obtained from 6 patients including histology and immuno-histochemistry. <b>Section</b> <b>areas</b> were classified according to CD 68 positivity.
