25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{although}} <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{on the same}} frequency can cause interference to one another, they may still benefit network capacity if adequate separation conditions between nodes are met. We define this separation and show that it decreases {{as the number of}} <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions</b> increases. We further show, through an example of three <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions,</b> that optimisation of network capacity is dependent on this separation and path loss exponent. The findings are verified through simulations which demonstrate how separation can be utilised to simultaneously increase the capacity and power efficiency of military ad-hoc networks. It is also shown through optimisation that the use of additional nodes can increase these benefits. Robert Hunjet, Andrew Coyl...|$|R

In this paper, therefore, we aim to investigate if the popular 802. 11 MAC can be modified to exploit this innovation in the physical layer.

30|$|In [6], the many-to-many space-time network coding (M 2 M-STNC) for {{a network}} of N decode-and-forward (DF) nodes is {{proposed}} to achieve a diversity order of N- 1 per node over a total of 2 N time slots while maintaining a stable network throughput of 1 / 2 symbol per time slot per node. The operation of the M 2 M-STNC scheme {{is based on the}} assumption of N- 1 perfectly synchronized <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions</b> in every time slot of the cooperation phase. However, the work in [6] did not analyze the impact of timing offsets on the network performance. In practice, <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions</b> from multiple relay nodes are extremely challenging due to the imperfect timing synchronization. Most research in cooperative communications when focusing on <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmissions</b> from distributed relay nodes assume perfect timing synchronization [4, 11, 12]. Overlooking the impact of timing synchronization errors could lead to detrimental effects on the network performance [13]. Also, channel state information errors at the receiving nodes are inevitable in practice [14]. Such errors could drastically diminish diversity gains and thus must be carefully characterized.|$|R

5000|$|In telecommunications, {{parallel}} transmission is the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>transmission</b> {{of the signal}} elements of a character or other entity of data.

Multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is used internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes externally {{for such things as}} printers, The major issue with this is [...] "skewing" [...] because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. A parity bit can help to reduce this. However, electrical wire parallel data transmission is therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more likely.|$|E
