Laser scanning {{has emerged as the}} preferred data acquisition method of as built information for creating these three dimensional (3 D) models. The product of the scanning process is a cloud of points representing scanned surfaces. From this point cloud, 3 D models of the surfaces are reconstructed. Most surfaces are of piping elements e. g. <b>straight</b> <b>pipes,</b> t-junctions, elbows, spheres. The automatic detection of these piping elements in point clouds has the greatest impact on the reconstructed model. Various algorithms have been proposed for detecting piping elements in point clouds. However, most algorithms detect cylinders (<b>straight</b> <b>pipes)</b> and planes which make up a small percentage of piping elements found in industrial installations. In addition, these algorithms do not allow for deformation detection in pipes. Therefore, the work in this research is aimed at the detection of piping elements (<b>straight</b> <b>pipes,</b> elbows, t-junctions and flange) in point clouds including deformation detection...|$|R
25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|E

60|$|The {{blow-pipe}} {{which these}} Indians use is an ingeniously contrived weapon. It {{is made from}} a species of palm-tree. When an Indian wants one, {{he goes into the}} woods and selects a tree with a long slender stem of less than an inch in diameter; he extracts the pith out of this, and then cuts another stem, so much larger than the first that he can push the small tube into the bore of the large one,--thus the slight bend in one is counteracted by the other, and a perfectly <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> is formed. The mouth-piece is afterwards neatly finished off. The arrows used are very short, having a little ball of cotton at the end to fill the tube of the blow-pipe. The points are dipped in a peculiar poison, which has the effect of producing death when introduced into the blood by a mere scratch of the skin. The Indians can send these arrows an immense distance, and with unerring aim, as Martin and Barney had many an opportunity of witnessing during their long and weary journey on foot to the forest-home of the savages.|$|E

6000|$|Elizabeth {{followed}} her father, who {{paused a moment}} to whisper a message {{to one of his}} domestics, into a large hall, that was dimly lighted by two candies, placed in high, old-fashioned, brass candlesticks. The door closed, and the party were at once removed from an atmosphere that was nearly at zero, to one of sixty degrees above. In the centre of the hall stood an enormous stove, the sides of which appeared to be quivering with heat; from which a large, <b>straight</b> <b>pipe,</b> leading through the ceiling above, carried off the smoke. An iron basin, containing water, was placed on this furnace, for such only it could be called, in order to preserve a proper humidity in the apartment. The room was carpeted, and furnished with convenient, substantial furniture, some of which was brought from the city, the remainder having been manufactured by the mechanics of Templeton. There was a sideboard of mahogany, inlaid with ivory, and bearing enormous handles of glittering brass, and groaning under the piles of silver plate. Near it stood a set of prodigious tables, made of the wild cherry, to imitate the imported wood of the sideboard, but plain and without ornament of any kind. Opposite to these stood a smaller table, formed from a lighter-colored wood, through the grains of which the wavy lines of the curled maple of the mountains were beautifully undulating. Near to this, in a corner, stood a heavy, old-fashioned, brass-faced clock, incased in a high box, of the dark hue of the black walnut from the seashore. An enormous settee, or sofa, covered with light chintz, stretched along the walls for nearly twenty feet {{on one side of the}} hail; and chairs of wood, painted a light yellow, with black lines that were drawn by no very steady hand, were ranged opposite, and in the intervals between the other pieces of furniture. A Fahrenheit's thermometer in a mahogany case, and with a barometer annexed, was hung against the wall, at some little distance from the stove, which Benjamin consulted, every half hour, with prodigious exactitude. Two small glass chandeliers were suspended at equal distances between the stove and outer doors, one of which opened at each end of the hall, and gilt lustres were affixed to the frame work of the numerous side-doors that led from the apartment. Some little display in architecture had been made in constructing these frames and casings, which were surmounted with pediments, that bore each a little pedestal in its centre; on these pedestals were small busts in blacked plaster-of-Paris. The style of the pedestals as well as the selection of the busts were all due to the taste of Mr. Jones. On one stood Homer, a most striking likeness, Richard affirmed, “as any one might see, for it was blind,” Another bore the image of a smooth-visaged gentleman with a pointed beard, whom he called Shakespeare. A third ornament was an urn, which; from its shape, Richard was accustomed to say, intended to represent itself as holding the ashes of Dido. A fourth was certainly old Franklin, in his cap and spectacles. A fifth as surely bore the dignified composure of the face of Washington. A sixth was a nondescript, representing “a man with a shirt-collar open,” to use the language of Richard, “with a laurel on his head-it was Julius Caesar or Dr. Faustus; there were good reasons for believing either,” ...|$|E

Street gutters were open sewers. Today, the worst that will hit your windshield while driving down a street is a bird dropping, and we call that progress. But when you look down a stream that runs along the backyards of a row of houses, and you see the pipes sticking out of the ground at the water’s edge, lined up like mailboxes sending raw sewage into the stream from each house, you can see that we have quite a way to go yet. Our cover story this issue concerns <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> and the danger to public health and the environment they pose. Recognizing that threat and discussing it is one thing, but actually moving to eliminate it is another.

The method should be capable of providing quantitative wall thickness information for both <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> and bends. The wave propagation in bends is far more complicated than in <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> because natural focusing occurs due to geometrical path differences.

Numerical results show that a tomographic inversion on simple simulated data provides accurate results. The focusing effect due to the shape of the bend yields a phase rotation of the wavelet, which complicates accurate timing picking. This effect was excluded in the simulated ray tracing data.
