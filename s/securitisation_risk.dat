40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} analyse {{and discuss the}} impact of {{financial}} reform and related institutional change {{on the process of}} financial intermediation. In effect reforms stood the earlier quantity driven model on its head. The attempt was to de-segment markets and remove asset and liability restriction of the balance sheets of financial intermediaries. Regulatory barriers to entry would be removed and markets would determine prices. Specialisation, if any, would be market driven rather than by policy design and financial intermediaries were free to use economies of scale and scope to achieve efficiency gains and improve market reach.

40|$|Recently Life Insurance Securitisation {{practices}} have been probed in dedicated areas {{to access the}} wider capital markets. These developments have shown a rising interest among leading insurers and reinsurers to start building experience with securitisation practices, either for risk transfer, raising additional capital {{or a combination of}} these. As these structures have proven to be cost effective and generally accepted in the banking segment it is foreseen that securitisation can become an accepted method in insurance environments too in the foreseeable future. This paper provides an overview of recent practices in Life Insurance Securitisation and aims to demonstrate that Life Insurance Securitisation has viable potential for insurance companies in the future to reduce the cost of (regulatory) capital and transferring risk to the capital markets.

40|$|Prima facie {{securitisation}} {{played a}} prominent role in the recent global financial crisis. Moral hazard associated with securitisation is the key element behind the failure of <b>securitisation.</b> <b>Risk</b> retention is the US legislator's response to address the moral hazard issue associated with the originate-to-distribute model. This paper adopts a lexieconomic framework to analyse the risk retention provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and proves that said provisions are not capable of eliminating moral hazard associated with securitisation. This paper argues that in order to ensure proper screening of the borrower, the cost for the lender for not engaging in proper screening and monitoring should be higher than the benefits she gains by not screening. Inter alia this paper further argues that the inclusion of non-recourse mortgages would make securitisation schemes susceptible to changes in home prices.

We examine how a local newspaper reported the outbreaks, focusing on the linguistic framing of biosecurity. Consistent with the growing concern with securitisation among policymakers, issues were discussed in terms of space (indoor–outdoor; local–global; national–international) and flows (movement, barriers and vectors) between spaces (farms, sheds and countries). The apportioning of blame along the lines of 'them and us'– Hungary and England – was tempered by the reporting on the Hungarian operations of the British poultry company.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the pricing of synthetic credit <b>risk</b> <b>securitisation.</b> Securitisation is advantageous both for originating banks, who incur savings on bank capital costs and for investors, who acquire a stake in leveraged credit portfolio risk, an exposure type rarely accessible otherwise. Securitisation is cost-efficiently implemented by structured credit derivatives, issued securities are therefore referred to as synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). We perform arbitrage-free pricing of synthetic CDOs referring to investment grade European corporate debt, such that a comparison with observed transactions can be drawn. CDO payout rules are formalised, taking both direct risk transfer structures and synthetic transactions using SPVs for excess spread trapping into account. Underlying losses are captured by a reduced-form affine multi-factor model, exploiting the strong observed comovement of corporate spreads for systematic factor estimation. Estimation is performed by Kalman filter-based QML, applied to implied spread structures of recent European corporate bond issues to which originating banks are exposed. Valuation results are obtained {{for a variety of}} structural variants. A comparison with transactions accommodating our modelling approach with regard to payout rules and reference debt quality supports the hypothesis that investors have a strong preference for CDO investments: Observed note issuance spreads provide no adequate compensation for the leveraged portfolio risk exposure.

These two factors are the engine behind unprecedented global ageing. In this paper, we explore how this demographic transition may influence financial markets and, in turn, how financial market innovation {{might help to}} resolve concerns flowing from global ageing trends. We first provide context by reviewing the economics, finance, and insurance-related literature on how global ageing patterns may influence capital markets. We then turn to insurance markets, and discuss a range of products and policies, including both retail and wholesale financial offerings for various forms of life annuities, long-term care benefits, reverse mortgages, <b>securitisation</b> of longevity <b>risk,</b> inflationprotected assets, reinsurance, guarantees, derivative contracts on residential property price indices, mortality swaps, and longevity derivative contracts.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between credit <b>risk</b> and <b>securitisation</b> in the South African banking sector. Panel data {{analysis was used to}} analyse the annual observations from four major South African banks for a sample period from 2005 to 2014. Results indicate that the basis for securitisation variation in South African banks stems from capital, bank size and the economic growth of the country. A positive impact of <b>securitisation</b> on credit <b>risk</b> was discovered. The paper revealed that, contrary to previous findings, the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2009 had no effect on the securitisation in the South African banking sector. This paper also found that size has a significant influence on capitalisation. Compared to small banks, large banks tend to securitise more and take on further credit risk. Therefore, banks should increase or maintain an acceptable capital amount to hedge against any unexpected risks. Proper systems should be established and adopted to encourage repayment of loans by borrowers...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} reviews the risk {{financing}} techniques {{employed in the}} insurance markets {{and looks at the}} changing field of the risk management arena. The overarching view is that apart from the traditional channels of financing risk, alternative routes should be explored. The latter is strengthened with the surfacing of off-balance sheet instruments in modern financial markets. The paper extends the discussion to the layered risk financing approach and reinforces its importance. That is, cash flow engineering instruments are employed to match different segments of the loss distributions. The role of insurance risk capital to assume extreme losses is further discussed, while reinsurance still remains a form of capital restructuring. Taken all together, the intention is that risk financing should be able to release assets committed to liabilities, and should reduce the cost of risk capital in sponsoring all-purpose equity. Finally, risk management platforms are redefined, while the <b>securitisation</b> of insurance <b>risk</b> is explored along with its effectiveness and possible caveats.

40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} viewed as a key bank funding, risk {{management}} and performance improvement tool {{over the last two}} decades. However, the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 has shown that engagement in securitisation might create significant financial problems for banks and consequently lead to widespread problems in the financial sector. This, therefore, has underlined the importance of understanding banks’ securitisation activities, the benefits and risks inherent, and the consequences for the financial system. This thesis comprises empirical research on the effects of securitisation on banks. The work is presented in three essays. The first essay investigates whether banks improve their performance through the use of the securitisation market by applying a propensity score matching approach. Specifically, we attempt to assess whether the access to the securitisation market led to lower cost of funding, less credit risk exposure, and higher profitability. Using US commercial bank data from 2001 to 2008, we first test these hypotheses using univariate analysis and find that securitising banks are, on average, more profitable institutions, with higher credit risk exposure, and higher cost of funding. However, the propensity score matching analysis does not provide evidence to suggest that securitisation had a significant impact upon bank performance. In other words, the analysis shows that securitisers would have had comparable cost of funding, credit risk, and profitability had they remained non-securitising. This evidence leads us to conclude that securitisation does not seem to outperform alternative funding, risk management, and profitability improvement techniques used by non-securitising banks that have ex-ante similar characteristics to those securitising. The second essay investigates the impact of securitisation on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks. Using US bank holding company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding securitised assets choose asset portfolios of lower credit <b>risk.</b> Examining <b>securitisations</b> by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding <b>securitisation</b> and <b>risk</b> taking is primarily driven by securitisations of mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer loans. Securitisations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit-risk taking behaviour. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in securitisation transactions, as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitisation on the riskiness of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the structure of transactions. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude of credit support provided by banks. The third essay examines the relationship between banks’ off-balance sheet securitisation structures and insolvency risk, with a particular focus on credit and liquidity support provided by these banks. Additionally, it examines the risk effect of credit-enhancing facilities and liquidity commitments provided by banks to securitisation structures of other institutions. Using US bank holding company data for the period from 2002 to 2007, we first find that credit enhancements provided by originating banks in their securitisation structures have a significant positive effect on insolvency risk of the banks. Second, examining credit enhancements by the form of underlying facility, we find that among credit-enhancing interest-only strips, subordinated securities, and standby letters of credit, the latter have the greatest positive association with bank insolvency risk. In contrast, liquidity provisions are found to have a significant risk-reducing effect. Finally, examining credit and liquidity support provided by banks to third-party securitisation structures, we find that credit enhancing third-party <b>securitisations</b> reduces insolvency <b>risk</b> of the banks, while liquidity provisions are found to be highly positively associated with their insolvency. Summarising the main findings, the first essay finds no evidence of significant causal effects of securitisation on performance of securitising banks. The second essay finds evidence to suggest that outstanding securitisation has a negative impact on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks; while the third essay finds that the interests retained by banks in connection to securitised assets significantly increase their insolvency risk. This shows that the net risk transfer for originating banks through securitisation might be ambiguous; however banks do account for the retained exposure to the securitised assets reducing credit risk taking. Taken together, the evidence from the three studies suggests that banks predominantly use securitisation for financing purposes rather than as a risk management or performance improvement mechanism. This research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} motives for and consequent implications of securitisation and provides valuable findings for the ongoing discussion of how to redesign the securitisation model and to reform the supervision and regulation of banks’ engagement in securitisation activities in response to the recent financial crisis.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} cluster-based {{classification}} methodology {{as a process}} of identifying bank failure. A central part of the thesis is an analysis of US commercial banks condition and performance pre- and post 2007 banking crisis. The structure of US commercial banks has changed radically in the forms of funding patterns, <b>securitisation</b> and credit <b>risk</b> transfer mechanisms. The change is reflected in both the results of the analysis we carried out in this thesis and in the cluster-based classification. Cluster-based classification allows us to partition a classification problem through clustering on a subset of features, then assigning and training one or more classifiers individually on each cluster and customizing the feature set for the cluster. The approach we developed for banks rely on two information sources namely, financial data of banks and set of financial features {{that can be used for}} clustering. In our implementation of the methodology, financial banks are partitioned into clusters and in order to determine the cluster-specific feature subset, we perform feature selection on each cluster using a fast correlation based feature selection algorithm. Finally, a multilayer perceptron neural network is attached to each of the clusters for classification. Using data set on US commercial banks obtained from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), we found that the cluster-based classification approach achieves improved classification accuracy, in an order of up to 16 % higher, compared to non-clustering approaches on both the pre and post- 2007 bank crisis. In addition, through a computational analysis of the underlying financial dynamics of banks, we identified two main failure patterns which we labelled gradual and brittle. Gradual pattern encompasses banks whose failure proceeds in small steps and failure is not likely to be abrupt. Unlike banks exhibit- ing a gradual failure pattern, brittle banks may not give ample warning of impending failure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This seminar, opened by Governor Christian Noyer, brought together forty five representatives from central banks in developed and emerging countries and from international organisations (such as the Bank for International Settlements and the European Central Bank), as well as twenty speakers from central banks, international institutions and the private sector. The first two days of the seminar were devoted to conferences on: • risks and sources of macro-financial vulnerability, the latest developments on credit risk transfer markets and the presentation of the findings of the cross-sectoral survey on credit derivatives in France; • the technical, financial and legal aspects of <b>securitisation</b> and credit <b>risk</b> management; • the presentation of the French and European experiences with respect to the role of central banks in rating companies and their contribution to financial stability; • bad debts and their impact on financial stability (case of Japan); • Basel II, a prudential framework which better reflects credit risk, and the effect of ratings on market dynamics; • lastly, the macro-financial consequences of risk transfers from the perspective of financial interdependence. Over the next two days, participants attended two workshops on the subjects of “Basel II, credit risk provisioning and accounting standards” and “Credit risk management and its macro-financial consequences”. These gave rise to intensive and fruitful discussions on the following four points: 1. identification of the sources of risk or financial vulnerability 2. credit risk assessment 3. credit risk management 4. implications for economic policy This article summarises the debates held in the workshops and the round table discussions on the last day. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study emanates from {{the inclusion of}} environmental risks on the global security agenda. Although {{dating back to the}} Rio Summit on Environment and Development (UNEP, 1992), this trend gained momentum following the publication of the Fourth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in February 2007 (IPCC, 2007 a). The report warned that the global climate system is changing mainly because of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, exposing, amongst others, Africa as a continent most vulnerable to the impact of climate variability and change. Subsequent to the report, the security implications of climate change were discussed by the United Nations Security Council in April 2007 (UN, 2007 a). With these developments as a point of departure, the aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the <b>securitisation</b> of environmental <b>risks,</b> particularly the impact of climate change, in South Africa, with specific reference to official perceptions of (and where applicable, policy responses to) environmental security between 2007 and 2012. As a literature and documentary case study on South Africa, the research utilises a conceptual framework that broadens and deepens the concept of security to include the environment as a non-traditional (non-military) aspect. In this context, environmental risks are discussed as a challenge to security, considering their contemporary relevance. Environmental security is discussed as an emerging security issue in the context of its global and regional scope; its linkage to and impact on food, water and energy security; and its influence on the political, economic, and social sectors of security. Further, the study indicates that Southern Africa in general, and South Africa in particular, are highly vulnerable to the impact of environmental risks such as climate change; and that such risks indeed exacerbate existing security risks and threats. Against this backdrop, the South African government’s securitisation (or lack of securitisation) of the environment is described and explored with reference to official views on environmental security. The analysis indicates that the Government securitises environmental risks such as climate change to a limited degree only (in terms of securitising speech and act); and the issue thus does not fall within the ambit of security, but rather that of sustainable development. The Government base their unsecuritised stance on the impact of environmental risks, on the country’s basic natural resources (such as food, water and energy) being overwhelmed by existing growth pressures; and that the Administration’s current priority is inter alia social development issues, such as employment and poverty eradication. The study concludes with a summary of key findings in response to the stated research problem, and with recommendations concerning the South African government’s response to environmental security.

40|$|PhDUnlike other {{financial}} services (e. g., {{services provided by}} a bank or a primary insurance company), reinsurers seldom deal with the consumers directly. This indirect relationship with the consumer results in the view {{that it is not}} necessary to regulate pure reinsurers to the same degree as primary insurers, because they deal only with other companies or individuals in the insurance business who are already subject to regulatory control. It is true that a reinsurer bears its own risk; however, if a reinsurer becomes insolvent or has not provided sufficient reserves to cover liability of payments, the stability of the primary insurer might be threatened and hence the interests of the insured parties. In the last decade or so, reinsurance markets have been dominated by a number of trends, which include an increase of the potential risk of liability of "longtail" catastrophe (e. g., earthquake, hurricane and flood) and significant uncollectible reinsurance recoverables due to legal disputes relating to contract liability. These factors have affected solvency margins of primary insurers. At the same time, there has been a rapidly growing concern respecting "finite risk" reinsurance and <b>securitisation</b> of insurance <b>risk,</b> which can be tailored more specifically to the needs of the insurers. With regard to emerging markets, reinsurance regulation currently tends to be based on local protectionism. This has impeded the diversification of insurance risk and has resulted in a shortage of capital capacity to cover further risks. In addition, trade barriers as to reinsurance have been gradually dismantled by the efforts undertaken by many international negotiations and organisations (e. g., WTO and OECD) in recent years. On the other hand, with insurance regulation being gradually built, internationally on a set of pro-competitive principles designed to ensure a competitive, solvent and fair market, the reinsurance market is becoming more competitive. In order to establish a sound and viable regulatory regime, emerging countries are seeking to implement regulatory reform based on several leading regulatory models which have been proved effective in developed countries (e. g., the UK and USA models). It is evident, however, that the attempts merely to copy the "readymade" law of industrialised countries will fail unless awareness of particular social, economic and legal differences are taken into account. The primary theme of this volume is that the traditional point of view that private reinsurers and reinsurance markets are not in need of governmental regulation is flawed. To the contrary, the reinsurers, reinsurance intermediaries and related reinsurance arrangements should be appropriately regulated to protect the solvency of primary insurers. Through comparative analysis of different sets of international regulatory principles and of experienced developed country models, this volume will develop and address these general regulatory issues. In order to provide and to enact a sound and viable regulatory system in emerging markets, however, such regulations should be adopted to suit the particular country circumstances and should not be imposed or copied en masse from existing models. In support of this proposition, the example of the Taiwanese reinsurance market will be used as a case study. Unless otherwise indicated, this volume speaks as of September 200...|$|R
