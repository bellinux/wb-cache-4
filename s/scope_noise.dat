40|$|Abstract—This {{document}} details {{the process of}} developing a wireless device that captures the basic movements of the foot (plantar flexion, dorsal flexion, abduction, adduction.), and the knee movement (flexion). It implements a motion capture system by using a hardware based on optical fiber sensors, due to the advantages in terms of <b>scope,</b> <b>noise</b> immunity and speed of data transmission and reception. The operating principle used by this system is the detection and transmission of joint movement by mechanical elements and their respective measurement by optical ones (in this case infrared). Likewise, Visual Basic software is used for reception, analysis and signal processing of data acquired by the device, generating a 3 D graphical representation in real time of each movement. The result is a boot in charge of capturing the movement, a transmission module (Implementing Xbee Technology) and a receiver module for receiving information and sending it to the PC for their respective processing. The main idea with this device is to help on topics such as bioengineering and medicine, by helping {{to improve the quality of}} life and movement analysis...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInspired by the {{a contrario}} {{approach}} this paper proposes {{a way of}} setting the threshold when using parsimonious path filters to detect thin curvilinear structures in images. The a contrario approach, instead of modeling the structures to detect, models the noise to detect structures deviating from the model. In this <b>scope,</b> we assume <b>noise</b> composed of pixels that are independent random variables. Henceforth, cracks that are curvilinear sequences of bright pixels (not necessarily connected) are detected as abnormal sequences of bright pixels.

40|$|Abstract—The gyro {{stabilized}} platform control {{is required to}} isolate the line of sight (LOS) from the disturbance and vibration of carrier and ensure pointing and tracking for target in electro-optical tracking system. A compound adaptive fuzzy PID control with hysteresis-band switching is developed for this servo system with nonlinear property and some uncertainties. Here, in the adaptive fuzzy controller, the self-tuning factors are made to modify the parameters of fuzzy controller online, and a new learning algorithm of fuzzy rules modifier is proposed to adjust control efforts. The improved PID controller are adopted to restrain motor saturation and fulfil non-error control. The hysteresis-band switching (HBS) strategy is given to deal with jitter caused by single-point switching condition. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can achieve perfect control performance and is proved to be effective in bating carrier disturbances within the <b>scope</b> of definite <b>noise</b> and sensitivity to acceleration...|$|R

40|$|Double-modulated {{terahertz}} differential time-domain spectroscopy (double-modulated THz-DTDS), is {{a technique}} {{that is based on}} dithering the sample under test. In this paper, we report a measurement technique based on mounting the sample on a spinning wheel, in order to overcome fundamental limitations imposed by linear dithering. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle showing that noise decreases {{as a function of the}} spinning wheel modulation frequency. This technique does not suffer the mechanical noise limitation of traditional linear dithering and thus opens up future <b>scope</b> for further <b>noise</b> reduction via hardware advances in the modulation frequency of the wheel. The spinning wheel technique enables a rapid succession of measurements between the reference and sample signals with a single mechanical delay scan. As a result, an improvement in measurement time by at least a factor of two, as compared to the conventional THz-TDS measurement technique is observed. The spinning wheel technique is experimentally verified by measuring the dielectric properties of a thick polymer material. Jegathisvaran Balakrishnan, Bernd M. Fischer and Derek Abbot...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} development of seismic detectors {{over the last}} 80 years. However, {{there is still a}} need to further develop new earthquake exploration and data acquisition systems with high precision. In particular, for China {{to keep up with the}} latest technology of these systems, it is important to be involved in the research and development, instead of importing systems that soon fall behind the latest technology. In this study, the features of system-on-a-programmable-chip (SoPC) technology are analyzed and used to design a new digital seismic-data acquisition station. The hardware circuit of the station was developed, and the analog board and the main control data-transmission board were designed according to the needs of digital seismic-data acquisition stations. High-definition analog-to-digital converter sequential digital filter technology of the station (cascade integrator comb filter, finite impulse response digital filter) were incorporated to provide advantages to the acquisition station, such as high definition, large dynamic <b>scope,</b> and low <b>noise.</b> A specific data-transmission protocol was designed for the station, which ensured a transmission speed of 16 Mbps along a 55 -m wire with low power consumption. Synchronic acquisition was researched and developed, so as to achieve accuracy better than 200 ns. The key technologies were integrated into the SoPC of the main control data-transmission board, so as to ensure high-resolution acquisition of the station, while improving the accuracy of the synchronic acquisition and data-transmission speed, lowering the power consumption, and preparing for the follow-up efforts to tape out. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} environmental inversion {{results of}} acoustic data in very shallow water (less than 20 m) {{obtained in the}} <b>scope</b> of underwater <b>noise</b> monitoring activities. A single au-tonomous hydrophone was moored at a reference position within the working area. Acoustic transmissions were performed {{with a pair of}} acoustic projectors, from a small vessel. Three ocean transects were considered: the vessel departed from a position close to the moored receiver, accomplishing a set of transmission stations on a straight line, at distances of up to 4 km. For modelling purposes, emitter and receiver swapped roles, which resembles to what is usually called a synthetic array. The acoustic data was inverted for seafloor parameters, and source and receiver depths. The inversion procedure carried out herein is similar to Matched-Field Processing (MFP) : the problem was posed as an optimisation problem where the replica field was obtained for candidate solutions. The objective function was the root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed transmission loss (TL) and that generated by forward mod-elling. The search of the solution was carried out with a genetic algorithm (GA), in an attempt to minimise that error. Empirical distributions were generated with candidate solutions of final GA generations, in order obtain a solution of the inverse problem as a maximum a posteriori estimate. The empirical distributions were in general compact and the RMSE achieved values below 1 dB. The results indicate that in underwater noise monitoring activities, using a single hydrophone for modelling purposes may be a viable option...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} the Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine for an {{autonomous}} agent (bot) in a game is always a difficult task mainly done by an expert human player, who has to transform his/her knowledge into a behavioural engine. This paper presents an approach for conduct-ing this task by means of Genetic Programming (GP) application. This algorithm is applied to design decision trees {{to be used as}} bot’s AI in 1 vs 1 battles inside the RTS game Planet Wars. Using this method it is possible to create rule-based systems defining decisions and actions, in an automatic way, completely different from a human designer doing them from scratch. These rules will be optimised along the algorithm run, considering the bot’s performance during evaluation matches. As GP can generate and evolve behavioural rules not taken into account by an expert, the obtained bots could perform better than human-defined ones. Due to the difficulties when applying Computational Intelligence techniques in the videogames <b>scope,</b> such as <b>noise</b> factor in the evalua-tion functions, three different fitness approaches have been implemented and tested in this work. Two of them try to minimize this factor by con-sidering additional dynamic information about the evaluation matches, rather than just the final result (the winner), as the other function does. In order to prove them, the best obtained agents have been compared with a previous bot, created by an expert player (from scratch) and then optimised by means of Genetic Algorithms. The experiments show that the three used fitness functions generate bots that outperform the opti-mized human-defined one, being the area-based fitness function the one that produces better results. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Directive 2002 / 49 /EC {{relating}} to assessment {{and management of}} environmental noise establishes that common assessment methods for the determination of environmental noise indicators will be defined {{for use in the}} EU member states. The Institute for Health and Consumer Protection (IHCP) of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission is supporting the Directorate General for the Environment (DGENV) in the preparation of Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS) for road, railway, aircraft and industrial noise to be used for producing strategic noise maps and relevant action plans in order to improve the reliability and the comparability of results across the EU Member States. A working group (WG 1) of international experts was established to define: (i) the <b>scope</b> of strategic <b>noise</b> mapping with respect to the geographical basis and exposure and health risk assessment; (ii) a quality process for collecting and checking quality of input data; (iii) the relevant criteria for performing simplifications to the CNOSSOS-EU framework for strategic noise mapping purposes; and (iv) the accuracy of the overall assessment in relation to the quality and availability of input data and related simplifications. Preliminary discussions indicate that the harmonized method is to be designed for EU-wide noise mapping and EU-policy evaluation, though it might be applicable for local action planning. The group is preparing recommendations to other related working groups on the influence on yearly averaged environmental noise indices Lden and Lnight, on the parameters related to a policy option that may be considered relevant even if it influences the above indices moderately, and on cost-benefit, for both data collection and processing, since costs need to be clearly associated with the degree of importance of a given parameter and to be weighed against its influence on the noise indices...|$|R
