2500|$|According to Rockstar's {{president}} Sam Houser, it {{was their}} intention {{to start a new}} chapter of Max Payne's life with the game: [...] "This is Max as we've never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>before,</b> a few years older, more world-weary and cynical than ever." [...] The press release states that since the last game, Max has left New York City behind and [...] "drifted from bad to worse." [...] The press release goes on to say Max has been double-crossed in this new city and is searching for both the truth and a way out. The game is set in São Paulo, Brazil, several years after the events of ending of the second game. Max Payne now works in executive protection for the wealthy Rodrigo Branco and his family in the hopes of escaping the memories of his troubled past. When a street gang kidnaps Rodrigo's wife, Fabiana, Max is pulled into a conspiracy of shadowy, warring factions threading every aspect of São Paulo society in a deadly web that threatens to engulf everyone and everything around him.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Catherine the Great (1762–96), {{children}} are at play in St. Petersburg's Summer Garden pretending to be soldiers. Two officers — Tsurin and Chekalinsky — enter, the former complaining about his bad luck at gambling. They remark that another officer, Herman, seems obsessed with the gaming table but never bets, being frugal and methodical. Herman appears with Tomsky, who remarks that his friend hardly seems like his old self: is anything bothering him? Herman admits he {{is in love with}} a girl above his station whose name he does not even know. When Prince Yeletsky, an officer, strolls into the park, Chekalinsky congratulates him on his recent engagement. Yeletsky declares his happiness while Herman, aside, curses him enviously. Yeletsky points out his fiancée, Liza, who has just appeared with her grandmother, the old Countess. Catching sight of Herman, the two women note they have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>before,</b> staring at them with frightening intensity. Herman realizes that Liza is his unknown beloved. When Yeletsky and the women leave, Herman is lost in thought as the other officers discuss the Countess: known as the Queen of Spades and formerly as the Muskovite Venus, due to her beauty, she succeeded at gambling in her youth by trading amorous favors for the winning formula of Count St. Germain in Paris. Tomsky says only two men, her husband and, later on, her young lover, ever learned her secret, because she was warned by an apparition to beware a [...] "third suitor" [...] who would try to force it from her. Musing on the winning sequence of three cards, the others lightly suggest that such a combination would solve Herman's problems. Threatened by approaching thunder, all leave except Herman, who vows to learn the Countess' secret.|$|E
60|$|The youth's {{face had}} haunted me. Where had I <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>before.</b> There was {{something}} strangely familiar in every line of him; in his carriage, his manner of speaking, his gestures. I {{could have sworn}} that I knew him, and yet I knew too that I had never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
