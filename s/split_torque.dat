5000|$|Roto Hydramatic (sometimes spelled Roto Hydra-Matic or Roto-Hydramatic) was an {{automatic}} transmission built by General Motors and used on some Oldsmobile and Pontiac and Holden models from 1961 - 1965.

Oldsmobile, one of the users of this transmission, called the fluid couplings stator the [...] "Accel-A-Rotor." [...] The lightweight, aluminum-cased transmission was sometimes nicknamed the [...] "Slim Jim." [...] HydraMatic Division calls the Roto a four range, three gear HydraMatic. It counts the stator multiplication @ 3.50 to one as a first gear, and when road speed and the two coupling halves speed match, it counts the same gear with fluid now passing straight through the stator as 2nd gear at 2.93 to one. 2nd gear or third range has a ratio of 1.56 and because the fluid coupling is drained for this gear ratio making the front clutch apply makes this a rare automatic that is in FULL mechanical lock-up (coupling drained) in second gear. Fourth range the coupling fills releasing the front clutch makes a ratio of 1 to 1. This transmission, like single and dual range, and dual coupling hydramatics also have the feature of <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> in the transmission whereby in fourth or high gear only 40-to 50% depending on transmission, 40% in Roto's case, but because of the design the coupling is only required to carry 40% of the engine torque.

This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers.

40|$|Rotorcraft {{transmission}} {{design is}} limited by empirical weight trends that are proportional to the power/torque raised to the two-thirds coupled with the relative inexperience industry has with the employment of variable speed transmission to heavy lift helicopters {{of the order of}} 100, 000 lbs gross weight and 30, 000 installed horsepower. The advanced rotorcraft transmission program objectives are to reduce transmission weight by at least 25 %, reduce sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB, have a 5000 hr mean time between removal, and also incorporate the use of <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> technology in rotorcraft drivetrains of the future. The major obstacle that challenges rotorcraft drivetrain design is the selection, design, and optimization of a variable speed transmission in the goal of achieving a 50 % reduction in rotor speed and its ability to handle high torque with light weight gears, as opposed to using a two-speed transmission which has inherent structural problems and is highly unreliable due to the embodiment of the traction type transmission, complex clutch and brake system. This thesis selects a nontraction pericyclic continuously variable transmission (P-CVT) as the best approach for a single main rotor heavy lift helicopter to target the above mentioned obstacle for drivetrain design and provides advancement {{in the state of the}} art of drivetrain design over existing planetary and <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> transmissions currently used in helicopters. The goal of the optimization process was to decrease weight, decrease noise, increase efficiency, and increase safety and reliability. The objective function utilized the minimization of the weight and the constraint is the tooth bending stress of the facegears. The most important parameters of the optimization process are weight, maintainability, and reliability which are cross-functionally related to each other, and these parameters are related to the torques and operating speeds. The analysis of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT achieved a weight reduction of 42. 5 % and 40. 7 % over planetary and <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> transmissions respectively. In addition, a 19. 5 dB sound pressure level reduction was achieved using active gear struts, and also the use of fabricated steel truss like housing provided a higher maintainability and reliability, low cost, and low weight over cast magnesium housing currently employed in helicopters. The static finite element analysis of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT, both 2 -D and 3 -D, yielded stresses below the allowable bending stress of the material. The goal of the finite element analysis is to see if the designed product has met its functional requirements. The safety assessment of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT yielded a 99 % probability of mission success based on a Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic- petri net analysis and a failure hazard analysis. This was followed by an FTA/RBD analysis which yielded an overall system failure rate of 140. 35 failures per million hours, and a preliminary certification and time line of certification was performed. The use of spherical facegears and pericyclic kinematics has advanced the state of the art in drivetrain design primarily in the reduction of weight and noise coupled with high safety, reliability, and efficiency.

40|$|<b>Split</b> <b>torque</b> designs {{can offer}} {{significant}} advantages over the traditional planetary designs for helicopter transmissions. However, {{it has two}} unique properties, gap and phase differences, which result {{in the risk of}} unequal load sharing. Various methods have been proposed to eliminate the effect of gap and promote load sharing to a certain extent. In this paper, system design parameters will be optimized to change the phase difference, thereby further improving load sharing. A nonlinear dynamic model is established to measure the load sharing with dynamic mesh forces quantitatively. Afterwards, a multiobjective optimization of a reference <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> design is conducted with the promoting of load sharing property, lightweight, and safety considered as the objectives. The load sharing property, which is measured by load sharing coefficient, is evaluated under multiple operating conditions with dynamic analysis method. To solve the multiobjective model with NSGA-II, an improvement is done to overcome the problem of time consuming. Finally, a satisfied optimal solution is picked up as the final design from the Pareto optimal front, which achieves improvements in all the three objectives compared with the reference design...|$|E
40|$|<b>Split</b> <b>torque</b> designs, {{proposed}} as alternatives to traditional planetary designs for helicopter main rotor transmissions, can save weight {{and be more}} reliable than traditional designs. This report {{presents the results of}} an analytical study of the system dynamics and performance of a <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> gearbox that uses a balance beam mechanism for load sharing. The Lagrange method was applied to develop a system of equations of motion. The mathematical model includes time-varying gear mesh stiffness, friction, and manufacturing errors. Cornell's method for calculating the stiffness of spur gear teeth was extended and applied to helical gears. The phenomenon of sidebands spaced at shaft frequencies about gear mesh fundamental frequencies was simulated by modeling total composite gear errors as sinusoid functions. Although the gearbox has symmetric geometry, the loads and motions of the two power paths differ. Friction must be considered to properly evaluate the balance beam mechanism. For the design studied, the balance beam is not an effective device for load sharing unless the coefficient of friction is less than 0. 003. The complete system stiffness as represented by the stiffness matrix used in this analysis must be considered to precisely determine the optimal tooth indexing position...|$|E
