This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892–94. [...] Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population.

50|$|The Otago skink {{has been}} {{assessed}} as Endangered by the IUCN, {{based on its}} very limited range and low total population. As of 2012 the Department of Conservation (DOC) has classified the Otago Skink as Nationally Critical under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, and research into conservation management is ongoing. Most threats to the species seem to derive from anthropogenic sources. Agriculture and mining have over time taken up much of its habitat, altering the landscape and removing food sources and cover. This was compounded {{by the introduction of}} mammalian predators. The Otago skink, having historically been exposed to only limited predation from native birds, was heavily impacted by the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>house</b> cats, rabbits, ferrets, and weasels in conjunction with the increasing lack of sheltering habitats.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} preserved {{material at}} the site also provide valuable information about diet, animal husbandry, and material culture. In particular, {{the large numbers of}} well-preserved animal remains are an important source of information on the nature and size of domesticated animals during the periods when they were sacrificed, including the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>house</b> cats from areas of Roman settlement into non-Roman Germanic areas. In part because of excavation problems, {{it is also one of}} the few inland Central European sites where remains of fish have been recovered: pike and some tench. In addition there are fragments of a fish trap and of hand nets and well-preserved harpoons and fish hooks consisting of a sharpened stick which was turned with a tug on the line after being swallowed in the bait. The site also yielded one of the earliest known Germanic bows and a five-hole weaving tablet.|$|R

5000|$|This {{romantic comedy}} of manners {{was written for}} Squire Bancroft and his wife Marie (née Wilton), {{managers}} of the Prince of Wales's Theatre, and starred Mrs. Bancroft. Gilbert wanted his friend John Hare to play the male lead, but the Bancrofts were not satisfied with him and cast Canadian Charles Francis Coghlan instead. [...] The Bancrofts had produced the best plays of Tom Robertson in the 1860s, and Sweethearts was Gilbert's tribute to Robertson's [...] "realist" [...] style. The importance of small incidents is emphasized, characters are revealed through [...] "small talk," [...] and what is left unsaid in the script are {{as important to the}} play as what is said in the dialogue. These are all Robertson trademarks, though they are not key features of Gilbert's other plays. However, the play combines sentiment with a typically Gilbertian sense of irony. The story of the play deals with themes such as the differences between men's and women's recollections of romantic episodes, and the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> developments to greenfield land.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the north}} eastern {{district}} {{was late in}} developing. In the 1830s, prospector John Davidson Smith bought the Whitehorse Manor from John Cator to sell off as 500 smaller plots. He then speculated on an ancient spring on {{the slope of the}} Norwood Hills. He commissioned the architect Decimus Burton to build the Beulah Spa pleasure gardens which were a popular attraction for 20 years. Thousands came from all over the south east to sample the waters. The area developed a reputation as a beauty spot, attracting much speculative attention. However, most of the south eastern area remained rural, with gypsy camps reported on the Whitehorse farm up until the 1850s. In the northern district the clay based soil meant that bricks were in plentiful supply and they were much used in local building. The Brickfields were let for two years in 1854, with half a million bricks up for sale and enough clay dug for a further million. Part of the northern district at Green Lane had been given by Archbishop Grindal to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he had been master. The college suddenly became eager to sell in the 1890s when the land value rose after adjacent development. Apparently it is: [...] "the only place where Pembroke has enjoyed that unearned increment through the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing,</b> which has helped to finance so many colleges." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} decade, housing {{construction}} in Mexico has increased dramatically, despite {{the economic and}} financial crises, {{it is one of}} the main drivers of the Mexican economy; the government has supported programs to develop social housing in order to assist low-income families. This type of initiatives has allowed low-income people to own a place to live, but it has also promoted the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> developments with house models of similar characteristics in the very diverse geographical and climatic zones of Mexico. Even though some of the dwellings have few differences depending on the region they belong to, they do not reflect climatic adaptations. The correct selection of the envelope materials is one of the first and most effective passive strategy that must be considered in the design of a housing. However, just selecting the materials by knowing their thermal properties is not enough to make an appropriate decision about the construction system. For this reason, we need a tool like Ener-Habitat, which allows a quick assessment of thermal and energy performance of a building system consisting of several layers, through the time-dependent calculation of heat transfer, suitable for high thermal mass materials, such as those generally used in Mexico and the climates of Mexico with high solar radiation and large temperature swing during the day. The study propose a method to analyze the cost and energy benefit of building systems, and as example analyzes some walls building systems, in a hot-dry climate city of Mexico, during the air conditioning season. This tool allows, at early stages of architectural design, quick assessments for decision taking on the building systems choice, in relation with better energy performance. Ener-Habitat was created by researchers from six academic institutions in Mexico and was funded by the National Council for Science and Technology and the Ministry of Energy of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{capacity}} to react quickly to species introductions and to plan effective management countermeasures is always difficult, and methodology is lacking. This paper summarizes the different {{steps of a}} decision-making protocol applied to the recent establishment of an exotic species, the House Sparrow Passer domesticus, in the Lesser Antilles. This pest bird damages crops, fruits and stored food products and also competes with numerous hole-nesting birds in {{a large part of}} its range, and this requires more or less rapid management decision to limit its impact. In order to construct a base for decision-making in the Lesser Antilles case, we designed and conducted a brief biological study involving three spatial scales. At the regional scale, we defined the state <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>House</b> Sparrows throughout the West Indies. At the island scale, we estimated the number and distribution of breeding colonies. At the local scale, we estimated the numbers and behaviour <b>of</b> <b>House</b> Sparrows. To enable a quick decision to be made, we also suggested organizing a collective decision-making process applying a multi-actor guideline taking account of the different kinds of actors and levels of competence. We applied this method and we presented our results to a multi-actor workshop. The collective decision-making chose to apply the precautionary principle on one island (bird eradication) and to install both communications and monitoring plans. The procedure involving both multi-spatial scale assessment and a multi-actor workshop needs to be refined but its prospects are promising. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSummary Objective Chagas {{disease is}} a major vector-borne {{parasitic}} disease in Latin America, primarily transmitted to humans by triatomine vectors. Non-domiciliated triatomine species such as Triatoma dimidiata in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, can transiently invade houses and are emerging as a major challenge to control Trypanosoma cruzi transmission to humans. We analyzed the spatio-temporal <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>house</b> infestation by T. dimidiata in four rural villages. Methods Triatomines were collected in four rural villages over a 2 years period, and the spatio-temporal patterns of infestation were analyzed. Results Triatomines were consistently more abundant at the periphery of villages than in centers, indicating a much higher risk of T. cruzi transmission at the periphery. Male T. dimidiata were found further {{in the center of}} the village, while females remained closer to the periphery, suggesting differential dispersal capabilities between sexes, although the timing of dispersal appeared identical. Surprisingly, infected females were consistently collected in houses much further from the surrounding bushes than non-infected females, while the distribution of males was unaffected by their T. cruzi infection status, suggesting an increased dispersal capability in infected females. Conclusion The spatial structure of infestation should be taken into account for the prioritization of vector control activities within villages, and spatially targeted interventions may be explored. A potential vector manipulation by T. cruzi, observed for the first time in triatomines, may favor parasite transmission to new hosts...|$|R
