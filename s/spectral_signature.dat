Merrill in California {{detected the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>signature</b> of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E

2500|$|Hyperspectral, {{as opposed}} to multispectral, {{processing}} gives the potential of improved <b>spectral</b> <b>signature</b> measurement from airborne and spaceborne sensor platforms. Sensors on these platforms, however, must compensate for atmospheric effects. Such compensation is easiest with high contrast targets sensed through well-behaved atmosphere with even, reliable illumination, the real world will not always be so cooperative. [...] For more complicated situations, one can not simply compensate for the atmospheric and illumination conditions by taking them out. The Invariant Algorithm for target detection was designed to find many possible combinations of these conditions for the image.|$|E

The Curiosity rover will perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between a geochemical and a biological origin.|$|E
40|$|Mixture {{processing}} of remotely sensed multispectral scanner data involves estimating the percent coverage of individual crops or species {{contained within the}} {{instantaneous field of view}} of the scanner. In recent years, various mixture processing algorithms have been proposed to solve the so-called 2 ̆ 2 mixture problem 2 ̆ 2. All of the proposed algorithms require, as inputs, the <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> of the various species observed. Often it is extremely difficult to obtain the required <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> of individual species. In this paper, two methods for obtaining the required <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> for a particular mixture model are considered. For the model considered, the <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> become signature vectors. The first method is based upon determination of the signature vectors such that a measure of the inconsistency between the mixture model and the observed data is minimized. The second method is based upon determination of the signature vectors such that the estimated mean percent coverage of individual species match apriori or ground truth estimates. The two methods proposed are applied to actual multispectral data in order to verify the concepts presented...|$|R

Overall reflectance of senescent leaves was {{higher than that of}} young leaves, as was the reflectance of leaves from trees growing in metal-enriched soils, as compared with leaves from the control area. However, the characteristic spectral features were not changed in either case.

2500|$|The <b>spectral</b> <b>signature</b> of {{hematite}} {{was seen}} on the planet Mars by the infrared spectrometer on the NASA Mars Global Surveyor ("MGS") and 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The mineral was seen in abundance at two sites [...] on the planet, the Terra Meridiani site, near the Martian equator at 0° longitude, and the Aram Chaos site near the Valles Marineris. Several other sites also showed hematite, e.g., Aureum Chaos. Because terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments or by aqueous alteration, this detection was scientifically interesting enough that {{the second of the}} two Mars Exploration Rovers was sent to a site in the Terra Meridiani region designated Meridiani Planum. In-situ investigations by the Opportunity rover showed a significant amount of hematite, much of it in the form of small spherules that were informally named [...] "blueberries" [...] by the science team. [...] Analysis indicates that these spherules are apparently concretions formed from a water solution.|$|E

40|$|Climate change {{occurs when}} the Earth's energy budget changes due to natural or {{possibly}} anthropogenic forcings. These forcings cause the climate system to adjust resulting in a new climate state that is warmer or cooler than the original. The key {{question is how to}} detect and attribute climate change. The inference of infrared <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> of climate change has been discussed in the literature for nearly 30 years. Pioneering work in the 1980 s noted that distinct <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> would be evident in changes in the infrared radiance emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere, and that these could be observed from orbiting satellites. Since then, a number of other studies have advanced the concepts of <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> of climate change. Today the concept of using <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> to identify and attribute atmospheric composition change is firmly accepted and is the foundation of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) satellite mission being developed at NASA. In this work, we will present an overview of the current climate change detection concept using climate model calculations as surrogates for climate change. Any future research work improving the methodology to achieve this concept will be valuable to our society...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of management plans developed {{for responding to}} coral disease outbreaks is limited {{due to the lack}} of rapid methods of disease diagnosis. In order to fulfill current management guidelines for responding to coral disease outbreaks, alternative methods that significantly reduce response time must be developed. Hyperspectral sensing has been used by various groups to characterize the <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> unique to asymptomatic and bleached corals. The 2010 combined bleaching and Caribbean yellow band disease outbreak in Puerto Rico provided a unique opportunity to investigate the <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> associated with bleached and Caribbean yellow band-diseased colonies of Orbicella faveolata for the first time. Using derivative and cluster analyses of hyperspectral reflectance data, the present study demonstrates the proof of concept that <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> can be used to differentiate between coral disease states. This method enhanced predominant visual methods of diagnosis by distinguishing between different asymptomatic conditions that are identical in field observations and photographic records. The ability to identify disease-affected tissue before lesions become visible could greatly reduce response times to coral disease outbreaks in monitoring efforts. Finally, <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> associated with the poorly understood Caribbean yellow band disease are presented to guide future research on the role of pigments in the etiology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Linear {{spectral}} unmixing is {{a popular}} tool in remotely sensed hyperspectral data interpretation. It aims at estimating the fractional abundances of pure <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> (also called as endmembers) in each mixed pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer. In many situations, {{the identification of the}} endmember signatures in the original data set may be challenging due to insufficient spatial resolution, mixtures happening at different scales, and unavailability of completely pure <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> in the scene. However, the unmixing problem can also be approached in semisupervised fashion, i. e., by assuming that the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear combinations of a number of pure <b>spectral</b> <b>signatures</b> known in advance (e. g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer). Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best mode...|$|R
