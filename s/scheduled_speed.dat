40|$|Scheduling diverse {{applications}} in large, shared clusters is particularly challenging. Recent research on cluster scheduling focuses either on <b>scheduling</b> <b>speed,</b> using sampling to quickly assign resources to tasks, or on scheduling quality, using centralized algorithms that {{search for the}} resources that improve both task performance and cluster utilization. We present Tarcil, a distributed scheduler that targets both <b>scheduling</b> <b>speed</b> and quality. Tarcil uses an analytically derived sampling framework that adjusts the sample size based on load, and provides statistical guarantees {{on the quality of}} allocated resources. It also implements admission control when sampling is unlikely to find suitable resources. This makes it appropriate for large, shared clusters hosting short- and long-running jobs. We evaluate Tarcil on clusters with hundreds of servers on EC 2. For highly-loaded clusters running short jobs, Tarcil improves task execution time by 41 % over a distributed, sampling-based scheduler. For more general scenarios, Tarcil achieves near-optimal performance for 4 × and 2 × more jobs than sampling-based and centralized schedulers respectively. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|In a {{simultaneous}} paired approach to closely-spaced parallel runways, {{a pair of}} aircraft flies in close proximity on parallel approach paths. The longitudinal separation between the aircraft must be maintained within a range that avoids wake encounters and, {{if one of the}} aircraft blunders, avoids collision. To increase operational availability, the approach procedure must accommodate a mixture of aircraft sizes and, consequently, approach speeds. In these procedures, the slower aircraft is placed in the lead position. The faster aircraft maintains separation from the slow aircraft in a dependent operation until final approach and flies independently afterward. Due to the higher approach speed of the fast aircraft, longitudinal separation will decrease during final approach. Therefore, the fast aircraft must position itself before the final approach so that it will remain within the safe range of separation as separation decreases. Given the approach geometry and speed schedule for each aircraft, one can use kinematics to estimate the separation loss between a pair of aircraft. A kinematic model can complement fast-time Monte-Carlo simulations of the approach by enabling a tailored reduction in the variation of starting position for the fast aircraft. One could also implement the kinematic model in ground-based or on-board decision support tools to compute the optimal initial separation for a given pair of aircraft. To better match the auto-coupled flight of real aircraft, the paper derives a kinematic model where the speed schedule is flown using equivalent airspeed. The predicted time of flight using the equivalent airspeed kinematic model compares well against a high-fidelity aircraft simulation performing the same approach. This model also demonstrates a modest increase in the predicted loss of separation when contrasted against a kinematic model that assumes the <b>scheduled</b> <b>speed</b> is true airspeed...|$|E

40|$|The {{competitive}} market will keep asking airlines for better services and lower prices, imposing pressure on costs. Therefore, {{it is important}} for an airline to establish operational standards that will allow an aircraft to be operated more efficiently. The implementation of the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index can represent significant operating cost reductions when compared to simply flying Fixed Speeds. Different aircraft models today are equipped with Flight Management Computers (FMC) that are capable of automatically calculating the Economic Speeds based on the Airline Cost Index. In the other hand, several aircraft types manufactured by world leading companies and flown by many airlines around the globe are equipped with FMCs that do not have this capability. Accordingly, this work focuses on the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index. More specifically, the Cost Index Methodology is discussed and its fundamentals are applied to the climb phase of the flight. Finally, a methodology for the generation of a practical guidance that allows the determination of the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedule</b> during the daily operation is presented, allowing an airline with a fleet equipped with FMCs not capable of automatically calculating the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedule</b> {{to take advantage of the}} potential operating cost reduction. The proposed methodology can be applied on the development of a calculation software to be installed on an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) or to be used for generating data to be sent directly to the flight crew in the cockpit through a Datalink System. In case an EFB or a Datalink System are not an alternative, the proposed methodology leads to the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedule</b> Table, a practical guidance that allows the flight crew to determine the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedule</b> for an Airline Cost Index and different conditions of aircraft weight, cruise altitude and speed, with corrections for temperature and wind variations. Since corrections for temperature and wind variations can be understood as a simplification that permits the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedules</b> to be presented through a table, it is necessary to investigate the impact of this simplification on the optimization. Therefore, the operating costs for an aircraft flying the Economic Climb <b>Speed</b> <b>Schedule</b> calculated for each specific condition is compared with that same aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the suggested Table.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new scheduling technique {{to improve the}} speed, power, and scalability of a dynamic scheduler. In a high-performance superscalar processor, the instruction scheduler comes with poor scalability and high complexity due to the inefficient and costly instruction wakeup operation. From simulation-based analyses, we find that 98 % of the wakeup activities are useless in the conventional wakeup logic. These useless activities consume {{a lot of power}} and slowdown the <b>scheduling</b> <b>speed.</b> To address this problem, the proposed technique schedules the instructions into the segmented issue window based on their wakeup addresses. During the wakeup process, the wakeup operation is only performed in the segment selected by the wakeup address of the result tag. The other segments are excluded from the wakeup operation to reduce the useless wakeup activities. The experimental results show that the proposed technique saves 50 - 61 % of the power consumption, reduces 42 - 76 % in the wakeup latency compared to the conventional design. 1...|$|R

40|$|A queue is {{required}} when a service provider {{is not able}} to handle jobs arriving over the time. In a highly flexible and dynamic environment, some jobs might demand for faster execution at run-time especially when the resources are limited and the jobs are competing for acquiring resources.

In such cases, it {{is required}} to accelerate (directly sending the job to the server) urgent jobs (requesting for speed up) ahead of other jobs present in the queue for an earlier completion of urgent jobs. Under the assumption of no additional resources, such acceleration of jobs would result in slowing down of other jobs present in the queue.
