40|$|The {{two most}} common forms of obesity {{management}} are currently behavioural and surgical interventions. This research {{aimed to explore}} the impact of behavioural and <b>surgical</b> interventions on <b>weight</b> loss outcome and to assess the mechanisms of change involved in this process {{with a focus on}} social cognitions, adaptive and maladaptive eating. The thesis consists of three studies which were designed using the Health Action Process Approach model as a theoretical framework. For study one a longitudinal design was adopted and data were collected from individuals undergoing behavioural and <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss interventions pre-treatment, at three months and six months post-treatment. Part one investigated the differences in social-cognitions between individuals undergoing behavioural and surgical interventions and parts two to four investigated predictors of adaptive and maladaptive eating and their role in weight loss. Building on this, study two used a qualitative design to investigate the long-term experience of patients undergoing surgery for weight loss with a particular focus on eating behaviour. Finally, study three was a Randomised Controlled Trial of a planning prompt to enhance weight reduction in individuals undergoing <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss interventions. Overall results showed that obese participants having either surgery or behavioural interventions vary along a number of different dimensions and that the roles of eating behaviours for the prediction of weight loss differ in these two populations. Not only does the mode of management influence the success of patient outcomes, but also the changes in the mechanisms necessary to bring about these outcomes. Based on the results of the studies it would seem that when trying to understand weight loss, a single model such as the HAP A although useful for study design, cannot be applied to all populations and that not only do the weightings given to different components vary between populations but also the associations between components and outcomes.

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obese people. Male sexual function after bariatric surgery is not well known. Aim: To compare male sexual function and sexual quality of life after <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss with controls seeking bariatric surgery. Material and methods : International Index of Erectile Function and Sexual Quality of Life-Male (SQoL-M) questionnaires were administered by e-mail to 152 men who had undergone weight-loss surgery. The control group consisted of 44 obese men who completed the questionnaires during their preoperative evaluation. Results : Fifty-six percent {{of men in the}} control group and 20 % of men in the postoperative group reported erectile dysfunction (ED) (OR = 5. 1; 95 % CI: 1. 6 – 16. 0, p = 0. 005).

40|$|The global {{pandemic}} {{of obesity}} continues to escalate worldwide {{and results in}} severe multisystem metabolic dysfunction in the expanding population of its sufferers. It {{is associated with the}} concurrent pathologies of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and sleep apnea, which have also increased in prevalence over the past decade. Obesity can be mapped in social networks and is recognised as a fundamental element of the metabolic syndrome contributing to the global burden of diabesity and oncobesity. Its impact on global health has resulted in a massive burden on healthcare services and is among the most prominent contributors to mounting healthcare costs. Despite its pathological impact, the non-surgical management of obesity through behavioural, lifestyle and pharmacotherapies has not offered dependable benefits in severely obese patients. Bariatric surgery has demonstrated consistent weight loss in morbidly obese subjects and is increasingly performed worldwide to treat morbid obesity. Furthermore, these operations may produce beneficial metabolic effects especially with respect to improvement in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Understanding <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss mechanisms and metabolic modulation is required to enhance patient benefits and operative outcomes. A surgical model of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was developed as an experimental platform to investigate the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The model was studied through a systems biology approach to characterize systemic and gastro-intestinal surgical metabolic modulation. Analysis of postoperative faecal samples from this rodent model revealed a powerful shift in gut microbial ecology and also highlighted the role of RYGB surgery in regulating the cross-talk between the gut microbiome and its mammalian host. Similar metabolic changes were also identified in human subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. Analysis of plasma and cardiac tissue revealed shifts in metabolic activity, reflected by enhanced cardiac energy metabolism. Overall, the results of this work identify some of the potential mechanisms behind bariatric <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss and systemic metabolic enhancement. This study not only supports the term metabolic surgery but also identifies the global multi-systemic benefits of bariatric surgical procedures. As such, the findings presented in this thesis may in future contribute to the enhancement of current bariatric procedures and the development of the next-generation of innovative metabolic therapies.

Although bariatric surgery is the predominant treatment for individuals with morbid obesity, implications of the <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss to the antioxidant balance and oxidative stress are not clarified yet. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss on caloric ingestion, sanguineous levels of vitamin C, â-carotene, vitamin E, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). A clinical study was realized in the University Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Catarina with a control group (GC) and a bariatric group (GB), both with 20 individuals. The mean age was 38 ± 11 years in both groups and Body Mass Index (BMI) was 22, 4 ± 2, 4 kg/m 2 and 48 ± 8, 7 kg/m 2, respectively. The GC was evaluated in only one moment and GB was evaluated before surgery (baseline), 3 and 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The caloric ingestion (3119 ± 799 to 1164 ± 429 calories/day) and MPO (384, 18 ± 18, 20 to 32, 79 ± 69, 20 mU/mL) significantly decreased in six after surgical months in relation to baseline. Moreover, the study showed an increase in vitamin C (0, 46 ± 0, 14 to 0, 76 ± 0, 35 mg/dL), â-carotene (0, 51 ± 0, 53 to 1, 72 ± 0, 23 ìM), vitamin E - corrected ratio - (0, 006 ± 0, 003 to 0, 013 ± 0, 007 ìmol/ mg), CAT (15, 98 ± 6, 41 to 24, 86 ± 9, 78 mmol H 2 O 2 / min/mL) and TBARS (14, 59 ± 2, 42 to 26, 89 ± 6, 70 nmol/ mL) in six after surgical months.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg•mˉ²) is increasing at an exponential rate. Currently, the most viable option {{for weight loss}} is bariatric surgery. Success following surgical procedure is guided by the individual's ability to make behavioral changes. A {{better understanding of the}} physical activity behavior of individuals who undergo bariatric surgery will enable the development of effective post-surgical exercise guidelines and interventions to enhance <b>surgical</b> <b>weight</b> loss outcomes. PURPOSE: To define the physical activity profile of subjects 2 - 5 years post bariatric surgery by examining the relationship between physical activity and weight loss. Additionally, this study examines the association between physical function, psychosocial correlates of physical activity, and weight loss. METHODS: Thirty-seven adults (percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) = 62. 15 ± 19. 93, age = 50. 76 ± 9. 99 years) participated. Subjects wore an activity monitor to measure their physical activity. Body height, weight, physical function, psychosocial variables of physical activity (self-efficacy, expected outcomes (benefits) and perceived barriers) and health related quality of life were measured. Assessment also included demographics, medical history, and dietary questionnaires. RESULTS: This study determined that subjects' who have undergone bariatric surgery participated in 205. 33 ± 136. 98 minutes per week of ≥ 3 METs for ≥ 1 minute bouts. The average dropped to 47. 56 ± 69. 84 minutes per week when including only bouts of 10 continuous minutes or more. Physical activity was correlated with %EWL (r= 0. 47, p=< 0. 01) and self-efficacy (r= 0. 39, p<= 0. 02), but not with physical function, expected outcomes (benefits), perceived barriers, or HRQOL. Physical function was correlated with %EWL (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The subjects' activity level failed to meet standards that have been shown necessary for weight maintenance. Those subjects that were more confident in their ability to exercise were more active and had more success losing weight. These findings suggest that behavioral interventions should include a strategy to address self-efficacy. The disparity between physical activity and physical function would suggest that subjects are capable of performing most exercise and mobility activities.
