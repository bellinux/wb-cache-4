The plan failed because the princess' magic knife <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> danger before she had imbibed the potion. Velent then exchanged the knife for an ordinary knife of his own making, but when the princess noticed that the new knife was {{much better than the}} old one, the disguised Velent was revealed.

25|$|In December 1673 Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque {{reported}} {{a vision of}} Christ in which Jesus <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart. After her death in 1690, the devotion was promoted by the Jesuits. Devotion to the two Hearts continued to spread in France. On Christmas Eve in 1800, amid the French Revolution, knowing they could face the guillotine for their actions, Peter Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie established the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary with a mission to spread the message of God's love manifested through the Hearts of Jesus and Mary and through the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Future {{members of the congregation}} included Saint Damien de Veuster of Molokai. By the beginning of the 19th century the devotion to the Immaculate Heart was sufficiently widespread in Europe for Pope Pius VII to allow a feast to honor it in 1805.|$|E
500|$|The {{two women}} arrived in San Francisco, where Wu's plans for {{graduate}} study changed after visiting the University of California, Berkeley. She met physicist Luke Chia-Liu Yuan, a grandson of Yuan Shikai (the first President of the Republic of China and self-proclaimed Emperor of China). Yuan <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> Radiation Laboratory, where [...] the director was Ernest O.

500|$|Peirce, who had {{originally}} sought {{a career in}} photography before moving into filmmaking, applied techniques she had learned into the film. She described the film's mood as [...] "artificial night". Director of Photography Jim Denault <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> work of photographer Jan Staller, whose long-exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using [...] "moonlight" [...] effects {{for most of the}} film. As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night, John Pirozzi, who had been experimenting with time-lapse photography using a non-motion-controlled moving camera, was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1937 {{progress}} was made in promoting the Divine Mercy and in November 1937 a pamphlet was published with the title Christ, King of Mercy. The pamphlet included the chaplet, the novena, and the litany of the Divine Mercy and the Divine Mercy image appeared on the cover, with the signature, [...] "Jesus I Trust in You". On 10 November 1937, Mother Irene, Faustina's superior, <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> booklets while Faustina rested in her bed.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{inspired}} by the film Ordinary People, Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. He <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> gun and bullets {{but she did not}} inform the police or mental health services. He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist but before it occurred he flew back to New York on December 6, 1980. At one point, he considered committing suicide by jumping from the Statue of Liberty. Chapman says the message [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill" [...] flashed on the TV at him and was also on a wall hanging put up by his wife in their apartment. On the night before the murder, Chapman and his wife discussed on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.|$|E
2500|$|After reigning {{almost twenty}} years, working {{at least ten}} hours a day, Christina had what some have {{interpreted}} as a nervous breakdown. She suffered with high blood pressure, complained about bad eyesight and pain in her neck. Grégoire François Du Rietz, since 1642 the court physician, was called when she suddenly collapsed in 1651. In February 1652 the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths and healthy meals, as opposed to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five, and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments. For years, Christina knew by heart all the sonnets from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> 16erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. She now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 [...] "laden in riches and curses".|$|E

2500|$|His sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, {{claims that}} the King did {{participate}} in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 {{and that there were}} several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: [...] "It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things to far. It is said that the trips to Svartsjö Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but {{it is what it is}} said. I could tell you a million things about this." [...] In 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.|$|E
