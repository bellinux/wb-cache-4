40|$|ABSTRACT: Soils {{of a large}} {{tropical}} {{area with}} differentiated landscapes cannot be treated uni-formly for ecological applications. We intend to develop a framework based on physiography {{that can be used}} in regional applications. The study region occupies more than 1. 1 million km 2 and is located at the junction of the savanna region of Central Brazil and the Amazon forest. It includes a portion of the high sedimentary Central Brazil plateau and large areas of mostly peneplained crystalline shield on the border of the wide inner-Amazon low sedimentary plain. A first broad subdivision was made into landscape regions followed by a more detailed subdivi-sion into soil regions. Mapping information was extracted from soil survey maps at scales of 1 : 250000 - 1 : 500000. <b>Soil</b> <b>units</b> were integrated within a homogenized legend using a set of selected attributes such as taxonomic term, the texture of the B horizon and the associated vegetation. For each region, a detailed inventory of the <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> with their area distribution was elaborated. Ten landscape regions and twenty-four soil regions were recognized and delineated. Soil cover of a region is normally characterized by a cluster composed of many <b>soil</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Soil</b> diversity is comparable in the landscape and the soil regions. Composition of the soil cover is quantitatively expressed in terms of area extension of the <b>soil</b> <b>units.</b> Such geographic divisions characterized by grouping <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> and their spatial estimates must be used for regional eco-logical applications...|$|R

40|$|During {{november}} 2008, {{intense and}} concentrated rainfall occurred causing numerous mass movements, changing significantly the morphology of valleys and slopes and reaching directly {{the population of}} the municipalities of Vale do Itajaí. In forecasting natural disasters, geotechnical mapping, associated with a GIS and laboratory tests, composes an important tool in identifying factors and processes involved in the destabilization of slopes. In this sense, the present paper proposes the creation of a preliminary geotechnical mapping to identify the geotechnical units more susceptible to the occurrence of mass movements in the watershed of Ribeirão Baú, located at the city of Ilhota, Santa Catarina state. Using the methodology developed by Davison Dias (1995), which seeks to estimate from geological, soil and topographic data the <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> with similar geomechanical behavior, nine geotechnical <b>units</b> were <b>estimated.</b> From all the geotechnical <b>units</b> <b>estimated,</b> it can be noteworthy the units Cambisol with substrate of sandstone, that was affected by 311 mass movements, and the most affected, the Cambisol with substrate gneiss unit, reached in 6, 5 % of its total area by 315 mass movements, which corresponds to a greater magnitude and number of mass movements events due to its thick mantle of weathering and extensive network of fractures and faults.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential of remote sensing data for mapping wide areas of different <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> within the arid environment. Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data were analyzed to determine how well they enable us to discriminate different <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> in Central Saudi Arabia (A 1 -Qasseem). Processing and analyzing the TM data indicated that maximum discrimination of all <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> in this study area is provided by the use of a Selective Principal Component transformation, with the use of such imagery up to 90 % of the mapped <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> can be differentiated. This study shows that there is an agreement between soil maps made by traditional soil survey at regional and reconnaissance levels for certain areas and the Landsat TM image. This agreement may be due to a number of factors which include: 1) Scale similarity. 2) The studied soil profile is homogeneous throughout or derived from unique parent material. 3) The base map in traditional soil survey is derived from photo interpretation which considers the landforms as a base in discriminating various mapping units. In general, Landsat TM data can be regarded as an effective tool to be used as a base map for regional and reconnaissance soil survey...|$|R

40|$|Near surface {{geophysics}} such as {{electromagnetic induction}} (EMI), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) are widely used for field characterization, to delineate <b>soil</b> <b>units,</b> and to <b>estimate</b> <b>soil</b> texture, bulk densities and/or soil water contents. Hereby, the measured soil apparent conductivity (ECa) is often used. Soil ECa is governed by horizontal and vertical changes in soil texture, mineralogy, soil water content, and temperature, and the single contributions {{are not easy to}} disentangle. Within single fields and between fields fertilization management may vary spatially, which holds especially for field trials. As a result, ECa might vary due to differences in electrolyte concentration and subsequent pore fluid conductivity, but secondary fertilization effects might also {{play a major role in}} ECa differences such as differences in soil water uptake by growing plants. To study the direct effect of mineral fertilization on ECa, a field experiment was performed on 21 bare soil plots each of a size of 9 m 2, where 7 different fertilization treatments were established in triplicates. As mineral fertilizers, commercial calcium ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride were chosen and applied in dosages of 200, 400, and 2000 kg ha- 1 N equivalent. Additionally, soil water, soil temperature, and EC were recorded in a pit at different depths using commercial sensors. Changes in ECa were measured every 10 days using EMI and monthly using GPR and ERT. Additionally, soil samples were monthly taken at all plots and nitrate, chloride, and potassium contents were measured in the lab. The poster will show the effect of ECa changes due to fertilization and corresponding leaching of the fertilized elements over time. The experimental results provide information of how fertilization is influencing ECa readings and how long the fertilizers are influencing ECa measurements with geophysical instruments. This study helps to overcome restricted interpretation of ECa measurements on managed agricultural soils...|$|R

40|$|Current soil maps contain {{qualitative}} attributes {{which are}} challenging to integrate into agronomic models or decision support systems. In this paper, {{a new approach}} is proposed that will enable the use of soil maps as a suitable information system of soils hydrostructural properties for agronomic and environmental models. This enhancement is possible through a new methodology for characterizing the <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> {{on the basis of}} the multi-scale soil-water functionality of the pedon which is a representative <b>soil</b> mapping <b>unit</b> delineated by pedologists according to the geomorphology. The hydro-functional mapping <b>units</b> should represent <b>soil</b> mapping <b>units</b> that are theoretically homogenous from the perspective of the pedostructure parameters of the pedon. For the purpose of this study, the Haggerty-Cox property, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA was selected. The soil data "soil mapping units and physical characteristics" of the study area were obtained from SSURGO. Due to time and cost constraints, the research was restricted to three SSURGO <b>soil</b> <b>units</b> (SwA, Starks-Fincastle complex with 0 - 2 % slope: MsC 2, Miami silt loam, 6 - 12 % slopes: and HoA, Hononegah fine sandy loam with 0 - 2 % slopes) to check their spatial homogeneity according to the pedostructure parameters (PS). The discriminant statistical analysis for the area of study shows that the PS parameters are unique for each <b>soil</b> mapping <b>unit</b> and can be effectively used to characterize these units and validate their delineation. The resulting hydro-functional <b>soil</b> mapping <b>units</b> match SSURGO units but have additional physical attributes. In general, subsurface horizons (B) are more distinguishable than surface horizons (Ap), and using pedostructure parameters from both potential and shrinkage curves gives the highest distinguishing value. Results confirm that the pedostructure parameters are discriminant characteristics of the hydrostructural functioning of soils as delineated by pedologists. Having the hydro-functional <b>soil</b> mapping <b>units</b> will assist in the decision support system data analysis, which in turn, will allow for the prediction of water and chemical transport and interactions...|$|R
