The aim of this study, which was conducted over a period of 18 months in three Yucatec Mayan communities, is to better understand the selection criteria for medicinal plants. An important group of selection criteria are the flavor and aroma of plants. The absence of smell or taste indicates that the taxon has no potential medical value. Medicinal plants are more often considered to be sweet or aromatic (to smell good) or astringent, while a similar percentage of medicinal and nonmedicinal plants are considered bitter, spicy, acidic, or bad smelling. The relationship between the ethnobotanical data obtained for the individual <b>plants</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> (natural products) prominent in each species is specifically addressed in this paper.

40|$|In {{the seeds}} of Hevea brasiliensis, the cyanogenic monoglucoside {{linamarin}} (2 -β-d-glucopyranosyloxy- 2 -methylpropionitrile) is accumulated in the endosperm. After onset of germination, the cyanogenic diglucoside linustatin (2 -[6 -β-d-glucosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]- 2 - methylpropionitrile) is formed and exuded from the endosperm of Hevea seedlings. At {{the same time the}} content of cyanogenic monoglucosides decreases. The linustatin-splitting diglucosidase and the β-cyanoalanine synthase that assimilates HCN, exhibit their highest activities in the young seedling at this time. Based on these observations the following pathway for the in vivo mobilization and metabolism of cyanogenic glucosides is proposed: storage of monoglucosides (in the endosperm) —glucosylation—transport of the diglucoside (out of the endosperm into the seedling) —cleavage by diglucosidase—reassimilation of HCN to noncyanogenic compounds.

40|$|The {{relative}} carbon isotope content (δ 13 C value) in each {{position of}} glucose from a C 4 plant (maize starch) and a C 3 plant (sugar beet sucrose) {{has been determined}} by stepwise chemical and biochemical degradation of the molecule and stable isotope ratio measurement of the fragments. The suitability of the degradation methods has been tested through their chemical yield and isotope balance.

Most prominent was a relative 13 C enrichment by 5 to 6 δ-units in position 4 and a depletion by about 5 δ-units in carbon 6. As possible reasons for these nonstatistical isotope distributions, isotope effects of the aldolase, the triose phosphate isomerase, and the transketolase reactions during carbohydrate biosynthesis are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: Photosensitivity {{in animals}} {{is defined as}} a severe {{dermatitis}} that results from a heightened reactivity of skin cells and associated dermal tissues upon their exposure to sunlight, following ingestion or contact with UV reactive <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products.</b> Photosensitivity occurs in animal cells as a reaction that is mediated by a light absorbing molecule, specifically in this case a plant-produced metabolite that is heterocyclic or polyphenolic. In sensitive animals, this reaction is most severe in non-pigmented skin which has the least protection from UV or visible light exposure. Photosensitization in a biological system such as the epidermis is an oxidative or other chemical change in a molecule in response to light-induced excitation of endogenous or exogenously-delivered molecules within the tissue. Photo-oxidation can also occur in the plant itself, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species, free radical damage and eventual DNA degradation. Similar cellular changes occur in affected herbivores and are associated with an accumulation of photodynamic molecules in the affected dermal tissues or circulatory system of the herbivore.

40|$|In many cases, <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> {{accumulate}} {{in the large}} central vacuole of plant cells. However, the mechanisms involved in the transport of secondary compounds are only poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transport mechanisms for the major barley (Hordeum vulgare) flavonoid saponarin (apigenin 6 -C-glucosyl- 7 -O-glucoside) are different in various plant species: Uptake into barley vacuoles occurs via a proton antiport and is competitively inhibited by isovitexin (apigenin 6 -C-glucoside), suggesting that both flavone glucosides are recognized by the same transporter. In contrast, the transport into vacuoles from Arabidopsis, which does not synthesize flavone glucosides, displays typical characteristics of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Transport of saponarin into vacuoles of both the species is saturable with a Km of 50 to 100 μm. Furthermore, the uptake of saponarin into vacuoles from a barley mutant exhibiting a strongly reduced flavone glucoside biosynthesis is drastically decreased {{when compared with the}} parent variety. Thus, the barley vacuolar flavone glucoside/H+ antiporter could be modulated by the availability of the substrate. We propose that different vacuolar transporters may be responsible for the sequestration of species-specific/endogenous and nonspecific/xenobiotic secondary compounds in planta...|$|R
40|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{influences}} {{a multitude of}} processes during stress response, but also potently affects the immune system, glucose metabolism, electrolyte or water homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. According to the present understanding, the adrenal cortex is tightly controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This axis involves hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which determine processes of adrenocortical growth and function. However, control of the adrenal gland comprises a plethora of additional endogenous or exogenous factors. Among those are diverse hormones, psychosocial parameters, physiological stress, <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> or even environmental pollutants.

Effective chemical control of the CLM is limited as the feeding larvae are protected by the leaf cuticle mainly in mines of immature foliage and the pupal stage is also protected by the rolled leaf margins (Jones 2001; Beattie 2004). Several pressures as pesticide resistance has accelerated the search for safe environmentally, toxicologically, selective and efficacious pesticides (Weinzierl and Henn 1991; Dias et al. 2005; Amiri-Besheli 2008, 2009). Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides controlling major insect pests. Botanicals are a promising source of pest control compounds. The pool of plants possessing insecticidal substances is enormous (FAO 1992; Jacobson 1989). These have generated remarkable interest in recent years as potential sources of natural insect control agents. Over 2000 species of plants are known to possess different degrees of insecticidal activity (Jacobson 1975).

Thus the ability to scavenge free radicals in order to minimize oxidative damage to living cells is very important. The hexane extract of Acalypha hispida (Burn F.) was screened for phytochemical constitu-ents and was found to contain flavonoids, carbohydrates, phenols and alkaloids. Fractions ob-tained from chromatographic separation were screened for free radical scavenging activities using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide. Out of the six-teen pooled fractions (S 1 -S 16) screened, compounds S 10 (91. 8 %), S 11 (93. 8 %), S 14 (92. 5 %) and S 15 (91. 4 %) at a concentration of 0. 1 mg/ml had significant antioxidant activities when compared to the known antioxidant ascorbic acid (90. 9 %).

40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) serves {{not only}} as a high energy carbon {{compound}} in glycolysis, but it acts also as precursor for plastidial anabolic sequences like the shikimate pathway, which produces aromatic amino acids (AAA) and subsequently <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products.</b> After conversion to pyruvate, PEP can also enter de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids, and the non-mevalonate way of isoprenoid production. As PEP cannot be generated by glycolysis in chloroplasts and a variety of non-green plastids, it has to be imported from the cytosol by a phosphate translocator (PT) specific for PEP (PPT). A loss of function of PPT 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana results in the chlorophyll a/b binding protein underexpressed 1 (cue 1) mutant, which is characterised by reticulate leaves and stunted roots. Here we dissect the shoot- and root phenotypes, and also address the question whether or not long distance signalling by metabolites is involved in the perturbed mesophyll development of cue 1. Reverse grafting experiments showed that the shoot- and root phenotypes develop independently from each other, ruling out long distance metabolite signalling. The leaf phenotype could be transiently modified even in mature leaves, e. g. by an inducible PPT 1 RNAi approach or by feeding aromatic amino acids (AAA), the cytokinin trans-zeatin (tZ), or the putative signalling molecule dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DCG). Hormones, such as auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, ethylene, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid did not rescue the cue 1 leaf phenotype. The low cell density 1 (lcd 1) mutant shares the reticulate leaf-, but not the stunted root phenotype with cue 1. It could neither be rescued by AAA nor by tZ. In contrast, tZ and AAA further inhibited root growth both in cue 1 and wild-type plants.

40|$|The {{wavelength}} dependent {{interaction of}} biological systems with radiation is commonly described by appropriate action spectra. Particularly effective plant responses are obtained for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Excess shortwave UV-B radiation will induce genetic defects and plant damage. Besides the ecological {{discussion of the}} deleterious effects of the excess UV radiation there is increasing interest in horticultural applications of this spectral region. Several metabolic pathways leading to valuable <b>secondary</b> <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> like colors, odors, taste, or resulting in mechanical strength and vitality are triggered by UV radiation. Thus, in ecologically {{as well as in}} economically oriented experiments the exact generation and knowledge of the spectral irradiance, particularly near the UV absorption edge, is essential. The ideal filter 'material' to control the UV absorption edge would be ozone itself. However, due to problems in controlling the toxic and chemically aggressive, instable gas, only rather 'small ozone filters' have been realized so far. In artificial plant lighting conventional solid filter materials such as glass sheets and plastic foils (celluloseacetate or cellulosetriacetate) which can be easily handled have been used to absorb the UV-C and the excess shortwave UV-B radiation of the lamp emissions. Different filter glasses are available which provide absorption properties suitable for gradual changes of the spectral UV-B illumination of artificial lighting. Using a distinct set of lamps and filter glasses an acceptable simulation of the UV-B part of natural global radiation can be achieved. The aging of these and other filter materials under the extreme UV radiation in the lamphouse of a solar simulator is presently unavoidable. This instability can be dealt with only by a precise spectral monitoring and by replacing the filters accordingly. For this reason attempts would be useful to develop real ozone filters which can replace glass filters. In any case chamber experiments require a careful selection of the filter material used and must be accompanied by a continuous UV-B monitoring...|$|R

Glycolysis as the main route for PEP production involves the enzymatic sequence of 3 -phosphoglycerate to PEP conversion catalyzed by phosphoglyceromutase (PGyM) and enolase (ENO). However, biochemical studies indicate that chloroplasts and a number of non-green plastids lack ENO and/or PGyM. The present study shows for the first time, the identification and functional characterization of the putative plastid localized ENO (ENO 1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The effect of a deficiency in PEP provision to plastids was investigated with the aid of double mutants defective in ENO 1 and PPT 1. Crosses between different alleles of eno 1 and the chlorophyll a/b binding protein underexpressed (cue 1) mutant defective in PPT 1 could not be obtained as double homozygous lines due to partial lethality of the gametophytes and constraints in sporophyte development, including a largely reduced oil production in the seeds, thus highlighting the essential role of PEP in plastids. The heterozygous eno 1 mutants in the homozygous cue 1 background (cue 1 /eno 1 [+/-]) revealed an aberrant segregation pattern, retarded vegetative growth and disturbed flower development attributed to a reduced ENO 1 gene dosage. Constitutive overexpression of ENO 1 could rescue the reticulate leaf and the stunted root phenotype of cue 1 and alleviate the diminished seed and oil production in the mutant. In contrast, wild-type plants overexpressing ENO 1 alone, could not improve seed quality and oil content...|$|R

The functional properties of BpUGT 94 B 1 were investigated using protein modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, {{and analysis of the}} substrate specificity of isolated wild-type and mutated forms of BpUGT 94 B 1. A single unique arginine residue (R 25) positioned outside the conserved <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>product</b> glycosyltransferase region was identified as crucial for the activity with UDP-glucuronic acid. The mutants R 25 S, R 25 G, and R 25 K all exhibited only 0. 5 % to 2. 5 % of wild-type activity with UDP-glucuronic acid, but showed a 3 -fold increase in activity with UDP-glucose. The model of BpUGT 94 B 1 also enabled identification of key residues in the acceptor pocket. The mutations N 123 A and D 152 A decreased the activity with cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside to less than 15 % of wild type. The wild-type enzyme activity toward delphinidin- 3 -O-glucoside was only 5 % to 10 % of the activity with cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside. Independent point mutations of three residues positioned near the acceptor B ring were introduced to increase the activity toward delphinidin- 3 -O-glucoside. In all three mutant enzymes, the enzymatic activity toward both acceptors was reduced to less than 15 % of wild type. The model of BpUGT 94 B 1 allowed for correct identification of catalytically important residues, within as well as outside the <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>product</b> glycosyltransferase motif, determining sugar donor and acceptor specificity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 4 -Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4 CL) is a {{key enzyme}} of general phenylpropanoid {{metabolism}} which provides the precursors for a large variety of important <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>products,</b> such as lignin, flavonoids, or phytoalexins. To identify amino acids important for 4 CL activity, eight mutations were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana At 4 CL 2. Determination of specific activities and Km values for ATP and caffeate of the heterologously expressed and purified proteins identified four distinct classes of mutants: enzymes {{with little or no}} catalytic activity; enzymes with greatly reduced activity but wild-type Km values; enzymes with drastically altered Km values; and enzymes with almost wild-type properties. The latter class includes replacement of a cysteine residue which is strictly conserved in 4 CLs and had previously been assumed to be directly involved in catalysis. These results substantiate the close relationship between 4 CL and other adenylate-forming enzymes such as luciferases, peptide synthetases, and fatty acyl-CoA synthetases...|$|R

Significant increases in both growth and secondary product accumulation have been observed, upon incubation with phytohormones, in some species. Consequently, {{the use of}} phytohormones in vitro has received increasing attention as a potential means for increasing those <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>products</b> notoriously produced in small quantities.

Efforts to increase the amount of artemisinin via chemical synthesis or fieldgrown crops have met with huge costs and disappointingly low yields, respectively. Agrobacterium transformed hairy root cultures of A. annua (Clone YUT 16) produce artemisinin and undergo rapid growth compared to non-transformed, making them a good model system to study secondary metabolite production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Flavonol glucosides {{constitute}} {{the second group}} of secondary metabolites that accumulate in Crocus sativus stigmas. To date there are no reports of functionally characterized flavonoid glucosyltransferases in C. sativus, despite {{the importance of these}} compounds as antioxidant agents. Moreover, their bitter taste makes them excellent candidates for consideration as potential organoleptic agents of saffron spice, the dry stigmas of C. sativus. Results Using degenerate primers designed to match the <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>product</b> glucosyltransferase (PSPG) box we cloned a full length cDNA encoding CsGT 45 from C. sativus stigmas. This protein showed homology with flavonoid glucosyltransferases. In vitro reactions showed that CsGT 45 catalyses the transfer of glucose from UDP_glucose to kaempferol and quercetin. Kaempferol is the unique flavonol present in C. sativus stigmas and the levels of its glucosides changed during stigma development, and these changes, are correlated with the expression levels of CsGT 45 during these developmental stages. Conclusion Findings presented here suggest that CsGT 45 is an active enzyme that plays a role in the formation of flavonoid glucosides in C. sativus. </p...|$|R

Until recently however, much less was known about SDG and its monoglucoside (SMG) biosynthesis. Lately, flax UGT 74 S 1 was identified and characterized as an enzyme sequentially glucosylating secoisolariciresinol (SECO) into SMG and SDG when expressed in yeast. However, the amino acids critical for UGT 74 S 1 glucosyltransferase activity were unknown. A 3 D structural modeling and docking, site-directed mutagenesis of five amino acids in the <b>plant</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>product</b> glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motif, and enzyme assays were conducted. UGT 74 S 1 appeared to be structurally similar to the Arabidopsis thaliana UGT 72 B 1 model. The ligand docking predicted Ser 357 and Trp 355 as binding to the phosphate and hydroxyl groups of UDP-glucose, whereas Cys 335, Gln 337 and Trp 355 were predicted to bind the 7 -OH, 2 -OCH 3 and 17 -OCH 3 of SECO.
