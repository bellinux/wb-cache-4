40|$|Offline {{handwriting}} recognition systems require cropped text line images for both training and recognition. On the one hand, the annotation of position and transcript <b>at</b> <b>line</b> <b>level</b> is costly to obtain. On the other hand, automatic line segmentation algorithms {{are prone to}} errors, compromising the subsequent recognition. In this paper, we propose a modification of the popular and efficient multi-dimensional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. More particularly, we replace the collapse layer transforming the two-dimensional representation into a sequence of predictions by a recurrent version which can recognize one <b>line</b> <b>at</b> a time. In the proposed model, a neural network performs a kind of implicit line segmentation by computing attention weights on the image representation. The experiments on paragraphs of Rimes and IAM database yield results that are competitive with those of networks trained <b>at</b> <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> and constitute a significant step towards end-to-end transcription of full documents...|$|R

Such amplification is performed by a device known as a preamplifier or [...] "preamp", which boosts the signal to <b>line</b> <b>level.</b> After manipulation <b>at</b> <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> signals are then typically sent to a power amplifier, where they are amplified to levels that can drive headphones or loudspeakers.

Exploiting the knowledge embedded in emails with automatic tools is challenging, due to the unstructured, noisy and mixed language nature of this communication medium.

We present an approach to classify email content <b>at</b> <b>line</b> <b>level.</b> Our technique classifies email lines in five categories (i. e., text, junk, code, patch, and stack trace) to allow one to subsequently apply ad hoc analysis techniques for each category.
