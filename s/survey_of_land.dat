5|$|Under Henry's son, King Richard I, a {{new land}} tax was collected, {{the first since}} 1162. It was {{organised}} by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England {{who was in charge}} of governing England while the king was gone. Like the geld, the carucage was based on the amount of land owned, thus targeting free men rather than serfs, who owned no land and were therefore exempt. First collected in 1194, and the first land tax collected in England since the geld, carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or carucates (a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight-ox plough-team in a year, which was normally considered equivalent to a hide). The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey, a <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> holdings in England that was completed by 1087.|$|E

25|$|The system largely {{consisted}} of land assignments {{from the state}} in return for military services. Land was assessed by the periodic rawk (cadastral survey), which {{consisted of}} a <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> parcels (measured by feddan units), assessment of land quality and the annual estimated tax revenue of the parcels, and classification of a parcel's legal status as waqf (trust) or iqtaʿ. The rawk surveys organized the iqtaʿ system and the first rawk {{was carried out in}} 1298 under Sultan Lajin. A second and final rawk was completed in 1315 under Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad and influenced political and economic developments of the Mamluk Sultanate until its fall in the early 16th century.|$|E

2500|$|Fox {{insisted that}} no <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> around Parihaka {{should take place}} until the {{commission}} had made a report. Bryce agreed that central Taranaki would not be entered, apart from the completion of necessary road repairs. In April, however, he found just such a necessity, directing that 550 armed soldiersmostly unemployed men newly recruited {{with the promise of}} free landwould begin [...] "repairing" [...] a new road that would lead directly to Parihaka. His force marched from Oeo to set up camp near Parihaka. A stockade and camp were established at Rahotu, a redoubt and blockhouse at Pungarehu and an armed camp at Waikino to the north. The land around Parihaka began to be surveyed and work began, from both northern and southern approaches, on a coast road between New Plymouth and Hawera. Apart from offering food to the soldiers, Māori continued their daily life as if the surveyors did not exist. In its 1996 report on Taranaki land confiscations, the Waitangi Tribunal noted that Bryce was a Taranaki war veteran who [...] "clearly retained his relish of warfare ... on his own admission, he had always desired a march on Parihaka in order to destroy it." [...] The tribunal claimed his later actions were [...] "so provocative that, in our view, he was also endeavouring to recreate hostilities." ...|$|E
