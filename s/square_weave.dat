40|$|An {{analytical}} model is {{developed for the}} acoustic impedance of a composite made of a fine screen bonded to a perforated plate, the resistance having been modeled using steady flow theory and data, and including both linear and nonlinear components. The model of the screen resistance alone is derived first, and it is then extended to include a perforated plate bonded to the screen. Quantities such as effective open ratio and pressure recovery are evaluated. Conclusions are presented, including: (1) when the screen is bonded to a perforated plate, the linear resistance increases as the inverse of the perforate open area, (2) the nonlinearity in the screen resistance depends on {{the square of the}} screen wire diameter, and (3) when the resistance is considered as a function of approach velocity, the screen nonlinear term increases as the inverse of the square of the perforated plate open area ratio. The general theory can be applied to any screen structure, but final results are limited to a twilled <b>square</b> <b>weave</b> screen. Results {{can be applied to the}} study of sound absorbing materials used for lining the walls of aircraft engine duct suppressors...|$|E

40|$|As {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} used for primary structures in commercial aircrafts, {{it is necessary}} to understand damage initiation for composites subject to low velocity impacts from service conditions, maintenance, and other ground equipment mishaps. In particular, collisions with ground vehicles can present a wide area, blunt impact. Therefore, the effects of bluntness of an impactor are of interest as this is related to both the external visual detectability of an impact event, as well as the development of internal damage in the laminate. The objective of this investigation is to determine the effect of impactor radius on the initiation of damage to composite panels. A pendulum impactor was used to strike 200 mm <b>square</b> <b>woven</b> glass/epoxy composite plates of 3. 18 mm and 6. 35 mm thicknesses. Hemispherical steel tips with radius 12. 7 mm to 152. 4 mm were mounted to a piezoelectric force sensor which measures the contact force history. Impacts were conducted with and without rubber bumpers to mimic the bumpers used on ground vehicles. Strain gauges were mounted to select panels. Experimental data show distinct threshold energy for the onset of delamination and fiber breakage. These energy levels increase with increasing tip radius. Strain increases with decreasing tip radius. Strains at the panel center are less affected by the presence of rubber bumpers with increasing tip radius. Finite element simulations match the experimentally measured contact force and strain data. Curved FE panels show peak contact forces independent of impactor radius and incident angle. In-plane compressive stresses decrease with increasing radius tips and incident angl...|$|R

40|$|The tensile, {{ballistic}} and puncture {{impact behavior}} of woven fabric {{have been subject}} of interests for many researchers. The tensile behavior of woven fabric can be analyzed from the experimental and analytical methodologies. While experiment provides accurate information about woven fabric’s mechanical properties than the analytical approach, it also generates sample wastage. Finite element analysis (FEA) method is used to model uniaxial tensile, impact and puncture response of woven fabrics in two and three dimensional geometrical model shapes. Woven fabrics models sizes are based on either unit cell or meso-scale (large scale) approach. Nevertheless, limited publications address woven fabric models in terms of weave repeat sizes. Finite element analysis {{has the ability to}} represent fabric geometrical properties and their symmetries, with weave mesh structures able to be made as close as possible, with minimal assumptions. Other than ballistic impact performance, limited work is done to model tensile performance of aramid based woven fabrics. In addition to that, many publications neglect the weaves structures influences such as float and yam crimp to tensile and puncture impact behavior. Hence, in the study, an alternative simulation procedure was proposed to develop the understanding and prediction of float and yam crimp relationship in uniaxial tensile and puncture impact behavior of isotropic weave repeat unit. Woven fabric geometrical models were developed with TexGen and Abaqus CAD pre-processor module. The study was divided into three critical stages. Initially, FEA models were established on plain 1 / 1, 2 / 2 twill and 8 ends satin. Woven fabrics were configured as a balanced weave thereby allowing systematic investigation o f the effect of uniaxial tensile stress on the weave. Woven fabrics were designed to have equivalent densities 8 yams cm' 1 for all three weaves. Equivalent woven fabric specifications were manufactured and tested. Stress-strain validation between experimental and simulation results were made. Next, puncture impact models were developed based on the validated uniaxial tensile simulation models framework and its selected assumptions. Woven fabric for puncture simulation was expanded to consider larger model size than the previous uniaxial tensile model. Here, puncture model analysis was developed with 7 ends and picks cm with a total of 112 yams in both directions. Similar in uniaxial tensile approach, validation analysis was made between puncture model and experimental stress-strain result. Parameters studies were executed on the validated puncture models. The effects of yam frictions and impactor shapes to puncture models stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution were analyzed. The stress-strain behavior of woven fabrics was found to be related to woven fabric structures. In uniaxial tensile validation, the presence of float in woven fabrics had contributed to stronger <b>square</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics in both warp and weft directions. The apparent gap was more pronounced in puncture model validation than uniaxial tensile model validation. The parameters studies results had shown that flat impactor shape and tightest yam to yam frictions contributed to highest stress-strain, post-impact kinetic energy and damage evolution results. Both uniaxial tensile strength and puncture impact present analogous non-linearity behavior in stress-strain result, which indicated the crimp interchange and yam extension presence in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (November 23, 1890 – December 30, 1941), {{better known}} as El Lissitzky, was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, {{typographer}} and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian Avant Garde who helped develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich. His work greatly influenced the Constructivist movement and {{would go on to}} dominate 20 th century graphic design, especially through his influence on the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. (Re) building some of El Lissitzky's output as virtual artifacts constituted my contribution to a collaborative Second Life venture which was part of a large exhibition that was held in the Spring of 2014 in the Manege Museum in Moscow. The conceptualizers of the project, filmmaker Peter Greenaway and artist Saskia Boddeke, were supported by the British Council to create a mega-exhibit by combining film, animation and 3 D virtual world technology that were brought together to create a unified atmospheric setting which drew the viewer into the period of the Russian avant-garde. More than 1, 000 artworks, borrowed from galleries and private collections around the world, were displayed across 5000 <b>square</b> metres, <b>woven</b> together with a gigantic polyscreen installation which combined real and virtual film footage that also featured our Second Life collaboration. Having long been a great admirer of El Lissitzky's oeuvre, when I was invited by Saskia Boddecke to contribute to their project, I immediately asked her whether it would be possible for me to concentrate exclusively on his output - a proposal to which she had no objection to. The result were three different projects that in two cases were almost exact replicas of El Lissitzky's work (for which the needed permissions were obtained by the exhibition's organizers in Russia), and one of which was more of an interpretation based upon his original output.

However, multi-tube designs {{were found to be}} energetically more effective than single tubes at similar foam filler densities, proving a higher interaction effect in multi-tube designs. Empty composite and empty hybrid tubes crushed predominantly in progressive crushing mode, without applying any triggering mechanism. Foam filling was found to be ineffective in increasing the crushing loads of the composite tubes over the sum of the crushing loads of empty composite tube and foam. However, foam filling stabilized the composite progressive crushing mode. In empty hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of the inner Al tube was found to be a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation of empty Al tube, leading to higher crushing load values than the sum of the crushing load values of empty composite tube and empty metal tube.
