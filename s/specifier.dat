The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour <b>specifier</b> can be used when reproducing the flag. For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255–0–0 (web hexadecimal #FF0000). In 1984, the National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act was passed to unify the manufacturing standards for flags used in both indoor and outdoor conditions.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or <b>specifier</b> to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, <b>Specifier</b> or Complement, but cannot have both.|$|E

We propose that pluripotency transcription factors are lineage <b>specifiers</b> that direct commitment to specific fetal lineages. Individual factors bestow the ability to differentiate into particular cell types, and concomitant expression of multiple lineage <b>specifiers</b> within pluripotent cells enables differentiation into every fetal lineage. Moreover, we speculate that, rather than being an intrinsically stable “ground state,” pluripotency is an inherently precarious condition in which rival lineage <b>specifiers</b> continually compete to specify differentiation along mutually exclusive lineages...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rise}} of minimalism, many {{concepts}} related to the geometrical relations of phrase structure held fast to in earlier approaches have been reconsidered. This article deals with distinguishing (relational and technical) properties of <b>specifiers</b> and adjuncts in a Bare Phrase Structure framework (X'-Theory). I extend specific aspects of X-structure relevant to the discussion of <b>specifiers</b> vs. adjuncts. I argue that unique <b>specifiers</b> {{can be derived from}} the system and that adjunction, possibly multiple, results from Direct Merge only. The final product is a series of relationships in line with recent thoughts and minimalist premises, but formally more similar to earlier conceptions of the X'-schema. I address conceptual, empirical and theoretical arguments against multiple <b>specifiers</b> and related issues next, that is beyond the predictions immediately following from the tripartitional view of clause structure proposed in Grohmann (2000). After laying out my motivations to critically consider the issue, I present a set of data that casts serious doubt over the justifications offered to replace Agr with v as the accusative casemarker. Having conceptual and empirical back-up, I then tackle the theoretical validity of <b>specifiers,</b> and ways to distinguish unique <b>specifiers</b> from (multiple) adjuncts. I introduce a version of Bare Phrase Structure that does so, yet keeps the spirit of defining structural identification over relational rather than categorial properties...|$|R

25|$|Minimal pronouns require {{closeness}} to a vP, often with an embedded possessive. An embedded v would {{start with a}} relative pronoun in <b>specifier</b> position, which would later {{be followed by a}} bound variable interpretation. Locality domains for reflexives are first determined by the proximity of indexicals, myself, to v. Previously thought of as indexicals, the subject pronoun myself can be instead attributed to being bound pronouns connected to the closest v.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the v, what {{normally}} binds the pronoun, has all phi features {{bound to}} {{itself from the}} start. Kratzer describes predication as the subject pronoun that eventually becomes a relative pronoun. Predication, in (24) adopts the phi features from v. Kratzer predicts that the merging of DPs to a <b>specifier</b> position would only happen when the DPs are without phi features. In the event that a DP adopts phi features from v from predication, then {{there should be a}} clear distinction.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Chomsky's minimalist {{framework}} on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages. These probing techniques analyzed negative data over prescriptive grammars, {{and because of}} Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved {{to in order to}} fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as ditransitive, inchoative, and causative verbs), could select their own <b>specifier</b> element within a syntax tree construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).|$|E

25|$|In her 2008 book, Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax, {{linguist}} Gillian Ramchand {{acknowledges the}} roles of lexical entries {{in the selection of}} complex verbs and their arguments. 'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that the <b>Specifier</b> is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.|$|E
25|$|Under a {{syntactic}} intransitive base approach, the transitive form {{is derived}} from the intransitive form by insertion of a verbal layer projected by a head expressing causation and introducing the external agent argument. This idea assumes that a verbal phrase is able to be separated into different layers of verbal projections whereby each of the layers provide a <b>specifier</b> where an argument can be attached. In addition, the layers are joined together by head movement of the lowest verb head to positions higher in the syntactic structure. Change-of-state verbs are broken-down into the verbal layers of initiation phrase (initP), process phrase (procP) and result phrase (resP), which approximately correspond to the predicate cause, become, and state respectively.|$|E

Although newer fossil discoveries filled the gap between theropods and Archaeopteryx, {{as well as the}} gap between Archaeopteryx and modern birds, phylogenetic taxonomists, in keeping with tradition, almost always use Archaeopteryx as a <b>specifier</b> to help define Aves. Aves has more rarely been defined as a crown group consisting only of modern birds. Nearly all palaeontologists regard birds as coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. Within Coelurosauria, multiple cladistic analyses have found support for a clade named Maniraptora, consisting of therizinosauroids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Of these, dromaeosaurids and troodontids are usually united in the clade Deinonychosauria, which is a sister group to birds (together forming the node-clade Eumaniraptora) within the stem-clade Paraves.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{reprogramming}} {{factors that}} induce pluripotency {{have been identified}} primarily from embryonic stem cell (ESC) -enriched, pluripotency-associated factors. Here, we report that, during mouse somatic cell reprogramming, pluripotency can be induced with lineage <b>specifiers</b> that are pluripotency rivals to suppress ESC identity, {{most of which are}} not enriched in ESCs. We found that OCT 4 and SOX 2, the core regulators of pluripotency, can be replaced by lineage <b>specifiers</b> that are involved in mesendodermal (ME) specification and in ectodermal (ECT) specification, respectively. OCT 4 and its substitutes attenuated the elevated expression of a group of ECT genes, whereas SOX 2 and its substitutes curtailed a group of ME genes during reprogramming. Surprisingly, the two counteracting lineage <b>specifiers</b> can synergistically induce pluripotency in the absence of both OCT 4 and SOX 2. Our study suggests a “seesaw model” in which a balance that is established using pluripotency factors and/or counteracting lineage <b>specifiers</b> can facilitate reprogramming...|$|R
