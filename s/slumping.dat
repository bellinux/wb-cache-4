5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain. The campaign {{would prove to be}} the franchise's most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before <b>slumping</b> under an injury cloud {{at the end of the}} year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and <b>slumping</b> to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had ever done in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the season the NHL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired resulting in a lockout. The season was threatened with cancellation before the lockout ended, ultimately the length of the labor dispute resulted in the reduction of games from the standard 82 to a shortened 48. Cory Schneider entered the season as the team's new starting goaltender, while the Canucks attempted to trade incumbent Roberto Luongo. The two goaltenders battled for playing time early in the season resulting in a goaltender controversy. After a six-game winning streak to start February the Canucks dealt with multiple injuries and suspensions resulting in the team <b>slumping.</b> In late March Schneider captured the starters job starting seven consecutive games helping the team to a second six-game winning streak. Vancouver dueled the Minnesota Wild in the standings before pulling away in April and winning the division. Led by Henrik and Daniel Sedin the Canucks' power play struggled dropping from fourth the previous season to twenty-third, with the Sedin twins' point production declining. Derek Roy was brought in through a trade to help deal with injuries at centre in the team's only trade of the year. Schneider was injured late in the season and missed the first two games of the playoffs. Vancouver lost the fourth game of their playoff series on a controversial call on Daniel Sedin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>slumped</b> {{concrete}} takes various {{shapes and}} according to the profile of <b>slumped</b> concrete, the <b>slump</b> is termed as true <b>slump,</b> shear <b>slump</b> or collapse <b>slump.</b> If a shear or collapse <b>slump</b> is achieved, a fresh sample should be taken and the test repeated. A collapse <b>slump</b> is an indication that the mix is too wet.|$|R
25|$|The {{concrete}} then <b>slumps</b> (subsides). The <b>slump</b> of {{the concrete}} is measured by measuring {{the distance from the}} top of the <b>slumped</b> concrete to the level of the top of the <b>slump</b> cone.|$|R
25|$|The <b>slump</b> test is {{suitable}} for <b>slumps</b> of medium to high workabiity, <b>slump</b> {{in the range of}} 5 – 260mm, the test fails to determine the difference in workability in stiff mixes which have zero <b>slump,</b> or for wet mixes that give a collapse <b>slump.</b> It is limited to concrete formed of aggregates of less than 38mm (1.5inch).|$|R
5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was <b>slumping</b> in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
25|$|GM cited <b>slumping</b> and {{unprofitable}} {{sales of}} the Fiero {{as the reason for}} its demise following its 5th model year.|$|E
25|$|The {{east and}} {{northwest}} sides of Monks Mound were twice excavated in August 2007 during {{an attempt to}} avoid erosion due to <b>slumping.</b> These areas were repaired to preserve the mound.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} <b>slump</b> varies widely, ranging from meters per second, to meters per year. Sudden <b>slumps</b> usually occur after {{earthquakes}} or heavy continuing rains, and can stabilize {{within a few}} hours. Most <b>slumps</b> develop over comparatively longer periods, taking months or years to reach stability. An example of a slow-moving <b>slump</b> is the Swift Creek Landslide, a deep-seated rotational <b>slump</b> located on Sumas Mountain, Washington.|$|R
25|$|Only a true <b>slump</b> is of any {{use in the}} test. A {{collapse}} <b>slump</b> {{will generally}} mean that the mix is too wet or {{that it is a}} high workability mix, for which the <b>slump</b> test is not appropriate. Very dry mixes having <b>slump</b> 0 – 25mm are typically used in road making, low workability mixes having <b>slump</b> 10 – 40mm are typically used for foundations with light reinforcement, medium workability mixes with <b>slump</b> 50 – 90mm, are typically used for normal reinforced concrete placed with vibration, high workability concrete with <b>slump</b> > 100mm is typically used where reinforcing has tight spacing, and/or the concrete has to flow a great distance.|$|R
30|$|The <b>slump</b> of {{the fresh}} {{concrete}} recorded show that higher RHA content resulted in lower <b>slumps</b> for all the mixes except 5  % RHA content. The rapid water absorption of RHA particles due to the cellular microstructure of the particles and the hygroscopic nature resulted in lower <b>slumps</b> recorded. The 5  % RHA content however appeared {{to have had a}} different effect on the <b>slump</b> {{of the fresh}} concrete as the <b>slumps</b> were higher than that of the control mixes. The 5  % RHA content appeared to have improved the dispersion of the cement particles resulting in higher <b>slumps</b> recorded.|$|R

25|$|Currently and in {{the past}} LDS church leaders have {{forbidden}} dancing that includes full-body contact or is suggestive of sexual behavior. One youth guide stated that these unapproved movements deemed vulgar included shoulder or hip shaking, body jerking, crouching, <b>slumping</b> over, and backbending.|$|E
25|$|<b>Slumping</b> play led to Evans' departure, {{and he was}} {{replaced}} by Ralph Willard who headed the Pitt program from 1994–95 through 1998–-99. Despite highly regarded recruiting classes and stars such as Mark Blount and Vonteego Cummings, Pitt advanced to only one NIT in five seasons under Willard.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{determining}} <b>slump</b> {{is to use}} an automated <b>slump</b> meter. Sensors and controls enable the meters to measure and display <b>slump.</b> Their reliability has by now earned them acceptance in various standard codes such as ASTM International. Some automated <b>slump</b> meters, {{such as the one}} by [...] also can add water to the concrete mix in the delivery truck while in transit. In 2013 [...] was revised to allow water additions during transit for trucks equipped with automated <b>slump</b> monitoring and measurement systems.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day, West Indies had reached 359-7. After <b>slumping</b> to 65-3, all three wickets being taken by Davidson, Worrell {{assisted}} Sobers in taking the score to 239, at which point Sobers was out, his 132 having taken only 174 minutes. Worrell followed shortly afterwards for 65, but Solomon (65) ensured that there would be no collapse.|$|E
25|$|Wallace {{also found}} that Ford's apology was likely, at least partly, {{motivated}} by a business that was <b>slumping</b> as result of his antisemitism repelling potential buyers of Ford cars. Up until the apology, {{a considerable number of}} dealers, who had been required to make sure that buyers of Ford cars received the Independent, bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slump</b> folding: When <b>slumps</b> form in poorly {{consolidated}} sediments, they commonly undergo folding, {{particularly at}} their leading edges, during their emplacement. The asymmetry of the <b>slump</b> folds {{can be used}} to determine paleoslope directions in sequences of sedimentary rocks.|$|R

500|$|The westward-facing {{flank of}} Hualālai forms a large {{underwater}} <b>slump</b> {{known as the}} North Kona <b>slump.</b> An area of about , the <b>slump</b> consists of an intricate formation of beaches and scarps [...] below the waterline. This area was explored more closely in a 2001 joint Japan-United States project to explore the volcano's flanks, utilizing the Remotely operated vehicle ROV Kaikō. [...] Data collected showed that the lava flows there originated in shallow water [...] deep, and that unlike similar <b>slumps</b> at other volcanoes, the <b>slump</b> at Hualālai formed gradually.|$|R
25|$|Marbled and dappled {{patterns}}: Some {{of these}} patterns are clearly formed through the {{distortion of the}} original pattern during the <b>slumping</b> of the glass plate during melting. However, by using spiral and circular patterns of alternating colours producers were also able to deliberately imitate the appearance of natural stones such as sardonyx. This occurs most often on pillar-moulded bowls, which {{are one of the}} commonest glass finds on 1st century sites.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{was near}} the exit, {{preventing}} others from attempting to run past him and escape. Bryant moved across the café towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up. He {{was shot in the}} arm and head, left <b>slumping</b> against the fireplace but alive.|$|E
25|$|Spurrier next had an {{opportunity}} to start in the fifth game of the 1973 season, when he replaced a <b>slumping</b> Brodie against the Minnesota Vikings. He set team records with 31 completions and 320 passing yards, but he also tossed two interceptions, and the 49ers lost 17-14. With Spurrier suffering from a lingering knee injury, 49ers Coach Nolan decided to start fellow backup Joe Reed the following week, and Spurrier's playing time was again limited.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the <b>slump</b> {{test has}} been used to measure {{concrete}} consistency. However, many researchers contend that the <b>slump</b> alone is not a sufficient measure of consistency and that other quantifiable rheological properties such as shear yield stress and plastic viscosity are more representative and should be considered. A <b>SLump</b> Rate Machine (SLRM) was adapted and calibrated, to consistently measure the plastic properties for a number of concrete mixes, namely <b>slump</b> rate and <b>slump</b> flow. Furthermore, a theoretical model was developed to correlate the <b>slump</b> flow and <b>slump</b> rate with the shear yield stress and plastic viscosity of fresh concrete, respectively. Employing the SLRM and the theoretical model has resulted in an efficient new approach to adequately predict the rheological behaviour of fresh concrete as well as to provide reasonably accurate values for shear yield stress and plastic viscosity.

25|$|Another way pulps kept {{costs down}} was by paying authors less than other markets; thus many eminent authors {{started out in}} the pulps before they were {{successful}} enough to sell to better-paying markets, and similarly, well-known authors whose careers were <b>slumping</b> or who wanted a few quick dollars could bolster their income with sales to pulps. Additionally, some of the earlier pulps solicited stories from amateurs who were quite happy to see their words in print and could thus be paid token amounts.|$|E
25|$|Kenny {{took over}} a club that had won the League of Ireland {{two years in a}} row and had {{qualified}} for the group stages of the previous year's Europa League. However the 2012 season proved to be a disaster for Kenny and Rovers, crashing out of Europe to Lithuanian side Ekranas and <b>slumping</b> to fourth place in the league table.

40|$|Retrogressive thaw <b>slumps</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{dramatic}} thermokarst landforms in periglacial regions. This thesis investigates the impacts of two of the largest hillslope thaw <b>slumps</b> on the geochemistry of periglacial streams on the Peel Plateau, Northwest Territories. It aims to describe the inorganic geochemistry of runoff across active mega-slumps, impacted and pristine tundra streams, as well as that of the ice-rich permafrost exposed in the <b>slump</b> headwalls. <b>Slump</b> runoff is characterized by elevated suspended sediments (911 g/L), high conductivity (2700 µS/cm), and high SO 42 - (up to 2078 ppm). The runoff originates as a solute-rich meltwater near the <b>slump</b> headwall, and leaches and re-dissolves soluble salts (e. g., gypsum) as it flows along the mudflow. Conductivity increases until the runoff mixes with pristine tundra streams, diluting the <b>slump</b> runoff signal. SO 42 -/Cl- is used as a tracer to isolate the <b>slump</b> runoff signal in impacted waters, and suggests that the contribution of <b>slump</b> runoff to the Peel River has been increasing since the 1960 s...|$|R
