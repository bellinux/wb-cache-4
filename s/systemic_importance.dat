40|$|ABSTRACT Neutrophils engulf {{and kill}} {{bacteria}} using oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms. Despite robust antimicrobial ac-tivity, neutrophils are impaired in directing Salmonella clearance and harbor viable intracellular bacteria during {{early stages of}} infection that can subsequently escape to more-permissive cell types. The mechanisms accounting for this immune impairment are not understood. We report that Salmonella limits exposure to oxidative damage elicited by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) in neutrophils by expressing an ABC importer specific for D-alanine, a DAO substrate found in peptidoglycan stem peptides. A Sal-monella dalSmutant defective for D-alanine import was more susceptible to killing by DAO through exposure to greater oxida-tive stress during infection. This fitness defect was reversed by selective depletion of neutrophils or by inhibition of DAO in vivo with a small-molecule inhibitor. DalS-mediated subversion of neutrophil DAO is a novel host-pathogen interaction that en-hances Salmonella survival during <b>systemic</b> infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Neutrophils engulf Salmonella during early stages of infection, but bacterial killing is incomplete. Very {{little is known about}} how Salmonella survives in neutrophils to gain access to other cell types during infection. In this study, we show that D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) in neutrophils consumes D-alanine and that importing this substrate protects Salmonella from oxidative killing by neutrophil DAO. Loss of this importer results in increased bacterial killing in vitro, in neutrophils, and in a mouse model of infection, all phenotypes that are lost upon inhibition of DAO. These findings addmechanistic insight into a novel host-pathogen interaction that has consequences on infection outcome...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the challenges involved in regulating the international financial system, addressing the role of the IMF, the continuing sources of instability, and the barriers to effective international cooperation in this policy area. The IMF has extensive research capability and efficient organisational structure, but misses State-like powers and remains subordinate to, but central to, the G 20 as the principal rescue agent and supporter of longer term economic stability in global contemporary economic governance. The IMF's position of <b>systemic</b> economic <b>importance</b> is thus somewhat paradoxical. Its formal ambition does (and has always) overreach its actual mandate. But in any standoff with a sovereign government it invariably acknowledges that it has no power to turn technical advice into a formal legal right to implement, as opposed to advocate, policy change. It must rely on the authority of argument rather than the power of statute in a residual era of sovereign States. The challenge of international financial regulation is to reduce the frequency and severity of economic crises {{while at the same time}} maximising the prosperity of humanity and the planet on which we live. But this will only happen if the struggle between financial power struggle and rulesbased behaviour, a hallmark of the present system, can be balanced. Contrary to the pietistic chimera of the cosmopolitan theorist, even on the smaller, more practical canvas of twenty-first century economic institutional multilateralism, cooperative, collective action problem-solving will remain constrained by both national and international politics. Coordination in the global financial system is to be encouraged but responsibility for regulation will remain largely a 'host country' activity...|$|R

40|$|An accumulating body of {{evidence}} shows that gut microbiota fulfill {{an important role in}} health and disease by modulating local and <b>systemic</b> immunity. The <b>importance</b> of the microbiome in the development of kidney disease, however, is largely unknown. To study this concept, we depleted gut microbiota with broad-spectrum antibiotics and performed renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. Depletion of the microbiota significantly attenuated renal damage, dysfunction, and remote organ injury and maintained tubular integrity after renal I/R injury. Gut flora-depleted mice expressed lower levels of F 4 / 80 and chemokine receptors CX 3 CR 1 and CCR 2 in the F 4 / 80 + renal resident macrophage population and bone marrow (BM) monocytes than did control mice. Additionally, compared with control BM monocytes, BM monocytes from gut flora-depleted mice had decreased migratory capacity toward CX 3 CL 1 and CCL 2 ligands. To study whether these effects were driven by depletion of the microbiota, we performed fecal transplants in antibiotic-treated mice and found that transplant of fecal material from an untreated mouse abolished the protective effect of microbiota depletion upon renal I/R injury. In conclusion, we show that depletion of gut microbiota profoundly protects against renal I/R injury by reducing maturation status of F 4 / 80 + renal resident macrophages and BM monocytes. Therefore, dampening the inflammatory response by targeting microbiota-derived mediators might be a promising therapy against I/R injury...|$|R
40|$|Status epilepticus (SE) is a {{neurological}} emergency {{with a high}} morbidity and mortality. Our goal was to analyse clinical presentations, EEG features and outcome of patients referring to our neurological emergency practice for SE. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and the EEGs of patients who underwent emergency neurological evaluation over a 2 -year period (2006 - 2007) for suspected enduring seizures, acute confusional state or altered mental state. All cases with a confirmed diagnosis of SE and EEG monitoring were selected. We collected data about 58 patients (28 males and 30 females). Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) was predominant (65 % of patients). Pre-existing epilepsy was found in 40 % of cases. The most common causes of SE were stroke and metabolic diffuse diseases, followed by CNS neoplasm and diffused ischaemic encephalopathy. Intravenous BDZs were given to 70 % of patients; the majority (46 %) of patients were treated with i. v. Valproate (VPA) as second line AED with a successful control of SE; a percentage of 15 % was treated immediately with i. v. VPA according to medical judgment.

40|$|AbstractCentral {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Thus, the mechanisms that control fat distribution {{and its impact on}} <b>systemic</b> metabolism have <b>importance</b> for understanding the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Hypercortisolemia at the systemic (Cushing's syndrome) or local levels (due to adipose-specific overproduction via 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1) results in the preferential expansion of central, especially visceral fat depots. At the same time, peripheral subcutaneous depots can become depleted. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the depot-specific actions of glucocorticoids (GCs) on adipose tissue function remain poorly understood. GCs exert pleiotropic effects on adipocyte metabolic, endocrine and immune functions, and dampen adipose tissue inflammation. GCs also regulate multiple steps in the process of adipogenesis. Acting synergistically with insulin, GCs increase the expression of numerous genes involved in fat deposition. Variable effects of GC on lipolysis are reported, and GC can improve or impair insulin action depending on the experimental conditions. Thus, the net effect of GC on fat storage appears to depend on the physiologic context. The preferential effects of GC on visceral adipose tissue have been linked to higher cortisol production and glucocorticoid receptor expression, but the molecular details of the depot-dependent actions of GCs are only beginning to be understood. In addition, increasing evidence underlines the importance of circadian variations in GCs in relationship to the timing of meals for determining their anabolic actions on the adipocyte. In summary, although the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, there is increasing evidence that GCs have multiple, depot-dependent effects on adipocyte gene expression and metabolism that promote central fat deposition.

A bank’s total interbank lending and borrowing provide useful complementary information. JEL classification: G 20, G 28, L 14. A pressing policy objective is to finalise and implement a regulatory framework for systemically important financial institutions. Meeting this objective calls for measures of <b>systemic</b> <b>importance.</b> The recent academic literature has proposed a number of such measures, underpinned by sophisticated economic and statistical techniques. Despite their intellectual appeal, these measures pose serious challenges for practitioners. They are demanding on data, computationally intensive and difficult to communicate to the general public. In addition, given that the measures require detailed system-level information, individual institutions {{would not be able}} to use these measures directly in order to assess and manage their own degree of <b>systemic</b> <b>importance.</b> This prompts the question whether there are simple, readily available indicators that are reliable proxies for the more sophisticated measures. In this article, we address this question empirically. We use data on 20 large internationally active banks to test the relationship between three sophisticated, model-based measures of <b>systemic</b> <b>importance</b> and three simple indicators. Given the multifaceted nature of <b>systemic</b> <b>importance,</b> we consider both top-down and bottom-up measures.

40|$|Objective: Avian {{tuberculosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important infections affecting most species of birds. Several mycobacterial species have been identified causing avian tuberculosis, and the organisms confirmed most frequently are Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium genavense. Any species of birds can be infected with M. avium. Generally, domesticated fowl or captive wild birds are affected more frequently than those living in the wild. M. avium can not only infect all species of birds, but can also infect some domesticated mammals to cause disease, usually with localized lesion. In immunocompetent individuals, M. avium complex isolates produce localized soft tissue infections, including chronic pulmonary infections in the elderly and cervical lymphadenitis in children, but rarely any disseminated disease. In patients infected with HIV and AIDS or in other immunocompromised individuals, M. avium complex isolates frequently cause severe <b>systemic</b> infections. The <b>importance</b> of avian tuberculosis and the risk of its zoonotic spread motivated our interest to determine the drug susceptibility testing of M. avium subsp. avium isolates from naturally infected domestic pigeons to avian tuberculosis. Methods: Based on their clinical signs, 80 pigeons suspected with avian tuberculosis were subjected to the study. Out of the 51 identified isolates, 20 M. avium subsp. avium were subjected to the test. Drug susceptibly testing was performed according to the guidelines by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and using proportional method. Results: In the drug susceptibility testing, all isolates were resistant to streptomycin, kanamycin, ethionamide, and thiophene carboxylic acid hydrazide. Additionally, 3, 2, and 1 isolates were susceptible to isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, respectively. To date, no study has documented the drug susceptibility testing of M. avium isolates from infected birds to avian tuberculosis. Pigeons are extensively kept in urban and rural areas for homing and racing purposes; thus, they can infect people and farm animals exposed to their droppings containing pathogenic M. avium, and the severity of drug resistance of these isolates indicate lethality in immunocompromised individuals and incurable lymphadenitis in immunocompetent individuals. Conclusion: We suggest drug susceptibility testing for more nontuberculous mycobateria, particularly M. avium complex isolated from infected birds and humans, as well as molecular basics of drug sensitivity in order to detect resistance genes of pathogenic M. avium subsp. avium...|$|R
40|$|In Chapter 1 of this thesis, {{decomposition}} of current clinically-used artemisnins is discussed. Artesunate formulated into rectal capsules undergoes decomposition under the thermal stress testing conditions required {{to establish the}} shelf life of the capsules. The amounts of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) formed {{as one of the}} degradants is outside the recommended guidelines of the International conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Our task was to find out the missing degradation products. Therefore, it was necessary to examine the thermal {{decomposition of}} artesunate. Dihydroartemisinin would have to be examined as well. Because of the importance of β-artemether as an antimalarial drug, its decomposition would also be examined. Artemisone is the drug developed at HKUST, and for it to be successful, it is important to establish its shelf life, and to identify the possible degradants which would be formed. Artesunate was submitted to controlled thermal degradation at 100 ℃ to give various products including remarkable artesunate dimers, β-artesunate, and various products which appear to arise from the degradation of DHA formed in situ. The most interesting product appears to be the formate ester which arises from thermal decomposition of the DHA. The artesunate dimers were prepared independently, and the formate ester was prepared by heating artesunate with formic acid. The thermal decomposition of DHA also gave various products. The most important product appeared to be a rearranged peroxide, a peroxyhemiacetal, which was shown to be an important degradation product appearing inside the capsules. Artesunate and DHA were also submitted to controlled degradation under acidic conditions, and for DHA, under basic conditions as well. The preoxyhemiacetal, and various other products arising via intramolecular aldol reaction were formed. Each of artesunate, DHA and artemisone were submitted to controlled thermal degradation at 40 ℃ in thermostatted bath {{for a long period of}} time. An NMR method was used to establish the amount of the degradation taking place. It is shown that artesunate and artemisone have about the same thermal stability, and DHA is less stable. In Chapter 2, the preparation of new polar artemisinin derivatives is discussed. The artemisinins dihydroartemisinin, artesunate and artemether currently used for treatment of malaria have the problem of neurotoxicity, of which dihydroartemisinin is the most neurotoxic. Artesunate and artemether are readily hydrolyzed or metabolized to dihydroartemisinin. It has been established that the more lipophilic an artemisinin is, the more likely it is to be neurotoxic. Therefore, new derivatives must be polar to attenuate the neurotoxicity and to enhance its <b>systemic</b> properties. The <b>importance</b> of lowering the Log P parameter by incorporating polar elements to enhance systemic properties of artemisinins has been illustrated by the preparation of the new artemisinin artemisone, which is non-neurotoxic, and is much more active than the current artemisinins against the malaria parasite. In this thesis, it is described how we wish to use polar groups to continue on the strategy of developing artemisinins which are non-neurotoxic and very active against the malaria parasite. The plan also would be to make water soluble salts from various derivatives bearing amino groups at C 10 of the artemisinin nucleus. The initial idea was to use the sulfamide group in the 10 -sulfamide dihydroartemisinin as a scaffold. Therefore, attempts were made to alkylate and acylate this group, and attach various other polar groups to it. The most active compound made in this way was the benzylpiperazinesulfamide derivative which had an activity in vitro agains the malaria parasite of 10 pg/mL. However, in general, it was not so easy to make such derivatives, because of the poor reactivity of the substituted sulfamide with the dihydroartemisinin. The unsubstituted 10 -piperazine DHA derivative was made for the first time, and also other piperazines were also made. However, it was not possible to prepare a stable water soluble salt from one of these derivatives...|$|R

Phase 2 May 2009 -August 2010 The purposes of this phase were to: vi ? provide further understandings for the EEI team of the Initiative?s development, based on the perceptions of the various stakeholders involved and our interpretations of those; ? provide ongoing formative feedback on the progress of the Initiative; ? produce a summative report. There are various components to the Initiative and it has been necessary to speak to a wide range of those involved: EEI team members; Steering Group members; Research and Innovation Services (RIS) representatives; pilot Masters programme representatives; Business Fellows; and others with relevant knowledge. We have carried out 31 interviews with 25 people. Contextual factors Contextual factors played a central role in the working of the Employer Engagement Initiative (EEI). The change in external economic conditions between 2007, when the bid was written, and 2008 when the Initiative started meant that the EEI functioned in a vastly different environment from that envisaged by the bid?s authors and the Higher Education Funding Council and had a profound effect on what the Initiative was able to achieve. Employers were less able to finance continuing professional development (CPD) for their employees. The internal university environment also had a powerful effect on achievements. Initial staffing challenges delayed the start of the Initiative. In October 2009 a new Vice-Chancellor took office, initiating and pursuing policies likely to encourage the development of flexible delivery of courses, but also initiating a period of reorganisation. This made it more difficult to achieve concrete changes during this period because of the uncertainties about structures, processes and the role of relevant personnel in the new structure. Key Findings The evaluation?s key findings are reported in relation to each of the Initiative?s central aims: Aim 1 Increasing the coherence of the university approach to employer engagement The EEI achieved the following: ? Worked with RIS to develop the university?s virtual Gateway, through enhancing presentation of the existing CPD offer and assisting with an analysis of competitor websites; ? Directly engaged in or facilitated the following processes: general awareness raising within the university; awareness raising of needs and interests external to the university; specific interactions between particular university units and employers and sector representatives; adding CPD discussions to existing meetings between the university and employers; and a contribution to cultural change in the university; ? Implemented three audit and mapping activities (an initial audit of existing flexible, postgraduate provision, a mapping project for the Maritime University Strategic Research Group, and an assessment of university activity within the maritime sector); ? Developed understandings about what was and what was not likely to be of interest to employers; ? Contributed to the development of a Corporate Relationship Strategy. Although several factors assisted the Initiative (the existence and contributions of Research and Innovation Services, Careers Destinations, existing academic-employer links), other factors posed challenges for the EEI (non-standard processes across 20 Schools, communication within a large university and the difficulties of building trust between different parts of the institution with different processes, structures, personnel and cultures). vii Aim 2 Changes to academic processes to enable flexible delivery of M level education The EEI achieved the following: ? Submitted the business case for changing various administrative systems in the University which will make flexible delivery more possible; ? A Technology Enhanced Learning Guide offering principles of practice, identifying key issues for planning and managing TEL projects, seeking to encourage academic engagement in TEL, and providing details of internal and external people and organisations to contact about proposed projects; ? Reviewing the quality assurance procedures of the University and assessing their suitability for employer responsive provision, and proposing various options for quality assurance of flexible learning courses; ? Input into the Curriculum Innovation Programme within the University, especially the sub-sections of postgraduate taught courses and continuing professional development; ? Initiation of discussion about various financial aspects of flexible provision, including payment-inkind and actual costs of teaching particular courses. Although some factors assisted the EEI (the possibility of ?workarounds? and a culture of working things out), others worked against the Initiative including registration, financial, IT and quality systems designed to support full-time students on full-length programmes. Aim 3 Pilot projects The EEI achieved the following: ? As this report goes to press, a flexibly delivered, postgraduate certificate in Environmental Health, leading potentially to a full Masters pathway, is being developed. Not only will this deliver a new programme to the university, but also a model of how such a course can be developed using a variety of expertise, including that of freelance learning designers. ? One module in an Energy Certificate has been developed. ? The team has been involved in exploring in some depth the possibility of an undergraduate programme tailored to the needs of a specific employer, the outcome of this is as yet unclear. Although some factors assisted the EEI in developing its pilots of postgraduate flexible provision (pre-existing flexible units and programmes within the University with related expertise in programme development, administration and marketing), other factors provided challenges including the traditional focus in the university on full-time, traditional-age students which meant there was little incentive or need for Schools or academics to investigate other models. Various options for development were explored as the project developed. Aim 4 Design Centre The loss of the building where the Design Centre was to be was an early major blow to the Initiative, making it impossible to have such a Centre. Other matters The EEI aimed to recruit 60 new M level FTE students on to flexible credit-based courses, co-funded by employers. It had been envisaged that the ASN allocation would be used on the pilot courses described previously. This proved problematic for three main reasons: ? Suitable courses could not be developed in time, although the new Environment Health Certificate should recruit from October 2011 on a part-time basis. ? ASNs were difficult to use. In order to get 60 ASNs (FTE), the university would need to recruit perhaps 200 or 250 part-time Masters students for a year to do one or two modules in order to reach 60 ASNs. viii ? The University has other groups of students who may fit the ASN criteria, but it is hard to access the relevant data as it is currently not routinely collected. This picture was complicated by the somewhat complex and unclear nature of the funding for ASNs. Emerging themes Engagement with employers presents universities with various dilemmas and challenges relating to the nature and extent of risk taken on and effort and resources invested, as priorities are balanced. These are documented in this report and are also clearly visible in the wider literature (inter alia Bolden et al. 2010; Connor and Hirsh 2008; and the Lambert Review 2003). There are significant cultural differences within sub-sections of the University as well as between the University and employers. Such differences are well documented in the external literature. Such cultural differences will continue to exist, given the complex nature of higher education. We suggest that the negative effects as regards engagement with employers can be minimised by the recommendations below. Short-term funding affects the nature of goals and achievements; it is hard to develop sustainable relationships, processes and products within short funding periods. Recommendations The University should make a clear decision about how far, if at all, it wants to position itself with regard to employer engagement in M level provision (and across the curriculum) and take action accordingly. Is it a strategic priority? If so, certain steps should be taken to facilitate such activity. These include: ? A clearer and more explicit path of authority and leadership for employer and community engagement within the University to signal its <b>importance.</b> ? <b>Systemic</b> co-ordination of relationships and systems within the University as regards employer engagement, through strategies, formalised systems of co-operation and audit and mapping activities. ? More active interactions outside the University at e. g. industry/university matching events, perhaps with a particular focus on large employers and existing employer partnerships. ? Adjustment of working patterns, workload models and promotion systems within the University to facilitate some staff focusing on such employer engagement. ? Adjustment of financial, registration and accreditation systems and requirements to enable more flexible provision. ? More flexible support of e-learning provision. ? The limitations of short-term funding must be considered and recognised in bids, which should be based on realistic, achievable aims within the timescale. ? Achievements are likely to be enhanced by clear line management structures within short-term projects and by co-location of those responsible for ?delivering the project?...|$|R
