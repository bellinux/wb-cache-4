5000|$|Judson criticized Straus {{for having}} blocked {{proposed}} state legislation to ban sanctuary cities, in which police {{do not ask}} the immigration status of persons whom they <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> <b>questioning.</b> In a campaign email, Judson cites the murder in 2015 of 25-year-old Spencer Golvach of Houston, killed by Victor Reyes, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who had been deported four times. Dan Golvach, in an advertisement sponsored by the Young Conservatives of Texas, which supports Judson, said that Straus opposition to the ban on sanctuary cities, [...] "put {{the life of an}} illegal alien ahead of my murdered son and many other Texans just like him." [...] Susan Pamerleau, the Republican sheriff of Bexar County and a candidate for a second term in the November 8 general election, defended Straus. Judson's [...] "use of a grieving father to accuse Joe Straus of a horrific murder committed by a career criminal is deplorable and irresponsible. No one has done more to secure the border than Joe Straus," [...] Pamerleau said." ...|$|E

5000|$|The checkpoints are {{described}} as [...] "the third layer in the Border Patrol's three-layer strategy", following [...] "line watch" [...] and [...] "roving patrol" [...] operations near the border. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, [...] "Border Patrol agents at checkpoints have legal authority that agents do not have when patrolling areas away from the border. The United States Supreme Court ruled that Border Patrol agents may stop a vehicle at fixed checkpoints <b>for</b> brief <b>questioning</b> of its occupants {{even if there is}} no reason to believe that the particular vehicle contains illegal aliens. [...] The Court further held that Border Patrol agents [...] "have wide discretion" [...] to refer motorists selectively to a secondary inspection area <b>for</b> additional brief <b>questioning.</b> In contrast, the Supreme Court held that Border Patrol agents on roving patrol may stop a vehicle only if they have reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contains aliens who may be illegally in the United States—a higher threshold <b>for</b> <b>stopping</b> and <b>questioning</b> motorists than at checkpoints. [...] The constitutional threshold for searching a vehicle is the same, however, and must be supported by either consent or probable cause, whether in the context of a roving patrol or a checkpoint search." ...|$|R
