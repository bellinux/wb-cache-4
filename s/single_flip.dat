5000|$|Rosalina is {{generally}} wise, kind, thoughtful and mother-like. She {{has a very}} tall frame in comparison to other female characters within the series and is classified as a large-class character in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8. Rosalina's skin is very fair, being a pallor white, and her facial features are similar to Princess Peach's, but sharper. Her eyes are similar to Peach's as well, but are more almond-shaped and have a deep, brown shade to her lashes rather than black. Like other main human characters, Rosalina has blue eyes, though hers have a noticeably cyan hue. Rosalina's hair is depicted as a platinum-blonde, a much lighter blonde than Peach's yellow-blonde. Her hairstyle {{is very similar to}} Peach's, as it consists of two separate flips on the sides in the same shape. Unlike Peach's hair, however, Rosalina's includes one large bang (which covers her right eye completely), two long, shaped ear-tails, and two rows of flips at her shoulder. Continuing from her shoulder is a large <b>single</b> <b>flip</b> down her back. Rosalina currently appears in a light blue evening gown and light purple high heels that grow when they are seen; her brooch and crown are silver star-shaped accessories. Her earrings are also star shaped, but gold in color. In Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8, Rosalina wears a light blue jumpsuit whenever she rides on a motorbike or an ATV.|$|E

This study was conducted to investigate the factors associated with loss of fixation after arthroscopically assisted CC fixation using a <b>single</b> <b>flip</b> button device for acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Materials and Methods. We enrolled a total of 47 patients (35 men and 12 women). Plain radiography was performed at a mean of 24 months postoperatively to evaluate the final radiological outcome. The primary outcome measure was a long-term reduction of the AC joint for at least 24 months. Results. We found that 29 patients had a high quality reduction (61. 7 %) and 18 patients had a low quality reduction (38. 3 %) in initial postoperative CT findings. Our study showed that the duration (5 days) from injury to treatment and the quality of initial postoperative reduction were significantly associated with the maintenance of reduction at final follow-up.

40|$|Abstract. The {{yield curve}} {{is shaped by}} (i) {{expectations}} of the future path of short-term interest rates and (ii) uncertainty about the path. Uncertainty affects the yield curve through two channels: (i) Investors attitudes toward risk as reflected in risk premia, and (ii) the nonlinear relation between yields and bond prices (known as convexity). The way in which these forces simultaneously work to shape the yield curve can {{be understood in terms}} of the conditions that guarantee the absence of arbitrage opportunities. Purpose and outline The purpose of the paper is to provide an introduction to the modern theory of the term structure of interest rates using high-school algebra. 1 In order to present the theory correctly, we must take uncertainty seriously. Nevertheless, the source of uncertainty can be modeled quite simply: All uncertainty is resolved by a <b>single</b> <b>flip</b> of a coin. In this setting, we can rigorously present all three forces that shape the yield curve: expectations, risk aversion, and convexity.

40|$|Flip chip {{technology}} has the shortest interconnect length for minimum signal disturbance and simultaneous interconnection leading to reduced process times especially for high I/O counts and for RF applications. Flip chip technology allows for reliabilities required for automotive applications, but {{to achieve this}} goal, a plastic encapsulant, the so called underfiller, has to be used. New material developments for transfer molding allow underfilling and overmolding in one single transfer molding step. Existing standard equipment for encapsulation can be used and no additional process step for underfill dispensing is required. Molded flip chips have the potential of high reliability as the low CTE of the flip chip molding compound reduces the thermal mismatch. State of the art in FC molding is the encapsulation of single chip packages as BGA or CSP. Trends of the market drive towards SIPs with an integration of different devices as e. g. SMD and FC. Therefore the highly reliable encapsulation of these hybrid packages with inhomogeneous topography is the future goal.
