5000|$|Depending on {{the source}} of current for the loop, devices may be {{classified}} as active (supplying or [...] "sourcing" [...] power) or passive (relying on or [...] "sinking" [...] loop power). For example, a chart recorder may provide loop power to a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter modulates the current on the loop to send the signal to the strip chart recorder, but does not in itself supply power to the loop and so is passive. Another loop may contain two passive chart recorders, a passive pressure transmitter, and a 24 V battery. (The battery is the active device). Note that a 4-wire instrument has a power <b>supply</b> <b>input</b> separate from the current loop.|$|E
5000|$|SM {{suppression}} focuses its protective philosophy on a power <b>supply</b> <b>input,</b> but offers {{nothing to}} protect against surges appearing between the input of an SM device and data lines, such as antennae, telephone or LAN connections, or multiple such devices cascaded and linked to the primary devices. This is {{because they do not}} divert surge energy to the ground line. Data transmission requires the ground line to be clean in order {{to be used as a}} reference point. In this design philosophy, such events are already protected against by the SM device before the power supply. NIST reports that [...] "Sending them surgesdown the drain of a grounding conductor only makes them reappear within a microsecond about 200 meters away onsome other conductor." [...] So having protection on a data transmission line is only required if surges are diverted to the ground line.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{evaporation}} {{of surface}} seawater (output) {{is more than}} the <b>supply</b> (<b>input)</b> of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems, causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to be much higher than that of the Atlantic—so much so that the saltier Mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the Atlantic, causing a two-layer flow across the Gibraltar strait: that is, an outflow submarine current of warm saline Mediterranean water, counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the Atlantic. Herman Sörgel's Atlantropa project proposal in the 1920s proposed a hydroelectric dam to be built across the Strait of Gibraltar, using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy. The underlying energy grid was as well intended to support a political union between Europe and, at least, the Marghreb part of Africa (compare Eurafrika for the later impact and Desertec for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid).|$|E

30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the relevance of}} these scores in the input–output network, we develop the concepts in the context. First suppose production of sector j increases due to a shock on final demand. This initiates two chains of effects. On the one hand, sector j increases its demand for inputs. This demand is matched {{by an increase in}} the <b>supply</b> of <b>inputs</b> of j’s suppliers. In {{order to be able to}} increase <b>supply</b> of <b>inputs,</b> j’s suppliers had to increase production, which in turn, means an increase in demand of inputs, including the output of sector j, and so on. On the other hand, other chain of effects starts because there is more output available to be used as inputs after sector j increased it demand. This means that sector j increases its <b>supply</b> of <b>inputs</b> for other sectors. With more inputs available, the other sectors purchase more inputs and increase production. This increase in production, in turn, increases the <b>supply</b> of <b>inputs,</b> and so on.|$|R

25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified {{power supply rejection ratio}} that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power <b>supply</b> <b>inputs.</b> Power <b>supply</b> <b>inputs</b> are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|R
