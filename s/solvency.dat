5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the <b>solvency</b> of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E
5|$|United Front Games cut 120 {{staff with}} the company's <b>solvency</b> in doubt until August when Square Enix {{acquired}} the publishing {{rights to the}} game. Square Enix did not buy the True Crime intellectual property, and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs. Square Enix London Studios general manager Lee Singleton said he recognized the game's playability and potential. United Front Games' President Stefan Wessels stated he was excited to work with Square Enix London Studios. Sixty people {{were added to the}} development team and the game was released in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and <b>solvency,</b> overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E

25|$|Lord Barrymore died {{in perhaps}} {{unexpected}} <b>solvency,</b> with no legitimate son. He had alienated {{much of his}} Cork patrimony in 1792, at which time the Buttevant estate passed to Viscount Doneraile and to a Scottish banker, John Anderson.|$|E
25|$|The Council is the {{governing}} {{body of the}} university, consisting of mainly lay members along with representatives of staff and students.

25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, {{unacknowledged}} by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is <b>solvency.</b> The question concerning <b>solvency</b> has arisen due to domestic {{problems in the}} crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E
25|$|All visitors, {{including}} those with Cuban nationality residing outside Cuba, must hold valid return tickets and proof of medical insurance. Non Cuban passport holders must also provide proof of financial <b>solvency</b> of at least US$50 per day. Visitors from many countries are expected to hold a passport valid {{for at least two}} months from the arrival date.|$|E
25|$|While the film, {{featuring}} the ensemble as a ragtag taxi company trying to hustle {{their way to}} <b>solvency</b> and respectability, performed modestly at the box office, its $16 million take exceeded its $12 million budget and has since become a minor cult favorite for its kitchen sink geniality. It was the second feature in a prolific career for director Joel Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|Counterplans: The {{negative}} {{can present}} a counter {{solution to the}} affirmative case's problem {{which may or may}} not go against the resolution. This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the counterplan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the <b>solvency.</b> Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the <b>solvency</b> of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).|$|E
25|$|Stock issues: In {{order for}} the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the stock issues, which are Harms, Inherency, <b>Solvency,</b> Topicality, and Significance. For the {{negative}} to win, they only need {{to prove that the}} affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely to dislike newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of Mills College and Stanford University, where {{she earned a}} doctorate in biology, Ray became {{an associate professor at}} the University of Washington in 1957. She was chief scientist aboard the schooner SS Te Vega during the International Indian Ocean Expedition. Under her guidance, the nearly bankrupt Pacific Science Center was transformed from a traditional, exhibit-oriented museum to an interactive learning center, and returned to <b>solvency.</b>|$|E
25|$|The temptation {{offered by}} such readily {{available}} savings overwhelmed {{the policy and}} regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the <b>solvency</b> of governments and their banking systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that the regulator focused exclusively on <b>solvency</b> margins, and took little or no account of accrued terminal bonuses in its overall analysis of the financial health of the company. It quotes Penrose as saying that the Policyholders Reasonable Expectations (PRE) would have included terminal bonus even if the amount was not defined; however the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) and the Treasury deny PRE existed as the terminal bonus was not guaranteed.|$|E

25|$|If {{the company}} is solvent, and the members have made a {{statutory}} declaration of <b>solvency,</b> the liquidation will proceed as a members' voluntary winding-up. In that case the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding-up, and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company's affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors' voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed.|$|E
25|$|Ontario is Canada's leading {{manufacturing}} province, {{accounting for}} 52% {{of the total}} national manufacturing shipments in 2004. Ontario's largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. , Moody's bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable, while S rated it AA-. Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013. Long known as a bastion of Canadian manufacturing and financial <b>solvency,</b> Ontario's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 37.5% in fiscal year 2017–2018, compared to 26% in 2007–2008.|$|E
25|$|Following a July 2000 House of Lords ruling, and {{the failure}} of {{attempts}} to find a buyer for the business, it closed to new business in December 2000 and reduced payouts to existing members. Lord Penrose's 2004 Equitable Life Inquiry found that the company had made over-generous payouts leading it to be under-funded. A 2007 European report concluded that regulators had focused on <b>solvency</b> margins and failed to consider the increasing risk of accrued terminal bonuses.|$|E
25|$|This measure {{involves}} only Part A. The {{trust fund}} is considered insolvent when available revenue plus any existing balances will not cover 100 percent of annual projected costs. According {{to the latest}} estimate by the Medicare trustees (2016), the trust fund is expected to become insolvent in 11 years (2028), at which time available revenue will cover 87 percent of annual projected costs. Since Medicare began, this <b>solvency</b> projection has ranged from two to 28 years, {{with an average of}} 11.3 years.|$|E
25|$|Before any {{concrete}} {{planning to}} regain <b>solvency</b> could be undertaken, an accurate {{accounting of the}} railroad's condition was required. The receivers' report, issued in June 1880, indicated total liabilities of US$145,494,005. Annual carrying charges were just over US$7.5 million, while net revenues were just under US$5.5 million. Already, this early into the process, the English bondholders' committee contended that expansions in the Reading's floating debt incurred during the six {{months prior to the}} bankruptcy were not covered by value in the corporation's assets.|$|E
25|$|If the {{investor}} actually owns Risky Corp's debt (i.e., is owed money by Risky Corp), a CDS {{can act as}} a hedge. But investors can also buy CDS contracts referencing Risky Corp debt without actually owning any Risky Corp debt. This may be done for speculative purposes, to bet against the <b>solvency</b> of Risky Corp in a gamble to make money, or to hedge investments in other companies whose fortunes are expected to be similar to those of Risky Corp (see Uses).|$|E
25|$|The Social Security Administration {{projects}} that the demographic situation will stabilize. The cash flow {{deficit in the}} Social Security system will have leveled off {{as a share of}} the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make <b>solvency</b> worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{he worked}} with Alan Greenspan in a major reform of the Social Security system that {{maintained}} its <b>solvency</b> by slowly raising the retirement age, thus cutting benefits for workers retiring in their mid-60s, and in 1986 he obtained {{the passage of a}} federal law that abolished most mandatory retirement ages. In his later years, Pepper, who customarily began each day by eating a bowl of tomato soup with crackers, sported a replaced hip and hearing aids in both ears, but continued to remain an important and often lionized figure in the House.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese banks hold {{strategic}} {{stakes in}} {{other sectors of}} the economy, including the insurance sector. Foreign bank participation is relatively high as is state ownership through the Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD). Overall, Portugal's financial system is sound, well managed and competitive, with shorter-term risks and vulnerabilities quite well contained, and with the system buttressed by a strong financial policy framework. Despite being relatively small and concentrated, Portugal's banking system generally compares well with other European Union (EU) countries in terms of efficiency, profitability, and asset quality, with <b>solvency</b> also close to European levels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>solvency</b> {{constraint}} of {{the standard}} central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than {{the same amount of}} itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.|$|E
25|$|John's successor, whom he {{apparently}} despised, was Henry of Stoke. He {{took steps to}} improve the abbey's finances. In particular, he retained the services of William of Shareshill, a talented lawyer, to maximise the abbey's income from its endowments. Shareshill was very successful and received the lease of Boningale as a reward. However, cattle disease in the 1330s and the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 struck hard. The labour shortage brought the community to its knees. Abbot Henry resigned in 1350 and in 1351 Edward III appointed Shareshill and William Banaster as custodians to restore <b>solvency.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, {{every major}} {{currency}} abandoned {{the gold standard}}. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the <b>solvency</b> of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced {{to raise interest rates}} {{in order to protect the}} gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.|$|E
25|$|A close {{examination}} of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called commenda, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account <b>solvency</b> risks.|$|E
25|$|Despite another minor {{uprising}} led by General Ferrera in 1925, Paz Barahona's administration was, by Honduran standards, rather tranquil. The banana companies {{continued to}} expand, the government's budgetary situation improved, {{and there was}} even an increase in labor organizing. On the international front, the Honduran government, after years of negotiations, finally concluded {{an agreement with the}} British bondholders to liquidate most of the immense national debt. The bonds were to be redeemed at 20 percent of face value over a thirty-year period. Back interest was forgiven, and new interest accrued only over the last fifteen years of this arrangement. Under the terms of this agreement, Honduras, at last, seemed on the road to fiscal <b>solvency.</b>|$|E
25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent <b>solvency,</b> the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by trial-and-error, a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E
25|$|This was {{a turning}} point in the team's history. Fan support gave the Indios' {{management}} team enough financial <b>solvency</b> to save the franchise. From winning only three championships in 40 years, the team went on to win 13 championships in the 34 years following the 1978 season. Collective fan protests demanded repairs to the baseball stadium from its owner, the then-named Parks and Leisure Administration of Puerto Rico (now called the Puerto Rico Department of Recreation and Sports), a government agency that still owns and controls the new stadium that has since replaced the old one. The stadium was remodeled soon after (1980). The Indios under Gomez ownership went on to win four more championships (83-84, 85–86, 87-88, 88-89) for a total of five during his tenure.|$|E
25|$|As the Senate's leading debt-hawk, Voinovich {{introduced}} the Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act in every Congress {{in which he}} served in beginning in 2006. The measure proposed {{the establishment of a}} national commission to examine the nation's tax and entitlement systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the <b>solvency</b> of entitlement programs for future generations. In January 2010, Voinovich met with President Obama to relay the urgency of our nation's fiscal crisis. Four days later, Obama publicly endorsed the Conrad-Gregg statutory debt commission, which was modeled after Voinovich's SAFE Commission. Obama announced during his 2010 State of the Union address that he would create the debt commission by executive order because it had failed to pass the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending {{as a share of}} gross domestic product (GDP), the <b>solvency</b> of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future <b>solvency</b> of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA {{actually}} makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possession}} of gold and silver has been a measure of <b>solvency</b> of a regime, the display of it, {{in the form of}} plates and vessels, is more a political act and a gesture of conspicuous consumption. The 16th-century French term buffet applied both to the display itself and to the furniture on which it was mounted, often draped with rich textiles, but more often as the century advanced the word described an elaborately carved cupboard surmounted by tiers of shelves. In England such a buffet was called a court cupboard. Prodigal displays of plate were probably first revived at the fashionable court of Burgundy and adopted in France. The Baroque displays of silver and gold that were affected by Louis XIV of France were immortalized in paintings by Alexandre-François Desportes and others, before Louis' plate and his silver furniture had to be sent to the mint to pay for the wars {{at the end of his}} reign.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the <b>solvency</b> of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E
