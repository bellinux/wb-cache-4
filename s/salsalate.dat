40|$|Animal {{models have}} {{identified}} multiple mechanisms of aspirin toxicity. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase in the gastroduodenal mucosa {{leading to a}} decrease in endogenous prostaglandins. Prostaglandin mediated mucus and bicarbonate secretion, epithelial hydrophobicity, blood flow, and cellular proliferation are all decreased. Salicylates may cause direct cellular toxicity via inhibition of energy metabolism and membrane transport properties. Salicylate preparations {{have been designed to}} decrease gastroduodenal absorption. Endoscopic studies in humans have confirmed that buffering of aspirin does not ameliorate damage, but enteric coating does. Salicylsalicylic acid (<b>salsalate)</b> is an effective antirheumatic drug that bypasses gastric absorption and also avoids cyclooxygenase inhibition. In a randomized, single-blind, endoscopic comparison of <b>salsalate</b> versus enteric-coated aspirin, significantly less gastroduodenal damage was observed in volunteers after <b>salsalate</b> administration compared to enteric-coated aspirin. An endoscopic study in rheumatoid arthritics also confirmed the ability of <b>salsalate</b> to spare gastroduodenal mucosa when compared to naproxen administration. <b>Salsalate</b> may cause less gastroduodenal damage than entericcoated aspirin {{based on the results of}} animal models and endoscopic studies in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastroduodenal}} mucosal {{damage caused}} by aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is a common clinical problem.

40|$|Selenoprotein P (SeP) was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} hepatokine that induces insulin resistance (IR) in rodents and humans. Recent clinical trials have shown that <b>salsalate,</b> a prodrug of salicylate, significantly lowers blood glucose levels and increases adiponectin concentrations. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>salsalate</b> and full length-adiponectin (fAd) on the expression of SeP under hyperlipidemic conditions and explored their regulatory mechanism on SeP. In palmitate-treated HepG 2 cells as well as high fat diet (HFD) -fed male Spraque Dawley (SD) rats and male db/db mice, SeP expression and its regulatory pathway, including AMPK-FOXO 1 a, were evaluated after administration of <b>salsalate</b> and salicylate. Palmitate treatment significantly increased SeP expression and aggravated IR, while knock-down of SeP by siRNA restored these changes in HepG 2 cells. Palmitate-induced SeP expression was inhibited by both <b>salsalate</b> and salicylate, which was mediated by AMPK activation, and was blocked by AMPK siRNA or an inhibitor of AMPK. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assay showed that <b>salsalate</b> suppressed SeP expression by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO 1 a. Moreover, fAd also reduced palmitate-induced SeP expression through the activation of AMPK, which results in improved IR.

40|$|Neuroinflammation plays a {{critical}} role in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI induces rapid activation of astrocytes and microglia, infiltration of peripheral leukocytes, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In the context of modest or severe TBI, such inflammation contributes to tissue destruction and permanent brain damage. However, {{it is clear that the}} inflammatory response is also necessary to promote post-injury healing. To date, anti-inflammatory therapies, including the broad class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have met with little success in treatment of TBI, perhaps because these drugs have inhibited both the tissue-damaging and repair-promoting aspects of the inflammatory response, or because inhibition of inflammation alone is insufficient to yield therapeutic benefit. <b>Salsalate</b> is an unacetylated salicylate with long history of use in limiting inflammation. This drug is known to block activation of NF-jB, and recent data suggest that <b>salsalate</b> has a number of additional biological activities, which may also contribute to its efficacy in treatment of human disease. Here, we show that <b>salsalate</b> potently blocks pro-inflammatory gene expression and nitrite secretion by microglia in vitro. Using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice, we find that <b>salsalate</b> has a broad antiinflammatory effect on in vivo TBI-induced gene expression, when administered post-injury. Interestingly, <b>salsalate</b> also elevates expression of genes associated with neuroprotection and neurogenesis, including the neuropeptides, oxytocin and thyrotropin releasing hormone. Histological analysis reveals salsalate-dependent decreases in numbers and activation-associated morphological changes in microglia/macrophages, proximal to the injury site. Flow cytometry data show that <b>salsalate</b> changes the kinetics of CCI-induced accumulation of various populations of CD 11 b-positive myeloid cells in the injured brain. Behavioral assays demonstrate that <b>salsalate</b> treatment promotes significant recovery of function following CCI. These pre-clinical data suggest that <b>salsalate</b> may show promise as a TBI therapy with a multifactorial mechanism of action to enhance functional recovery...|$|E

At 5 weeks of age, GK and Wistar (WIS) control rats were subdivided into four groups, each composed of six rats: GK rats with standard diet (GK-C); GK rats with salsalate-containing diet (GK-S); WIS rats with standard diet (WIS-C); and WIS rats with salsalate-containing diet (WIS-S). The GK-C rats (167. 2 ± 11. 6 mg/dL) showed higher blood glucose concentrations than WIS-C rats (133. 7 ± 4. 9 mg/dL, P< 0. 001) {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, and had substantially elevated blood glucose from an age of 15 weeks until sacrifice at 21 weeks (341. 0 ± 133. 6 mg/dL).

While this difference in blood glucose between 4 and 21 weeks in GK-S animals was significant, blood glucose at 21 weeks was significantly lower in GK-S compared to GK-C animals. At sacrifice, <b>salsalate</b> decreased plasma insulin (GK-S = 1. 0 ± 0. 3; GK-C = 2. 0 ± 0. 3 ng/mL, P< 0. 001) and increased plasma adiponectin concentrations (GK-S = 15. 9 ± 0. 7; GK-C = 9. 7 ± 2. 0 µg/mL, P< 0. 001). <b>Salsalate</b> also lowered total cholesterol in GK-S rats (96. 1 ± 8. 5 mg/dL) compared with GK-C rats (128. 0 ± 11. 4 mg/dL, P< 0. 001).

Impaired vascular endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), a bio-marker of vascular endothelial dysfunction, is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events. EDD is reduced with age, but is preserved in middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults who habitually perform aerobic exercise. The purpose of these studies {{was to determine the}} role of chronic low-grade inflammation, as assessed by white blood cell (WBC) count and endothelial nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, in the modulation of EDD in sedentary and aerobic exercise-trained MA/O adults. EDD was 34 % less in MA/O sedentary adults with higher compared with lower WBC count. Vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO) was 18 % less in subjects with higher vs. lower WBC count, but did not fully explain the differences with EDD. Inhibition of NO reduced EDD in subjects with lower, but not higher WBC count. Tetrahydrobiopterin selectively improved EDD in subjects with higher WBC count by increasing NO bioavailability. Thus, among healthy sedentary MA/O adults, a higher WBC count is related to impaired EDD and this is mediated by reduced responsiveness to NO and reductions in tetrahydrobiopterin and NO bioavailability. MA/O sedentary adults had a greater expression of NF-kappaB, a key pro-inflammatory transcription factor, in their vascular endothelial cells compared with young sedentary and MA/O aerobic exercise-trained adults. In a sub-group of MA/O subjects, oral <b>salsalate</b> was used to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling. <b>Salsalate</b> treatment reduced endothelial NF-kappaB expression in sedentary subjects, but had no effect in exercise-trained subjects. EDD improved by 76 % with <b>salsalate</b> in the sedentary adults, whereas there was no improvement in the exercise-trained adults. In sedentary subjects, antioxidant vitamin C infusion improved EDD by 32 % during the placebo condition, but had no effect during <b>salsalate.</b> In exercise-trained subjects, vitamin C infusion did not change EDD during either treatment. Therefore, in sedentary MA/O adults, increased NF-kappaB signaling suppresses EDD, in part, by increased oxidative stress. Reduced NF-kappaB signaling is a key mechanism for preserved EDD in exercise-trained MA/O adults...|$|E
