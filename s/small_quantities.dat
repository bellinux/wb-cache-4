5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. <b>Small</b> <b>quantities</b> of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E
50|$|Similar to decaffeination in coffee, coca tea can be decocainized. Just as {{decaffeinated}} coffee retains a <b>small</b> <b>quantity</b> of caffeine, decocainized coca tea will still contain a <b>small</b> <b>quantity</b> of organic coca alkaloids.|$|R

5|$|Neon, as liquid or gas, is {{relatively}} expensive– for <b>small</b> <b>quantities,</b> {{the price of}} liquid neon can be more than 55 times that of liquid helium. Driving neon's expense is the rarity of neon, which unlike helium, can only be obtained from air.|$|E
5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>quantities</b> {{of methane}} and {{formaldehyde}} detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E

5|$|Titanium of {{very high}} purity was made in <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{discovered}} the iodide, or crystal bar, process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E

5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E

5|$|Presumed hybrids with B.marginata (silver banksia) {{occur on}} Wilsons Promontory in Victoria; these {{are found in}} localities where both species co-occur, and have {{features}} intermediate between the two. Another purported hybrid with B.marginata, thought to be from Cape Paterson on Victoria's south coast, was first described by Alf Salkin and is commercially available in <b>small</b> <b>quantities.</b> It forms an attractive hardy low-growing plant to 1 metre.|$|E
5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E

Consumption of <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very <b>small</b> <b>quantities</b> {{everywhere}} on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day.

In Edinburgh, the duty has been very long commuted; but in Dumfries, the finisher of the law still exercises, or did lately exercise, his privilege, the quantity taken being regulated by a small iron ladle, which he uses as the measure of his perquisite. The expression lock, for a <b>small</b> <b>quantity</b> of any readily divisible dry substance, as corn, meal, flax, or the like, is still preserved, not only popularly, but in a legal description, as the lock and gowpen, or <b>small</b> <b>quantity</b> and handful, payable in thirlage cases, as in town multure.|$|R
