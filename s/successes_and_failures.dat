40|$|The paper {{questions}} common assumptions in {{the dominant}} representational framings of information systems <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> proposes a performative perspective that conceives IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> as relational effects performed by sociomaterial practices of IS project actor-networks of developers, managers, technologies, project documents, methodologies, and other actors. Drawing from a controversial case of a highly innovative information system in an insurance company-considered a <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> at the same time- the paper reveals the inherent indeterminacy of IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> describes the mechanisms by which <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> become performed <b>and</b> thus determined by sociomaterial practices. This is explained by exposing ontological politics in the reconfiguration and decomposition of the IS project actor-network {{and the emergence of}} different agencies of assessment that performed both different IS realities and competing IS assessments. The analysis shows that the IS project and the implemented system as objects of assessment are not given and fixed, but are performed by the agencies of assessment together with the assessment outcomes of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure.</b> The paper demonstrates that by reframing IS <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure,</b> the performative perspective provides some novel and surprising insights that have a potential to change conversations on IS assessments in both the IS literature and IS practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Knowledge <b>and</b> {{understanding}} of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> factors, {{as well as}} how to measure them and the interactions between these factors have great importance for project management effectiveness. Project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> is a question of perception and the criteria could vary from project to project A project that has been perceived to be a failure by one stakeholder may be perceived as a success by another. Therefore a study was conducted in India among the industries that are into inhouse software development, to investigate the influence of the non-technical components of the software development process, on <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> of software development. This study reveals that practitioners consider the level of customer/user involvement, software process management, and estimation & schedule to contribute most to project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> from the organizational perspective the level of customer/user involvement, project manager/staff and software process management contribute most to project <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure.</b> Keywords- <b>Success,</b> Failure, Non-technical components, inhouse, Software development...|$|R

5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the <b>successes</b> <b>and</b> <b>failures</b> of the war.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} relationship of resilience and perceived stress with life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure.</b> The research sample consisted of 120 who were selected from among the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> through the random sampling method. To collect the data, Resilience Scale, Perceived Stress Scale and Life Satisfaction Scale were used. The results showed that resilience and perceived positive stress are positively related to life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> (P< 0. 01). Also, perceived negative stress is negatively related to life satisfaction in the students of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> (P< 0. 01).

25|$|Many of {{the root}} ideas of Kemalism began during the late Ottoman Empire under various reforms to avoid the {{imminent}} collapse of the Empire, beginning chiefly in the early 19th-century Tanzimat reforms. The mid-century Young Ottomans attempted to create the ideology of Ottoman nationalism, or Ottomanism, to quell the rising ethnic nationalism in the Empire and introduce limited democracy {{for the first time}} while maintaining Islamist influences. In the early 20th century, Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of early Turkish nationalism, while adopting a secular political outlook. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, Atatürk, influenced by both the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks, as well as by their <b>successes</b> <b>and</b> <b>failures,</b> led the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, borrowing from the earlier movements' ideas of secularism and Turkish nationalism, while bringing about, for the first time, free education and other reforms that have been enshrined by later leaders into guidelines for governing Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The modern form of {{official}} military history {{began in the}} mid-nineteenth century with reports written as guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, were not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that its official histories should be written for the public, since it had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing explicit lessons from their <b>successes</b> <b>and</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary Objective: To {{assess the}} {{definitions}} of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> {{as defined by the}} participants of the Menucha Consensus Conference on Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE). Design: Thirteen experts from various fields participated in Menucha Consensus Conference. Though they belonged to different fields, all of them had some kind of experience in CPOE implementation. Measurements: The stories of these experts were analyzed using a constant comparison method and partially ordered display. Results: Each participant told a <b>success</b> <b>and</b> a <b>failure</b> story. Definitions of <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure,</b> as well as variables contributing to the <b>success</b> <b>and</b> <b>failure</b> of CPOE implementations, were extracted from the transcripts.

25|$|Nepal {{began to}} {{experience}} some successes {{in international affairs}} during the tenure of Jung Bahadur. To the north, relations with Tibet had been mediated through China since Nepal's defeat in 1792, and during {{the early nineteenth century}} embassies had to make the arduous journey to Beijing every five years with local products as tribute to the Qing emperor. By 1854, however, China was in decline and had fallen into a protracted period of disturbances, including the Taiping Rebellion (1851–64), revolts by Muslim ethnic groups north of Tibet, and war with European powers. The Nepalese mission to Beijing in 1852, just after the death of the sixth Panchen Lama, was allegedly mistreated in Tibet. Because of this slight, the Nepalese government sent a protest letter to Beijing and Lhasa outlining several grievances, including excessive customs duties on Nepalese trade. In 1855 Nepalese troops overran the Kuti and Kairang areas. The Nepalese-Tibetan War lasted for about a year, with <b>successes</b> <b>and</b> <b>failures</b> on both sides, until a treaty negotiated by the Chinese resident and ratified in March 1856 gave Nepalese merchants duty-free trade privileges, forced Tibet to pay an annual tribute of 10,000 rupees to Nepal, and allowed a Nepalese resident in Lhasa. In return, Nepal gave up territorial gains and agreed that it, as well as Tibet, would remain a tributary state subject to China. As the Qing Empire disintegrated later in the century, this tributary status was allowed to lapse, and even Tibet began to shake off its subordination.|$|E
