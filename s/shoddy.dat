5|$|A {{number of}} {{specific}} events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, <b>shoddy</b> school construction {{resulted in the}} collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including Tan Zuoren, were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with reprisals from Chinese officials for their activism.|$|E

Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
5|$|Still annoyed {{about the}} town's lack of {{understanding}} of the monorail, Marge visits Lanley to question his motives, and discovers a notebook containing drawings which reveal Lanley’s intention to run off with bags of money skimmed from the monorail project while everyone else falls victim to his faulty train. Marge immediately drives to North Haverbrook, which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser of one of his monorails. She discovers that the town is in ruins. While exploring, Marge meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook monorail. Cobb explains that Lanley embezzled construction funds through <b>shoddy</b> workmanship and materials, and that the entire project was a scam. Realizing Marge believes him, he offers his assistance in helping to prevent the same fate from happening to Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as <b>shoddy</b> workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

40|$|Part 4 : Learning and Data MiningInternational audienceDecision {{making for}} setting new {{policies}} is a challenging process {{as the current}} policy making system is utterly flawed. A policy is introduced by the decision maker when the problem domain was fully consulted by experts in the field.

Policy making on environmental issues are even <b>shoddier</b> as the environmental systems are habitually complex, and adaptive; and introduction of new technologies can easily affect the guiding strategies already taken.

Compatibility study is carried out in RCB design with 3 replications, each contain 5 seedlings. Height and biomass are accessed to measure the growth responses of the seedlings. The result showed that the best reponse is given by consortia that consist of the three kinds of these microbes. This increase the shoot biomass (137 %) compare to the control. The consortia also improved N 164 %, P 335 % and K 167 % in the plant tissues. While pure AMF improved absorption of N plants 80 %, P 383 % and K 51 % compare to the control.

5000|$|By 1969, Jones was {{becoming}} increasingly {{unhappy with the}} production of his albums on Musicor, for which he primarily blamed his longtime producer and mentor Pappy Daily. According to the Bob Allen biography George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Jones was disappointed with the haphazard uneven production quality of the records he'd made {{under the supervision of}} both Pappy and Art Talmadge and suspicious about the flurry of document signing that accompanied his various record label changes instigated by Daily over the years. Adding to the growing estrangement between Jones and Daily was the arrival of Tammy Wynette in the singer's life. Jones became aware of the pretty blond country singer after she scored a minor hit with [...] "Apartment No. 9" [...] in 1966, and their paths kept crossing because their tours were booked by the same agency. They began touring as part of the same show and soon Jones took more than a passing fancy to Wynette, who was eleven years his junior and grew up listening to all of his records. They soon became romantically involved and were married in 1969. Wynette encouraged Jones to update his image, altering his hairstyle and stage clothes, and soon Jones was longing to leave Musicor so he could record with Wynette and her red hot producer Billy Sherrill on Epic Records. As Jones biographer Bob Allen observes, Jones [...] "was more than anxious to be free of his association with Musicor - which he felt had resulted in some of the <b>shoddiest</b> records he'd made {{in the course of his}} long career - even if it did mean spreading a lot of money around." [...] Jones would eventually buy out his contract with Musicor and jump to Epic.|$|R

25|$|Financial {{responsibility}} for these upgrades {{was the subject}} of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York. Co-op City was developed under New York's Mitchell-Lama Program, which subsidizes affordable housing. RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development's original <b>shoddy</b> construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years. In the end, a compromise had the state supplying money and RiverBay refinancing the mortgage, borrowing $480 million from New York Community Bank in 2004, to cover the rest of the capital costs.|$|E

New York State threatened to foreclose on the property, and evict the tenants — which would mean {{the loss of their}} equity. But Cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest rent-strike in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then Bronx Borough President, Robert Abrams, and then Secretary of State, Mario Cuomo.
