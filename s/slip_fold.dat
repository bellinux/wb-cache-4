It is located northeast of the Cusiana and Cupiagua hydrocarbon fields. The area {{is characterized by a}} series of moderate to high-angle duplexes with east-southeast verging thin-skinned and thick-skinned tectonics. We present a structural model constrained by 2 -D and 3 -D seismic reflection data, surface geology, and well data. The structural analysis is based on backward modeling (kinematic restoration) and forward modeling using transfer-flexural slip and fault <b>slip</b> <b>fold</b> algorithms. The struc-tures are significantly tighter in the northern segment compared to the southern segment of the over-thrust trend. We estimate approximately 17 km of shortening in the northern duplex zone, and about 26 km total shortening for the southern duplex zone. We propose that thin-skinned in-sequence imbricate thrust stack deformation produced most of the shortening. The main Andean deformation (80 % of the total shortening) commenced in the Piedemonte area about 6 Ma with rapid shortening and uplif...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVolumetric {{restoration}} {{can provide}} crucial {{insights into the}} structural evolution of three-dimensional (3 -D) petroleum systems. A major limitation to its widespread application {{is the need to}} include complex architectures and realistic mechanics such as flexural slip. We apply an implicit approach that allows for, including unconformities, thin and/or pinched-out layers in the models but that cannot explicitly localize slip along horizons. To take advantage of this approach while accounting for flexural slip in 3 -D restoration, we investigate new geomechanical properties. We consider flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folding</b> as a result of stacked rigid and thin weak layers, which can be modeled using transversely isotropic properties. We compare restorations of an anticline using transversely isotropic properties, isotropic properties, and a stack of rigid isotropic layers with nonfrictional slip between the layers. Our results show that transversely isotropic properties reasonably approximate flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folding.</b> We use these new tools to model the evolution of a complex system located in the Niger Delta toe. The system includes a detachment fold, a fault-bend fold, and a structural wedge formed in series. Growth stratigraphy and erosional surfaces delimit the kinematics of deformation. Regional erosive surfaces, 3 -D gradients of fault slip, and vertical variations in mechanical strength motivated the use of our new restoration techniques. Restoring two growth units results not only in reinforcing the interpretation that the area is behaving as a deforming thrust sheet at critical taper, but also in highlighting coeval activity on both the hinterland structures and the toe of the thrust belt...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe ∼ 60 km-long Sahel ridge west of Algiers (Tell Atlas, north Algeria) is {{considered}} as an ENE-WSW fault-propagation fold {{running along the}} Mediterranean coast and associated with a north-west dipping thrust. Its proximity with Algiers makes this structure a potential source of destructive earthquakes that could hit the capital city, as occurred in 1365 AD and 1716 AD. The first paleoseismologic investigation on the Sahel ridge was conducted in order to detect paleo-ruptures related to active faulting and to date them. From the first investigations in the area, a first trench was excavated across bending-moment normal faults induced by flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folding</b> in the hanging wall of the Sahel anticline thrust ramp. Paleoseismological analyses recognize eight rupture events affecting colluvial deposits. 14 C dating indicates that these events are very young, six of them being younger than 778 AD. The first sedimentary record indicates two ruptures before 1211 AD, i. e. older than the first historical earthquake documented in the region. Three events have age ranges compatible with the 1365, 1673 and 1716 Algiers earthquakes, whereas three other ones depict very recent ages, i. e. younger than 1700 AD. Potential of these secondary extrados faults for determining paleoseismic events and thrust behaviour is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fold {{mechanisms}} {{operating in}} the Canton Schist have been resolved using the geometric relationship between folds and spiral inclusion trail geometries. Of the four end-member fold mechanisms, tangential–longitudinal strain <b>folding</b> and <b>slip</b> <b>folding</b> are unable to produce the observed inclusion trail and fold geometries, but a combination of flexural flow and pure shear folding {{is consistent with the}} geometric constraints. The maximum flexural flow component during each fold event was determined from the geometric data. During F 3 and F 4, flexural flow produced ≤ 27 % and ≤ 37 % of measured limb rotation, respectively, which corresponds to a maximum of 24 ° limb rotation by flexural flow in each fold event. To satisfy the geometric constraints, the remainder of limb rotation must be a product of pure shear folding. The maximum possible component of flexural flow folding during F 3 and F 4 increases with increased variation in vorticity between layers in the rock mass. In the flexural flow–pure shear model, a maximum of 28 % of inclusion trail curvature is produced by rotation of porphyroblasts relative to (irrotational) fold limbs, with a minimum 72 % curvature due to rotation of fold limbs relative to (irrotational) porphyroblasts. All model solutions produce less than ≈ 8 ° syn-folding porphyroblast rotation relative to geographic coordinates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanics}} of deformation i multilayer flexures i analysed by comparing field observations of joint clusters from the East Kaibab Monocline, Utah with fracture patterns produced in analytical nd numerical experiments. Dune boundaries (bedding planes) were mapped through {{the thickness of}} the aeolian Navajo Formation, and the occurrence of joints related to dune boundary <b>slip</b> and <b>fold</b> curvature was documented. Slip along dune boundaries, as evidenced by joint clusters oblique to bedding, occurs along the steep limb of the fold {{and in the middle of}} the Navajo. Joints perpendicular to bedding and parallel to the fold axis occur near the synclinal hinge. Numerical experiments examine a layer flexed to match the Navajo at Hackberry Canyon with both uniform and observed distribu-tion of dune boundaries. Within the numerical experiments, horizontal frictional interfaces slip within the centre of the layers where dips are steepest, and opening-mode fractures related to curvature form within the anticlinal and synclinal hinges of the fold. Thus, the first-order numerical results match field observations. This study illustrates the important roles of mechanical stratigraphy and interlayer <b>slip</b> in multilayered <b>folding</b> and the contribu-tion of bedding-plane faults and fold curvature in the production f joint clusters...|$|R

40|$|The Elkhorn Ridge Argillite {{exposed in}} the Bourne-Sumpter area of eastern Oregon is a broken {{formation}} of metamorphosed (greenschist facies) hemipelagic sediments, reefal carbonates, rare clastics, mafic volcanics and intrusives {{that may have}} accumulated in a late Triassic-Early Jurassic subduction zone complex or marginal basin. The structural fabric of this unit is best explained by a model of repeated homoaxial folding and simple and/or pure shear during progressive deformation. Deformation began before the sediments were completely lithified and tight to isoclinal mesoscopic folds developed with and without axial-plane cleavage. A predominant spaced cleavage formed {{by a combination of}} dissolution-redeposition processes and microfaulting. Grain boundary sliding and movement along microfaults are important additional deformation mechanisms that operated during flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folding.</b> The lithology and structural style of the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite are characteristic of deformed sequences in subduction zone complexes and marginal basins and {{can not be used to}} discriminate paleotectonic settings. New faunal evidence suggests that substantial disruption of structural stratigraphic units such as the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite have taken place during the Late Triassic to late Jurassic. Coeval blocks of similar lithology and fauna are located in the Miller Mountain area within the John Day inlier of central Oregon and in several terranes distributed along the western Cordillera from California to Canada. Other blocks of oceanic lithic assemblages of various ages in intermediate areas show significant differences in structural and sedimentological history and together are interpreted to lie within a diffuse fault zone of amalgamated suspect terranes...|$|R

The analysis is conducted {{to better understand the}} fracture development and deformation in the folds of fold and thrust belt, in basement and in Permian. The outcrop data is collected by using a scanline technique. This outcrop study has been carried out to collect different fracture parameters. A systematic relationship is observed between the fracture sets and fold geometry in the Paleozoic succession. The mechanism in the fold development is likely flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folding</b> and orthogonal flexural folding. The maximum tectonic stress in the study area is NW-SE, which links and explains the dominant NW-SE open fracture sets in the folds of Cambro-Silurian succession. The fracture intensity is controlled by the structural position of the folds. In more detail, the hinge zone and the areas where the folds are plunging offer the highest fracture intensities. The fracture sets can be explained by different stages of developments; 1) Foreland fractures formation of NW-SE. 2) The fold related stage of NE-SW oriented fractures which are possibly formed due to outer arc extension. 3) N-S trending fractures either formed or reactivated during the development of Oslo rift. The fractures in the basement are WNW-ESE and NNW-SSE trending and do not show any relationship with Cambro-Silurian succession and therefore, formed prior to the Caledonian Orogeny. The fractures in the Cambro-Silurian succession and Permian sill intrusion show similar trend which could suggest the reactivation of previously formed fractures...|$|R

40|$|Flexural <b>slip</b> <b>folds</b> are {{distinctive}} {{of mixed}} continuous-discontinuous deformation {{in the upper}} crust, as folding is accommodated by continuous bending of layers and localized, discontinuous slip along layer interfaces. The mechanism of localized, layer-parallel slip and the stress and fluid pressure conditions at which flexural slip occurs are therefore distinctive of shear localization during distributed deformation. In the Prince Albert Formation mudstone sequence of the Karoo Basin, the foreland basin to the Cape Fold Belt, folds are well developed and associated with incrementally developed bedding-parallel quartz veins with slickenfibers oriented perpendicular to fold hinge lines, locally cross-cutting axial planar cleavage, and showing hanging wall motion toward the fold hinge. Bedding-parallel slickenfiber-coated veins dip at angles from 18 ° to 83 °, implying that late increments of bedding-parallel shear occurred along unfavorably oriented planes. The local presence of tensile veins, in mutually cross-cutting relationship with bedding-parallel, slickenfiber-coated veins, indicate local fluid pressures {{in excess of the}} least compressive stress. Slickenfiber vein microstructures include a range of quartz morphologies, dominantly blocky to elongate-blocky, but in places euhedral to subhedral; the veins are commonly laminated, with layers of quartz separated by bedding-parallel slip surfaces characterized by a quartz-phyllosilicate cataclasite. Crack-seal bands imply incremental slickenfiber growth, in increments from tens of micrometers to a few millimeters, in some places, whereas other vein layers lack evidence for incremental growth and likely formed in single slip events. Single slip events, however, also involved quartz growth into open space, and are inferred to have formed by stick-slip faulting. Overall, therefore, flexural slip in this location involved bedding-parallel faulting, along progressively misoriented weak planes, with a range of slip increments...|$|R

Mineral assemblages indicate metamorphism of high grade amphibolite facies. The metamorphic rocks exhibit appressed cylindroidal folds with monoclinic symmetry in bedding (S 1) and transposed bedding surfaces (S 2). The axes of these folds trend north-northwest with average plunge of 25 ??. The poles to the axial planes (S 3) of the mesoscopic folds are spread {{on a great}} circle arc, the normal to which coincides with the regional megascopic fold axis BS 1 S 2 S 2. A slip cleavage (S 4) is developed subparallel to the axial planes of the megascopic folds. S 4, which strikes north-northwest with an average dip of 80 ?? east, parallels S 1 S 2 in some subfields. The symmetry of both field and microscopic structures is monoclinic (C 1 H).
