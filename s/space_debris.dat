5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing <b>space</b> <b>debris</b> in the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) persuades Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) {{to allow}} the newly {{assigned}} MACOs (Military Assault Command Operations) to attempt an extraction. Led by him, they perform remarkably well in combat, and manage to rescue Archer, Tucker, and Kessick. Enterprise then leaves orbit just as the warships arrive. Unfortunately, Kessick dies, but not before providing coordinates for the Xindi homeworld. When the ship reaches this position, there {{is nothing but a}} 100-year-old field of <b>space</b> <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process. Bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not the other. Trails of <b>space</b> <b>debris</b> and artificial satellites {{were present in the}} original images, and were carefully removed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Space</b> group <b>debris</b> imaging is {{difficult}} with sparse data in low Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) spaceborne radar. To {{solve this problem}} in the narrow band system, we propose a method for <b>space</b> group <b>debris</b> imaging based on sparse samples. Due to the diversity of mass, density, and other factors, <b>space</b> group <b>debris</b> typically rotates at a high speed in different ways. We can obtain angular velocity through the autocorrelation function based on the diversity in the angular velocity. The scattering field usually presents strong sparsity, so we can utilize the corresponding measurement matrix to extract the data of different debris and then combine it using the sparse method to reconstruct the image. Furthermore, we can solve the Doppler ambiguity with the measurement matrix in low PRF systems and suppress some energy of other debris. Theoretical analysis confirms the validity of this methodology. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) images of <b>space</b> group <b>debris</b> in low PRF systems...|$|R
50|$|The Weber's glands are muciparous glands on {{the side}} of the tongue. They are a minor salivary gland in the peritonsillar space. The glands are named after German anatomist Moritz Ignaz Weber. Clears peritonsillar <b>space</b> of <b>debris.</b>|$|R
50|$|Knuckle threads are {{an unusual}} highly rounded thread form. The large {{space between the}} rounded crests and roots {{provides}} <b>space</b> for <b>debris</b> to be shifted to {{not interfere with the}} thread, making this form resistant to debris and thread damage.|$|R
5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of <b>space</b> <b>debris,</b> {{consisting}} of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|Menace is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players control a powerful alien space fighter, moving through six stages {{on the planet}} of Draconia to advance through the game. Players use the ship's weaponry—lasers and cannons—to attack all advancing enemies, and defeat the level's boss: a guardian of Draconia. The six bosses act as Draconia's living defence mechanisms—the planet was created to habituate gruesome and harmful creatures, {{of which there are}} over sixty, participating in unlawful tasks. In the game's levels, players discover <b>space</b> <b>debris,</b> which can be converted into upgrades for the ship. The debris appears as tokens, and grants players additional weapons and upgrades, such as lasers, cannons, and improved ship and weapon power. The ship also has a shield, which provides temporary protection from enemies; contact with enemies and walls depletes the shields, increasing players' vulnerability to death.|$|E
5|$|Series 7 {{began on}} 25 September 1999 {{and saw the}} {{introduction}} of new presenters Steve Wilson and Emma Ledden. New features were added however unlike previous series, many of them failed to last and were continuously replaced. Short lived features included Chick or Chic, Fishing For Compliments and Great Mates. The computer game for this series was called Klunk The Junk which involved viewers guiding 'Malcolm the Alien' around space picking up <b>space</b> <b>debris</b> whilst avoiding the asteroids which would cause the player to lose a point however this too fizzled out within a few weeks. Mr Blobby's game became Blobby's Bistro however this was renamed after six weeks to Blobby's Hobbies whilst The Hot Seat became known as Live & Chatting.|$|E
50|$|NMF is {{also used}} to analyze {{spectral}} data; one such use is in the classification of <b>space</b> objects and <b>debris.</b>|$|R
50|$|Disks of <b>space</b> dust (<b>debris</b> disks) {{surround}} many stars. The dust can {{be detected}} because it absorbs ordinary starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Even if the dust particles have a total mass well {{less than that of}} Earth, they can still have a large enough total surface area that they outshine their parent star in infrared wavelengths.|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} {{suspected}} that the fireflies were either steam from the life support system turning into snow when exposed to open <b>space</b> or <b>debris</b> on {{the exterior of the}} spacecraft being shaken loose, however the former was considered the more probable explanation. Steam generated by the life support system formed condensation between the spacecraft bulkhead and the heat shield which then escaped into space and froze.|$|R
5|$|Space Shuttle Discovery docked on 10 March 2001, {{bringing}} to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds {{the record for the}} longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of <b>space</b> <b>debris.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling debris. Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of <b>space</b> <b>debris.</b>|$|E

50|$|Flutes — Flutes are {{the grooves}} on the working {{side of the}} files which can be {{produced}} either by twisting or grinding a wire. Flutes provide cutting edges and also <b>space</b> for <b>debris</b> collection. Therefore, their presence turns a wire into a shaping instrument which both cuts the tooth structure and acts as an auger.

50|$|Ai Tanabe (Tanabe Ai) is {{the newest}} member of the Debris Section. She is bright and earnest, but mostly unsure of herself. As a {{newcomer}} to <b>space,</b> the <b>Debris</b> Section and to extra-vehicular activity all at the same time, she has to slowly learn the ropes from everyone else. She believes that love is the solution to every problem. Kind and sweet, she is willing to do almost anything to help others. However, her kind spirit also masks a drive to become better than she is. She is originally voiced by Satsuki Yukino, and by Julie Ann Taylor in the English dub.|$|R
25|$|Heliocentric orbit: An {{orbit around}} the Sun. In our Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many {{artificial}} satellites and pieces of <b>space</b> <b>debris.</b> Moons by contrast {{are not in a}} heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There {{is the possibility that}} orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing <b>space</b> <b>debris</b> caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles (Kessler syndrome). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.|$|E
25|$|The United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a {{division}} of the United States Strategic Command, has been tracking objects in Earth's orbit since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the Space Age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 objects. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are <b>space</b> <b>debris.</b> The United States Strategic Command is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks <b>space</b> <b>debris</b> which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles.|$|E
50|$|The MBTA {{developed}} a central plaza linking the two station entrance buildings, {{built on the}} old railroad right-of-way.
