40|$|This paper takes {{a dynamic}} {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} nature and role of boundary objects by examining them {{in relation to the}} <b>social</b> <b>infrastructures</b> within which they are embedded and to the social identities of the groups that share them. It explores the premise that boundary objects are used not only as a translation device, but also as a resource to form and express social identities. It further suggests the occurrence of a dynamic process whereby changes in boundary objects enable changes in <b>social</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and <b>social</b> identities in one group. These changes, in turn, create the conditions for change in bordering groups through shared boundary objects. Based on interviews which were conducted over three years, we illustrate these ideas by presenting three vignettes that describe the introduction of 3 D modelling technologies into the AEC industry and the changes that consequently occurred...|$|R
