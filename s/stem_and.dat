5|$|S.occidentalis {{may also}} be mistaken for Microstoma floccosum, which occurs in the same habitat. M.floccosum, however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs.

5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|H.olivaceoalbus shows {{similarities}} between other closely related fungi {{of the genus}} Hygrophorus, {{some of which have}} only minor differences in physical features. Examples include H.pustulatus, H.inocybiformis, H.tephroleucus or H.morrisii. In the field, H.olivaceoalbus is distinguished by a combination of features including the double velum, the dark streaks on the slimy cap, the ing of the <b>stem,</b> <b>and</b> growth under pines, as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus pustulatus resembles H.agathosmus and has {{a similar}} almond odor. However, the fruit bodies of H.pustulatus are smaller, and it {{produces}} larger spores (11–14µm long). Hygrophorus occidentalis, which grows under conifers or oak, has a sticky <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> less pronounced almond odor. Hygrophorus marzuolus is also similar in appearance, but it lacks a distinctive odor, and has smaller spores than H.agathamosus.|$|E

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{compounds in}} the <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves of Gynura bicolor were studied. 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl and 2, 2 -azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assays {{were employed to}} evaluate antioxidant capacity. By solvent extraction and Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography in sequence, ethanol extracts of Gynura bicolor <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves were fractionated to obtain their active fractions, which were further separated to obtain 12 compounds: 1 - 8 from <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> four, 8 - 12, from leaves. Their structures were elucidated {{on the basis of}} spectroscopic data (nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry). Among these substances, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 with significant antioxidant activity were determined to be responsible active components for <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> compounds 4, 8, and 12 for leaves...|$|R

5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a <b>stem,</b> <b>and</b> was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scott Redhead {{reduced the}} species Crinipellis cremoricolor (originally {{described}} by Shaffer and Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the University of Michigan Biological Station) {{to a variety}} of C.crinipellis. The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7–12 by 3.8–5µm. According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and <b>stem,</b> <b>and</b> pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.|$|E
5|$|In {{the genus}} Boletus, B.auripes is {{classified}} in section Appendiculati.

5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the <b>stem,</b> <b>and</b> less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} {{more deeply}} and {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct <b>stem,</b> <b>and</b> only grows amongst sphagnum moss. Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12µm, while P.milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points.|$|E
5|$|The bulb lies dormant {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.|$|E
