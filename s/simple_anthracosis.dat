40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the most important new radiological presentations of anthracosis and anthracofibrosis and evaluate the risk ratio for accurate diagnosis of these conditions using computed tomography instead of bronchoscopy. Materials and Methods: This prospective, case-control study evaluated three groups of 70 patients with a bronchoscopic diagnosis of <b>simple</b> <b>anthracosis</b> and anthracofibrosis and 40 patients with a non-anthracotic diagnosis (control group). Bronchoscopy, chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) (parenchymal and mediastinal windows) were reviewed. Special attention was given to mass lesions, calcified lymph nodes, bronchi and bronchial stenosis. Results: Abnormal chest x-rays were observed in 93 % of patients with bronchial anthracofibrosis; patchy consolidation was the most prevalent finding. The most significant CT finding was lymph node calcification (80 %, odds ratio = 22. 9), followed by bronchial calcification and bronchial stenosis (odds ratio = 6 and 2. 91, respectively). Other significant findings were mass-lik...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anthracosis is {{the black}} pigment {{discoloration}} of bronchi with an unknown cause which can cause bronchial destruction and deformity (anthracofibrosis). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the frequency of tuberculosis in anthracosis and evaluate their association. Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects with bronchoscopy diagnosis of <b>simple</b> <b>anthracosis,</b> anthracofibrosis and non-anthracotic control groups entered this study. Demographic data and important clinical and radiological findings were recorded. Bronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed for further cytopathologi-cal, acid-fast bacilli staining and culture in all cases. Results: Cough and dyspnea were significantly higher in anthracosis subjects. Radiological characteristic of tuberculosis such as upper lobe localization and cavity were not significantly higher in anthracosis subjects that suffer from tuberculosis. Laboratory test for tuberculosis showed positive acid fast bacilli in 17. 5 and 25 % and caseating granuloma in 20 and 17. 5 % of anthracosis and anthracofibrosis subjects. Adding the result of culture, the frequency of tuberculosis in both groups of anthracosis was 27. 5 % that was significantly more than non-anthracotic control group (Odd ratio = 6. 15, CL= 1. 29 <OR< 40. 06). Conclusion: Anthracosis and tuberculosis showed a significant association. Anti-tuberculosis therapy promised better treatment of anthracosis in subjects proved to suffer from tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Approximately one {{thousand}} coal miners working in dusty environment for 5 years {{and over in}} Hokkaido were examined on the occurrence of pneumoconiosis by means of mass roentgenography and of cardio-pulmonary function tests. Results obtained in this survey were as follows; (1) The presence of disease was detected in the following proportions; Coal miner's pneumoconiosis 27. 6 %, Simple antracosis 11. 2 %, Minimal stage of anthraco-silicosis 6. 8 %, Initial stage 7. 6 %, Moderate stage 1. 4 %, Advanced stage 0. 6 %. (2) Prevalence of coal-miner's pneumoconiosis rose {{in accordance with the}} rise of their age and with the increase in the duration of the period of their engagement, but the tendency of such rises of the prevalence was definitely sharper in the younger workers. The same relation was observed also in the cases of anthracosilicosis, (3) Minimal and initial stages of anthracosilicosis were recognized in relatively early periods after engagement and also in younger ages, but the moderate and advanced cases were detected in the workers who had been engaged in work over 10 years and also in those of 45 years and over. (4) Prevalence of anthracosilicosis was higher in the rockdrillers and in those who had been working in metal mines in the past than in the coal cutters and attendant labours but a certain individual disposition for the occurrence of anthracosilicosis also seemed to exist, (5) Complication of pulmonary tuberculosis increased remarkably with the advance of anthracosilicosis, but such complications were rare in <b>simple</b> <b>anthracosis.</b> (6) Vital capacity, respiratory change of the chest, diminished definitely with the advance of the disease, on the contrary, the maximum blood pressure tended to increase...|$|E
