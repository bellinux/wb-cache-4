500|$|The {{director}} duo Abbas–Mustan {{took inspiration}} from National Basketball Association player Kobe Bryant, {{who was accused}} of rape by a fan; they began developing the film when they read about his sexual-assault case in the newspapers. About the film's unusual title, they <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "aitraaz" [...] was colloquial and suited the subject. Shyam Goel and Shiraz Ahmed wrote the screenplay. Hussain A. Burmawala and R. Verman were responsible for film editing and art direction, respectively.|$|E
500|$|There was one {{unlikely}} theory {{based on}} a story on miscommunication. According to the story, James Brooke arrived in Kuching on his yacht [...] "Royalist." [...] He then asked his local guide about {{the name of the}} town. The local guide mistakenly thought that Brooke was pointing towards a cat, and so had <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Kuching." [...] However, ethnic Malays in Sarawak usually use the term [...] "pusak" [...] for cats, instead of the Malay word [...] "kucing".|$|E

500|$|Christopher Lloyd {{was cast}} as Doc Brown {{after the first}} choice, John Lithgow, became unavailable. Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984), {{producer}} Neil Canton suggested him for the part. Lloyd originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife. He improvised some of his scenes, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown pronounces gigawatts as [...] "jigawatts", which was the way a physicist <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script, rather than with an initial hard [...] "g", although both pronunciations are acceptable. Doc Brown's notable hunch came about because at 6'1" [...] Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 5'5", and they needed to look closer in height.|$|E
500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the defendant in an appeal of murder. If the defendant was taken in the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong evidence of guilt that there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, he or she could decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, and if he was still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|E
500|$|... "The F Word" [...] was {{considered}} particularly controversial, even by South Park standards {{due to the}} excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "fag". The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "The F Word" [...] marks a return of South Parks tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said [...] "The F Word" [...] served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not. Ramsey Isler of IGN compared [...] "The F Word" [...] to [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson", an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur [...] "nigger". However, Isler said [...] "The F Word" [...] was not as skillfully crafted as the [...] "Jesse Jackson" [...] episode and, although some moments were entertaining, the episode [...] "had a habit of running some gags into the ground". James Hibberd, of The Live Feed, said he found the episode [...] "well-intended and funny", and that it forced viewers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, [...] "This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "fag" [...] has not lost its associations with homosexuals, so she did not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode [...] "preachy", and said, [...] "It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Pacific War, {{the captain}} of the renamed ship issued {{standing}} orders if any man on the boat <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Squalus", he was to be marooned at the next port of call. This led to crew members referring to their ship as [...] "Squailfish". That went over almost as well; a court martial was threatened for anyone heard using it.|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 2010, Margera was {{allegedly}} attacked {{with a baseball}} bat outside of his bar, The Note. Margera spent the night at Crozer-Chester Medical Center, where he was treated for head injuries. According to the alleged assailant, Elizabeth Ray, it was because Margera allegedly called her a nigger. Ray denies attacking Margera. Margera denies having <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> claiming [...] "I called her a crazy bitch and an idiot, but I definitely didn't use the n-word".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 the Associated Press Stylebook was {{revised to}} advise against using non-clinical words with the suffix -phobia, {{including}} homophobia, in [...] "political and social contexts." [...] AP Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> homophobia suggests a severe mental disorder, {{and that it}} could be substituted with [...] "anti-gay" [...] or similar phrasing. The AP's decision was criticized in some media outlets, especially those in the LGBT area, who argued that homophobia did not necessarily have to be interpreted in a strict clinical sense.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2013 an {{audiotape}} {{was released on}} YouTube of Clem voicing a commercial for Vermont Teddy Bear. In this commercial Clem is heard making racist remarks; he denied being racist and said: [...] "I never <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in that manner, ever." [...] He believed that the audio was leaked from [...] "someone who had access to [...] world" [...] and that audio bits were taken from recordings when he worked at Clear Channel. Clem's company, Bubba Radio Network, ordered {{the removal of the}} video from YouTube, although it is now hosted on TMZ.|$|E
2500|$|Griffin hosted CNN's New Year's Eve Broadcast on December 31, 2009, {{along with}} Anderson Cooper. As Cooper {{talked about the}} Balloon boy hoax, Griffin <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "fucking" [...] while making fun of the {{pronunciation}} of Falcon Heene, the six-year-old boy who {{was said to have}} been trapped in the balloon gondola. Although Griffin was rumored to be banned from future CNN broadcasts, she has co-hosted the show with Cooper every year since. CNN terminated Griffin from their New Year's Eve Broadcast in 2017, after Griffin posted pictures of herself holding a bloody, decapitated model head resembling President Donald Trump.|$|E
2500|$|Scopes {{was found}} guilty and fined $100 ($ in [...] ), but the verdict was {{overturned}} on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity, as national reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow, the famed defense attorney, spoke for Scopes. The trial publicized the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy, which set Modernists, who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against Fundamentalists, who <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen as both a theological contest and a trial on whether [...] "modern science" [...] should be taught in schools.|$|E

2500|$|The State {{argued in}} its first charge of {{corruption}} that Shaik had paid Zuma R1.2 million (US$185,000) to further a [...] "general corrupt relationship." [...] To prove this charge, the State gave evidence of all the financial transactions between Shaik and Zuma. The State's first witness for this charge was Shaik's former secretary, Bianca Singh, who gave testimony while accompanied by three bodyguards. She stated that [...] "Zuma was quite close to Shaik. They would speak {{on the phone and}} he would come to visit." [...] She also testified that Shaik arranged financial affairs for Zuma, managed his bank accounts on the computer, and discussed his financial situation with him. She concluded by saying that she knew that Shaik <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Zuma often because she often overheard him while he was on the phone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975 Genie {{began to}} use a {{different}} type of serial verb construction, in sentences such as [...] "I like go ride Miss F. car". Curtiss noted that all of these were first-person utterances, that she almost never <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> I, and that she frequently used standalone verbs, such as go, which typically precede a second verb; although in several cases she said go ride and go walk, Curtiss thought Genie may have treated these as single words and were therefore not as complicated as they appeared. In addition, all of these sentences were in verb–(verb–verb phrase) form which Curtiss argued had no hierarchical structure, although an outside analysis argued they had contained some degree of hierarchy. In non-test settings during early 1975 Genie gave some indications, including one verbal response to David Rigler, that she grasped conditional sentences, but Curtiss said she could not be completely certain. Curtiss also noted that, despite the fact that Genie clearly understood contractions, she did not use any in her speech.|$|E
2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When she wanted to talk about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E

Craig and Bentley denied that Bentley had <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> while <b>the</b> police officers testified that he had said them. Further, Bentley's counsel argued {{that even if he}} had <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> it could not be proven that Bentley had intended <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to mean <b>the</b> informal meaning of [...] "shoot him, Chris" [...] instead of the literal meaning of [...] "give him the gun, Chris".|$|R
