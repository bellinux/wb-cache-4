Accounts {{of the food}} vary, some calling it spicy while others said it was bland. Lennon described the food as [...] "lousy", while Pattie Boyd says it was delicious. Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds, whole wheat dough baked over a fire, spiced eggplant, potatoes that had been picked locally, and, for breakfast, cornflakes, toast and coffee. [...] Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses: [...] "The food was impossible for me, because I'm allergic to <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> so I took two suitcases with me: one of clothes and one of Heinz beans" [...] and eggs.

The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things,</b> it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E

50|$|Horace Poolaw was a {{photographer}} {{in a time}} of huge transition for Native American People. He was able to document this huge transition from the inside. His photographs differ significantly from photographs taken at the same places and same times from non-Natives. Poolaw was able to show Natives in day-to-day life. He photographed Kiowa women in the latest fashion as well as Kiowas in cars with headdresses. Horace was able to capture the transition of children being taken into boarding school. They had their worn Native clothing when they arrived and transition was drastic - they transformed into boarding school children in their new hard shoes and military uniforms, as well as the cutting of the hair that represented <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> spiritual <b>things</b> in Native culture. Poolaw was capturing the transition from the inside out as opposed to the official documentation by the government. Horace Poolaw captured the truth in the transition, which makes his photography so precious. He visually proved how adaptable Native people really are.|$|R

Most of the foods like vegetables contain bacteria that could be pathogenic and we may be infected because of these bacteria. Even we wash them very carefully; bacteria can locate in our kitchen countertops and can be transmitted to us. So the focus {{of this study is to}} find out which type of five different countertops provides the most hygienic environment for mankind. The aim of this experiment is to compare total number of different types of bacteria due to different types of countertops. Since infeasibility to examine every types of countertop in the world, five most common types of countertops which are; granite, laminate, polished chipboard, marble and formica are choosen for the experiment. In this experiment; the mean total number of different types of bacteria that was grown over granite, laminate, marble, formica and polished chipboard is respectively 203. 2, 77. 2, 76. 8, 59. 8 and 35. 6.

She is like the sailor who boasted (only she never boasts) that, if he had but a long life and a strong knife, he would build St. Paul's Cathedral before he was done. And Madam How has a very long life, and plenty of time; and one of the strongest of all her tools is water.

6000|$|... "Many {{people think}} that it is {{possible}} to conduct a victorious campaign with the single watchword 'Down with Socialism.' Well, I am not fond of mere negatives. I do not like fighting an abstract noun. My objection to Anti-Socialism as a platform is that Socialism means <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things.</b> On this point I agree with Mr. Asquith. I will wait before I denounce Socialism till I see what form it takes... Socialism is not necessarily synonymous with robbery. Correctly used, the word only signifies a particular view of the proper relation of the State to its citizens, a tendency to substitute public for private ownership, or to restrict the freedom of individual enterprise in the interests of the public. But there are some forms of property which we all admit should be public and not private, and the freedom of individual enterprise is already limited by a hundred laws. Socialism and Individualism,--I am not fond of these abstract phrases. There are opposing principles which enter in various proportions into the constitution of every civilized society. It is merely a question of degree. One community is more Socialistic than another. The same community is more Socialistic at one time than at another. This country is far more Socialistic than it was fifty years ago, and for most of the changes in that direction the Unionist or Tory Party is responsible." ...|$|E

You tell me that the various brands of socialists differ so much in their beliefs about this future that the bewildered layman can make nothing at all of their theories. Very well. They differ so much because there are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> we can do with this human race.... The defeat of death; the life period advancing to ten-score years all crowded with happy activity. The solution of labor's problem; increasing safety and decreasing hours of toil, and a way out for the unhappy consumer who is ground between labor and capital. A real democracy and the love of work that shall come when work is not relegated to wage-slaves, but joyously shared in a community inclusive of the living beings of all nations. France and Germany uniting precisely as Saxony and Prussia and Bavaria have united. And, most of all, a general realization that the fact that we cannot accomplish all these things at once does not indicate that they are hopeless; an understanding that one of the wonders of the future {{is the fact that we}} shall always, in all ages, have improvements to look forward to.|$|E

60|$|Some {{like to be}} one thing, some another. There {{is so much to}} be done, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>things</b> to do, so many trades! Shepherds, soldiers, sailors, ploughmen, carters--one {{could go}} on all day naming without getting to the end of them. For myself, boy and man, I have been many things, working for a living, and {{sometimes}} doing things just for pleasure; but somehow, whatever I did, it never seemed quite the right and proper thing to do--it never quite satisfied me. I always wanted to do something else--I wanted to be a carpenter. It seemed to me that to stand among wood-shavings and sawdust, making things at a bench with bright beautiful tools out of nice-smelling wood, was the cleanest, healthiest, prettiest work that any man can do. Now all this has nothing, or very little, to do with my story: I only spoke of it because I had to begin somehow, and it struck me that I would make a start that way. And for another reason, too. His father was a carpenter. I mean Martin's father--Martin, the Little Boy Lost. His father's name was John, and he was a very good man and a good carpenter, and he loved to do his carpentering better than anything else; in fact as much as I should have loved it if I had been taught that trade. He lived in a seaside town, named Southampton, where there is a great harbour, where he saw great ships coming and going to and {{from all parts of the}} world. Now, no strong, brave man can live in a place like that, seeing the ships and often talking to the people who voyaged in them about the distant lands where they had been, without wishing to go and see those distant countries for himself. When it is winter in England, and it rains and rains, and the east wind blows, and it is grey and cold and the trees are bare, who does not think how nice it would be to fly away like the summer birds to some distant country where the sky is always blue and the sun shines bright and warm every day? And so it came to pass that John, at last, when he was an old man, sold his shop, and went abroad. They went to a country many thousands of miles away--for you must know that Mrs. John went too; and when the sea voyage ended, they travelled many days and weeks in a wagon until they came to the place where they wanted to live; and there, in that lonely country, they built a house, and made a garden, and planted an orchard. It was a desert, and they had no neighbours, but they were happy enough because they had as much land as they wanted, and the weather was always bright and beautiful; John, too, had his carpenter's tools to work with when he felt inclined; and, best of all, they had little Martin to love and think about.|$|E
