[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Yerel yönetimlerin önemi bütün dünyada her geçen gün artmaktadır. Yerel halkın ortak ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak amacıyla özerk kamu tüzel kişileri olarak kurulmuş olan yerel yönetimler, demokrasinin olgunlaşmasında ve yerleşmesinde son derece önemli roller üstlenmişlerdir. Bunda en önemli etken yerel yönetimlerin yerel hizmetleri daha iyi karşılayabilme avantajlarının ve demokrasinin gelişmesinde oynadığı etkin rolün anlaşılması olmuştur. Bu nedenle yerel yönetimler, yerine getirmiş oldukları hizmetler ve ülkenin demokratikleşmesi açısından büyük önem taşımaktadırlar. Türkiye‟de planlı dönemden beri gerek merkezi yönetimin gerekse yerel yönetimlerin idari yapılarını ve işleyişlerini düzenleyen birçok idari reform projesi uygulanmasına rağmen yerel yönetimlerin plan yapma konusundaki sorunlarını giderecek kapsamlı bir çalışma yapılmamıştır. Türk kamu yönetiminde global dönüşüme paralel olarak gerçekleşen reform, il özel idarelerinin yapısında da önemli bir değişimi beraberinde getirmiştir. Reformla birlikte il özel idarelerinin uzun zamandır sahip olduğu yapıdan, gerek yönetim anlayışı gerekse idari uygulamalar açısından ayrıldığı görülmüştür. İl özel idareleri açısından son dönemlerde yaşanan en önemli, değişim, 3360 sayılı İl Özel İdaresi Kanununun yürürlükten kaldırılıp, 5302 sayılı İl Özel İdaresi Kanununun konulmasıdır. Yeni il özel idaresi kanunu ile il özel idarelerinin kuruluşu, organları, yönetimi, görev, yetki ve sorumlulukları ile çalışma usul ve esasları yeniden düzenlenmiştir. Bu kanun, il özel idareleri için birçok yeniliği de beraberinde getirmiştir. Üst ölçekli planlarda yetki karmaşasından kaynaklı sorunların çözümü için de kararların alındığı 22. 02. 2005 tarih ve 5302 sayılı “İl Özel İdaresi Kanunu” ile il özel idarelerine üst ölçek fiziki plan yapma yetkisi yanında yerel fiziki plan yapma yetkisi de verilmiştir. Yeni kanun ile belediye sınırı ve mücavir alan sınırı dışında kalan alanlarda “Uygulama İmar Planı ve Nazım İmar Planı” yapma yetkisine sahipken, il sınırında ise İl Çevre Düzeni Planı” yapma yetkisini elde etmiştir. Bu çalışma, yerel yönetimlerin bir ayağı olan il özel idarelerinin söz konusu yeni düzenlemelerle ilgili olarak; sürece adaptasyonu ve sorunların üstesinden gelip, elindeki yetkiyi tam anlamıyla kullanıp kullanamadığının bir araştırmasını içermektedir. İncelemede il özel idareleri ile ilgili teorik bilgiler yer alırken, yapılan alan çalışması ile de çalışmanın pratik kısmı desteklenmiştir. Çalışma yöntemi olarak anket uygulamasına gidilmiştir. İl özel idareleri ve planlama yetkileri konulu, toplamda 20 sorudan oluşan, bir anket hazırlanmıştır. Anket kapsamında ülke sınırı çalışma sınırı olarak kabul edilmiş ve hazırlanan anketler posta yolu ile bütün il özel idarelerine gönderilmiştir. Ülke genelinde katılımın % 70 gibi ciddi bir orana ulaşmış olduğu ankette, İl özel idarelerinin planlamada karar alma süreci, karar merciinin yapısı, eğitim düzeyi, planlama kadrosu, teknik eleman kapasitesi, il özel idareleri ile diğer kamu kurumlarının planlama konusunda ilişkisi, planlama noktasında bu gün gelmiş oldukları nokta, yapılan plan türleri, teşkilat yapısı analiz edilmiştir. The {{importance}} of local governments {{all over the}} world is increasing every day. Local governments which are extremely important role in the maturation of democracy, has been established as an autonomous public entities, In order to meet the common needs of the local population The most important factor in this, the advantages of local governments and its effective role on the development of democracy have been recognized. Since the planned period in Türkey, both the central government and local governments applied to many administrative reform project that regulate the functioning and administrative structures, but there was no any comprehensive study to resolve the planning problems of local governments Held in parallel with the global transformation of the Turkish public administration reform, has brought an important change in the structure of <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations.</b> In this process, the long-accepted and implemented structures of the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> have also changed in terms of understanding of management and administrative practices. The most important change in the recent period from the ponit of view the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> is the repaeling of the the <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administration</b> code numbered 3360 and promulgation of the the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> code numbered 5302 trought the new <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> code; the establishment, organs, administrations, task, authorizations, responsibilities, working methods and essential were re-organized.

Types of plans in the planning system that is socio-economic plans, senior fziki plans and local physical plans examined in this sub-headings. Hierarchy and authority of planning system consist of what kind of connection between the plans, when making a plan which other plans become important and include theorical knowledges of which institutions do what kind of plan. Understanding of management and planning system from Turkey mentioned in the third chapter. Management system in Turkey consists of two parts, the first central administration, and the other local administration system. Centralized management and decentralized management is the opposite of each other, but complete each other s weaknesses. For this reason, the form of government cannot completely be neighter a centralized administration nor local administration, may be the dominant one another, but the sysyem must have boht. The fourth chapters, <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations,</b> which have also been the main subject of study in this chapter are carried out by a unit of local government. In this section, the historical development of the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations,</b> organizational structure, organs, financial structure, norms, staff evaluated in this section. In the fifth chapter, <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> and planning authorities are discussed in details. New <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> law gives authority to make plans. According to this new law, <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> make the provincial environment plan in the province and development plan in the municipality and adjacent areas outside the boundary. This study has come into being by the new <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> of Law, which consist of planning authorities. The main subject of this thesis is <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> and its planning power. Sixth chapter is {{the last part of the}} study, consist of questionnaire survey the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> in Turkey. The answers of the questionnaire survey provide researcher to make a good decision for the main hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. In order to Questionnaires were prepared to answer the questions of hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. Scope of the study; firstly, a main hypothesis determined. In addition, four sub-hypotheses were determined, in order to reach the right conclusion about the main hypotheses. Sub-hypotheses discuss the situation about decision making mechanism, organizational structure and staff of the norm, plan status Main hypothesis is as follows: H 0 = <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administrations</b> in Turkey, dated 02. 22. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administrations</b> given planning powers of entry into force of the law since 2005, has used effectively. H 1 = <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administrations</b> in Turkey, dated 02. 22. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administrations</b> given planning powers of entry into force of the law since 2005,not used effectively. As a result; based on the assumptions of the sub-hypotheses, main hypotheses was rejected. Result of the sub- hypotheses; decision-makers‟ inadequate technical knowledge about planning principles, spending long time to establish planning departmants in provincial private administration, insufficient and inadequate urban planner in <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations,</b> until today no provincial environmental scheme plan at most of the provinces, local physical planning problems cause of technical deficiencies These results show that, <b>Special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> in Turkey, dated. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administrations</b> planning powers given to the law coming into force in 2005, not used effectively. Evaluation of their own in the planning system in Turkey, we will accept as the law of planning, the main addition to the Law number 3194, again depending on the law, with a very special purpose registration law was enacted. At this point, the <b>Special</b> Provincial <b>Administration</b> Law No. 5302 is one of them. Within the scope of this law, the most important pillar of the upper scale spatial planning provincial environmental scheme plan construction are given <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations.</b> With the power of municipalities to plan their almost grown, research findings show that the use of this power lasted <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations.</b> So main Hypothesis H 0 is rejected within the scope of the research.

40|$|Transferring {{of public}} library {{services}} to the local administrations {{is one of the}} issues that are constantly on the agenda in recent years in Turkey. Discussions about this issue generally come to a conclusion that favorable conditions for the transferring of public libraries have not occurred yet. In those discussions also, it is emphasized that necessary legal arrangements must be made and adequate conditions have to be provided for the local administrations in the fields of budget, personnel and infrastructure etc. before the transferring takes place. As the latest point reached in, according to the draft law related to the transferring which is a long-awaited one in Parliament, the 81 province public libraries and central district public libraries that are connected to the metropolis cities will remain under the administration of Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, General Directorate of Libraries and Publications but remaining district public libraries will be transferred to the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations.</b> The aim of the study is “to determine whether there are appropriate conditions or not for the realization of the transferring in terms of the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> by getting opinions of <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> directors about the transferring of the public libraries to the special provincial administrations”. This research covers a total of 162 <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> including 81 cities and 81 districts in Turkey. Within the scope of the research, surveys were posted to 162 administration directors and 125 of them participated in the research with their answers. Hypothesis of the study was developed as follows; “special provincial administration directors in Turkey think that the transferring of the public libraries to the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> will not change the public libraries’ current situation. Results of the research show that most of the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administration</b> directors in Turkey are unwilling to the transferring of public libraries to the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> in the existing conditions. The directors think that legal arrangements to draw a special frame for these services should be made and a planned process should be monitored applying pilot studies before the transferring takes place. The directors also believe that no change will occur in the public library services in general and the public libraries will generate unnecessary work loads for the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> in case of the transferring. Besides, positively, directors think that the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> will give adequate support and importance to the public libraries and they will not have a problem in fulfilling their responsibilities for them in case of the realization of the transferring. The issue of the transferring of the public libraries to the <b>special</b> provincial <b>administrations</b> should be discussed by experts, professional people and institutions in the field, after building of a legal infrastructure related to the subject, the decision should be made on the basis of scientific data...|$|R
