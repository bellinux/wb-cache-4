25|$|The ancient Greeks {{perceived}} {{order in}} the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies {{and the development of}} democracy. At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which {{is the product of a}} continual search for perfection, rather than a <b>simple</b> <b>application</b> of a set of working rules.|$|E

25|$|Researchers in {{the field}} do not agree on a theory for cold fusion. One {{proposal}} considers that hydrogen and its isotopes can be absorbed in certain solids, including palladium hydride, at high densities. This creates a high partial pressure, reducing the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough {{by a factor of}} ten to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment. It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower potential barrier could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a <b>simple</b> <b>application</b> of Coulomb's law. Electron screening of the positive hydrogen nuclei by the negative electrons in the palladium lattice was suggested to the 2004 DOE commission, but the panel found the theoretical explanations not convincing and inconsistent with current physics theories.|$|E

Over time, these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity, causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top. However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also diffuse back up towards the top of the bottle. Once equilibrium has been reached, the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of buoyant mass mb.

2500|$|Frattini's {{argument}} {{shows that}} a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group. [...] A slight generalization known as Burnside's fusion theorem states that if G is a finite group with Sylow p-subgroup P and two subsets A and B normalized by P, then A and B are G-conjugate {{if and only if}} they are NG(P)-conjugate. [...] The proof is a <b>simple</b> <b>application</b> of Sylow's theorem: If B=Ag, then the normalizer of B contains not only P but also Pg (since Pg is contained in the normalizer of Ag). [...] By Sylow's theorem P and Pg are conjugate not only in G, but in the normalizer of B. [...] Hence gh−1 normalizes P for some h that normalizes B, and then A'gh−1 = Bh−1 = B, so that A and B are NG(P)-conjugate. [...] Burnside's fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a semidirect product: if G is a finite group whose Sylow p-subgroup P is contained in the center of its normalizer, then G has a normal subgroup K of order coprime to P, G = PK and P∩K = {1}, that is, G is p-nilpotent.|$|E
