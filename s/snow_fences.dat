5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
25|$|During 2015, the MBTA {{implemented}} its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much {{of which}} focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The section of the Braintree Branch between JFK/UMass and Wollaston had old infrastructure and is largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. New third rail with heaters and a different metal composition to reduce wear was installed along with <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> and switch heaters. The work required bustitution of the line from JFK/UMass to North Quincy on many weeknights. The program did not include work south of Wollaston.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop a new <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> with the airfoil snow plates for the {{prevention}} of snowdrifts and improvement of visibility on roadways. The design was in accordance with aerodynamic principles, and its performance was evaluated in a wind tunnel test in which natural snow was used to simulate blowing-snow. In general, the snowdrifts and visibility blockage behind the <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> was caused by the alternate rolling-up of the bottom gap flow and the shear layer separated from the top of <b>snow</b> <b>fence.</b> It was found that the alternate rolling-up of the bottom gap flow and the shear layer separated from the top of <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> could be prevented by using airfoil snow plates. On the basis of this finding, the airfoil snow plates with an optimum configuration were designed for the prevention of alternate rolling-up of their flows. Consequently, the developed new type <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> with the airfoil snow plates plates had a high performance in preventing snowdrifts and improving visibility in comparison with the conventional <b>snow</b> <b>fence...</b>|$|R

In the previous report, {{it was found that the}} developed new type <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> with the airfoil snow plates had a high performance in preventing snowdrifts and improving visibility in comparison with the conventional <b>snow</b> <b>fence.</b> In this report, the characteristics of aerodynamic fluid forces and the flow-induced vibrations of the airfoil snow plates was investigated. Important results from the present study were that (i) the fluctuating fluid forces acting on the airfoil snow plates which set up the topmost part of the <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> was the most values in all of them, (ii) the flow-induced vibrations in the airfoil snow plate attached on the topmost part was generated, and then become divergent, (iii) the fluctuating fluid forces and the flow-induced vibrations of the airfoil snow plate were completely suppressed when a perforated plate was attached at the top part of the <b>snow</b> <b>fence...</b>|$|R

25|$|Apart {{from being}} the easiest Munro, Càrn Aosda also has the {{reputation}} as {{being one of the}} most despoiled, with the mountain having <b>snow</b> <b>fences,</b> ski tow supports, huts and vehicle tracks right up to the summit as part of the Glenshee ski centre. The mountain has four pistes on its slopes, there is a run for beginners plus two for intermediate level on the easier slopes which go south from the summit into Butchart’s Corrie. There is a piste ranked as difficult on the steeper slopes of the eastern shoulder. There are also three towbar lifts on the southern slopes to service the ski runs one of which goes past the 900 metre mark to just a few metres from the summit.|$|E
25|$|Preventative {{measures}} {{are employed in}} areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people, such as ski resorts, mountain towns, roads, and railways. There {{are several ways to}} prevent avalanches and lessen their power and destruction; active preventative measures reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while passive measures reinforce and stabilize the snowpack in situ. The simplest active measure is repeatedly traveling on a snowpack as snow accumulates; this can be by means of boot-packing, ski-cutting, or machine grooming. Explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery. Passive preventive systems such as <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> and light walls can be used to direct the placement of snow. Snow builds up around the fence, especially the side that faces the prevailing winds. Downwind of the fence, snow buildup is lessened. This is caused by the loss of snow at the fence that would have been deposited and the pickup of the snow that is already there by the wind, which was depleted of snow at the fence. When there is a sufficient density of trees, they can greatly reduce the strength of avalanches. They hold snow in place and when there is an avalanche, the impact of the snow against the trees slows it down. Trees can either be planted or they can be conserved, such as in the building of a ski resort, to reduce the strength of avalanches.|$|E

2500|$|The line {{north of}} the {{junction}} at Stanley was single track, resulting in delays, especially after trains had waited for connections at Perth. From 1890, the signalling system using telegraph orders was replaced by electric tablets, later automatic tablet exchange systems were used. The [...] climb out of Inverness was doubled in 1898, and [...] of line widened over the Grampians between 1901 and 1909. Snow could close the line for days during the winter, and <b>snow</b> <b>fences</b> were erected beside the railway. The Highland had three types of snow plough; a small one that was fitted to locomotives, now capable of hauling trains through [...] drifts. If the snow was less than [...] deep, a pilot engine with a larger plough would precede the train. An even larger plough could be used {{with three or four}} locomotives coupled together. Dava Moor and the cuttings near Druimuachdar summit were troublesome, although the line over the summit improved after it had been doubled.|$|E
50|$|Snow bridges may superficially look {{similar to}} <b>snow</b> <b>fences,</b> but they act differently. <b>Snow</b> <b>fences</b> are built {{vertically}} and accumulate snow on their downwind side, while snow bridges are slanted or horizontal and hold snow on their top side.|$|E
50|$|Snow {{farming is}} the use of obstacles, {{equipment}} and knowledge about management of snow in order to strategically manipulate snow coverage. Often this is done for the purpose of skiing or even preventing snow drift in certain areas like roads. The most popular obstacle is the <b>snow</b> <b>fence,</b> which is used to create drifts and collect more snow in a given area than would otherwise naturally occur. The snow can be moved to other areas and groomed {{with the use of a}} snow groomer. Sometimes the <b>snow</b> <b>fence</b> is readily movable in order to maximize the collection of blown snow, despite wind direction changes.|$|R
