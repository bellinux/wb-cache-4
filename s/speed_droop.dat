50|$|Next to the inertia {{given by}} the {{parallel}} operation of synchronous generators, the frequency <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> is the primary instantaneous parameter in control of an individual power plant's power output (kW).|$|E
5000|$|For stable {{operation}} of the electrical grid of North America, power plants typically operate with a four or five percent <b>speed</b> <b>droop.</b> [...] By definition, with 5% droop the full-load speed is 100% and the no-load speed is 105%.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the use of}} {{automatic}} generation control, one generating unit in a system would be designated as the regulating unit and would be manually adjusted to control the balance between generation and load to maintain system frequency at the desired value. The remaining units would be controlled with <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> to share the load in proportion to their ratings. With automatic systems, many units in a system can participate in regulation, reducing wear on a single unit's controls and improving overall system efficiency, stability, and economy.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimentally}} validated simulation code is used {{to study}} the development and contribution of various friction components during turbocharged diesel engine transients. This is accomplished {{with the use of}} a recently proposed detailed friction model. Mean friction mean effective pressure modelling is found to considerably underestimate actual friction around firing TDC, leading to lower <b>speed</b> <b>droops</b> for abrupt load increases. The piston rings assembly contribution is dominant for the particular engine, due to its high number of piston rings and its low crankshaft speed. The model can be used to investigate such interesting cases as the effect of engine oil temperature on engine transient response, or the variation of oil film thickness during a cycle or a transient event.

40|$|Abstract – SolvSim Power Station is {{a unique}} {{hardware-in-the-loop}} simulator, which {{makes it possible to}} test <b>speed</b> <b>droop,</b> speed governor time constant and island operation capability when the power station is synchronized to the main grid. The simulator is adopted to fit all types of power stations and is a suitable tool for the power system operator to use when validating ancillary services. Tests show that the <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> can vary considerably with the loading. It also emphasizes the need to perform island operation tests as faults in the power station and improper parameter settings can be discovered...|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} {{of a program}} to conduct digital controls research for small turboshaft engines is on engine test evaluation of advanced control logic using a flexible microprocessor based digital control system designed specifically for research on advanced control logic. Control software is stored in programmable memory. New control algorithms may be stored in a floppy disk and loaded directly into memory. This feature facilitates comparative evaluation of different advanced control modes. The central processor in the digital control is an Intel 8086 16 bit microprocessor. Control software is programmed in assembly language. Software checkout is accomplished prior to engine test by connecting the digital control to a real time hybrid computer simulation of the engine. The engine currently installed in the facility has a hydromechanical control modified to allow electrohydraulic fuel metering and VG actuation by the digital control. Simulation results are presented which show that the modern control reduces the transient rotor <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> caused by unanticipated load changes such as cyclic pitch or wind gust transients...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of wind turbines currently in operation have the conventional concept design. That is a single-rotor wind turbine (SRWT) which is connected through spur gearbox to a generator. Recently, dual-rotor wind turbine (DRWT) {{has been introduced}} to the market. It has been proven that the steady state performance of the DRWT system for extracting energy {{is better than the}} SRWT. But, a comparison of fault-ride-through capability of these two types of turbines requires further research. In this paper, the fault-ride-through capability of DRWT and SRWT are evaluated and compared when generating units are operating at constant pitch angle and constant speed modes. Constant pitch angle mode is simulated to investigate the natural damping of DRWT and SRWT. To verify the time domain simulation results, damping characteristics of DRWT and SRWT are also compared through eigenvalue analysis and <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> characteristics of the control system. The accuracy of the aerodynamic model of the DRWT is enhanced by including the stream tube effect in the simulation. It was uncovered that DRWT introduces higher damping torque to the network in both constant speed and constant pitch angle modes. This advantage improves the transient performance of DRWT-based wind farms...|$|E

50|$|In {{electrical}} power generation, <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> {{control is a}} speed control mode of a prime mover driving a synchronous generator connected to an electrical grid. This mode allows synchronous generators to run in parallel, so that loads are shared among generators in proportion to their power rating.|$|R
50|$|Load can {{be shared}} among {{parallel}} running generators through load sharing. Load sharing {{can be achieved by}} using <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control controlled by the frequency at the generator, while it constantly adjusts the engine fuel control to shift load to and from the remaining power sources. A diesel generator will take more load when the fuel supply to its combustion system is increased, while load is released if fuel supply is decreased.|$|R
30|$|The operational-control {{criteria}} used for system frequency analysis {{is a specific}} criteria which is mainly a personal version of the GB Security and Quality of Supply Standards (GB SQSS) [17]. The following assumptions are used: ① the level of infrequency loss of power infeed is set up to 1800 GW, and frequency response must avoid a deviation of the system frequency outside statutory limit: which range 49.8 – 50.2  Hz for more than 5 cycles, ② the level of normal loss of power infeed is set up to 1.35 GW for frequency response to avoid a deviation in the system frequency by more than 0.20  Hz, ③ the system frequency can rise to 52.0  Hz or fall to 47.0  Hz in exceptional circumstances. If system frequency is over 52.0  Hz, over-frequency relays will trip generators, ④ frequency control devices (or a speed governor) are set up to operate with an overall <b>speed</b> <b>Droop</b> of 4 % (GB SQSS establishes between 3 % and 5 %). In this paper, UFLS is set to start at 49.8  Hz and the plan consists of six load shedding steps of unequal size with {{the total amount of}} load shedding of 0.25 p.u [23]. A delay for each load shedding step is 0.1  s (5 cycles).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling, simulation and practical implementation of an inverter-based diesel generator emulator. The {{main purpose of}} this emulator is {{for the study of}} frequency variations in diesel-based autonomous power systems in a laboratory environment where the operation of a real diesel generator is not possible. The emulator basically consists in a voltage source inverter with a second order output filter which voltage references are given by the model of the diesel generator. The control of the emulator is based on the digital signal processor TMS 320 F 2812, where the mathematical models of the diesel generator and the control of the inverter are computed in real-time. Parameters for the model were obtained from commercially available components. Experimental results for different values of <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> showed that the emulator achieves a satisfactory performance in the transient and stationary response. For the stationary response, the measured frequency deviates from theoretical values with a mean absolute error of: 0. 06 Hz for 0 % droop, 0. 037 Hz for 3 % droop, and 0. 087 Hz for 5 % droop. For the transient response, the measured frequency nadir deviates from simulations in: 0. 05 Hz for 0 % droop, 0. 02 Hz for 3 % droop, and 0. 1 Hz for 5 % droop. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the operation of an indirect injection, naturally aspirated, diesel engine under transient conditions resulting from a rapid increase in load. For this purpose, a single-zone thermodynamic model, following the filling and emptying modelling technique, is developed, which accounts for all basic parts of the thermodynamic engine operation; it also covers the dynamic simulation of the engine with special submodels to model the conservation of energy in the crankshaft, the inertia forces, the governor dynamics and the fuel pump characteristics. Unlike most previous models, the transient operation is not regarded as a series of steady state operating points, but care has been taken for the special characteristics of this unsteady operation. To this aim, analytical expressions were derived for the better simulation of combustion, mechanical friction and governor movement, which during the transient operation behave in a different way than at steady state. The model has been tested favourably (at steady state conditions) against results derived from detailed experimental work conducted at the authors' laboratory. A detailed parametric study is made, which includes the influence of a variety of dynamic and thermodynamic parameters on the transient response of the particular engine, as well as of a four-cylinder one with the same technical characteristics. For the latter case, a special multi-cylinder engine model has been developed, accounting in detail for the solution of the governing differential equations for every cylinder separately. Analytical diagrams for the effect of the operating parameters on the transient operation of the two typical properties of <b>speed</b> <b>droop</b> and recovery period are given, which quantify each parameter's contribution. Finally, the effect of a faulty fuel injection system on one cylinder of the four-cylinder engine is studied, providing important information about the engine's non-optumum operation.

50|$|The grid {{frequency}} is a system-wide indicator of overall power imbalance. For example, it will drop {{if there is}} too much demand because generators will start to slow down slightly. A generator in frequency-response mode will, under nominal conditions, run at reduced output in order to maintain a buffer of spare capacity. It will then continually alter its output on a second-to-second basis {{to the needs of the}} grid with <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control.|$|R
50|$|Small {{deviations}} from the nominal system frequency are very important in regulating individual generators and assessing the equilibrium of the grid as a whole. When the grid is heavily loaded, the frequency slows, and governors adjust their generators so that more power is output (<b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control). When the grid is lightly loaded the grid frequency runs above the nominal frequency, and this is taken as an indication by Automatic Generation Control systems across the network that generators should reduce their output.|$|R
50|$|The bladess of the three-bladed {{main rotor}} are {{attached}} to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under tension. The blade levers are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the collective pitch lever in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational <b>speeds</b> by <b>droop</b> stops, which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.|$|R
40|$|Power System Model to Analyze the Frequency Stability of the Sri Lankan Power System due to Wind Power Penetration Level The National Energy Policy {{published}} by the ministry of power and energy stipulated that by year 2016, energy contribution from non conventional renewable energy dispatch {{to be at least}} 10 % of total generation. Hence relevant government organizations have introduced various incentives to the private sector to do develop the renewable energy sources in the country. This has led to various research activities by entities to study the economic and technical aspects. The incentive provided for the wind power development is the form of tariff by GOSL i. e. the cost at which utility to purchases from the wind developer is the highest among other NCRE’s. Hence there is lots of interest to develop wind power. Wind power output varies depending on the wind speed and also due to uncontrollable nature of its prime mover. It is necessary to study to impact of wind power in the whole system as it will affect the system frequency. This dissertation concentrates on two aspects namely development of power system model to analyze effect on system frequency due to supply- demand unbalance and determination of wind penetration level to the Sri Lankan power system which does not cause significant frequency variations. The Total power system is modeled as a single machine connected to a load. For a more accurate model the generator is split into hydro and thermal separately. The frequency controller of the power system is model explicitly to the power system model. By feeding wind power output variation to the model externally as electrical power change in the system, steady state frequency deviation could be obtained. If we have accurate wind turbine characteristic and the wind speed variation approximately in 1 min interval where wind turbines are located, maximum wind penetration level, which does not cause frequency variations beyond 50 Hz + 1 % can be found from this model. This will be the amount of wind power that system could absorb without having frequency instability but will not be the maximum wind penetration level of the Sri Lankan power system. Normal practice is to operate system with 5 % spinning reserve and keep all the generation except frequency controlling machine at free governor operation with 5 % <b>speed</b> <b>droop.</b> Droop setting of frequency controlling station is maintained at 2 %. These values are included into model to study the impact of frequency deviation. Analysis of the most economical wind penetration limit for the Sri Lankan power system with the required network modification {{is beyond the scope of}} this research...|$|E
50|$|In a {{synchronous}} grid all the generators must {{run at the}} same frequency, and must stay very nearly in phase {{with each other and}} the grid. For rotating generators, a local governor regulates the driving torque, maintaining constant speed as loading changes. <b>Droop</b> <b>speed</b> control ensures that multiple parallel generators share load changes in proportion to their rating. Generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid, because energy is consumed as it is produced. Energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators.|$|R
50|$|During normal {{operation}} in synchronization with the electricity net, powerplants are governed with a five percent <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control. This means the {{full load speed}} is 100% and the no load speed is 105%. This {{is required for the}} stable operation of the net without hunting and dropouts of power plants. Normally the changes in speed are minor. Adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor. Generally this is a basic system requirement for all powerplants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication.|$|R
5000|$|As {{frequency}} {{is fixed}} on the grid, and so actual turbine speed is also fixed, the increase in turbine speed reference will increase the error between reference and actual speed. As the difference increases, fuel flow is increased to increase power output, and vice versa. This type of control {{is referred to as}} [...] "straight proportional" [...] control. If the entire grid tends to be overloaded, the grid frequency and hence actual speed of generator will decrease. All units will see an increase in the speed error, and so increase fuel flow to their prime movers and power output. In this way <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control mode also helps to hold a stable grid frequency. The amount of power produced is strictly proportional to the error between the actual turbine speed and speed reference.|$|R
5000|$|The federal {{government}} of the United States admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare. The United States Department of Homeland Security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the security of control system networks. The {{federal government}} is also working to ensure that security is built in as {{the next generation of}} [...] "smart grid" [...] networks are developed. In April 2009, reports surfaced that China and Russia had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid and left behind software programs {{that could be used to}} disrupt the system, according to current and former national security officials. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyber attack. China denies intruding into the U.S. electrical grid. One countermeasure would be to disconnect the power grid from the Internet and run the net with <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control only. Massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a national trauma.|$|R
30|$|The {{source of}} the above {{assertion}} lies in the need, in our traditional AC grid system, to actively intervene to balance supply and demand, otherwise frequency stability is degraded. In fact, the grid frequency is a system-wide measure of overall power imbalance. For example, if demand becomes too high, thereby drawing excess current through any given electrical power generator, an unavoidable Lorentz braking force is initiated resulting in a decrease in its rotational speed. If the generator is operated in frequency-response mode, whereby it normally runs at reduced output, a buffer of spare capacity is available. In this case the generator can continually alter the power it delivers to the grid on a second-to-second basis using what is termed <b>droop</b> <b>speed</b> control - a feedback signal to the turbine directing it to boost its power. If demand exceeds this level of control it becomes necessary to power up ‘idle’ additional turbine/generator sets. This mode of operation is effective for the power utilities particularly when accurate predictions of the demand profile are available. Needless to say this ‘balancing act’ is deemed to be severely compromised {{by the introduction of}} ‘inflexible’ and ‘intermittent’ renewable sources.|$|R
