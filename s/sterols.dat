5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} <b>sterols,</b> of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all <b>sterols,</b> followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} odor of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{contains}} a unique sterol molecule called volemolide, a derivative {{of the common}} fungal sterol ergosterol that may have application in fungal chemotaxonomy. A 2001 study identified a further nine <b>sterols,</b> three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly oxygenated compounds—similar to <b>sterols</b> found in marine soft coral and sponges—are rare in fungi. The mushroom also contains volemitol (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from the species by the French scientist Émile Bourquelot in 1889. Volemitol occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sterol</b> {{content of}} germinating conidia of the {{opportunistic}} pathogenic fungus AspergilZus fumigatus has been correlated with germination phase {{and sensitivity to}} polyene antibiotics. The <b>sterol</b> and <b>sterol</b> ester contents of walls did not change during germination. The <b>sterol</b> ester content of membranes and cell sap remained constant during germination, whereas the <b>sterol</b> content increased during the outgrowth of germ tubes. On the basis of differential extraction studies {{it was concluded that}} the loss of. resistance to polyenes that occurred {{in the early stages of}} swelling of conidia during germination was not due to a movement of <b>sterol</b> or <b>sterol</b> ester out of the wall. Radioactive-labelling experiments demonstrated that, although the amounts of conidial wall <b>sterol</b> and <b>sterol</b> ester did not change during germination, they were metabolically active. Changes in the turnover rate of wall and membrane <b>sterol</b> and <b>sterol</b> ester during germination were investigated and their relationship to a possible mechanism for the change from resistance to sensitivity to polyene antibiotics is discussed...|$|R

40|$|A Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>sterol</b> auxotroph, FY 3 (alpha hem 1 erg 7 ura), {{was used}} to probe the {{characteristics}} of <b>sterol</b> uptake in S. cerevisiae. The steady-state cellular concentration of free <b>sterol</b> at the late exponential phase of growth could be adjusted within a 10 -fold range by varying the concentration of exogenously supplied <b>sterol.</b> When cultured on 1 microgram of <b>sterol</b> ml- 1, the cells contained a minimal cellular free-cholesterol concentration of 0. 85 nmol/mg (dry weight) and were termed <b>sterol</b> depleted.

40|$|<b>Sterol</b> {{profiles}} of microalgae and their change with environmental conditions are {{of great interest}} in ecological food web research and taxonomic studies alike. Here, we investigated effects of light intensity and phosphorus supply on the <b>sterol</b> content of phytoplankton and assessed potential interactive effects of these important environmental factors on the <b>sterol</b> composition of algae. We identified <b>sterol</b> contents of four common phytoplankton genera, Scenedesmus, Chlamydomonas, Cryptomonas and Cyclotella, and analysed the change in <b>sterol</b> content with varying light intensities in both a highphosphorus and a low-phosphorus approach. <b>Sterol</b> contents increased significantly with increasing light in {{three out of four}} species. Phosphorus-limitation reversed the change of <b>sterol</b> content with light intensity, i. e., <b>sterol</b> content decreased with increasing light at low phosphorus supply. Generally <b>sterol</b> contents were lower in low-phosphorus cultures. In conclusion, both light and phosphorus conditions strongly affect the <b>sterol</b> composition of algae and hence should be considered in ecological and taxonomic studies investigating the biochemical composition of algae.

5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil <b>sterols,</b> to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRegulation of <b>sterol</b> {{biosynthesis}} in {{the terminal}} portion of the pathway represents an efficient mechanism by which the cell can control the production of <b>sterol</b> without disturbing the production of other essential mevalonate pathway products. We demonstrate that mutations affecting early and late steps in <b>sterol</b> homeostasis modulate {{the expression of the}} ERG 3 gene: a late step in <b>sterol</b> biosynthesis in yeast. Expression of ERG 3 is increased in response to a mutation in the major isoform of HMG CoA reductase which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of <b>sterol</b> biosynthesis. Likewise, mutations in non-auxotrophic ergosterol biosynthetic genes downstream of squalene production (erg 2, erg 3, erg 4, erg 5, and erg 6) result in an up-regulation of ERG 3 expression. Deletion analysis of the ERG 3 promoter identified two upstream activation sequences: UAS 1, which when deleted reduces ERG 3 gene expression 3 – 4 -fold but maintains <b>sterol</b> regulation and UAS 2, which when deleted further reduces ERG 3 expression and abolishes <b>sterol</b> regulation. The recent isolation of two yeast genes responsible for the esterification of intracellular <b>sterol</b> (ARE 1 and ARE 2) has enabled us to directly analyze the relationship between <b>sterol</b> esterification and de novo biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that the absence of <b>sterol</b> esterification leads to a decrease in total intracellular <b>sterol</b> and ERG 3 is a target of this negative regulation...|$|R

5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} apricot to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked.

The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several <b>sterols</b> related to ergosterol, some of which are unique to this species.

5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and <b>sterols,</b> through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E
5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and <b>sterols</b> are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E

40|$|The hypocholesterolemic drug {{lovastatin}} (mevinolin) {{was found}} to be very effective in lowering the <b>sterol</b> levels of the wild-type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lovastatin dramatically decreased the steryl ester content from 2. 62 to 0. 8 micrograms/mg (dry weight), whereas the free <b>sterol</b> content decreased only from 2. 79 to 2. 24 micrograms/mg (dry weight) when lovastatin was present in the medium at 10 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations (100 micrograms/ml), lovastatin nearly abolished the accumulation of steryl esters and decreased the free <b>sterol</b> concentration to less than 1. 3 micrograms/mg (dry weight). As a result of the lowered <b>sterol</b> levels, proportional amounts of exogenous <b>sterol</b> were taken up from the medium during aerobic, respiratory conditions. Nearly all of the exogenous <b>sterol</b> taken up was partitioned into the free <b>sterol</b> fraction.

5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus, {{commonly}} known as the bloody milk cap, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. First described from France in 1811, the species was given its current name by Elias Fries in 1838 when he transferred it to Lactarius. Found in Asia, Mediterranean Africa, and Europe, fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under conifers, especially Douglas fir. When bruised or cut, the fruit bodies ooze a blood-red to purple latex that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air. The caps are orangish to reddish-brown, and become funnel-shaped with age. The gills are pinkish to purplish. Different forms have been described from Italy, but these are not universally accepted as distinct. L.sanguifluus mushrooms are edible, and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia. Fruit bodies grown in polluted soil, including roadsides subject to heavy traffic, can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals. Several <b>sterols</b> and pigment have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of <b>sterols</b> are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or <b>sterols,</b> can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
