The company's management were forced to look for new products with which to maintain their position in the market.

50|$|An MFA {{system is}} a model of an {{industrial}} plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more processes, material flows between processes, and <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to chemical engineering, where a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities {{as long as they are}} well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.|$|E

50|$|Human needs such as shelter, food, transport, or {{communication}} require materials like wood, starch, sugar, {{iron and}} steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity expands, material production, use, and disposal increase {{to a level}} where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are {{at the core of}} local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills. Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow, carbon dioxide, on top of the political and scientific agenda. The gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> within human society.Scientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere.

50|$|Material flow {{analysis}} (MFA) (also {{referred to as}} substance {{flow analysis}} (SFA)) is an analytical method to quantify flows and <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> or substances in a well-defined system. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic, urban, social and industrial metabolism. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant. When combined with {{an assessment of the}} costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called Material Flow Cost Accounting. MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the Journal of Industrial Ecology, Ecological Economics, Environmental Science and Technology, and Resources, Conservation, and Recycling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shift from}} the tweed design to tolex {{occurred}} in limited production in 1960. The tolex on the earliest versions in this era was pinkish brown and rough textured. There were only six amplifiers covered in tolex originally, and they were called the Professional Series: Bandmaster-Amp, Concert-Amp, Pro-Amp, Super-Amp, the Twin-Amp (production halted Feb-May 1960, resumed as the blonde Twin) and the Vibrasonic-Amp. These were considered a step above the student models (Champ, Harvard, Princeton) which remained tweed-covered in 1960. Grillclothes were initially {{the same as those}} used in the previous tweed era (i.e.: maroon with gold stripe). Beginning in mid to late 1961, Fender introduced another color combination: a smoother but still light brown tolex with a dark maroon or [...] "oxblood" [...] grillcloth. By mid-1961, after this short-lived look, Fender was using the darker brown tolex which was a mainstay for many of the mid-1961 to 1963 amps. Between 1961 and 1963, there were three different grillcloth colors: wheat, brown, and maroon and many tolex-grille color combinations are found suggesting that Leo Fender and Co. was not hesitant to use up whatever <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> were on hand.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} on material flow analysis {{has been focused}} on quantitative characterization of past material flows. Fewer analyses exist on past and prospective quantification of <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> in-use. Some of these analyses explore the composition of products’ stocks, but a focus on the characterization of material stocks and its relation with service delivery is often neglected. We propose the use of the methods of human demography to characterize material stocks, defined herein as stock demographics, exploring the insights that this approach could provide for the sustainable management of materials. We exemplify an application of stock demographics by characterizing the composition and service delivery of iron, steel, and aluminum stocks of cars in Great Britain, 2002 – 2012. The results show that in this period the stock has become heavier, it is traveling less, and it is idle for more time. The visualization of material stocks’ dynamics demonstrates the pace of product replacement as a function of its usefulness and enables the formulation of policy interventions and the exploration of future trends.

40|$|We {{study the}} strip packing problem, {{in which a}} set of {{two-dimensional}} rectangular items has to be packed in a rectangular strip of fixed width and infinite height, {{with the aim of}} minimizing the height used. The problem is important because it models a large number of real-world applications, including cutting operations where <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> such as paper or wood come in large rolls and have to be cut with minimum waste, scheduling problems in which tasks require a contiguous subset of identical resources, and container loading problems arising in the transportation of items that cannot be stacked one over the other. The strip packing problem has been attacked in the literature with several heuristic and exact algorithms, nevertheless, benchmark instances of small size remain unsolved to proven optimality since many years. In this paper we propose a new exact method, that solves a large number of the open benchmark instances within a limited computational effort. Our method is based on a Benders’ decomposition, in which in the master we cut items into unit-width slices and pack them contiguously in the strip, and in the slave we attempt to reconstruct the rectangular items by fixing the vertical positions of their unit-width slices. If the slave proves that the reconstruction of the items is not possible, then a cut is added to the master, and the algorithm is re-iterated. We show that both the master and the slave are strongly NP-hard problems, and solve them with tailored pre-processing, lower and upper bounding techniques, and exact algorithms. We also propose several new techniques to improve the standard Benders’ cuts, using the so-called combinatorial Benders’ cuts, and an additional lifting procedure. Extensive computational tests show that the proposed algorithm provides a substantial breakthrough with respect to previously published algorithms...|$|E

40|$|This PhD thesis {{concerns}} urban mining, {{an umbrella}} term for different recycling strategies aimed to recover {{materials from the}} built environment. More specifically, it focuses on hibernating urban infrastructures, that is: cables and pipes that have been left behind in their subsurface location after they were disconnected. I term this subsurface urban realm of system rejects the “Urk World”. “Urk” is short for “urkopplad”, the Swedish word for “disconnected”, an abbreviation often found on old infrastructure maps denoting discarded system parts. Since urks contain high concentrations of copper, my normative stance is that the Urk World should be “mined” as a contribution towards diminishing the persistently wasteful handling of mineral resources in society. The thesis has three focus areas. The first of these discusses how the Urk World has emerged, that is: how the creation of urks is sustained in sociotechnical processes related to infrastructure’s provision. The second concerns the potential of urk mining, how much copper the Urk World contains, where these quantities are located and by which implications they could be recovered. The third focus area {{is devoted to the}} politics of urks, and is concerned with the political embeddedness of infrastructure and where politics might intervene for the sake of increased urk recovery. Five papers complete the thesis. The first paper investigates how much copper, aluminium and steel there is in the Urk World of the Swedish city of Norrköping, and how these quantities are spatially dispersed in the urban environment. The second paper is based on interviews with system owners and repair crews, and investigates how urks come into existence in relation to three different infrastructural processes: maintenance, larger installation projects and shutdown. The third paper describes how environmental systems analysis can be beneficially coupled with theories and methods from the social sciences to create knowledge useful to aid the development of urk recycling schemes. The fourth article makes use of the inherent ambiguities of urks to investigate a spectrum of locations where politics aimed for increased urk recovery can intervene as well as what is at stake there. The fifth and final paper investigates urks in Linköping’s power grid in spatial and weight terms, and analyses the implications of urk recovery from several different viewpoints. In overall terms, the major contribution of the thesis is how it improves the knowledge of societal <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> thereby giving an increased recognition of the built environment as a resource base. In overall scientific terms, it sets an example of how a coherent interdisciplinary research design can provide knowledge useful for the implementation of urk recycling schemes as well as for political decision–making for increased urk recovery...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the {{influence}} of advanced manufacturing technologies on company’s performance. The aim of this contribution is to suggest the suitable concept of performance management that enables to measure the influence of advanced manufacturing technologies. The introductory part of the article defines the term “advanced manufacturing technologies” (AMT) as information technologies for the storage of data and their subsequent processing. A complex and lucid view onto the company performance and generators of this performance provides the concept of Kaplan and Norton referred to as Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The goals and measures are based on the vision of a strategy of the company and monitor its performance from the four following perspectives: financial, customer-related, internal processes, learning and growth. The utilization of BSC can be amplified by the emphasis on the value-based approach to the management of performance. The value orientation of BSC can be attained by properly selecting the value-based indicator, for example Economic Value Added (EVA), as the top criterion of the financial perspective of BSC. EVA (net operative profit minus capital expenses) measures {{the extent to which the}} company contributed in the given period by its activities to the increase or decrease value for the owners. The allocation of capital should be in accordance with the fundamental goal, which is to accept only such projects that will generate value thus contributing to the creation of EVA. A great advantage of the concept EVA is the possibility of linking strategic and operative decision-making and utilizing it on all levels of management by searching for and supporting of so-called value-generators. The approach BSC allows a complex view on effects from the introduction of AMTs without any aspect to be omitted. By acquiring AMT the perspective of learning and growth is supported significantly. AMTs require an intensive utilization of sophisticated information systems, which makes demands on abilities and qualifications of the employees so that they are able to work effectively. The perspective of internal processes is also significantly influenced by utilizing AMTs. Their utilization may lead to reduced amounts of material usage, to reduction of <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> to acceleration of the manufacturing cycle, better utilization of the manufacturing equipment, acceleration of development and to an increase of the number of innovations. At the same time it is possible to assume that these technologies reduce the number of necessary employees. The result will be reduced costs, higher quality of products, lower number of defects etc. By providing a better quality product faster that meets the specific requirements of a customer, the customer can be more satisfied. However, AMT often mean high expenditures during their acquisition (negative effect on cash flow during the acquisition) and resulting higher costs in individual years of their service life due to depreciation. Investment into AMT usually ties up the long-term capital that provides the expenses. Increased revenues from sales of products or services and cost savings must exceed the disadvantage of high acquisition costs and tied-up capital bearing costs. Only in such a case the acquisition and operation of AMTs can lead to a positive EVA and to an increase of the company value. Our research suggests that these frameworks are in fact complementary and can be very affective when used together...|$|E
