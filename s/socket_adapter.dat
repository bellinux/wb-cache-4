40|$|BACKGROUND: Finite element {{analysis}} has been universally employed for {{the stress and}} strain analysis in lower extremity prosthetics. The <b>socket</b> <b>adapter</b> was the principal subject of interest due to its importance in deciding the knee motion range. OBJECTIVES: This article focused on the static and dynamic stress analysis of the designed hybrid adapter developed by the authors. A standard mechanical design validation approach using von Mises was followed. Four materials were considered for the analysis, namely, carbon fiber, oil-filled nylon, Al- 6061, and mild steel. STUDY DESIGN: The paper analyses the static and dynamic stress on designed hybrid adapter which incorporates features of conventional male and female socket adapters. The finite element analysis was carried out for possible different angles of knee flexion simulating static and dynamic gait situation. METHODS: Research was carried out on available design of <b>socket</b> <b>adapter.</b> Mechanical design of hybrid adapter was conceptualized and a CAD model was generated using Inventor modelling software. Static and dynamic stress analysis was carried out on different materials for optimization. RESULTS: The finite element analysis was carried out on the software Autodesk Inventor Professional Ver. 2011. The peak value of von Mises stress occurred in the neck region of the adapter and in the lower face region at rod eye-adapter junction in static and dynamic analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oil-filled nylon {{was found to be}} the best material among the four with respect to strength, weight, and cost. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Research investigations on newer materials for development of improved prosthesis will immensely benefit the amputees.

The sensing unit design is an advancement over previous prosthesis force measurement devices {{in that it is}} very thin (19 mm) and lightweight (527. 5 g, including signal-conditioning instrumentation). The disk-shaped transducer fits between the socket and <b>socket</b> <b>adapter</b> of a standard modular prosthesis, measuring all six force and moment components at this location. Twelve strain gages were used, configured into six two-arm active Wheatstone bridge cir-cuits. A 6 X 6 matrix was constructed from calibration data to relate the 6 -component bridge-output vector to a 6 -component force and moment vector. In a bench-test setting, the sensor was evaluated under typical load combinations encountered during the walking of a person with transtibial amputation (TTA) and shown to have errors less than 7. 2 % of the full-scale output for each direction. Data collected on a subject with TTA walking at different speeds are presented. Key words: force sensor, lower limb amputation, prosthetic alignment, prosthetic fitting, prosthetics...|$|E

40|$|The Leakage Current Sentinel (LCS) {{has been}} {{designed}} and implemented {{for the detection of}} hazardous situations caused by dangerous earth leakage current values in intensive care units and operating theaters. The device, designed and manufactured with full compliance of the high risk environment requirements, is able to monitor online the earth leakage current and detect ground wire faults. Operation utilizes a microammeter with an overall sensitivity of 2. 5 x 10 (4) V/A. In order to assure the reliability of the device in providing alarm signals, the simultaneous presence of absorbed power current is monitored by means of another ammeter with decreased sensitivity (3. 0 V/A). The measured root mean square current values are compared with reference values in order to send signals to NAND and OR complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor gates to enable audible and visible alarms according to the possible hazardous cases examined in the article. The final LCS packaging was shaped as a wall <b>socket</b> <b>adapter</b> for common electromedical device power cord plugs, with particular attention to minimizing its dimensions and to provide analog voltage outputs for both measured leakage and power currents, in order to allow automatic data acquisition and computerized hazardous situation management. Finally, a personal computer based automatic measuring system has been configured to simultaneously monitor several LCSs installed in the same intensive care unit room and, as a consequence, to distinguish different hazardous scenarios and provide an adequate alert to the clinical personnel whose final decision is still required. The test results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the LCS in giving an alert in case of leakage current anomalous values, either in case of a ground fault or in case of a dangerous leakage current...|$|E
30|$|Virtually all {{households}} in the USA, as well as Europe, have electric meters installed [8]. While there are still conventional analog electric meters in use, electricity suppliers have started to equip households with modern digital “smart meters.” These “smart meters” replace traditional analog meters and offer the possibility of real-time usage data analysis by directly reporting the data to a utility from the provider. Unfortunately, these smart meters only provide usage data of a household’s overall power consumption and are dedicated {{to be used by}} metering service providers, not end users. This is disadvantageous because the provided data makes it difficult to identify per appliance power consumption or generate real-time feedback of energy usage for the end user. To achieve this traceability of energy usage, one field of research is to analyze high-fidelity power traces, measured by smart meters, and thus identify connected appliances and their current operating state [9 – 11] by their load signatures. Other research groups have worked in the field of wireless power metering. The basic concept is to provide a metering device {{in the form of a}} <b>socket</b> <b>adapter</b> or multi-contact plug, which connects to a wireless network to transfer the metering data to a data storage. “Plug” from MIT [12] thereby built a multi-contact plug with a current transformer and used analog-digital converters (ADC) for direct power metering of the connected load. Berkeley University’s ACme [8] is designed as a power plug adapter and with this equal to our solution. Like other similar devices, ACme has a high per adapter idle power consumption of 1 W, which is acceptable for measuring devices with high energy consumption like washing machines and PC work stations. For low-power-consuming devices, the high idle power of the metering adapters would waste lots of energy and thus reduce the potentially possible savings. We also have found several companies with smart home energy metering devices on the market [13 – 15]. Edimax “Smart Plug” uses Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 standard network protocol for data communication, which is designed mainly as a versatile, high data rate radio protocol but not specialized for energy efficiency [14]. This explains the high power consumption of the metering devices and makes it less suitable for metering low-energy consumers. AVM “FRITZ!DECT 200 ” uses DECT ULE for data transmission [15]. Even if DECT ULE counts as low-energy radio standard, this device also requires an AVM FRITZ!Box IP router as base station. This limits the setup places and causes range issues (e.g., in basements). Voltcraft “Energy Count 3000 ” [13] uses 868 -MHz radio for communicating and is more energy efficient than any other evaluated platform. As disadvantage, it provides no support for an IP gateway and thus can only be accessed via handheld remote panel with low range. Energy Count 3000 lacks usability of a web or mobile interface, which makes this platform more applicable for technical enthusiasts. All in all, we think that the analyzed related works lack energy efficiency and usability. We tried to conquer this by developing a specialized radio protocol and hardware to significantly reduce energy consumption of measuring devices and provide a versatile back-end to generate helpful front-end applications that help improve the energy efficiency of regular households.|$|E
5000|$|Solderless {{breadboards}} usually cannot accommodate surface-mount technology devices (SMD) or components with {{grid spacing}} other than 0.1 in (2.54 mm). Further, they cannot accommodate components with multiple rows of connectors if these connectors {{do not match}} the dual in-line layout - {{it is impossible to}} provide the correct electrical connectivity. Sometimes small PCB adapters called [...] "breakout adapters" [...] can be used to fit the component to the board. Such adapters carry one or more components and have 0.1 in (2.54 mm) spaced male connector pins in a single in-line or dual in-line layout, for insertion into a solderless breadboard. Larger components are usually plugged into a <b>socket</b> on the <b>adapter,</b> while smaller components (e.g., SMD resistors) are usually soldered directly onto the adapter. The adapter is then plugged into the breadboard via the 0.1 in connectors. However, the need to solder the components onto the adapter negates some of the advantage of using a solderless breadboard.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Lower-limb amputees often {{suffer from}} pain and {{discomfort}} caused by prosthesis use. Problems include musculoskeletal issues caused by compensatory gait patterns and skin injuries caused by shear stress at {{the interface between}} the residual limb and the <b>socket.</b> Torsion <b>adapters</b> {{have been shown to}} relieve these skin problems, but are not commonly prescribed due to a perceived decrease in stability. This study describes the Torsionally Active Prosthesis (TAP), a novel prosthesis that aims to provide the same reduction in shear stress as a torsion adapter without the accompanying decrease in stability. The work consists of four parts. First, a powered prosthesis capable of general motion in the transverse plane was developed. Second, exploratory human subject testing was performed to identify a pattern of motion that reduces transverse-plane torque at the socket without reducing torsional stiffness. The results indicate that this can be achieved by coupling transverse-plane ankle rotation with sagittal-plane ankle rotation. Third, the powered prosthesis was configured to perform this axis coupling and human subject testing was performed to determine its efficacy. Three subjects wore the prosthesis and walked at their self-selected speed in straight lines and clockwise and counterclockwise circles with at least three levels of axis coupling, including zero coupling. The subjects showed a trend toward decreased socket torque with increased axis coupling. Finally, the Pivot-Flex Foot (PFF), an unpowered prosthesis that could provide axis coupling was designed, built, and bench-tested. The PFF demonstrated a linear coupling between transverse-plane ankle rotation and sagittal-plane ankle rotation during bench testing...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of {{electronic}} assembly pins quantity minimizes mount stress effect on electronic components. Developed high through-hole installation technology {{of electronic}} components {{on the main}} board provides significant reducing of the strain transmitted to electronic components in comparison with standard low through-hole and surface-mount installation. The strain in integrated circuits mounted on the main board depends on rigidity and design of their pins. The offered soft installation technology 3 - 4 times reduces strain {{in comparison with the}} solid installation. Hollow electronic modules are more sensitive to main board deformation than the encapsulated ones. The strain in electronic modules changes depending on duration of the main board deformation they are installed on. The deformation produced by the main board onto contact pads (assumed to be weak links of the whole structure) in electronic modules is found to be dependent on connecting leads or pins, and decreasing their rigidity or applying compensators can significantly reduce the influence of the main board onto the electronic components. The measured strain in case of soft installation technology is 3 - 4 times lower than the strain in solid installation. The developed method for acceptable limit specification of PCB warpage is applicable for any design of electronic modules and any installation technology. For the more detailed research of the strain in electronic components, which are relatively small objects, the further research will be aimed at application acoustic emission method in order to develop methods for strength diagnostics and predicting possible breakages at the stage long before a fatal destruction in electronic packages. The paper presents research of mechanical strain in printed circuit board functional assemblies, which are parts of electronic packages in modern machines and mechanisms. The strain is caused by external impacts that occur in manufacturing and exploitation conditions. The paper studies effects of the strain transmission from the main board to the installed electronic components, such as integrated circuits, discrete components, <b>adapters,</b> <b>sockets,</b> connectors, electronic modules etc. : mount stress in electronic components; strain effect of electronic component installation technologies; strain effect of integrated circuit installation technology; the influence of the main board load duration on the strain in mounted electronic modules; the strain in contact pads produced by bending of the main board.
