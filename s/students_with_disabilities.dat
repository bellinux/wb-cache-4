40|$|The way {{in which}} {{technologies}} support <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> has been widely explored in recent times. Much of this {{research has focused on}} computer programs specifically designed to teach social and academic skills to <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> In the research reported in this paper we examined how <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> could use technology designed for the general market. The impetus for the study was the principle of normalisation, which espouses that people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> should have the opportunity to share in experiences of their same-aged peers. In previous research we demonstrated the benefits of using the commercially available hand-held games console Nintendo DS with Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training program <b>with</b> <b>students</b> in mainstream classrooms. This finding led us to consider how this technology could be used to meet specific academic and social outcomes for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in the same settings. We implemented a small-scale study in an Education Support Centre [1] as this setting provided us with the opportunity for a detailed examination of how <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> might use this technology. We found that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> can benefit from using the Nintendo DS with Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training program and have identified how they may use this type of technology in inclusive classrooms. © 2016, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.
