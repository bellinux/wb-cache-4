5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E

For some joints, multiple fasteners are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.|$|E

The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible.
