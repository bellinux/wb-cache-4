One use is to dedicate several of the elements to reception of common radar signals, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate radar warning receiver. The same basic concept can be used to provide traditional radio support, and with some elements also broadcasting, form a very high bandwidth data link. The F-35 uses this mechanism to send sensor data between aircraft in order to provide a <b>synthetic</b> <b>picture</b> of higher resolution and range than any one radar could generate. In 2007, tests by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and L-3 Communications enabled the AESA system of a Raptor to act like a WiFi access point, able to transmit data at 548 megabits per second and receive at gigabit speed; this is far faster than the Link 16 system used by US and allied aircraft, which transfers data at just over 1 Mbit/s.

This can be seen in the way he treats Portuguese travellers. The importance assigned to their travels, which varies between 1746 and 1759, derives from the editor's task. Prévost, at first given simply the job of translating, soon took on the transitional task of correcting, and finally undertook the work of an editor, following the synthetic method which he preferred.

40|$|The first approach, {{described}} {{in the first part}} of this thesis, studies 3 D face modeling from multi-views. Today human face modeling and animation techniques are widely used to generate virtual characters and models. Such characters and models are used in movies, computer games, advertising, news broadcasting and other activities. We propose an efficient method to estimate the poses, the global shape and the local structures of a human head recorded in multiple face images or a video sequence by using a generic wireframe face model. Based on this newly proposed method, we have successfully developed a pose invariant face recognition system and a pose invariant face contour extraction method. The objective of this thesis is to model and render complex scenes or objects from multiple images taken from different viewpoints. Two approaches to achieve this objective were investigated in this thesis. The first one is for known objects with prior geometrical models, which can be deformed to match the objects recorded in multiple input images. The second one is for general scenes or objects without prior geometrical models. The proposed algorithms in this thesis were tested on many real and synthetic data. The experimental results illustrate their efficiency and limitations. The second approach, {{described in}} the second part of this thesis, investigates 3 D modeling and rendering for general complex scenes. The entertainment industry touches hundreds of millions of people every day, and <b>synthetic</b> <b>pictures</b> and 3 D reconstruction of real scenes, often mixed with actual film footage, are now common place in computer games, sports broadcasting, TV advertising and feature films. A series of techniques has been developed to complete this task. First, a new view-ordering algorithm was proposed to organize and order an unorganized image database. Second, a novel and efficient multiview feature matching approach was developed to calibrate and track all views. Finally, both match propagation based and Bayesian based methods were developed to produce 3 D scene models for rendering. Yao Jian. "September 2006. "Adviser: Wai-Kuen Chan.

The {{focus is on the}} efficiency effects generated by the different kinds of privatization policies. A special emphasis is put on the broad dynamic effects of privatization.

In particular, it is argued that the development of legal reform is not an exogenous but an endogenous process influenced by the vested interests created by the initial privatization policy.
