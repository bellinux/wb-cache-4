25|$|The {{position}} held by policy-makers regarding gentrification {{is often}} divided, with one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> {{arguing that it}} is of benefit to the public economy and revitalisation of the built setting, whilst the other side argues that the huge social costs and displacement of people, especially the poor, outweigh all potential strengths of the process.|$|E
25|$|Around 600 however, {{tensions}} flared {{between the}} Armenian Apostolic Church {{and the church}} in Kartli, as the Armenian Church attempted to assert prominence in the Caucasus, in both hierarchical and doctrinal matters, whereas the Catholicos of Mtskheta, Kirion I, leaned towards the Byzantine, Chalcedonian <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> as Kartli was once again seeking imperial support against the Sassanid Empire, who had abolished the Kingdom in 580. The Third Council of Dvin, in 607, sanctioned the rupture with the Armenian Church.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> {{some argue that}} influencers have no such effect and {{therefore}} companies shouldnâ€™t target their seeding efforts on a specific group of people. Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds examined the phenomenon through a computer network simulation {{under the assumption that}} influential people are more difficult to influence, therefore social hubs have a lower tendency to adopt new products. Their work suggests that highly connected individuals do not {{play a crucial role in}} influencing others and that a random individual is just as likely to start a trend as connected people.|$|E
25|$|The debate {{arose from}} a {{controversy}} of 1706 on the immortality of the soul. Clarke published a refutation {{of the views}} of Henry Dodwell, and this drew in Collins, who wrote a Letter to Mr Dodwell in his defence. By the sixth edition (1731), Clarke's own Letter to Mr Dodwell of 1706 had grown to 475 pages, including the replies of Collins. Clarke's main argument against Dodwell was that the soul, being immaterial, must be immortal. John Norris argued differently, though on Clarke's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> using in particular the ideas of Malebranche. Collins challenged Clarke on the ground of his substance dualism.|$|E
25|$|She {{became more}} {{prominent}} as a progressive when she voiced opposition to {{what became the}} 2003 Iraq War, appearing on CNN and Fox News to discuss it. She {{said that she was}} approached by groups such as MoveOn.org and Win Without War to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing antiwar voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time said they thought their fame could lend attention to that <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of Ms. and Venus Zine. Garofalo has had frequent on-air political disputes with Bill O'Reilly, Brian Kilmeade, and Jonah Goldberg.|$|E

25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis.|$|E
25|$|The Moscow group {{tended to}} support the leftist <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> on how to destroy {{religion}} (i.e. in favour of attacking religion {{in all of its}} forms rather than moderation), and in 1924 it attacked Yaroslavsky, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich for differentiation between different religions, instead of genuine godlessness. It accused Yaroslavsky of attacking only the clergy rather than religion in general. Yaroslavsky protested this and affirmed that all religions were enemies of socialism including the Renovationist schism in the Orthodox church, but that the methods of struggle against different religions should vary due to the large number of loyal Soviet citizens with religious beliefs who should be re-educated as atheists rather than treated as class enemies. Bezbozhnik argued that it was an oversimplification to treat religion solely as a kind of class exploitation to be attacked, forgetting the complex nature of religions, as well as the individual believers. The CPSU Central Committee supported Yaroslavsky's viewpoint on this issue, although this debate remained unresolved at the Union that came in 1925.|$|E
25|$|How a child {{develops}} {{gender identity}} is also debated. Some believe that masculinity {{is linked to}} the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with male genitalia. Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Recent research has been done on one's self concept of masculinity and its relation to testosterone; the results have shown that masculinity not only differs in different cultures, but the levels of testosterone do not predict how masculine or feminine one feels. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men hormonally and physically, and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven. On the nurture <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it. Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.|$|E

500|$|Among proponents and {{publishers}} of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run {{and what their}} goals should be, reflecting a [...] "clash between two philosophies for advocating social change".

500|$|Murray {{initially}} {{refused to}} endorse either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, citing the abuse {{he had received}} after his comments in 2006.

He received online abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as [...] "vile" [...] by Police Scotland; one referred to the Dunblane massacre. A {{few days after the}} vote, in which a 55% majority opposed Scottish independence, Murray said that he did not regret stating his view, but said that it was out of character and that he would concentrate on his tennis career in the future.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> those {{in favor of}} animal testing held that {{experiments}} on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. Claude Bernardâ€”who is sometimes known as the [...] "prince of vivisectors" [...] {{and the father of}} physiology, and whose wife, Marie FranÃ§oise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883â€”famously wrote in 1865 that [...] "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen". Arguing that [...] "experiments on animals ... are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man...the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree", Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method.|$|E
500|$|Among these younger {{radicals}} were Bird and Snow; [...] {{among the}} old school was William Addison (a different person from Bird's superior at Guy's). [...] Addison disliked the modern reliance on laboratory and theoretical results favoured by the new generation, and challenged Richard Bright (who gave his name to Bright's disease) when Bright suggested {{that the source of}} the problem in oedema was the kidneys. [...] Addison preferred to believe that the condition was caused by intemperance or some other external factor, and that since the whole body had been disrupted, it could not be localised to a specific organ. [...] Addison further challenged Bright's student, Snow, when in 1839 Snow suggested from case studies and laboratory analysis that oedema was associated with an increase in albumin in the blood. [...] Addison dismissed this as a mere epiphenomenon. [...] Bird disagreed with Snow's proposed treatment, but his arguments clearly show him to be on the radical <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> and he completely avoided whole-body arguments. [...] Snow had found that the proportion of urea in the urine of his patients was low and concluded from this that urea was accumulating in the blood, and therefore proposed bloodletting to counter this. [...] Bird disputed that increased urea in the blood was the cause of kidney disease and doubted the effectiveness of this treatment, citing the results of FranÃ§ois Magendie, who had injected urea into the blood, apparently with no ill effects. [...] It is not clear whether Bird accepted Snow's reasoning that urea must be accumulating, or whether he merely adopted it for the sake of argument; while a student in 1833, he had disputed this very point with another of Bright's students, George Rees.|$|E
