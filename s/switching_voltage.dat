Further, {{it is observed that}} the <b>switching</b> <b>voltages</b> (V-T) of Ge 10 Se 90 -xTlx glasses decrease with the increase in the Tl concentration. An effort has been made to understand the observed composition dependence on the basis of nature of bonding of Tl atoms and a decrease in the chemical disorder with composition.

50|$|Generally, {{this means}} the device leaks a signal at some level.

This approach is limited by thermal noise within the circuit. There is a characteristic voltage (proportional to the device temperature and to the Boltzmann constant), which the state <b>switching</b> <b>voltage</b> must exceed in order for the circuit to be resistant to noise.

Second, the theoretical approach is modified in order to be suitable for the actual //- cantilever beam model because the material, geometry and the type of structure have been changed. The <b>switching</b> <b>voltage</b> of each beam size is predicted using the modified method. Third, a series of single //-cantilever beams are designed according to the MEMS design rules. Using the facilities at Semiconductor and Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory at RIT, the //-beams are fabricated and the switching voltages of each beam are measured. The detailed explanation of each fabrication step, measurement and testing method are described in this thesis. Finally, the results from the theoretical approach are compared to those from testing. Testing results show that for varying the beam dimensions, the trend in predicted <b>switching</b> <b>voltage</b> is similar to the experimental data.
