40|$|Research on the {{evaluation}} and selection of procurement bids (“winner determination”) has traditionally ignored the temporal and finite capacity constraints under which manufacturers and service providers often operate. We consider the problem faced by {{a firm that}} procures multiple key components or services {{from a number of}} possible <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Bids</b> submitted by suppliers include a price and a delivery date. The firm has to select a combination of supplier bids that will maximize its overall profit. Profit is determined by the revenue generated by the products (or services) sold by the firm, the costs of the components (or services) it acquires as well as late delivery penalties it incurs if it fails to deliver its products/services in time to its own customers. We provide a formal model of this important class of problems, discuss its complexity and introduce rules {{that can be used to}} efficiently prune the resulting search space. We proceed to show that our model can be characterized as a pseudoearly/ tardy scheduling problem and use this observation to build an efficient heuristic search procedure. Computational results show that our heuristic procedure typically yields solutions that are within a few percent from the optimum. They further indicate that taking into account the manufacturer/service provider’s capacity can significantly improve its bottom line...|$|E

30|$|To avoid {{power outages}} during {{anticipated}} peak load periods, state utility companies can procure electricity from other suppliers (in aggregate) {{with the help}} of online auctions. The required electricity may be purchased from diverse renewable energy sources. We have presented an electricity combinatorial reverse auction that has been specifically designed for very short-term resource procurement. To be able to secure electricity, our auction consists of two bidding rounds: in the first round, variable energy <b>suppliers</b> <b>bid</b> on bundle of items; in the second round, storage and controllable renewable energy <b>suppliers</b> <b>bid</b> on any items still remaining. Our new, smart market makes it possible for power suppliers of all sizes to compete, including homeowners. We have solved our constrained combinatorial procurement problem (multiple items, two attributes and two conflicting objectives) by using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization technique {{to be able to find}} the best trade-off solution. The latter represents the best combination of sellers that results in the lowest cost and highest quantity of electricity. Designing an auction with 15 -minute intervals allows for greater equality of opportunity between small players (such as residents) and big players (plants). We believe that the proposed electricity auction will promote the expansion of renewable energy plants as well as home-based generation as new technologies become more and more accessible to residents (electric vehicles and solar panels). In summary, our electricity auction is a new concept in terms of: ➀the problem being addressed (the anticipated peak demand load); ➁features of our smart electricity market; ➂auction design (characteristics, bidding strategies and winner determination).|$|R

The survey delineates different representative scenarios in e-procurement where auctions can be deployed and describes the conceptual and mathematical aspects of different categories of procurement auctions. We discuss three categories: (1) multi-unit auctions for a single homogeneous type of item; (2) combinatorial procurement auctions where the buyer seeks to procure a bundle of multiple items and the <b>suppliers</b> <b>bid</b> for subsets of the bundle; and (3) multi-attribute auctions where th...|$|R

This incentive to bid above marginal cost is not the result of coordinated action among the bidders. Rather, each bidder is independently selecting its bid to maximize profits based on its estimate of the residual demand curve it faces. The <b>supplier</b> <b>bids</b> a price for its energy capacity to optimize its marginal tradeoff between higher prices and lower quantities. Price response from either demand or other suppliers prevents the supplier from raising its bid too much. Profit maximizing bidding should be expected and encouraged by regulators.

40|$|The {{emerging}} electricity market behaves {{more like}} an oligopoly than a perfectly competitive market due to special features such as, {{a limited number of}} producers, large investment size (barrier to entry), transmission constraints, and transmission losses which discourage purchase from distant suppliers. This makes it practicable for only a few independent power suppliers to service a given geographic region and in this imperfect market each power supplier can increase its own profit through strategic bidding. The profit of each supplier is influenced to varying extents by differences in the degree of imperfection of knowledge of rival suppliers. A new framework to build bidding strategies for power suppliers in an electricity market is presented in this paper. It is assumed that each <b>supplier</b> <b>bids</b> a linear supply function, and that the system is dispatched to minimize customer payments.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{building}} the optimal bidding strategies for competitive suppliers in the California-type spinning reserve market is addressed. In this market, each supplier is required to submit a capacity bid and an energy bid simultaneously, and selection of spinning reserve suppliers is solely based on the capacity bids and the required spinning reserve amount broadcast by the independent system operator (ISO). In this procedure, the uniform market clearing price rule is employed. Winners of capacity bids {{may be asked to}} provide energy in ISO's real time dispatch according to system operation requirements, and the dispatch of energy supply is based on energy bids with application of the uniform market clearing price rule. It is assumed that each <b>supplier</b> <b>bids</b> a linear capacity supply function and a linear energy supply function into the spinning reserve market, and each supplier chooses the coefficients in these two supply functions to maximize benefits, subject to expectations about how rival <b>suppliers</b> will <b>bid.</b> A stochastic optimization model is first developed to describe this problem and a genetic algorithm based method is then employed to solve it.

40|$|It {{has been}} found from {{contemporary}} research {{in the fields of}} concurrent engineering and supply chain management that significant benefits can be achieved if suppliers are involved in new product development processes as early as possible. However, recent investigations in manufacturing industries have revealed that this approach of early supplier involvement (ESI) in new product development (NPD) is not widely practised. It has been a great challenge for researchers and practitioners to implement this approach in practice. One issue is about the lack of a customer-supplier interface appropriate for facilitating ESI in NPD. This paper proposes such an interface that is consistent not only with the customer's new product development process but also with the <b>supplier's</b> <b>bid</b> preparation process. This interface includes two models. One is the product-oriented model of a partial supply chain.

We examine a multi-period model where expected profit is optimized, and a single-period model where a mean-variance objective is considered. In addition, we investigate what the consequences of such purchasing behavior might be. For this purpose, we study the game where suppliers compete on price and flexibility for the buyer's orders.
