5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Performing live again brought Como a {{new sense}} of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{recalled}} that Joseph <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> {{as the group}} rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad." [...] Both of Jackson's parents have rejected the longstanding allegations of child abuse by saying that spankings were common when disciplining children back then. The child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings, {{with some of them}} rejecting the claims.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle and pain, and eventual material and professional success".|$|E
500|$|Jackson had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} with his father. In 2003, Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped him as a boy. Joe was also said to have verbally abused his son, often {{saying that he had}} a [...] "fat nose". Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals, though he credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success. In an interview with Martin Bashir for the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson recalled that Joe often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that [...] "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you." [...] Jackson's parents have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse, with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today, it was a common way to discipline children at the time. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have also said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Speaking openly about his childhood in an interview with Oprah Winfrey broadcast in February 1993, Jackson acknowledged that his youth had been lonely and isolating. His deep dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain hyper-compliant, especially with his father, and to remain childlike in adulthood are consistent with the effects of the maltreatment he endured as a child.|$|E

500|$|As {{she arrived}} at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd {{gathered}} outside the building. [...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} couple months, Wallenda {{performed}} daily shows at Silver Dollar City with his family. [...] The highlight of the show was a three-person [...] "Chair Pyramid" [...] on the high-wire. [...] Wallenda and Jonah Finkelstein rode bicycles across the wire while Delilah Wallenda <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> atop a balance bar they carried. [...] In {{the middle of the}} performance, Wallenda would purposely act like he was losing control and move the balance bar erratically to heighten the drama. [...] He would then shout [...] "Watch it, Mom!" [...] before regaining control. [...] Acting off balance was the hardest part of the act, according to Wallenda.|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{the girl}} {{collapsed}} under her memories, the priest passed stiffly {{into the next}} room, where he found Gilder and Merton alone with Patrick Royce, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> handcuffed. There {{he said to the}} Inspector submissively: ...|$|E
6000|$|The clerk, who was lately {{from the}} East, and wore his {{moustache}} curled upward like the whiskers of a cat, was [...] "gassing" [...] with another young man, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> with his heels on the counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has the auto-stage from Fernwood got in yet?" [...] {{questioned}} Sam of <b>a</b> storekeeper who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tilted <b>chair</b> {{under the}} wooden awning of his establishment.|$|R

6000|$|Sampson <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> {{near the}} door; the table upon which lay his gun stood {{between him and}} Wright. This {{position}} did not invite me to start anything.
