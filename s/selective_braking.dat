50|$|Mercedes-Benz {{launched}} {{the first generation}} W163 series M-Class on 19 February 1997, in the United States for the 1998 model year, with sales beginning that September. It is a mid-sized body-on-frame SUV with seating for five, or seven with an optional third-row seat. The M-Class was the first luxury SUV to feature electronic stability control, a system designed to detect loss of control and instantaneously intervene with <b>selective</b> <b>braking</b> to bring the vehicle back on its intended course. Furthermore, the M-Class boasted front- and side-impact airbags with advanced occupant detection for the front passenger seat, which, helped earn the W163 the highest marks in insurance industry crash tests.|$|E
5000|$|... 2000: New wheels {{featured}} a fancier six-spoke design. New to the option list for 2000 was an antiskid system called the Precision Control System. Precision Control System {{was designed to}} help keep the car on its intended path by <b>selective</b> <b>braking</b> of one or more individual wheels. Though optional on all models, GX buyers had to order optional traction control to get the new antiskid system. Heated power front seats were now standard on GLS models. Standard leather door inserts trim not cloth, Retained accessory power was standard this year. [...] "Oldsmobile" [...] emblem on deck lid is larger than on 1999 models, although some early 2000 models carried the smaller version. A new gold-trim package was also available. New automatic headlights were now standard on all models.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{stability}} {{control systems}} cannot replace defensive driving techniques and proper tire selection. These systems rely on <b>selective</b> wheel <b>braking,</b> which depends in turn on road contact. While stability control may help recovery from a skid when a vehicle slows enough to regain traction, it cannot prevent aquaplaning.|$|R
40|$|This Research Note {{describes}} {{the process of}} deriving the effectiveness rates of electronic stability control systems (ESC) and roll stability control systems (RSC) in truck tractors that are used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to estimate the benefits of these systems. ESC and RSC {{are two types of}} stability control systems that have been developed for heavy vehicles. RSC is designed to mitigate on-road, untripped truck rollovers by automatically decelerating the vehicle by applying the foundation brakes and reducing engine torque output. ESC includes the RSC function described previously but it has added capability that allows it to also mitigate severe oversteer or understeer conditions that can lead to vehicle loss-of-control (LOC), by automatically applying <b>selective</b> <b>brakes</b> to generate a yawing moment that helps the driver maintain directional contro...|$|R
40|$|The Active Gear, Flexible Aircraft Takeoff and Landing Analysis program, AGFATL, was {{developed}} to provide a complete simulation of the aircraft takeoff and landing dynamics problem. AGFATL can represent an airplane either as a rigid body with {{six degrees of freedom}} or as a flexible body with multiple degrees of freedom. The airframe flexibility is represented by the superposition of up to twenty free vibration modes on the rigid-body motions. The analysis includes maneuver logic and autopilots programmed to control the aircraft during glide slope, flare, landing, and takeoff. The program is modular so that performance of the aircraft in flight and during landing and ground maneuvers can be studied separately or in combination. A program restart capability is included in AGFATL. Effects simulated in the AGFATL program include: (1) flexible aircraft control and performance during glide slope, flare, landing roll, and takeoff roll under conditions of changing winds, engine failures, brake failures, control system failures, strut failures, restrictions due to runway length, and control variable limits and time lags; (2) landing gear loads and dynamics for up to five gears; (3) single and multiple engines (maximum of four) including selective engine reversing and failure; (4) drag chute and spoiler effects; (5) wheel braking (including skid-control) and <b>selective</b> <b>brake</b> failure; (6) aerodynamic ground effects; (7) aircraft carrier operations; (8) inclined runways and runway perturbations; (9) flexible or rigid airframes; 10) rudder and nose gear steering; and 11) actively controlled landing gear shock struts. Input to the AGFATL program includes data which describe runway roughness; vehicle geometry, flexibility and aerodynamic characteristics; landing gear(s); propulsion; and initial conditions such as attitude, attitude change rates, and velocities. AGFATL performs a time integration of the equations of motion and outputs comprehensive information on the airframe, state-of-maneuver logic, autopilots, control response, and aircraft loads from impact, runway roll-out, and ground operations. Flexible-body and total (elastic plus rigid-body) displacements, velocities, and accelerations are also output in the flexible-body option for up to twenty points on the aircraft. The AGFATL program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with an overlayed central memory requirement of approximately 141 (octal) of 60 bit words. The AGFATL program was last updated in 1984...|$|R
