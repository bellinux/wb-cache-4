5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the action}} the Tripolitanians had lost their three largest vessels and {{suffered}} heavy casualties, while the Sardinians only had two dead and five wounded. Later in the day while Sivori was making preparations for another attack on the city, a Dutch brig sailed out of port saluting him and <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> it wished to communicate with him. Upon contacting the squadron, the brig's captain sent Sivori the congratulatory remarks of the British consul at Tripoli. The Sardinian commander sent the Dutch vessel back into port with a message to Karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations, further military action would be taken against the city. Rather than suffer continued action from the Sardinians, Karamanli acceded to the Sardinian requests and sent an envoy out to the Sardinian squadron.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5000|$|Lipoxygenases (...) are {{a family}} of (non-heme), iron-containing enzymes most of which {{catalyze}} the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids containing a cis,cis-1,4- pentadiene into cell <b>signaling</b> agents <b>that</b> serve diverse roles as autocrine <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> regulate the function of their parent cells, paracrine <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> regulate the function of nearby cells, and endocrine <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> regulate the function of distant cells.|$|R
50|$|Another type of <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> can {{be found}} in China is the Unilight <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> {{displays}} all three colours in one signal section.|$|R
50|$|Integra-Signum {{asks the}} train driver to confirm distant <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> show stop and distant or home <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> show caution. If {{he does not}} confirm or passes a home <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> shows stop, the train is stopped automatically. This is {{achieved}} by interrupting the power supply to the motors and applying the emergency brake.|$|R
5|$|The season four premiere {{introduces}} {{several new}} interns, {{to be trained}} under Meredith, Yang, Karev, Stevens, and eventually O'Malley. Among them are Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) who continues to make appearances, and Dr. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) who formed a friendship with Meredith while the two were in college. Harris is fired in the fifth season, due to not actually having a medical degree, and departs the show immediately after. Meredith and Shepherd's relationship reaches a toll, and the two separate, leading Shepherd to entertaining a relationship with Rose (Lauren Stamile), a nurse. Rose appears frequently until season five, when Derek and Meredith decide to rekindle their flame. Throughout the fifth season, Stevens experiences full-out hallucinations of Duquette, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> she is ill, and once she is lucid, he departs, marking his final appearance. Following the announcement of her relationship with Robbins, Callie's father Carlos Torres (Hector Elizondo) initially contests his daughter's concurrence in homosexuality, but eventually accepts it, and he reappears several times throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E
25|$|Meta-communication: <b>Signals</b> <b>that</b> will {{modify the}} meaning of {{subsequent}} signals. One example is the 'play face' in dogs which <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> a subsequent aggressive signal {{is part of a}} play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.|$|R
60|$|The National {{flag was}} run up--the {{established}} <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> {{the nation was}} in need. Instantly on every summit near and far was seen the flutter of an answering flag. Quickly followed the <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> commanded the call to arms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Signals</b> <b>that</b> {{are driven}} from within a process (an initial or always block) must be of type reg. <b>Signals</b> <b>that</b> are driven from outside a process must be of type wire. The keyword reg does not {{necessarily}} imply a hardware register.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the large}} church {{is located on}} a hill near the shore, the {{building}} has historically dominated the view of Jaffa from the sea, thus serving as a beacon to pilgrims, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Land is near.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani's use of {{drink and}} drugs {{intensified}} from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, {{this was the}} period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> the disease had reached an advanced stage.|$|E
25|$|Key {{studies using}} such {{strategy}} {{were conducted in}} 2008. Melton et al. studied the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid. They found that it increased reprogramming efficiency 100-fold (compared to Yamanaka’s traditional transcription factor method). The researchers proposed that this compound was mimicking the <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> is usually caused by the transcription factor c-Myc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{linear range}} is that range of input or output values for which an {{electronic}} amplifier produces an output <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> is a direct, linear {{function of the}} input <b>signal.</b> <b>That</b> is, the output can be represented by the equation: ...|$|R
50|$|Later systems {{modified}} the time base {{to include a}} second <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> periodically produced blips on the display, providing a clock <b>signal</b> <b>that</b> varied with the time base and thus {{did not need to}} be aligned. In UK terminology, these were known as strobes.|$|R

25|$|Although McClellan {{had already}} planned to shift his supply base to the James River, his defeat unnerved {{him and he}} precipitously decided to abandon his advance on Richmond and begin the retreat of his entire army to the James. Gaines's Mill and the Union retreat across the Chickahominy was a {{psychological}} victory for the Confederacy, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> Richmond was out of danger.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} {{study suggests that}} the pericyte death is caused by blood glucose persistently activating protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which {{through a series of}} intermediates inhibits signaling through platelet-derived growth factor receptors — <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> supports cellular survival, proliferation, and growth. The resulting withdrawal of this signaling leads to the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the cells in this experimental model.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) is another <b>signal</b> processing solution <b>that</b> separates different <b>signals</b> <b>that</b> are statistically independent in time.

25|$|This, {{along with}} other rules {{pertaining}} to grade crossing <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> the wigwag was unable to meet due to its power requirements, rendered it obsolete for new installations in 1949, but grandfathering laws allowed them to remain until upgrades to the crossings they protected were necessary. Magnetic Signal was sold to the Griswold Signal Company of Minneapolis shortly after WWII. Production of new signals continued until 1949, and replacement parts until 1960.|$|E
25|$|Kukbary (Gökböri), {{the emir}} of Harran, invited Saladin {{to occupy the}} Jazira region, making up {{northern}} Mesopotamia. He complied and the truce {{between him and the}} Zengids officially ended in September 1182. Prior to his march to Jazira, tensions had grown between the Zengid rulers of the region, primarily concerning their unwillingness to pay deference to Mosul. Before he crossed the Euphrates, Saladin besieged Aleppo for three days, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> the truce was over.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other Eastern Bloc countries, the Socialist Republic of Romania {{had never}} {{undergone}} even limited de-Stalinization. In November 1989, Ceauşescu, then aged 71, was re-elected {{for another five}} years {{as leader of the}} Romanian Communist Party, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, on December 16, 1989, his Securitate ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian-speaking Calvinist minister, László Tőkés, for sermons offending the regime.|$|E

25|$|The {{pilot of}} Santa Cruz, John P. Hamill {{identified}} Cuyahoga, and {{neither he nor}} the ship's Captain Abdelardo Albornoz were concerned as the two ships appeared to be passing port-to-port. When the two vessels were 1,200yards apart Cuyahoga turned west, {{into the path of}} Santa Cruz, to enter the Potomac River to moor for the night. Hamill immediately sounded Santa Cruzs whistle <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> he would maintain course and speed and that the cutter should return to its original course. After waiting 30 seconds without any response from Cuyahoga Hamill sounded a danger warning of five short blasts.|$|E
25|$|McClellan ordered Keyes's IV Corps to move west of Glendale {{and protect}} the army's withdrawal, while Porter {{was sent to the}} high ground at Malvern Hill to develop {{defensive}} positions. The supply trains were ordered to move south toward the river. McClellan departed for Harrison's Landing without specifying any exact routes of withdrawal and without designating a second-in-command. For the remainder of the Seven Days, he had no direct command of the battles. The Union retreat across the Chickahominy after Gaines's Mill was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> Richmond was out of danger.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the spell}} of {{liberalization}} promoted by the new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ivașcu {{became a member of}} the Academy of Social and Political Sciences. In 1969 and 1971, he received the Romanian Writers' Union Prize. From 1971 until his death, Ivașcu directed România Literară, the Writers' Union magazine. According to Manolescu, who was to succeed him there, the move from Contemporanul to România Literară was rather a demotion, <b>signaling</b> <b>that</b> Ceaușescu did not trust him. Others contrarily note that Ceaușescu handpicked Ivașcu to direct the magazine after the fall from favor of a previous editor, Nicolae Breban. Breban had made public his criticism of the July Theses, through which Ceaușescu had reintroduced hardline Marxism-Leninism.|$|E
