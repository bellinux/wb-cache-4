5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms.

5|$|Several {{species and}} forms were {{described}} before 1800, {{most of them}} with inadequate locality data. At least two names — Amphidromus laevus (Müller, 1774) and the form A. perversus f. aureus Martyn, 1784 — <b>still</b> (<b>as</b> of 2017) {{have not yet been}} reported from a precise locality. During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, many species and varieties were named, again usually with poor locality data. Not until Eduard von Martens (1867) published his monograph was there an attempt to cover the entire complex of species within this genus. The 1867 monograph contained considerable information both on the variation within the genus, and on the problems of the geographic distribution of the species. Many concepts that originated with von Martens are <b>still</b> (<b>as</b> of 2017) in use.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous. Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and Hansa Bay and thereby {{speeding}} up the Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, for aircraft based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater <b>still,</b> <b>as</b> they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as <b>still</b> <b>as</b> possible.

Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, <b>still</b> <b>as</b> its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman <b>still</b> <b>as</b> a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E

Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Despite of the {{internal}} opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. <b>Still,</b> <b>as</b> both sides feared a betrayal, all {{the contents of the}} pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the elections for the Constituent Assembly. Both the PJ and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón, and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but <b>still</b> <b>as</b> demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were <b>still</b> <b>as</b> bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida early on October 16, <b>still</b> <b>as</b> a Category1 hurricane. It {{turned to the}} north, {{remained}} a hurricane despite little convection, {{then turned to the}} northeast in response to an approaching upper-level trough. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17. On October 18, as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) with a pressure of 952mbar, a Category 2 hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.|$|E
5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. <b>Still,</b> <b>as</b> of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
