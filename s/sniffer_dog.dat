500|$|Pascal and Maximus have {{garnered}} widespread universal acclaim from film critics, who greeted both {{characters with}} nearly equal praise but generally reviewed Maximus more enthusiastically. Citing both characters as [...] "right on the money," [...] Jonathan Crocker of Total Film described Maximus as [...] "A horse ... who thinks he's John McClane." [...] Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic enthused, [...] "In true Disney fashion, {{two of the}} most memorable characters are animals: Pascal ... and Maximus, a barrel-chested horse with the tracking skills of a bloodhound and a sense of duty straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips wrote that both characters are [...] "Very funny, very noble" [...] and [...] "lovely supporting character." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone admitted to having [...] "fell hard" [...] for Maximus and Pascal. Similarly, Lindsey Ward of Canoe.ca predicted Tangled Ever After, writing, [...] "Kids and adults alike will also fall for Rapunzel's trusty chameleon sidekick Pascal and palace horse Maximus -- whose hilarious role as Flynn's foe-turned-BFF might just earn him his own spin-off." [...] The Globe and Mails Jennie Punter hailed them as [...] "characters that only Disney animators could so memorably portray." [...] Writing for the Miami Herald, Rene Rodriguez described both characters as [...] "terrific," [...] while Alison Gang of U-T San Diego called them [...] "hilarious." [...] David Edelstein of Vulture.com admitted that he [...] "can't help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots." [...] Joe Neumaier of the Daily News appreciated the fact that although [...] "There are laughs involving ... Rapunzel's silent chameleon sidekick ... directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard keep the tale grounded." [...] Observing the way in which animal sidekicks have become [...] "Disney animation staples," [...] Doris Toumarkine of Film Journal International wrote that Pascal is [...] "cute-as-can-be," [...] likening the character to Jiminy Cricket from Disney's Pinocchio (1940). Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote that Pascal [...] "is likely to charm the adults, further designating Tangled as silky-smooth entertainment." [...] Norman Wilner of Now wrote that [...] "the best performance is a silent one delivered by ... Maximus, a guardsman's horse clearly modelled on Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive – but funnier." [...] Describing the character as [...] "marvelously bothered," [...] Michelle Orange of Movieline wrote that Maximus is [...] "given a nuanced fidelity and expressive agility so precise that it seems more human than human." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters called Maximus [...] "magnificent." [...] Empires Helen O'Hara wrote that Maximus is a [...] "comic scene-stealer and police horse extraordinaire." [...] While Ian Berriman of SFX dubbed Maximus the film's [...] "breakout star," [...] The Ages Jim Schembri hailed the character as [...] "the funniest horse in film history." [...] Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald labelled Maximus [...] "The de facto star of ... Tangled" [...] who [...] "possesses the strength of Hercules, the nose of an airport <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> and the crankiness of Harrison Ford." ...|$|E

40|$|Police <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{essential}} in preventing and also detecting drug crime. However, the existing legal framework {{related to the}} use of police dogs is fragile and nebulous, as it is primarily based on searches carried out by police officers.

This divide will be illustrated by examples of dog-assisted searches during routine police work such as beat patrols, in venues, schools and in traffic controls...|$|R

50|$|Teenagers {{expect the}} {{contents}} of their backpacks not {{to be open to}} the random and speculative scrutiny of the police.

The dog sniff search was unreasonably undertaken because there was no proper justification. The youth court judge found that the police lacked any grounds for reasonable suspicion and excluded the evidence. The Court agreed that his exclusion of the evidence should not be interfered with.|$|E
