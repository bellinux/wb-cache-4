5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head and wounded.

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern part of the}} state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E

5|$|The Great Plague of London <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{summer of}} 1665, and the Theatre Royal, {{along with all}} other public entertainment, was shut down by order of the Crown on 5 June.

5|$|A {{number of}} proof coins were issued at the {{suggestion}} of Barber and Superintendent Bosbyshell. Ellsworth was enthusiastic, intending the special strikes as gifts, but was forced to share them with Company president Higinbotham, to Ellsworth's dismay. The proof coins for the year 1892 represented the first hundred coins struck, as well as numbers 400, 1492, and 1892. The total number of proof coins struck for 1893 is less certain: R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins states that approximately 100 proofs were struck for 1893, but numismatist Ira Goldberg in a 2011 article gives the number as fewer than ten. The first coin <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 1893, in proof, is in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society. The Mint gave consideration to including the Columbian half dollar in proof sets, but at the time it sold proof coins for only a few cents above face value, and it would have to sell the proof Columbians for more than $1 so as to avoid devaluing the uncirculated commemoratives. Mint authorities decided against a public sale of proof Columbians.|$|E
5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E
5|$|Bullock {{served as}} Chambers' second for the duel; Bibb acted as second for Rowan. According to Bibb, he and Bullock met on February 1 {{to discuss the}} {{parameters}} for the duel. Bullock proposed that the matter be dropped, but Bibb insisted that Chambers would have to retract his challenge, to which Bullock would not consent. The duel was held February 3, 1801, near Bardstown. Both combatants missed with their first shots. Both men fired again, and Rowan's second shot struck Chambers, wounding him severely. (Bibb's account says that Chambers was <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left side; other accounts state that the shot hit Chambers in the chest.) Rowan then offered his carriage to take Chambers to town for medical attention, and Chambers asked that Rowan not be prosecuted. Despite medical aid, Chambers died the following day.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 poisha. 1 poisha coins followed in 1974, with 1 coins introduced <b>in</b> 1975. <b>The</b> 1, 5 and 10 poisha were <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> aluminium, with <b>the</b> 25 and 50 poisha <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> steel and <b>the</b> 1 <b>in</b> copper-nickel. <b>The</b> 5 poisha were square with rounded corners, and the 10 poisha were scalloped.

5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jokwe of March 2008 was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Mozambique since Cyclone Favio <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous year, and was the most recent cyclone to make landfall on Mazambique until Cyclone Dineo in 2017. The tenth named storm of the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Jokwe was first classified as a tropical depression on March 2 over the open Southwest Indian Ocean. It tracked west-southwest, crossing northern Madagascar as a tropical storm on March 5 before intensifying into a tropical cyclone on March 6. Jokwe rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 195km/h (120mph), before weakening slightly and striking Nampula Province in northeastern Mozambique. It quickly weakened while paralleling the coastline, though the storm restrengthened as it turned southward in the Mozambique Channel. Late in its duration, it remained nearly stationary for several days, and steadily weakened due to wind shear before dissipating on March 16.|$|E
5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was <b>struck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.|$|E
