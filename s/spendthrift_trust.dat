2500|$|Most {{states have}} {{property}} laws that allow a trust agreement {{to contain a}} legally enforceable restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest in the trust (sometimes known as an [...] "anti-alienation provision"). The anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors of a beneficiary from acquiring the beneficiary's share of the trust. Such a trust is sometimes called a <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trust.</b> To prevent fraud, most states allow this protection {{only to the extent}} that the beneficiary did not transfer property to the trust. Also, such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trust</b> is recognized. This means that the beneficiary's share of the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{relevant}} sense, a trust {{can be viewed}} as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the [...] "governing instrument", be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation, although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee's creditors), making it [...] "bankruptcy remote", and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E

Professor Danforth analyzes with considerable acuity {{the ins and}} outs of the specific rights creditors and beneficiaries of trusts have under the Uniform Trust Code (UTC). His article clearly represents the most detailed analysis of the new Code's approach to <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trusts.</b> Professor Danforth is determined to establish that Article V is not as creditor-friendly as its critics claim. 2 His article is essentially an apologia, coupled with some proposed modifications so as to leave no doubt about this. However, in his zeal to defend Article V and refute the contention that it is too creditor-friendly, Professor Danforth strikingly ignores its manifold shortcomings. Article V is a missed opportunity to legislate a coherent theory of creditor rights and spendthrift protections. As drafted, it is a disappointing amalgam of often contradictory, formalistic rules...|$|R

50|$|A <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trust</b> is {{an example}} of an {{arrangement}} containing an anti-alienation provision.

5000|$|Nevada has {{enacted a}} series of statutes, codified at Chapter 166 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, that {{specifically}} enable the creation of self-settled <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trusts.</b> This form of trust is {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "Nevada Asset Protection Trust". Under Chapter 166, an individual can serve as the settlor, trustee and beneficiary of the trust. This network of laws is specifically designed to protect trust assets from the claims of any creditor. NRS 166.170 specifically limits the circumstances under which a creditor may bring a claim. If a creditor existed {{at the time of the}} property's transfer to the trust, then the creditor must bring its claim against the trust within 2 years after the transfer or within six months after the creditor reasonably should have known of the transfer, whichever is later. NRS 166.170(1). If the creditor's claim surfaces after the transfer is made, the creditor must bring its claim within two years after the transfer, regardless of notice. NRS 166.170(1).

40|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, {{authoritative}} treatise writers such as James Kent and Joseph Story represented Anglo-American trust law as a seamless web. But the transplantation of trust law from England to America was not a simple process of adherence. Rather, American courts and legislatures came to discard fundamental English trust doctrines. Restraints on anticipation and on alienation were embraced, and in key state jurisdictions bare trusts were abolished, or else displaced from the core of trust law. Irreducible settlor power over beneficiaries and the strong protection of beneficiaries from creditors under <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trusts</b> were two strikingly original American creations, which flowed from these basic doctrinal choices. The changes made to American trust doctrine yield a paradox for the legal, social and economic historian, namely that republican America {{ended up with a}} more dynastic property law, more wedded to dead hand control and more hostile to commercial creditors, than did aristocratic England with its unreformed system of common law and equity rooted in the feudal property system. The American abandonment of free alienability of beneficial interests and the corresponding reduction of the beneficiary's powers over trust assets may have been rooted in the volatility of credit in America and the desire of the wealthy to escape from the pressures of the market, though disparities between jurisdictions remain to be explained. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the first article-length {{treatment of the}} legal rules that enable uninsured and underinsured individuals to escape tort liability by sheltering their income and assets from collection. These legal barriers to collecting tort judgments include limits on wage garnishment, homestead exemptions, retirement-plan exemptions, discharge in bankruptcy, <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trusts,</b> offshore asset protection trusts, and more. Of course, indigent persons would be judgment-proof even without these rules, because they have so few assets and so little income. Contrary to the myth of personal tort liability that is standard in torts scholarship and teaching, however, these legal rules enable huge numbers of working-class, middle-class, and affluent people to be (or become) judgment-proof {{despite the fact that}} they have decent incomes and significant assets that could be used to satisfy a tort judgment. The article describes the most important of these judgment-proofing rules in depth, demonstrates that they seriously undermine the deterrence and corrective justice goals of tort law, argues that they lack any persuasive justification, proposes specific reforms to reduce the judgment-proof problem, and evaluates the political feasibility of this agenda. It also discusses the important role of liability insurance in dealing with the residual threat of personal tort liability, and suggests ways in which increased use of mandatory liability insurance could contribute to solving the judgment-proof problem...|$|R

50|$|Manchester was {{a notorious}} spendthrift, {{and as a}} result of the {{excessive}} spending of both him and the prior two Dukes, the family's fortune (already low) was completely exhausted, culminating in the sale of the family's lands during the tenure of the tenth Duke.

40|$|This Article {{develops}} {{an agency}} costs {{theory of the}} law of private trusts, focusing chiefly on donative trusts. The agency costs approach offers fresh insights into recurring problems in trust law including, among others, modification and termination, settlor standing, fiduciary litigation, trust-investment law and the duty of impartiality, trustee removal, the role of so-called trust 2 ̆ 2 protectors, 2 ̆ 2 and <b>spendthrift</b> <b>trusts.</b> The normative claim is that the law of trusts should minimize the agency costs inherent in locating managerial authority with the trustee and the residual claim with the beneficiaries, but {{only to the extent that}} doing so is consistent with the ex ante instructions of the settlor. Accordingly, the use of the private trust triggers a temporal agency problem (whether the trustee will remain loyal to the settlor’s original wishes) in addition to the usual agency problem when risk-bearing and management are separated (whether the trustee/manager will act in the best interests of the beneficiaries/residual claimants). The positive claim is that, at least with respect to traditional doctrines, the law of trusts conforms to the suggested normative approach. The Article draws on the economics of the principal-agent problem and the theory of the firm, and it engages the ongoing debate about whether trust law is closer to property law or contract law. The analysis should be amenable to extension in future work to commercial and charitable trusts...|$|R
