50|$|The Unfair <b>Contract</b> <b>Terms</b> Act 1977 (c 50) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom which regulates {{contracts}} {{by restricting}} {{the operation and}} legality of some <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> It extends to nearly all forms of contract {{and one of its}} most important functions is limiting the applicability of disclaimers of liability. The terms extend to both actual <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> and notices that are seen to constitute a contractual obligation.|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{explores the}} {{enforceability}} and presence of pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> in internet retail contracts. Analyzing case law on internet contract enforceability and {{a survey of}} 500 firms’ websites, it demonstrates that even the enforceability of many internet contracts is questionable. It then presents new data that suggest that the prevalence of pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> is far less than usually assumed. It suggests that the benefit of making these terms enforceable is outweighed {{by the loss of}} user friendliness required for the necessary interface changes. Finally, it uses fresh statistical analyses to determine what relationship, if any, exists between enforceability, pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms,</b> business size, product channel, or product type. Generally, it concludes that the contract literature has likely overestimated the benefit of the pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> and underestimated the role internet <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> play in informal enforcement; unenforceable terms may still serve as guideposts to dispute resolution...|$|R

Typically the theory associates the choice of debt <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> to firm and market characteristics, arguing that an adequate choice of debt <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> allows for the reduction of debt-contracting costs. We use a panel-data approach to examine the validity of extant predictions concerning the choice of maturity, call options, convertible options and other covenants [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} industry structure, {{corporate governance}} at firm-level and country-level, {{and the bank}} loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> by analysing 2, 689 companies from 23 countries during the period 2004 – 2008. We find that firms in less competitive industries, with better firm-level governance, or with better country-level governance borrow larger sized loans at lower interest rates without collateral requirements. However, the effect of monopoly power of market concentration on the loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> is adjusted by corporate governance mechanisms. By controlling for both firm-level and country-level governance, firms in competitive industries are found to have favored loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> Substitution effects between firm-level governance and country-level governance in determining the loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> are also evidenced by our results...|$|R

40|$|A {{rudimentary}} {{conceptualization of}} the development of ancillary <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> would assert competition will result in terms that are joint-wealth-maximizing for merchants and customers. Building on developments in modeling frictions in markets, this article presents simple models of frictions in multi-period contracting as to ancillary <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> The modeling illustrates that, for plausible parameter estimates of frictions, combinations of switching costs and investigation costs may allow collectively inferior <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> to persist in consumer transactions. The results are in harmony with recent evidence illustrating the infrequency with which consumers actually read <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> The modeling identifies circumstances where this opportunistic behavior [...] taking advantage of frictions to secure collectively suboptimal <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> [...] is particularly likely. They include: (i) contracts of small dollar amounts, in terms of consideration or marginal cost in rendering performance; (ii) contracting involving the sequencing of relationship-specific investments during formation; (iii) multi-period contracting involving increasing switching costs; (iv) rapidly growing markets; and (v) merchants who bifurcate contractual terms among customers. A number of these factors are common to the provision of online services. This article additionally samples authority that can be revived by courts inclined to police opportunistic structuring of the methods of mutual assent to secure collectively suboptimal <b>contract</b> <b>terms...</b>|$|R

40|$|European {{legislation}} currently {{does not}} clearly determine in what language standard <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> must be drafted {{in order to}} be validly incorporated into consumer contracts so they can be relied upon by a trader. This may be particularly problematic {{in the case of a}} cross-border contract as parties may not speak the same language. In this paper, I indicate to what extent the transparency requirement may play a role in determining the language in which the standard <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> are to be drafted. Finally, on the basis of experiments I conducted with colleagues, I conclude that traders should be required to provide the standard <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> in the <b>contracting</b> language, but that there is no need to require them to provide the standard <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> in the consumer’s mother tongue...|$|R
