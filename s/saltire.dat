5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the <b>Saltire</b> surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the <b>Saltire,</b> in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the <b>Saltire,</b> however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a <b>Saltire</b> surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a <b>Saltire</b> surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the <b>Saltire</b> will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the <b>Saltire</b> may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the <b>Saltire</b> to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a <b>saltire</b> shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the <b>saltire</b> in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, the <b>Saltire</b> can {{be flown}} {{at any time}} by any individual, company, local authority, {{hospital}} or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the <b>Saltire</b> from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the <b>Saltire</b> on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the <b>Saltire</b> on council buildings.|$|E

(This same design, save for the Crown, is used on both the Regimental flag and tactical recognition flash of the Royal Regiment of Scotland). The badge of the No. 679 (The Duke of Connaught's) Squadron Army Air Corps bears a <b>Saltire</b> between two wreaths ensigned 'Scottish Horse'; an honour they received in 1971 which originated through their links with the Royal Artillery. The Officer Training Corps units attached to universities in Edinburgh and Glasgow, plus the Tayforth University OTC, all feature the <b>Saltire</b> in their cap badge designs.|$|E

5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a <b>saltire</b> argent. The tincture of the <b>Saltire</b> can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white <b>saltire</b> appeared in the blue sky and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting of a blue background over which is placed a white representation of an X-shaped cross, the <b>Saltire</b> is one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.|$|E

2500|$|The 310th's coat of {{arms and}} {{distinctive}} unit insignia were approved on 23 September 1932, and both rescinded on 2 February 1959. The distinctive unit insignia included a 1 1/8 in (2.86 cm) gold colored metal and enamel device, which consisted of a yellow shield with cut off <b>saltires</b> {{in the shape of}} an [...] "X" [...] in the center, and three conjoined horse's heads over the <b>saltires.</b> The yellow shield symbolized the cavalry, while the <b>saltires</b> and the horse's heads represented the regiment's number, 310. The regimental motto, [...] "Fidelis" [...] (Faithful), was attached {{to the bottom of the}} distinctive unit insignia. The regimental {{coat of arms}} was of a similar design to the distinctive unit insignia but included the Organized Reserve's Minuteman crest above the shield and omitted the motto.|$|R

5|$|The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, {{plus the}} Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the <b>Saltire</b> {{in a variety}} of forms. Combat and {{transport}} vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the <b>Saltire</b> was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan), have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being draped over the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.|$|E

5|$|The white inescutcheon {{is itself}} charged with five smaller blue shields (escudetes) {{arranged}} like a Greek cross (1+3+1). Each smaller shield holds five white bezants {{displayed in the}} form of a <b>saltire</b> (2+1+2). The red bordure is charged with seven yellow castles: three on the chief portion (one in each corner and one in the middle), two in the middle points of each quadrant of the curved base (rotated 45degrees), and two more on each side of the bordure, over the flag's horizontal middle line. Each castle is composed by a base building, showing a closed (yellow) gate, on top of which stand three battlemented towers. In heraldic terminology, the shield's blazon is described as Argent, five escutcheons in cross azure each charged with five plates in <b>saltire,</b> on a bordure gules seven towers triple-turreted Or, three in chief.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the <b>Saltire,</b> variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the <b>Saltire</b> itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{simplified}} symbol {{which does not}} depict St. Andrew's image, the <b>saltire</b> or crux decussata, (from the Latin crux, 'cross', and decussis, 'having {{the shape of the}} Roman numeral X'), began in the late 14th century. In June 1385, the Parliament of Scotland decreed that Scottish soldiers serving in France would wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross, both in front and behind, for identification.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is found in the}} Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503, in which a white <b>saltire</b> is depicted with a red background. In the case of Scotland, use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century, with the first certain illustration of a flag depicting such appearing in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's Register of Scottish Arms, circa 1542.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{proportions}} are not fixed, but 3:5 is {{most commonly}} used, {{as with other}} flags of {{the countries of the}} United Kingdom. (Flag manufacturers themselves may adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3). Lord Lyon King of Arms states that 5:4 is suitable. The ratio of the width of the bars of the <b>saltire</b> in relation to the width of the field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width. However, this ratio, though not rigid, is specified as one-third to one-fifth of the width of the field.|$|E
