40|$|Abstract—Sensor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in context-aware computing. While sensor modeling is usually isolated from former researches on context modeling <b>and</b> <b>sensor</b> type is always restricted to physical ones, this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive insight into the relationships between <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> context. Based on a more generic definition of <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> a corresponding <b>sensor</b> category in context-aware computing, main characteristics of <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> the relations between <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> context are analyzed in details. In particular, a multi-sensor oriented context model based on ontology approach is proposed. The model which has been applied to a middleware supporting for rapid context-aware applications development is proved to be effective.

40|$|Wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> {{actuator}} network applications require {{several levels}} of testing during their development. Although software algorithms {{can be tested}} through simulations and syntax checking, {{it is difficult to}} predict or test for problems that may occur once the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator has been deployed. The requirement for testing is not however limited to the development phase. During the lifecycle of the system, faults, upgrades, retasking, etc. lead to further needs for system validation. In this paper we review the state-of-the-art techniques for testing wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator applications and propose the Integrity-Checking Framework. The framework provides in-situ full lifecycle testing and validation of wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator applications by performing an “Integrity Check”, during which the <b>sensor</b> inputs <b>and</b> actuator responses ar...|$|R
40|$|This book {{introduces}} various coverage control {{problems for}} mobile sensor networks including barrier, sweep and blanket. Unlike many existing algorithms, {{all of the}} robotic <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator motion algorithms developed in the book are fully decentralized or distributed, computationally efficient, easily implementable in engineering practice and based only on information on the closest neighbours of each mobile <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator and local information about the environment. Moreover, the mobile robotic sensors have no prior information about {{the environment in which}} they operation. These various types of coverage problems have never been covered before by a single book in a systematic way. Another topic of this book is the study of mobile robotic <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator networks. Many modern engineering applications include the use of <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator networks to provide efficient and effective monitoring and control of industrial and environmental processes. Such mobile <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator networks are able to achieve improved performance and efficient monitoring together with reduction in power consumption and production cost...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{statistical}} theoretical framework for incorporation of <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator faults in dynamic simulations of wastewater treatment operation. <b>Sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator faults and failures are often neglected in simulations for control strategy development and testing, {{although it is}} well known that they represent a significant obstacle for realising control at full-scale facilities. The framework for incorporating faults and failures is based on Markov chains and displays the appealing property of easy transition of <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator history into a model for fault generation. The paper briefly describes Markov theory and how this is used together with models for <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator dynamics to achieve a realistic simulation of measurements and actuators...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for designing cost-effective optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator configurations useful for structural model updating and health monitoring purposes. The optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator configuration is selected {{such that the}} resulting measured data are most informative {{about the condition of}} the structure. This selection is based on an information entropy measure of the uncertainty in the model parameter estimates obtained using a statistical system identification methodology. The optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator configuration is selected as the one that minimizes the information entropy. A discrete optimization problem arises which is solved efficiently using genetic algorithms. This study also addresses important issues related to robustness of the optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator configuration to unavoidable uncertainties in the structural model, as well as issues related to the optimal <b>sensor</b> <b>and</b> actuator configurations designed to monitor multiple damage scenarios. The theoretical developments are illustrated by designing the optimal configuration for a 40 -DOF two-dimensional truss structure subjected to an impulse hammer excitation...|$|R

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the <b>sensors</b> <b>and</b> actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
