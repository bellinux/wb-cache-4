40|$|The renal {{arteriography}} has four methods, i. e., translumbar aort o graphy, retrograde aortography, selective {{renal arteriography}}, and intravenous aortography. The author attempted clinical observations on 262 cases of translumbar aortography and 34 cases of intravenous aortography {{which he had}} performed at Kyoto Univ. during his stay there, the period of April 1953 through June 1961. Especially, the clinical value on the dynamic x-ray diagnosis by application of the <b>seriography</b> was discussed with given instances. 1. Clinical Observations on Renal Arteriography b y Translumbar Abdominal Aortography There were included not only urologic diseases as renal tumor and urolithiasis etc., but also renal hypertension etc., in 262 cases which the translumbar aortography had been employed. The single shoot was made on most cases, and the <b>seriography</b> was taken in 79 cases which included both methods the seriographic apparatus was used in 73 cases and ODELCA mirror camera was used in 6 cases. The 16 mm x-ray cinematography was taken in 8 cases {{for the purpose of}} dynamic x-ray diagnosis. Side reactions of the aortograph y were found only in 15 cases. The most of them were the irritative symptoms caused by the contrast media, and it was demonstrated that 76 % Urografin (Schering) was most nonirritating. No such severe symptoms, as have been described in other references, were observed. The times of the appearances of the pictures which were shown by <b>seriography</b> were as follows : the shadow of the renal artery appeared during 1. 0 - 3. 0 sec., nephrogram during 2. 0,- 6. 0 sec., renal vein during 4. 0 - 6. 0 sec., renal calyces and pelves during 50. 0 - 60. 0 sec. after the beginning of injection respectively. Some other arteries in the abdo m inal cavity as well as the renal artery appeared by this method. I n cases of renal tumor, irregular pooling pictures of contrast media in the neoplastic area appeared well, and it was shown that the picture appeared and disappeared later than the shadow of the renal artery by means of <b>seriography.</b> In a case of solitary cyst of the kidney, a v ascularity in the cystic area and bow-shaped blood vessels around the area appeared clearly by this method. In a cases of hydronephrosis, function of the dise a s ed kidney was well estimated and an aberrant artery obstructing the ureter was visualized by this method. A case of horse-shoe kidney was demonstrated, being one o f congenital anomalies of the kidney. In a cases of Goldblatt's hypertension a picture of the renal artery stenosis was demonstrated. In a case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the slowed circulation in the aneurysmal part was shown but the renal arteries were normally demonstrated. 2. Clinical Observations on R e n a l A rteriography by Intravenous Abdominal Aortography This method was performed on 34 cases, mos t of whom were renal tuberculosis, urolithiasis and renal tumors etc. The single shoot was emplo y ed in most cases, and the <b>seriography</b> was taken in 5 cases and the 16 mm x-ray cinematography in 2 cases. The author hopes that applications of the <b>seriography</b> will be made in these cases to obtain clearer pictures of the renal artery. The appearance of the picture of the renal artery in <b>seriography</b> was during 7. 0 - 15. 0 sec. following the beginning of injection, and nephrogram appeared during 8. 0 - 16. 0 sec. and renal calyces and pelves at 90 sec. The pictures of renal artery and nephrogram in a case of ureteral calculus were demonstrated. It was shown by the seriographic method that pictures of the renal artery and nephrogram appeared late in case of the aortic aneurysm located above the renal arteryies. The intravenous aortography is more simple and more safe than the tr a n slumbar one, and has some other excellent clinical values. However, the former is somewhat inferior to the latter in a point of the contrast density of the picture. This research had been performed during the author's stay at the Kyoto University.

40|$|The {{author and}} others {{reported}} {{a part of}} results ab o ut studies of "Physiology and Pathology of Voiding" which was done by application of <b>seriography</b> and cineradiography to voiding cystourethrography. The c onclusions are as follows : 1) In normal cases, descending of the bladder base and opening of the internal meatus were shown. 2) In prostatic hypertrophy where patients could not void spontaneously descending of the bladder base was shown to a slight degree, but using the parasympathomimetic agent, Besacolin, the descent became more clear than before. After prostatectomy the descent of the bladder base {{and the opening of}} the internal meatus were clearly shown and urine was completely voided. 3) In p r ostatic cancer, descending of the bladder base and opening of the internal meatus were scarecely shown. The author believes that the above indications as well as the stiffness of the posterior urethra should be a help in differential diagnosis from the prostatic hypertrophy. 4) In neurogenic bladder, descending of the bladder base and opening of the internal meatus were clearly shown. 5) In urethral s t r icture, dilatation of the urethra as far as the strictural portion was shown with hard voiding...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{experiences}} with 75 % Urokolin-M,a new c ontrast media newly manufactured by Daiichi Pharmaceutical Company have been reported. 1) Excretory pyelography with Urokolin- M has been performed in 21 cases, among which 10 cases were performed in horizontal position using ureteral compressor band, 4 cases in trendelenburg position (10 - 15 °) with ureteral compressor band, 1 case in horizontal position without the band, 6 cases in trendelenburg position without the band. Satisfactory pyelogram was produced 7 - 15 minutes after intravenous Urokolin-M had been started regardless the methods employed {{as far as}} the kidney function was normal. As the side reactions, reddening of face, anguish sensation and nausea were noticed in 4 cases during intravenous injection of the media but they were not serious and no vascular pain was encountered as seen with Urokolin. 2) Translumbar abdo m inala ortography was performed in 5 cases, among which <b>seriography</b> was employed in 2 cases. Satisfactory aortograms were produced in all of 5 cases.

40|$|Four {{methods of}} renal arteriography, i. e., translumbar aortography, {{retrograde}} aortography, selective renal arteriography, and intravenous aortography have been introduced. Procedure and advantages of each method were presented. In our department, translumbar aortography is routinely employed because of simple instruments and technique required. Intravenous aortography was employed {{in a few}} cases. The author attempted inclusive observations on 206 cases of translu m ber aortography performed at his department {{during the period of}} April 1953 through March 1960. Disorders to which the aortography has been employed include renal hypertension as well as urologic disorders, which demonstrates wide clinical usage. Although a single shoot was employed in most cas e s, <b>seriography</b> was taken in 71 cases and 16 mm roentgencinematography was taken in 8 cases for functional diagnosis. In order to establish the relationship between renal arteriogram and urinary tract, combination of retrograde pyelography or pneumoretroperitoneum with the arteriogram was performed in 33 cases. Technical fail u re to produce renal arteriogram was found in 39 cases, their possible cases were discussed. The most causes of these technical failures were extraaortal extravasation of contrast media and inadequate exposure of the X-ray, etc. Side reaction of the arteriography was found only 15 cases. The most of the side reactions were the irritative symptoms caused by the contrast media. 76 % Urografin (Schering) was demonstrated to be most non-irritating. No such severs symptoms as have been described were observed...|$|E
40|$|Reports {{were made}} of {{experiences}} with a new co n trast agent, Umbradil and Umbradil Viscous U of Messrs, Astra, Sweden. 1) Excretory pyelography was carried out using Umbradil 35 % in 7, 50 % in 8, and 70 % in 2 cases, totaling 17 cases. Satisfactory pictures were obtained in all cases within 7 to 15 minutes after initiatation of the injection. Urograms were taken without urete r al compression in 5 patients, which procedures generally resulted in an insufficient filling of the agent and afforded unclear shadows, as compared with those cases where an ureteral compresser band was used. Then the shadows obtained were found unclear in 2 cases where a 70 % Umbradil was employed, too. Side reactions were slight, only a transient nausea and feverish sensation being experienced in 2 patients, respectively. 2) Umbradil 70 % w a s employed for translumbar abdominal aortography in 10 cases and for <b>seriography</b> in 3 of the 10 cases. With both procedures were obtained quite satisfactory arteriogram. sIn 1 patient with Goldblatt's hypertension a sense of oppression of the chest was induced and in 1 patient was encountered an incidence of nausea, but no side reactions other than the above were produced. 3) Umbradil 70 % was used for abdominal venography via femo ral vein in 2 cases. 4) Umbradil Viscous U was used for urethrography in 21 male patients. In al l cases, the posterior urethra was conspicuously distended, the region of seminal colliculus and the neck of bladder being clearly represented. There was a marked difference in the pictu r es obtai ned between Umbradil Viscous U and NaI 20 % employed as the control, namely the former being of satisfaction as a urethrographic contrast medium {{in that it is}} highly viscous and non-irritating. 5) Umbradil Viscous U was employed for urethrography in 11 female patients, the picture of urethral diverticulum being given in 3 of the 11 patients. It is therf ore satisfactory as a medium for urethrography in the female, too...|$|E
40|$|The roentgenogrms of 339 surgically treated cases wer e {{studied in}} this report. The plain roentgenography, {{retrograde}} pyelography and excretory pyelography {{were used as}} a routine examination to diagnose the renal tuberculosis in our clinic. If necessary, the intravenous nephrography, pneumoretroperitoneum, translumbar aortography, direct pyelography, <b>seriography</b> and enlargement radiography were performed. The roentgenological findings in renal tuberculosis were described in detail {{and the value of}} each method was discussed. The abnormal calcification in renal region was revealed by the plain roentgenography in 20 (5. 9 %) cases. The total and partial cement kidney were present in 9 and 4 cases respectively. This method should be used in all cases. Retrograde pyelography was tried in all case s, and pyelograms were obtained in 169 (49. 9 %) cases succesfully. Almost in all cases the pyelogram showed the lesions in renal pelvis and calices honestly. However, the closed tuberculous cativy in which the contrast medium could not enter was present in 43 (25. 4 %) of the 169 cases. Excretory pyelogsaphy was performed in 213 cases. It off e rs a fairly accurate picture of kidney function in accordance with the destruction of renal parenchym, so it has a great importance not only in the diagnosis but also in the determination of treatment. The cases, whose kidney function was impaired seriously and whose pyelogram could not show the pelvis and calices clearly and sufficiently, were 135 (66. 4 %), and the pathological changes in nephrectomized kidney of these were too extensive to treat by chemotherapy only. It is very interesting that the nearly closed tuberculous cavity could be visu a lised by excretory urography, on the other hand it was impossible to visualise it by retrograde pyelography in some cases. The incidence of the closed cavity is promoted by the chemotherapy, and such cases are resistant to the medical treatment. Diagnosis of such lesion is a very important metter, and many other assistant procedures are used to this purpose. Pneumoretroperitoneum is a useful method to outlining the kidney, but if the a d hesion of the perirenal tissue is firm, it is impossible to clarify the kidney outline. I have been unable to recognize the kidney outline in 11. 5 % of the cases. Direct pyelography is carried out by meens of translumbar direct puncture of the kidney. This is valuable in tuberculous hydronephrosis in which a pyelogram can not be obtained by usual urography. There is no serious complication, if the case is selected properly. Aortography was performed in 11 cases. The pictures of these cases and aortograms of the nephrectomized kidney were illustrated and the details of these cases were described. Translumbar injection of the aorta with a contrast medium permits a accurate visualisation of the arterial blood supply of the tuberculous kidney. I found in a number of cases, that the extent of the lesion could be visualised and assesed on the arteriogram and nephrogram, and that the diagnosis of closed cavity and the estimation of destruction in parenchym could be possible. Then this method may be valuable in tuberculous pyonephrosis, if its pyelogram can not be obtained by urography and the presence of kidney is doutful. Sometimes aortogam affords a great help in determinating the safe extent of the resection when partial nephrectomy is applicable. If pyelogram arouses suspision of the closed lesion, aortography should be carried out with no hesitation. The serial aortography is a very useful procedure to know each stadium of aortography. The arterial phase, nephrography phase and venous phase are different from each other. And it is important that man should try to obtain a clear and complete roentgenogram in any method, especially in arteriography...|$|E
