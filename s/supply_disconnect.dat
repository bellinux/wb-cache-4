40|$|Automated heating, {{lighting}} and irrigation systems are nowadays standard features {{of industrial and}} commercial buildings, and are also increasingly found in ordinary housing. In addition to the benefits of user comfort, automated technology for buildings saves energy and, above all, it provides enhanced protection against leakage of water and hazardous gases, and against fire hazards. Lightning strikes are a natural phenomenon that poses a significant threat {{to the safety of}} buildings. The statistics of the Fire and Rescue Service of the Czech Republic show that buildings are in many cases inadequately protected against lightning strikes, or that systems have been damaged by previous strikes. A subsequent strike can occur within the period between regular inspections, which are normally made at intervals of 2 – 4 years. Over the whole of Europe, thousands of buildings are subjected to the effects of direct lightning strikes each year. This paper presents ways to carry out wireless monitoring of lightning strikes on buildings and to deal with their impact on lightning conductors. By intervening promptly (<b>disconnecting</b> the power <b>supply,</b> <b>disconnecting</b> the gas <b>supply,</b> sending an engineer to inspect the structure, submitting a report to ARC, etc.) we can prevent many downstream effects of direct lightning strikes on buildings (fires, electric shocks, etc.) This paper introduces a way to enhance contemporary home automation systems for monitoring lightning strikes based on wireless sensor networks technology...|$|R
50|$|Ballistic {{conduction}} is the unimpeded flow of charge, or energy-carrying particles, over relatively {{long distances}} in a material.

Thus, ballistic transport in a material is determined by how ballistically conductive that material is. Ballistic conduction differs from superconductivity due to the absence of the Meissner effect in the material. A ballistic conductor would stop conducting if the driving force is turned off, whereas in a superconductor current would continue to flow after the driving <b>supply</b> is <b>disconnected.</b>|$|R

In order to improve the linearity of the Tx chain, the amplifiers driving the power divider network are biased so that the first preamplifier consumes half the current (280 mA) compared to the final stage PAs driving the antennas (560 mA) and the second preamplifier is biased to the same bias point as the final stage PA. The used PAs are normally on gallium nitride (GaN) devices which require a negative gate bias voltage {{to turn off the}} transistor before applying the drain voltage. The gate voltages of the GaN amplifiers are digitally controlled with a DAC that provides the negative voltage bias, so that at start-up the bias, voltage is set to −[*] 5 V and can be ramped up to the appropriate bias point during operation and measurements.

Materials and Methods: Eight cases of primary obstructive megaureter in {{the age group of}} 14 – 22 years underwent laparoscopic extravesical ureteric reimplantation between August 2011 and July 2015 using our novel technique. Five patients had obstruction on left side and three on right side. Follow-up ultrasonography at 1 month and 3 months, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) at 3 months and intravenous urogram (IVU) at 6 months was obtained to assess the development of reflux and to look for adequate drainage of the obstructive ureter. Results: Average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 18. 5 years. Mean operating time was 95 min. Mean blood loss of 20 ml. VCUG done after 3 months showed no reflux in all cases.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure. The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPDs).

50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the <b>supply</b> is reliably <b>disconnected</b> {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed conductive part of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|R
40|$|Large interruptions {{of power}} {{supply in the}} {{transmission}} system have considerable impact on modern society. The goal for the transmission system operator (TSO) is to prevent and mitigate such events with optimal decisions in design, planning, operation and maintenance. Identifying critical power components for system reliability provides one important input to this decision-making. This thesis develops quantitative component reliability importance indices applicable for identifying critical components in real transmission systems. Probabilistic models with component failure statistics are combined with detailed power system models evaluated with the AC power flow technique. In the presented method each system component is assigned three importance indices based on outage events expected probability and consequence to (i) reduced system security margin, (ii) interrupted load <b>supply</b> and (iii) <b>disconnected</b> generation units. By ranking components by {{each of the three}} interests, a more complete view of the risks to system reliability can be assessed than if, as traditionally, only (ii) is modelled. The impact on security margin is studied in well established critical transfer sections (CTS) supervised by the TSO. TSOs set the CTSs limits [MW] based on deterministic security criteria, with regard to thermal, voltage level, and system stability limits, and the CTSs' condition at post-contingency state is in the method used as an indicator of the system security margin. The methodology is extended with three indices modified to quantify the component importance for common-cause events initiated by acts of sabotage. The developed methods are applied on {{a significant part of the}} Great Britain transmission system, modelling 7000 components and 107 substation layouts. The study includes several load demand scenarios, 200 million initiating outage events and non-functioning protection equipment. The resulting component ranking provides an important input to the TSO's decision-making, and could be implemented as a complement to the existing deterministic N- 1 criterion. With the methods applied a TSO can perform further and more detailed assessments on a few critical components in order to enhance system reliability for equipment failures and strengthen the system vulnerability against sabotage.

40|$|Mobile Based Remote Meter Reading and Billing System was {{the title}} of the project chosen to develop for Ceylon Electricity Board in my partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirement of the degree of M. sc in Information Technology of the university of Moratuwa. Ceylon Electricity Board is currently having a computerized billing system. However, it does not have a feature or facility of updating consumer information system from a remote location i. e. from consumer site itself. Due to this reason electricity consumer information system does not reflect the current status of his/her electricity account. Normally it takes approximately 3 – 4 weeks to update the consumer info system with the current electricity meter reading/s after obtaining them from a consumer sites. This {{is one of the major}} drawbacks of the existing computerized electricity billing system. Also current system does not facilitate consumers to view their billing status through organization's website and also there is no facility to make bill payments through the web site. Finally, existing system does not cater for effective Management Information System and also efficient monitoring of overdue accounts. Because of this, Ceylon Electricity Board is unable to <b>disconnect</b> <b>supply</b> of default consumers at the right time. Therefore, under this project, updating of Consumer electricity readings from a remote location by using the mobile technology was proposed. After gathering the Meter Readings by the Bill man he/she can feed or transmit the reading data to the server using a device like mobile phone. This can be done immediately at the consumer site after obtaining the reading or at a later time before 16. 00 Hrs. of the day. By this manner, whole data entry process involve in this activity can be eliminated. At the end of the day, after necessary validations, consumer information system can be updated using the days readings transmitted by all meter readers/bill men to the server. In addition, e-commerce site is developed to facilitate consumer needs such as bill inquiry, making payments etc. Since the system has the facility of sending e-mail and SMS alerts for default consumers, handling of overdue consumers should become easy and efficient.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{a particle}} curtain falling in a horizontally-flowing gas stream and in quiescent air {{was investigated in}} the study. An existing experimental apparatus was modified to generate a particle curtain that spanned the entire width of a duct, and a uniform gas stream that flowed horizontally through the duct. In order to maximise the gas-solids interaction, the existing solids feeder with a rectangular cross-section was also modified to generate a uniform particle curtain with relatively high voidage. Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the behaviour of the falling particle curtain under various conditions. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of a falling particle curtain, models based on single particle behaviour were developed, and an existing CFD model was also employed. The CFD model was developed by Dr. Andrew Lee and Dr. Madoc Sheehan from James Cook University (JCU) to predict the solids transport behaviour within a flighted rotary dryer. Through collaboration with the present author, they modified this CFD model to predict the behaviour of the falling particle curtain in a horizontally-flowing gas stream and in quiescent air using the same conditions as the experiments. The behaviour of a falling particle curtain in a horizontal gas flow was investigated for a range of inlet curtain thicknesses. The experimental results show that for an inlet thickness of 2 cm, the curtain is found to diverge as it falls. Increasing the inlet thickness to 4 cm causes the curtain to become slightly converging, and further increase of the inlet thickness to 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm causes the curtain to become increasingly converging. The CFD model predictions show a reasonable agreement with the measured trajectories of the particle curtain; however, the agreement between the predictions of the single particle model and the measured trajectories is found to be less satisfactory due to the non-uniform gas flow found in practice. The measurements of the gas velocity profiles immediately downstream of the particle curtain show very little gas flows through the upper section of the particle curtain, and most of the gas flows through the lower section where the voidage is higher. In order to study the gas-solids heat transfer of a falling particle curtain in a horizontal gas flow, a stream of particles at ambient temperature was fed through the rectangular feeder. Warm air with a uniform velocity profile flowed horizontally through the duct. The solids temperature inside the curtain and the temperature of air leaving the curtain were measured as a function of distance from the top of the duct. The experimental results show that for a falling particle curtain with small inlet thickness, the solids temperature is found to reach equilibrium with the gas temperature after falling only a short distance from the top of the duct. As the inlet thickness increases, the gas and solids temperature take longer to reach equilibrium. The heat transfer model based on single particle behaviour is able to predict the solids temperatures of the particle curtain with large inlet thicknesses (6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm) reasonably well; however, the agreement with the measured gas temperatures is found to be less satisfactory, particularly in the upper section of the curtain. This is due to the fact that, in practice, the gas flow at the downstream of the curtain is not uniform as assumed by the model. In the study of a falling particle curtain in quiescent air, the air <b>supply</b> system was <b>disconnected</b> from the duct, leaving both end of the duct open to atmospheric pressure. The shape of the falling curtain was investigated for a range of inlet curtain thicknesses. The experimental results indicate that increasing the inlet curtain thickness from 2 cm to 10 cm causes the shape of the particle curtain to change from diverging to converging. A similar trend is also observed when the solids mass flowrate is increased from 0. 015 kg/s to 0. 100 kg/s. The CFD model predictions show a reasonable agreement with the experimental results. It is proposed that the structure of the particle curtain is determined by the balance between the particle pressure generated by the collisions amongst particles within the curtain and the compressive pressure caused by air pressure reduction due to the accelerating particles. When the particle pressure within the particle curtain is greater than the compressive pressure, the particle curtain is found to diverge as it falls. When the particle pressure is weaker that the compressive pressure, the particle curtain is found to converge...|$|R
