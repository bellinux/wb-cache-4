5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. <b>Surely</b> <b>it</b> {{must have been a}} personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. <b>Surely</b> <b>it</b> is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, a new {{coat of arms}} was adopted. Like the DRA coat of arms, this coat {{prominently}} featured Mount Ararat {{along with}} the Soviet hammer and sickle and red star behind it. The inclusion of Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain is part of its territory. The Kremlin retorted that although the Turkish symbol was the crescent, <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> {{did not mean that}} they laid claim to the moon. The Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 and Armenia thus became an independent republic. In 1992, a slightly modified version of the DRA's coat of arms was adopted and has remained in place ever since.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If {{ever there was}} music from another planet, this is <b>surely</b> <b>it.</b> Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing." [...] Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work Commotio, was premiered posthumously in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|Some in Russian society were {{surprised}} that a Russian music school would actually {{attempt to be}} Russian.

[...] That is an original idea!" [...] Rubinstein adds, And <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> was surprising that the theory of Music was to be taught {{for the first time}} in the Russian language at our Conservatory....

2500|$|The name Seri is an exonym {{for this}} people {{that has been}} used since the first {{contacts}} with the Spaniards (sometimes written differently, as ceres). Gilg reported in 1692 that it was a Spanish name, but <b>surely,</b> <b>it</b> was the name used by another group of the area to refer to the Seris. Nevertheless, modern claims that it is a Yaqui term that means something like [...] "people of the sand" [...] or an Opata term that means [...] "people who run fast". They are lacking in factual basis; no evidence has been presented for the former and no credible evidence has been presented for the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> stands to reason, [...] "How much more then if we go to Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and does it not follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E
2500|$|With Kuyper, Van Til {{believed}} that the Christian and the non-Christian have different ultimate standards, presuppositions that color the interpretation of every fact in every area of life. But with Warfield, he {{believed that}} a rational proof for Christianity is possible: [...] "Positively Hodge and Warfield were quite right in stressing the fact that Christianity meets every legitimate demand of reason. Surely Christianity is not irrational. To be sure, it must be accepted on faith, but <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> must not be taken on blind faith. Christianity is capable of rational defense."

2500|$|In a November 1941 report, the Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau {{accused the}} Red Army of {{employing}} [...] "a terror policy... against defenseless German soldiers that {{have fallen into}} its hands and against members of the German medical corps. At the same time... it has made use of the following means of camouflage: in a Red Army order that bears {{the approval of the}} Council of People's Commissars, dated 1 July 1941, the norms of international law are made public, which the Red Army {{in the spirit of the}} Hague Regulations on Land Warfare are supposed to follow...

2500|$|In another place, Surah 2:83 {{mentions}} that the covenant taken by Musa (i.e. Moses) from Bani Israel had also included {{the condition that}} they should indulge in good and worthwhile conversation, while being kind to parents, kindred, orphans and those in need, practice regular charity and to worship God alone. While, Sura 104:1-19 condemns those who are scandal/gossip-mongers and backbiters in strong terms, describing their punishment as [...] "Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One; And what will explain to thee what the Consuming One is! (It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze), Which rises above the hearts. <b>Surely</b> <b>it</b> shall be closed over upon them, In outstretched columns.", thus hinting that believers need {{to steer clear of}} such acts.|$|E
2500|$|... "Rydberg's work was, then, stamped as a failure, {{and this}} verdict from certain {{points of view}} cannot be {{considered}} unjust, seems to have caused the book to fall into oblivion, a fate which <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> has not deserved." [...] Among contemporary Swedish reviewers, Hildebrand and Bååth were appreciative, the latter unreservedly praising the work. In 1892, Irish scholar Stopford A. Brooke remarked: [...] "When we have made every allowance for a certain fancifulness, and for the bias which a well-loved theory creates, this book is a real contribution to Northern mythology." [...] While, in 1942, Fredrik Gadde concluded: [...] "Even though the views set forth by Rydberg never stood a chance of being accepted, there are points in his exposition that deserve being once more brought to light." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a long-time}} enthusiast of William Blake, and {{president}} of the Blake Society, Pullman led a campaign in winter 2014 to buy the Sussex cottage where the poet lived between 1800 and 1803, saying: <b>Surely</b> <b>it</b> isn’t beyond the resources of a nation that can spend enormous amounts of money on acts of folly and unnecessary warfare, a nation that likes to boast about its literary heritage, to find {{the money to pay for}} a proper memorial and a centre for the study of this great poet and artist. Not least because this is the place where he wrote the words now often sung as an alternative (and better) national anthem, the poem known as Jerusalem: [...] "And did those feet in ancient time". Blake’s feet walked in Felpham. Let’s not let this opportunity pass by.|$|E
2500|$|Kahane {{proposed}} an [...] "exchange of populations" [...] that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: [...] "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. <b>Surely</b> <b>it</b> {{is time for}} Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago." [...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't {{think that we can}} sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus." ...|$|E
2500|$|... kal va-chomer is as follows: Leviticus 18:21 {{speaks of}} the {{prohibition}} of worshiping Molech, a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume {{that if it were}} prohibited to pass some of one's children through the fire, <b>surely</b> <b>it</b> would be prohibited to pass all of one's children through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word [...] "ומזרעך", lit. [...] "and from your seed," [...] that this prohibition is only when some of one's children are sacrificed in this worship; when all of one's children are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve {{the health and well-being of}} one's remaining children, whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly.|$|E
