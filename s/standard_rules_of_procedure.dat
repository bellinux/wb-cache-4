5000|$|On March 27, 2017, Arizona Summit was {{notified}} by the ABA {{that the school}} had been placed on probation. [...] The school {{was found to be}} out of compliance with ABA <b>Standards</b> and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> for Approval <b>of</b> Law Schools 301(a), 308(a), and 309(b), as well as various sections of Standard 501. The ABA stated [...] "that the law school’s admissions practices, academic program…and outcomes…have resulted in the law school now being in a position where only immediate and substantial action can bring about sufficient change to put the law school on a realistic path back to being in compliance within the time allowed by the <b>Standards</b> and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Procedure.” Arizona Summit became the second InfiLaw school to be placed on probation by the ABA. Charlotte School of Law was placed on probation in November 2016.|$|R
40|$|Giving Credit Where Credit is Due; U. S. Perspectives on Recognition of Academic Credit for Coursework Completed Abroad In 2016, the ABA’s Section on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar issued {{revisions}} to Standard 310, Determination of Credit Hours for Coursework, {{as well as}} a Guidance Memo from the Managing Director. The Section also issued a Memorandum further explaining implementation of the Revised <b>Standards</b> and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> as they affect other Standards that relate to credit transfer for study abroad. These changes will affect the ways that all of our schools determine how to accept credit for student work done under the supervision of our partner schools abroad. How should U. S. law schools implement the revised Standards? This panel will encourage a lively discussion of this important question, one that is informed not only by the ABA revision process, but also by thoughtful approaches to similar questions debated in other countries. After all, regulating the granting of credit for coursework undertaken at foreign universities is not uniquely an issue for U. S. law schools. Law schools in Canada and universities throughout the European Union, for example, have participated in educational exchanges for nearly thirty years. This panel will also attempt to encourage discussion of the implementation of ABA Revised Standard 310 as informed by approaches in other countries. Presenters: William E.

The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly, contrary to UN's <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> (Provisional <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> <b>of</b> the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59). On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision [...] "was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the one-China principle".

40|$|In 2008, the Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association {{commenced}} {{a comprehensive}} review of the accreditation standards for American legal education. By July of 2011, most of the revised <b>standards</b> and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> had been drafted, discussed and approved by the section 2 ̆ 7 s Standards Review Committee (2 ̆ 2 SRC 2 ̆ 2) and were ready for submission to the council. However, the SRC 2 ̆ 7 s revised accreditation policies were not submitted for action by the council until 2014, more than six years after the review process began, as a result of decisions made by section leaders. The revised standards were particularly noteworthy for addressing several of the most significant accreditation issues facing legal education and higher education nationally, including: the need for greater focus on student learning outcomes and assessment of student learning; the utility of a common admission examination; a greater focus on educating for lawyering skills and competencies; and a sufficiently ambitious minimum bar success rate applicable to all law schools. In nearly all respects the review was both comprehensive and successful. However, {{at the end of the}} lengthy process, the council was unable to approve a few highly important provisions. Those provisions, referred to as policies pertaining to 2 ̆ 2 terms and conditions of faculty employment 2 ̆ 2 (T 2 ̆ 6 CE) and protection of academic freedom, are the subject of this article. The article provides a look at the history of the efforts undertaken during the comprehensive review to revise and improve the accreditation policies concerning T 2 ̆ 6 CE and faculty academic freedom and describes why, at the conclusion of the comprehensive review, the council failed to address them. In particular, the article describes the constituencies consulted and the factors considered by the SRC in drafting revised T 2 ̆ 6 CE standards and how the proposed revisions addressed complex issues concerning rights, duties, and status of all law faculty. The article contends that the council failed its leadership responsibilities by refusing to make a decision among several options that it had requested when confronted by competing interest-group preferences. The article concludes with some encouragement to the council to take the leadership initiative and address the perplexing, and likely to be enduring, difficulties of the T 2 ̆ 6 CE policies, given the likelihood that, in the future, the current standards will need to be amended to resolve their ambiguities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The European Ombudsman is a {{new kind}} of ‘agent’, whose status and role remain unclear. On the one hand, it is {{formally}} a parliamentary body, designed to strengthen the control of EU institutions and administrations by MEPs; on the other hand, the profile and role of this organ is close to that of a court. This article argues that the hybrid nature of this organ is the reason for its success. The powers of the Ombudsman, limited as they are, give him the opportunity to combine the instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial control in an original way. As such it is well equipped to scrutinize those agents which cannot be submitted to classic parliamentary controls without losing their independence, and thereby helps to reconcile executive delegation with parliamentary democracy. KEY WORDS Accountability; European governance; Ombudsman; parliament-ary scrutiny; <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law; transparency. It has become commonplace to say that parliaments alone can no longer hold the state apparatus accountable, in a context of increasingly complex and technical ‘governance’. The European Union (EU) is confronted with that problem, more than any other national political system (Joerges and Dehousse 2002; Harlow 2002). Its competence, which is often technical and based on expertise, implies that new forms of political control should be invented (Majone 2001). Its intricate institutional system, in which the European Parliament (EP) does not play the same central role as national parliaments, necessitates complementary modes of political accountability (Lord 1998). The nature of this problem explains the creation of the European Ombuds-man in the Treaty of Maastricht. This organ illustrates a new trend in the legitimization of the Union, which consists in subjecting ‘all of the Union’s institutions to <b>standard</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and <b>procedures,</b> or scrutiny by agents who are dedicated to a single task but responsible for applying it across the entir...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of technology-based tools into developing countries is usually impeded {{by a number}} of potential problems. The problems become murkier when the context of the issue, such as external debt management, where technology is to be used, does not have a <b>standard</b> textbook <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and <b>procedures</b> to follow. The principle problems encountered during the course of our research for this thesis hinged the issue of possible inapplicability of information technology (IT), especially information and decision support systems (I/DSS). This is also the case for other tools and techniques built and used by developed countries in the developing world. The great deal of difference in the context of use; content of the systems; and the attitudes of the parties involved in the process forms the basis for our argument. The research was intended to draw on the lessons learned by the Cabinet Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) during the introduction I/DSS for improving the decision making process in developing countries. Moreover, the research intended to tackle the issue of using I/DSS in a totally new context, other than for very structured purposes such as manufacturing and the like, and a challenging environment such as those in developing countries where difficulties of implementation and use are more in context, content and cultural issues than technological ones. The research would then show implications, identify problems and challenges and try to develop generalizations and recommendations. The research, since its initial phases, had to consider the forces of centralization versus decentralization and the organizational structure of decision making especially at the top level. Other issues such as I/DSS project planning and implementation; organizational dynamics and the research at the organizational level related to national policy; and technical information systems development were taken into consideration. This experience could be viewed as a documentation phase where the Egyptian Cabinet IDSC and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) together hove built, implemented and sustained state-of-the-art I/DSS in the process of establishing a powerful Egyptian debt management office. The analysis of these experiences displays many lessons for the implementation of sophisticated systems under conditions of extreme difficulty. It offers insight into a number of problems that concern designers, implementors, users, and researchers in I/DSS use in managing development planning and socio-economic change especially in developing countries. It also delves into important aspects related to project planning and implementation, organizational dynamics and the effective use of accurate, timely and relevant information in development planning. We conclude this thesis with on analytical framework that gives detailed methods and guidelines for future implementation of similar programs in developing countries that might wish to benefit from the experience of the Cabinet of Egypt IDSC...|$|R
