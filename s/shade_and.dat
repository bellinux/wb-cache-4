5|$|As a drought-deciduous {{succulent}} tree, B. rupestris adapts {{readily to}} cultivation and is tolerant {{of a range}} of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets—also known as bottletree scrub—of the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> fodder trees.|$|E

5|$|One {{potentially}} distinguishing {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate segments in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A.pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|Trees provide {{benefits}} such as absorbing carbon dioxide, {{and other}} pollutants. Trees also provide <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> reduce ozone emissions from vehicles. By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees, which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the {{effects of climate change}} and urban heat islands.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb. He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E

5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small black spots that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, <b>shade,</b> <b>and</b> heavier soils.|$|E

5|$|The mockingbird's habitat {{varies by}} location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, {{suburban}} and urban {{areas such as}} parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has an affinity for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> nesting. In western regions, desert scrub, chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass. This bird does not nest in densely forested areas, and generally resides in the same habitats year round.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees. They can provide <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> cooling through evapotranspiration, absorb {{greenhouse}} gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and {{reduce the risk of}} flooding. It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light <b>shade,</b> <b>and</b> will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E

5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less <b>shade,</b> <b>and</b> also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn a Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) field, rows of reflectors {{direct the}} {{incident}} sun rays towards a linear receiver. Some portion of reflector aperture area gets <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> blocked by neighboring reflector-rows. Thus, complete utilization of reflector aperture area is hampered. Continuously changing sun's position in sky demands appropriate tracking of reflectors, {{which leads to}} varying <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> blocked aperture areas over a day. Orientation of the field also plays an important role. Orientation {{is defined by the}} tracking axis of the reflector. For example, North-South (N-S) oriented LFR field is the one having tracking axis of reflector along N-S. In the present work, analytical expressions are used to find out <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> blocked aperture areas. Results for hourly and monthly variation in <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> blocked aperture areas for different orientations of the field, different values of spacing between reflector-rows and height of receiver are plotted and compared...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} sketch {{interpreter}} system with <b>shading</b> <b>and</b> cross section lines for 3 D freeform design. The input strokes are classi¯ed into three types: outlines (contour lines), <b>shading</b> lines <b>and</b> cross section lines. The outline {{is used to}} generate the basic rounded shape. The <b>shading</b> lines <b>and</b> cross section lines are used as control lines that are drawn inside the contour to modify the 3 D shape. In order to e®ectively extract 3 D information from the <b>shading</b> <b>and</b> cross section lines, we analyze di®erent representations and deformations of the <b>shading</b> <b>and</b> cross section lines and classify them into three cases: convex, concave and `upheaving'. Each deformation is drawn by hand and transferred to a 3 D shape {{according to the rules}} proposed in this paper. We evaluate our sketch interpreter system for various objects from concept sketches and present our results...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is <b>shade,</b> <b>and</b> often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Trees play a {{significant}} role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide <b>shade</b> <b>and</b> shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E
40|$|Sophisticated {{computer}} graphics {{were used to}} generate images of three-dimensional blocks-world scenes to investigate the perception of surface attitude. Three types of surface primitive (planar blocks, cylinders, and ellipsoids) were combined to form structured settings. The experiments were designed to investigate whether surface-based information such as gradients in <b>shading</b> <b>and</b> texture provide any significant advantage in attitude judgments over information derived from object contours. Images of <b>shaded,</b> textured, <b>and</b> line-drawn surfaces formed the stimulus set. The subjects' task consisted of setting an attitude probe on {{different parts of the}} scene so that the probe appeared to be locally coplanar with the perceived surfaces. Analysis of settings according to attitude components, slant and tilt, shows remarkable agreement in slant settings for the <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> line-drawn scenes but poor correlation between <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> textured scenes. Similarly, tilt was also easily judged in <b>shaded</b> <b>and</b> line-drawn scenes and the experiments indicate that explicit surface boundaries are important for stable tilt perception. In general, the results suggest that, for the simple surfaces employed here, surface cues provide little extra information beyond that which is derived from contours...|$|R
