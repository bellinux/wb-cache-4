2500|$|A PM motor {{does not}} have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the {{magnetic}} field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the [...] "dynamo" [...] type, which have <b>stator</b> <b>windings.</b> Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{classical}} vector {{control of a}} series-connected two-motor drive supplied by a single inverter is presented. This system consists of a six-phase induction machine and a three-phase induction machine. The <b>stators</b> <b>windings</b> of both machines are connected in series in appropriate manner. The dynamic decoupling of each machine from the group is obtained using the indirect vector control algorithm. Mathematical modelling of the multi-machine system showed the possibility of independent control of each machine in the group. The independent control is demonstrated by analyzing {{the characteristics of the}} torque and speed of each machine obtained via simulation of multi-machine system under indirect vector control scheme. Then, a reduced-order observer is applied to Sensorless control of multi-motor. The simulation results show that the closed-loop system performances are satisfactory using the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objects of}} this {{doctoral}} thesis are {{analysis of a}} small induction motor losses and research of ways how to reduce losses and increase efficiency of this motor.

50|$|Generally, three cooling {{approaches}} are used. For generators up to 300 MW, air cooling can be used. Between 250-450 MW hydrogen cooling is employed.

40|$|The {{generator}} {{consists of}} the <b>stator,</b> two <b>windings</b> on it - <b>stator</b> and the <b>windings</b> of the traction electromagnet, a rotating shaft, a rotor moving magnetic conductor with permanent magnets, able to move on the shaft in the axial direction (within the small range - from 0, 5 mm to 4 - 5 mm), a return damping spring, the electronic regulator of current of the traction electromagnet. With the changing of rotor angular frequency the electronic regulator changes current of a traction electromagnet in accordance with a given law, moving a rotor magnetic conductor along the rotor shaft, changing {{the size of the}} main magnetic air gap of the electric machine. Thus the magnetic flux linkage and, therefore, the rotating torque (resistance torque) on a rotor shaft are changing depending on the angular speed of the rotor. With a small angular frequency of the rotor the main air gap in a magnetic circuit of the electric machine has the maximum value. With the increasing of the angular frequency of rotation the traction electromagnet reduces the main air gap in a magnetic circuit of the generator thus increasing the flux linkage...|$|R

5000|$|The SRM has {{wound field}} coils as in a DC motor for the <b>stator</b> <b>windings.</b> The rotor however has no magnets or coils attached. It {{is a solid}} salient-pole rotor (having {{projecting}} magnetic poles) made of soft magnetic material (often laminated-steel). When power {{is applied to the}} <b>stator</b> <b>windings,</b> the rotor's magnetic reluctance creates a force that attempts to align the rotor pole with the nearest stator pole. In order to maintain rotation, an electronic control system switches on the windings of successive stator poles in sequence so that the magnetic field of the stator [...] "leads" [...] the rotor pole, pulling it forward. Rather than using a troublesome high-maintenance mechanical commutator to switch the winding current as in traditional motors, the switched-reluctance motor uses an electronic position sensor to determine the angle of the rotor shaft and solid state electronics to switch the <b>stator</b> <b>windings,</b> which also offers the opportunity for dynamic control of pulse timing and shaping. This differs from the apparently similar induction motor which also has windings that are energised in a rotating phased sequence, in that the magnetization of the rotor is static (a salient pole that is made 'North' remains so as the motor rotates) while an induction motor has slip, and rotates at slightly less than synchronous speed. This absence of slip makes it possible to know the rotor position exactly, and the motor can be stepped arbitrarily slowly.|$|E
50|$|Alternators used {{in central}} power {{stations}} also control the field current to regulate reactive power {{and to help}} stabilize the power system against the effects of momentary faults.
