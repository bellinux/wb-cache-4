The frequent practice of storing materials in 70 % ethanol after Carnoy fixation is, in our hands, only a desperate resort made necessary by the exigencies of the season or available research time and its use results in a rapid and steady deterioration of the stainability of the cells.

Previous FHE schemes all use the same blueprint from [Gentry 2009]: First construct a somewhat homomorphic encryption (SWHE) scheme, next “squash ” the decryption circuit until it is simple enough to be handled within the homomorphic capacity of the SWHE scheme, and finally “bootstrap ” to get a FHE scheme. In all existing schemes, the <b>squashing</b> <b>technique</b> induces an additional assumption: that the sparse subset sum problem (SSSP) is hard. Our new approach constructs FHE as a hybrid of a SWHE and a multiplicatively homomorphic encryption (MHE) scheme, such as Elgamal.

40|$|The {{repertoire}} of cytological procedures {{described in the}} present paper permits full analysis of brain neuroblast chromosomes. Moreover, if brains are cultured for 13 hr in the presence of 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxy-uridine, our fixation and Hoechst staining protocols allow visualization of sister chromatid differentiation and the scoring of sister chromatid exchanges (Gatti et al., 1979). Finally, we note that our cytological procedures can be successfully employed for preparation and staining of gonial cells of both sexes and male meiotic chromosomes (Ripoll et al., 1985; our unpublished results). Good chromosome preparations of female meiosis are obtained with the procedure described by Davring and Sunner (1977, 1979), Nokkala and Puro (1976), and Puro and Nokkala (1977). In this chapter, we have focused on the organization and behavior of Drosophila mitotic chromosomes, describing a {{repertoire of}} cytological techniques for neuroblast chromosome preparations. We have not considered the numerous excellent cytological procedures for embryonic chromosome preparations (for an example, see Foe and Alberts, 1985; Foe, 1989), because these chromosomes are usually less clearly defined than those of larval neuroblasts. In addition, we have not included the whole-mount and <b>squashing</b> <b>techniques</b> that allow chromosome visualization and spindle immunostaining of neuroblast cells (Axton et al., 1990; Gonzalez et al., 1990), male meiotic cells (Casal et al [...] 1990; Cenci et al., 1994), and female meiotic cells (Theurkauf and Hawley. 1992), because the fixation methods used in these procedures alter chromosome morphology. Fixation methods for antibody staining result in poorly defined chromosomes, whereas the methanol/acetic acid fixation techniques, such as those described here, preserve very well chromosome morphology but remove a substantial fraction of chromosomal proteins. Thus, one of the major technical breakthroughs in Drosophila mitotic cytology will be the development of fixation procedures that maximize chromosomal quality with minimal removal of proteins. This will be particularly useful for precise immunolocalization of heterochromatic proteins, including those associated with the centromere...|$|R

The <b>squash</b> <b>technique</b> was performed for slide preparation. Root tips were smashed and stained with 2 % acetic orcein, and a total of 4000 cells per treatment were analyzed. The phenolic compounds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and data was analyzed using the Scott-Knott test. The results show that S. australis aqueous extracts have antiproliferative potential. Besides, the extracts prepared from S. australis leaves of both accessions at a concentration of 0. 012 g/ml have shown antigenotoxic activity. The phytochemical analysis allowed us to determine the presence of flavonoids and phenolic acids, of which kaempferol and chrologenic acid were the most predominant compounds in the extracts from the inflorescences and leaves, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Glycidol {{is used as}} a {{stabilizer}} in {{the manufacture}} of vinyl polymers and natural oils and as an intermediate in the synthesis of glycerol, glycidyl ethers, and amines. It is also used as an alkylating agent,demulsifier, and dye-leveling agent and for sterilizing milk of magnesia. Glycidol is an alkylating agent which reacts readily with glutathione; it causes a decrease in glutathione content in rat liver, probably reflecting its binding to glutathione. It is a suspected reproductive toxicant and exposure to {{it has the potential to}} negatively affect the human reproductive system. The study investigated the cytotoxic effects of glycidol in Allium cepa L root meristem cells. Different concentrations of glycidol ranging 10, 20, 40 and 50 μg/ml for 1, 2, 3 and 5 h were treated with root meristem cells of Allium cepa L. Fuelgen <b>squash</b> <b>technique</b> was used to determine the aberrations in root tip cells. For each concentration 3000 well-spread cells were scored and cytological abnormalities such as break, gap, exchange, multiple breaks and chromosome fragments were observed. One way analysis of variance was used the study the significant different control and treatment exposed root tip cells. Significant difference between control and glycidol exposed cells were observed. Increasing concentrations increased the number of chromosomal aberrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to assess cyto- and {{genotoxic}} effects of sodium nitrate on Allium cepa root tips by using different concentrations (i. e. 0, 1 %; 1 % and 5 %) for treating uniform healthy onion bulbs for three different periods of time: 6, 24 and 72 hours. In the end of the experiment the harvested root tips were prepared according to Feulgen’s <b>squash</b> <b>technique</b> using Schiff reagent and the investigations were realized according to Allium test. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of nitrate were investigated by calculating the mitotic index and observing all chromosomes’ complement alterations during the mitosis. The phase rate of cells undergoing mitosis is also studied. For microscopy investigations a Novex Holland B microscope with digital camera included was used. The cytogenetic analysis of nitrate effects revealed a strong decrease in the mitotic index which is more intense with the concentration and time of exposure. Moreover, this effect is associated in case of the variant treated with 5 % sodium nitrate acting for more than 24 hours, with the appearance of genotoxic effects such as chromosomal alterations, highly condensed chromatin expression easily identified during mitosis stages, sticky chromosomes and chromosomal bridges and laggards...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the neurosurgical practice, a rapid {{pathological}} {{diagnosis of the}} space occupying lesion {{of the nervous system}} helps the surgeon to plan the extent of surgery and modify it accordingly. When faced with a crucial decision to maximize the clinical benefit while keeping the therapeutic deficits to a minimum, the neurosurgeon often resorts to a stereotactic biopsy as the diagnostic procedure. The neuro-pathologists are thus often required to make the diagnoses on very small biopsy specimens. Cytological preparations in the form of squash smears are of vital importance when frozen sections are not available, tissue available is limited (stereotactic biopsy), evaluation of intercellular matrix (astrocytoma versus oligodendroglioma) and evaluation of dis-cohesive cells (lymphoma, pituitary adenoma) and in inflammatory lesions). Aims: To evaluate the value of Squash cytology for rapid intraoperative diagnosis in CNS lesions and its correlation with final histomorphological diagnosis in our modest experience. Methods: 7 cases of CNS tumours were examined by <b>squash</b> smear <b>technique</b> in cytomorphological analysis followed by histomorphological correlation on paraffin section...|$|R
50|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is very diverse. The {{meals are}} lighter {{than in the}} central and {{southern}} regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed (especially the Safed cheese that originated {{in the mountains of}} the Upper Galilee). Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese.In {{the eastern part of the}} Galilee, freshwater fish as much as meat (especially the tilapia that lives in the Sea of Galilee, Jordan river, and other streams in the region), fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to <b>squash.</b> This <b>technique</b> exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} rapid intraoperative crush smear cytologic diagnosis of central and peripheral nervous system lesions and to determine the accuracy and relevance of {{the accuracy of the}} intraoperative cytologic diagnosis when compared to the final paraffin section diagnosis. Study Design The crush (<b>squash)</b> smear <b>technique</b> was introduced at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences in May 2003. The 8 months of 2003 were used for standardization of the procedure. In 2004, 151 patients with open neurosurgical specimens or stereotactic biopsies were diagnosed intraoperatively by crush smears, and the diagnosis was compared with final diagnosis on paraffin sections of the same tissue samples. No supplementation of frozen sections was used. Results Of 151 cases, 144 were diagnosed accurately intraoperatively by crush smear cytology when compared with the respective paraffin section diagnoses. The diagnostic accuracy attained was 95. 36 %. Each case was diagnosed within 10 minutes after receipt of sample. Neurosurgical procedure (open or stereotaxy) did not affect diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion In the expert hands of a pathologist with good exposure to neurosurgical specimens, crush smear cytology is an accurate and reliable procedure for the intraoperative diagnosis of central nervous system tumors...|$|R
