40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} a {{potential}} future fleet of supersonic aircraft on contrail coverage and contrail radiative forcing is investigated by means of simulations with the general circulation model ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) including a contrail parameterization. The model simulations consider air traffic inventories of a <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> and of a combined fleet of sub- and supersonic aircraft for the years 2025 and 2050, respectively. In case of the combined fleet, part of the <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> is replaced by supersonic aircraft. Supersonic aircraft fly at higher cruise levels (18 to 20 km) than subsonic aircraft (10 to 12 km). The different ambient meteorological conditions in terms of temperature and humidity affect the formation of contrails. At subsonic cruise levels, the combined air traffic scenario reveals a reduction in contrail cover in northern extratropics, especially over the North Atlantic and Pacific. At supersonic flight levels, contrail formation is mainly restricted to tropical regions. The northern extratropical stratosphere is only in winter cold enough {{for the formation of}} contrails. Total contrail coverage is only marginally affected by the shift in flight altitude. The model simulations indicate a global annual mean contrail cover of 0. 372 % for the subsonic and 0. 366 % for the combined fleet in 2050, respectively. The simulated contrail radiative forcing is most closely correlated to the total contrail cover, although contrails in the tropical lower stratosphere are found to be optically thinner than contrails in the extratropical upper troposphere. The global annual mean contrail radiative forcing in 2050 (2025) amounts to 24. 7 mW m ? 2 (9. 4 mW m ? 2) for the <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> and 24. 2 mW m ? 2 (9. 3 mW m ? 2) for the combined fleet. A reduced supersonic cruise speed (Mach 1. 6 instead of Mach 2. 0) leads to a downward shift in contrail cover, but does not affect global mean total contrail cover and contrail radiative forcing. Hence the partial substitution of subsonic air traffic leads to a shift of contrail occurrence from mid to low latitudes, but the resulting change in contrail-induced climate impact is almost negligible...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a three-dimensional database of aircraft fuel burn and emissions (fuel burned, NOx, CO, and hydrocarbons) from projected fleets of high speed civil transports (HSCT's) on a universal airline network. Inventories for 500 and 1000 HSCT fleets, as well as the concurrent <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleets,</b> were calculated. The objective of this work was to evaluate the changes in geographical distribution of the HSCT emissions as the fleet size grew from 500 to 1000 HSCT's. For this work, a new expanded HSCT network was used and flights projected using a market penetration analysis rather than assuming equal penetration as was done in the earlier studies. Emission inventories on this network were calculated for both Mach 2. 0 and Mach 2. 4 HSCT fleets with NOx cruise emission indices of approximately 5 and 15 grams NOx/kg fuel. These emissions inventories are available for use by atmospheric scientists conducting the Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft (AESA) modeling studies. Fuel burned and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx as NO 2), carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons have been calculated on a 1 degree latitude x 1 degree longitude x 1 kilometer attitude grid and delivered to NASA as electronic files...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{turbine engine}} NOX, CO 2 and H 20 exhaust {{emissions}} from civil <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleets</b> are potentially in sufficient amounts to affect atmospheric ozone and climate, {{particularly with the}} projected growth in air traffic. Because, {{it may be that}} the future envisaged low-NOX combustor technologies may not keep up with the industry requirements for increased engine thermal efficiency, the potential benefits from optimising aero engine cycles and flight operations for low mission emissions deserve to be thoroughly investigated. The SKY computer simulation system developed to examine such alternative routes integrates flight route performance, aero engine performance and the formation of pollutants within the combustor. Based on Turbomatch, Cranfield Gas Turbine Simulation System, SKY can be used to optimise mission/aircraft/engine/combustor combinations with respect to landing and take-off (LTO) as well as mission emissions. A model of the high capacity Boeing 747 - 400 powered by Turbomatch high bypass ratio turbofan models and simulated on long range routes such as London-Tokyo is selected for this work. On the one hand, aero engine cycles can be designed at a optimum bypass ratio and deliver mission NOX reductions of up to 10 % over designs optimised for LTO NOX, indicating that the current ICAO regulatory regime is a inadequate parameter to control mission NOX. On the other hand, operational measures such as speed reductions could bring further reductions of the order of 10 %, but some of the improvement would be made at the expense of fuel burn, CO 2 and H 20 emissions, payload-range capability and direct operating costs. The benefits from such alternative routes are not negligible but smaller in comparison to the 30 to 80 % potential cuts from future low-NOX technology, as well as to the 30 % reduction due to expected improvements in the next 20 years or so in airframe weight and aerodynamics and more efficient navigation practices...|$|R

In the case of photochemical models used to evaluate changes in O 3 or OH, inputs analyzed include rate coefficients measured in the laboratory, and chemical and physical constituents measured in the atmosphere. The Monte Carlo method was used with the 1 -dimensional GSFC tropospheric photochemical model to examine uncertainty propagation to calculation of NO(x) and the major oxidants (O 3, OH) in the upper troposphere. In all cases chemical kinetics inputs are varied and the NO(x) perturbation of a <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> is simulated.

40|$|As {{an aid to}} {{discussions on}} the future {{provision}} of meteorological forecasting services for civil transport operations, an approximate assessment is made {{of the effects of}} changes in the accuracy with which en-route and take-off winds and temperatures can be forecast. The results are given in terms of the annual value calculated over the world total of long-range civil operations, first for a current <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> equivalent to about 350 Boeing 707 's and then for a possible suporsonio fleet equivalent to about 4. 00 Concords, such as might be in operation in 1980 - 1985. It is found that in current long-range subsonic operations the accurate forecasting of en-route winds is the most important item. In future supersonic operations, however, the most important item {{is likely to be the}} accurate fore-casting of en-route temperature, wind being of comparatively minor importanoe. Accuracy in foreoastlng the airfield temperature for take-off is also likely to be important for supersonic transports...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{are likely to}} impose some restrictions on {{the next generation of}} supersonic commercial transport. There is a global concern over the effects of engine emissions on the ozone layer which protects life on Earth from ultraviolet radiation. There is also some concern over community noise. The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) must meet at least the current subsonic noise certification standards to be compatible with the future <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet.</b> Concerns over sonic boom represent another environmental and marketing challenge to the HSCT program. The most attractive feature of the supersonic transport is speed, which offers the traveling public significant time-savings on long range routes. The sonic boom issue represents a major environmental and economic challenge as well. Supersonic operation overland produces the most desirable economic results. However, unacceptable overland sonic boom raise levels may force HSCT to use subsonic speeds overland. These environmental and economic challenges are likely to impose some restrictions on supersonic operation, thus introducing major changes to existing route structures and future supersonic network composition. The current subsonic route structure may have to be altered for supersonic transports to avoid sensitive areas in the stratosphere or to minimize overland flight tracks. It is important to examine the alternative route structure and the impact of these restrictions on the economic viability of the overall supersonic operation. Future market potential for HSCT fleets must be large enough to enable engine and airframe manufacturers to build the plane at a cost that provides them with an attractive return on investment and to sell it at a price that allows the airlines to operate with a reasonable margin of profit. Subsonic overland operation of a supersonic aircraft hinders its economic viability. Ways to increase the market potential of supersonic operation are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} NO(x) (NO + NO 2) from {{aircraft}} engine exhaust on ozone and climate is of increasing concern {{as a result}} of anticipated growth in the world's <b>subsonic</b> aircraft <b>fleet</b> and new international efforts to build a supersonic transport (SST). Knowledge of NO(x) emissions currently relies on limited ground based testing of combustors and engines and on scaling relations to extrapolate emission values to upper atmosphere conditions. Direct observations made in the engine exhaust plume of the NASA ER- 2 high altitude aircraft cruising at subsonic speeds in the lower midlatitude stratosphere are presented. Results demonstrate the technical feasibility of detecting aircraft plumes within minutes after emission with sufficient completeness and precision to calculate emission indices for reactive nitrogen and other species. Furthermore, the combined results increase confidence in using ground based observations to assess the atmospheric impact of some aircraft emissions...|$|R

40|$|By entraining large {{quantities}} of ambient air into advanced ejector nozzles, the jet noise of the proposed High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) {{is expected to be}} reduced to levels acceptable for airport-vicinity noise certification. Away from the airport, however, this entrained air is shut off and the engines are powered up from their cutback levels to provide better thrust for the climb to cruise altitude. Unsuppressed jet noise levels propagating to the ground far from the airport are expected to be high. Complicating this problem is the HSCT's relative noise level with respect to the <b>subsonic</b> commercial <b>fleet</b> of 2010, which is expected to be much quieter than it is today after the retirement of older, louder, domestic stage II aircraft by the year 2000. In this study, the classic energy state approximation theory is extended to calculate trajectories that minimize the climb to cruise noise of the HSCT. The optimizer dynamically chooses the optimal altitude velocity trajectory, the engine power setting, and whether the ejector should be stowed or deployed with respect to practical aircraft climb constraints and noise limits...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} on air travel {{throughout}} the world has prompted several proposals {{for the development of}} commercial aircraft capable of transporting a large number of passengers at supersonic speeds. Emissions from a projected fleet of such aircraft, referred to as high-speed civil transports (HSCT's), are being studied because of their possible effects on the chemistry and physics of the global atmosphere, in particular, on stratospheric ozone. At the same time, there is growing concern about the effects on ozone from the emissions of current (primarily subsonic) aircraft emissions. Evaluating the potential atmospheric impact of aircraft emissions from HSCT's requires a scientifically sound understanding of where the aircraft fly and under what conditions the aircraft effluents are injected into the atmosphere. A preliminary set of emissions scenarios are presented. These scenarios will be used to understand the sensitivity of environment effects to a range of fleet operations, flight conditions, and aircraft specifications. The baseline specifications for the scenarios are provided: the criteria to be used for developing the scenarios are defined, the required data base for initiating the development of the scenarios is established, and {{the state of the art}} for those scenarios that have already been developed is discussed. An important aspect of the assessment will be the evaluation of realistic projections of emissions as a function of both geographical distribution and altitude from an economically viable commercial HSCT fleet. With an assumed introduction date of around the year 2005, it is anticipated that there will be no HSCT aircraft in the global fleet at that time. However, projections show that, by 2015, the HSCT fleet could reach significant size. We assume these projections of HSCT and subsonic fleets for about 2015 can the be used as input to global atmospheric chemistry models to evaluate the impact of the HSCT fleets, relative to an all-subsonic future fleet. The methodology, procedures, and recommendations for the development of future HSCT and the <b>subsonic</b> <b>fleet</b> scenarios used for this evaluation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Emissions of {{atmospheric}} species from the engines of subsonic aircraft at cruise altitude (roughly, above seven kilometers) are {{of concern to}} scientists, the aviation industry and policymakers for two reasons. First, water vapor, soot and sulfur oxides, and related heterogeneous processes, may modify clouds and aerosols enough to perturb radiative forcing in the UT/LS (upper troposphere/lower stratosphere). A discussion of these phenomena appears in Chapter 3 of the IPCC Aviation Assessment (1999). An airborne campaign conducted to evaluate aviation effects on contrail, cirrus and cloud formation, is described in Geophysical Research Letters. The second concern arises from subsonic aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO + NO 2 = NO(sub x)), CO, and hydrocarbons. These species may add to the background mixture of photochemically reactive species that form ozone. In the UT/LS, ozone is a highly effective greenhouse gas. The impacts of subsonic aircraft emissions on tropospheric NO(sub x) and ozone budgets have been studied with models that focus on UT chemistry [e. g. see discussions of individual models in Brasseur et al., 1998; Friedl et al., 1997; IPCC, 1999]. Depending on the model used, projected increases in the global <b>subsonic</b> aircraft <b>fleet</b> from 1992 to 2015 {{will lead to a}} 50 - 100 pptv increase in UT/LS NO. at 12 km (compared to 50 - 150 pptv background) in northern hemisphere midlatitudes. The corresponding 12 -km ozone increase is 7 - 11 ppbv, or 5 - 10 % (Chapter 4 in IPCC, 1999). Two major sources of uncertainties in model estimates of aviation effects are: (1) the often limited degree to which global models - the scale required to evaluate aircraft emissions - realistically simulate atmospheric transport and other physical processes; (2) limited UT/LS observations of trace gases with which to evaluate model performance. In response to the latter deficiency, a number of airborne campaigns aimed at elucidating the effect of aircraft on atmospheric nitrogen oxides and ozone were performed between 1990 and 1996 (see descriptions in Friedl et al., 1997; Brasseur et al., 1998) ...|$|R
