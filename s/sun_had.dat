5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In {{the form of the}} Sun disc Aten, the <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend. Richard Muller, {{a professor of}} physics at Berkeley, was part of a team that {{suggested that}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity, with this hypothetical companion being dubbed Nemesis. Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E

5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the <b>Sun,</b> <b>had</b> been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|On the island, Sun becomes {{increasingly}} {{worried about the}} intentions of Kahana crew. Despite Juliet Burke's (Elizabeth Mitchell) warning to Sun that women who conceive on the island die during their second trimester, Sun arranges to defect with Jin to the rival faction led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who {{does not want to}} leave the island. Juliet tries to stop Sun from leaving by telling Jin that <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> an affair, causing him to angrily back out of the journey at the last minute. After having a heartfelt conversation while fishing with Bernard Nadler, the only other married man on the island, he forgives Sun, who assures him that the baby is his.|$|E

5|$|Sunday was a rest day, so {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and the <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited the <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> been suggested many times, {{it was not until the}} 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{the lion}} and sun symbol in a flag is first attested in a {{miniature}} painting illustrating a copy of Shahnameh Shams al-Din Kashani, an epic on Mongol conquest, dated 1423. The painting depicts several (Mongul?) horsemen approaching the walled city of Nishapur. One of the horsemen carries a banner that bears a lion passant with a rising sun on its back. The pole is tipped with a crescent moon. By {{the time of the}} Safavids (1501–1722), and the subsequent unification of Iran as a single state, the lion and <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> become a familiar sign, appearing on copper coins, on banners, and on works of art. The Lion and Sun motif was also used on banners of the Mughals of India, notably those of Shah Jahan.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River. Robert Johnson, {{governor}} of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the Cape Fear River was in North Carolina's jurisdiction. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Cape Fear River on 26September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. The <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> set by the time the rising tide lifted the Henry off the river bottom.|$|E
5|$|Kidnappers violently {{take the}} Secret Service chief M {{from his house}} and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> been sent to {{sabotage}} a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise {{that not only is}} a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E

5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in Tintin magazine from 16 September 1948, {{before beginning}} its serialisation in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from 28 October 1948. Rather than continuing {{at the point where}} he had previously left off, Hergé started the story from scratch. He nevertheless made revisions to {{the early part of the}} story, namely by reworking the characters of Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus, as well as the location of Marlinspike Hall, into the narrative, all of which were elements that had been introduced to the Adventures of Tintin during the intervening eight years. Hergé was contractually obliged to produce two pages of comic for each issue, and in the previous adventure, Prisoners of the <b>Sun,</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled this by producing two pages of new Tintin stories each week. Seeking to limit his workload, he would only produce one page of Land of Black Gold per issue, with the other page being filled by a re-serialisation of old stories from his Jo, Zette and Jocko series.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{played in}} all five Tests, {{and in the}} First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, he scored his first Test century. He {{compiled}} 101 in 150 minutes, helping Australia {{to a total of}} 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring. Hassett’s men {{went on to win the}} match by an innings. The Second Test was an eight-wicket victory for the Australians, this time dominated by Harvey's 178, with whom Loxton shared a 140-run stand for the fifth wicket, contributing 35 himself. He also took a wicket. The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic; batting first, South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7/23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket. During the first innings, Hassett changed his batting order so that his better batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised. Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9, but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably. Not enforcing the follow-on, the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99, losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs. This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory, highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had fallen for only 245. The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey. On Loxton’s first ball, a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge. He survived to lunch after being caught from a no ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive. With an unbeaten 151, Harvey took Australia to an improbable five-wicket victory, supported by his fellow Victorian, who scored 54 in a century partnership.|$|E
