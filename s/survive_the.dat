50|$|Omnivores, {{insectivores}} and carrion-eaters <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> extinction event, due to {{the increased}} availability of their food sources. There were no herbivorous or carnivorous mammals {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous. Mammals and birds that <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> extinction fed on insects, worms, and snails, which then fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus and non-living organic material.|$|R

5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland <b>survive.</b> <b>The</b> main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists <b>survive.</b> <b>The</b> earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E

50|$|Omnivores, {{insectivores}} and carrion-eaters <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> extinction event, {{perhaps because}} of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals. Mammals and birds which <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> extinction fed on insects, larvae, worms and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists theorise that these organisms <b>survived</b> <b>the</b> collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus.|$|R
