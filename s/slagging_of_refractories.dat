40|$|Zirconia {{is usually}} {{utilised}} in Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN) in the slag contact zone, {{because of its}} high resistance to corrosion. However inconsistency of component performance and apparently erratic behaviours, in terms of corrosion rate, are frequently experienced. An important cause of the unexplained variability of component performance is the typical trial-and-error approach used to develop materials for the specific appli-cations, and the “Darwinian selection ” for {{the choice of the}} most suitable material despite the fact that a num-ber of studies are available in literature. As a matter of fact, although almost all the mechanisms that have been proposed are based on some form of cyclic mechanism where the oxide is attacked by the slag and the exposed graphite is then attacked by the metal, contradictory conclusions can be often found about specific features. It is not to be excluded that contradictory results could be dependant on the experimental conditions used. In this paper laboratory experiments have been carried out, using together slag and steel, in order to clarify their role on the global corrosion mechanism. The results showed that, besides the dissolution of carbon in steel and oxide in slag, other phenomena contribute to the corrosion. In particular the experiments put in evidence the critical role of steel in dissolving the products <b>of</b> reactions between <b>slag</b> components and carbon, pushing the attack <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> to carbon. The consequence is that the corrosion phenomenon is complex, and parameters such as activity <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> components, porosity <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> matrix, characteristics <b>of</b> carbon material are invol-ved in the tendency of the carbon to react with slag, hence on the global corrosion rate...|$|R
40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition <b>of</b> the <b>slag</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>refractory.</b> The flow <b>of</b> material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between <b>slags</b> <b>of</b> different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence <b>of</b> a <b>slag</b> having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a rotating furnace at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face <b>of</b> the <b>refractory.</b> These reactions are dependent on the composition <b>of</b> the <b>refractory</b> and <b>of</b> the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica <b>of</b> both the <b>refractory</b> and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix <b>of</b> the <b>refractory.</b> The postulation <b>of</b> the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency <b>of</b> the <b>refractory</b> to reach equilibrium with the composition <b>of</b> the <b>slag.</b> The silicates present in acid slags are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the bonding silicates <b>of</b> magnesite <b>refractories</b> which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the bonding silicates <b>of</b> chromite- containing <b>refractories</b> having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in basic slags are in equilibrium with magnesia <b>of</b> the <b>refractories</b> as well as with the bonding silicates <b>of</b> magnesite <b>refractories</b> having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by basic slags and the bonding silicates <b>of</b> chromite- containing <b>refractories.</b> Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with chrome-magnesite bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing <b>refractories,</b> however, neither <b>of</b> the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition <b>of</b> the <b>slag.</b> Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals <b>of</b> the <b>refractory.</b> The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less basic <b>slags,</b> because <b>of</b> the textural superiority <b>of</b> chromite-containing <b>refractories</b> over magnesite refractories. In contact with basic slags, however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by basic processes, ultrabasic slags are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{was to investigate the}} potential for chemical wear <b>of</b> carbon-based <b>refractory</b> materials in a silicomanganese furnace tap-hole. In the study, three research questions were addressed: 1. Is chemical reaction between refractory and slag or refractory and metal a potential wear mechanism? 2. Is the choice in carbon-based refractory material important from a tap-hole refractory life perspective? 3. What are the implications {{for the life of the}} tap-hole in a SiMn furnace? To study the potential for chemical wear, thermodynamic calculations were conducted to determine the potential for the formation of SiC and SiMn at 1600 °C through reduction of SiO 2 and MnO and dissolution of C (and subsequent reaction with Si) in metal. The thermodynamic calculations were based on published [1] metal and slag composition and carbon. Cup test experiments based on synthetic slag and graphite proved SiC formation conclusively, but not SiMn formation. To study the effect of the choice in carbon-based refractory material, two types <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> materials – carbon block and ramming paste – available commercially and industrial slag were sourced, prepared and characterised. Wettability studies proved the formation of SiC at 1588 °C with slag being wetting towards refractory in an argon atmosphere and non-wetting in a CO-atmosphere. Under wetting conditions, the wetting angle <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> on carbon block was slightly higher (50 °) at holding temperature compared to that of ramming paste (30 °). Under non-wetting conditions the angles were 160 ° and 150 ° respectively. Cup test experiments based on industrial slag and carbon-based refractory material proved both SiC and SiMn formation at 1600 °C conclusively and confirmed the wetting behaviour <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> towards <b>refractory</b> at larger scale. To study the implications for the life of the tap-hole in a SiMn furnace, the tap-hole of a 48 MVA SiMn furnace was excavated and profiled. The wear predicted by thermodynamic modelling was supported by mass flow calculations. It was concluded that chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory materials and slag and metal is one of the mechanisms responsible for wear in the tap-hole of a silicomanganese furnace.

It is desirable to further water-cool the HIsmelt vessel to reduce downtime for replacing refractory. Water-cooled elements close to a metal bath run the risk of failure.

40|$|Employed {{either in}} metal holding ladles/ tundishes, stopper rods, or metal {{delivery}} shrouds/ nozzles; the service life <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> bodies {{plays an important}} role in the commercial feasibility of continuous casting of steel. A suitable selection <b>of</b> oxide–graphite <b>refractory</b> material for a specific application is usually based on the fundamental understanding of its high temperature corrosion behaviour. Slag attack is particularly important. The structural strength <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> may be critically reduced by the solvent action <b>of</b> liquid <b>slags.</b> Typically, in the conventional method of the continuous casting of liquid steel whether refining slags in the metal holding ladle, or casting powder in mould – they are almost always composed of high basic oxide constituent (CaO) concentration. Therefore, corrosion studies having CaO as one of the constituent oxides, has been the subject of many research work. However, with the advent of modern near–net–shape continuous casting of steel not only thin walled refractory bodies are being employed but role and composition <b>of</b> meniscus <b>slags</b> has also changed making the control of corrosion a big challenge. The lack of available information on the corrosive action <b>of</b> the menisci <b>slags</b> <b>of</b> the modern continuous casting of steel, which are usually composed of high MnO and SiO 2 contents (having no or very little concentration of CaO), on the refractory bodies needs to be thoroughly studied. In general, uncertainties also exist regarding the fraction of graphite content in the refractory mix because an increase of the graphite content <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> does not always minimize corrosion process. An experimental study, using static corrosion test, was conducted at the usual steel casting temperature (1550 C) to develop a fundamental understanding by comparing the transient progresses of corrosion reactions of several commonly available oxide–graphite refractory in their interaction with menisci slags that are generated during the near–net–shape casting of liquid steel. Factors such as the presence of solid fractions and the low wetting characteristic <b>of</b> molten <b>slag</b> phase seems to promote the entrapment of gas bubbles at the vi interface, which was found to favourably impact the corrosion resistance property <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> by minimizing its contact with the corrosive slag phase. MgO–graphite refractories showed higher resistance to the corrosive actions of both the menisci slags due to the formation of two inhibitive layers: a thin layer of dense MgO and Olivine phase.

The morphology of the deteriorated layer showed the corrosion extent <b>of</b> <b>refractories.</b> With {{the addition of}} zirconia and titania into the refractories, the corrosion rate changed to some extent. The corrosion rate of three sorts <b>of</b> <b>refractories</b> increased dramatically with the increasing FeO content in smelting reduction slag. Compared with alumina-graphite refractory and alumina-graphite-zirconia refractory, alumina-graphite-titania refractory had stronger corrosion resistance in the smelting reduction conditions.

However, slag hydrates slower which delay strength gain in UHPC which can be addressed by using <b>slag</b> <b>of</b> high fineness. In this study, cement is replaced by slag at 20 % and 60 % by weight. <b>Slag</b> <b>of</b> three different fineness is used: 400 ± 4 m 2 /kg, 556 ± 5 m 2 /kg and 750 ± 5 m 2 /kg at constant water-binder ratio of 0. 25 for all mixes. Compressive and flexural strength were measured for mechanical performance while water penetration test and chloride migration test were conducted to enumerate durability. Results show that early and late compressive strength and flexural strength are improved significantly by incorporation <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> with fineness 556 ± 5 m 2 /kg compared to reference and <b>slag</b> <b>of</b> 400 m 2 /kg fineness. However, at similar fineness 20 % slag incorporation is found to produce higher early strength compared to 60 % slag although 90 day strength for both replacement percentages are similar. On durability aspects {{it is found that}} <b>slag</b> with fineness <b>of</b> 556 m 2 /kg and 750 m 2 /kg demonstrates significantly lower penetration depth and very high resistance to chloride migration at 28 day and 90 day age irrespective <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> replacement percentage. The study suggests that <b>slag</b> <b>of</b> high fineness (about 556 m 2 /kg based on the study) and 20 - 60 % cement replacement can significantly accelerate hydration and improve long term durability of UHPC mortar...|$|R
40|$|Ways of {{increasing}} productivity have been always a challenging issue for pyrometallurgical processes. Increasing the throughput of the reactor through higher temperature and vigorous agitation in bath are possible options for enhancing the kinetics of reactions in the multiphase system processes. On the other hand, these measures {{also lead to}} rapid degradation <b>of</b> the <b>refractory</b> and premature shutdown of the reactor for relining, imposing additional costs on processes {{in the form of}} planned and unplanned maintenance. An alternative solution to this problem is the formation <b>of</b> a <b>slag</b> freeze lining rather than direct contact <b>of</b> <b>refractory</b> layers with the hot bath. Slag freeze-linings are increasingly used in industrial pyrometallurgical processes to ensure furnace integrity is maintained in aggressive high temperature environments. Most previous studies of freeze-linings have analysed the formation <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> deposits based solely on heat transfer models. The focus of the present research is to determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>slag</b> chemistry and local process conditions on the microstructures, thickness, stability and heat transfer characteristics of the frozen deposit...|$|R
