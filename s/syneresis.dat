5000|$|<b>Syneresis</b> cracks (also {{known as}} subaqueous {{shrinkage}} cracks) are a [...] sedimentary structure {{developed by the}} shrinkage of sediment without desiccation - {{not to be confused}} with desiccation cracks. [...] <b>Syneresis</b> is the expulsion of a liquid from a gel-like substance. <b>Syneresis</b> cracks are formed by the contraction of clay in response to changes in the salinity of a liquid surrounding a deposit. The cracks can occur, for example, in mudstones deposoited between two beds of sandstone. The markings would have been formed [...] subaqueously on the bedding surface and could resemble desiccation mudcracks, but are not continuous and vary in shape. They commonly occur in thin mudstones interbedded with sandstones, as positive relief on the bottom of the sandstone, or as negative relief on the top of the mudstone. [...] Subaqueous shrinkage cracks can develop on and through a surface that has been continuously covered in water. <b>Syneresis</b> cracks in some shales and lime mudstones may initially be preserved as small cavities, which then usually fill with silt and sand from either the overlying or underlying beds and laminae.Usually there is no pattern to the cracks, and they do not connect to form geometric shapes.

50|$|The {{nature and}} {{composition}} of the vitreous humour changes {{over the course of}} life. At birth, the fluid is homogenous and finely striated (except Cloquet's canal). In adolescence, the vitreous cortex becomes more dense and vitreous tracts develop; and in adulthood, the tracts become better defined and sinuous. Central vitreous liquefies, fibrillar degeneration occurs, and the tracts break up (<b>syneresis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Mudcracks {{form when}} mud is dewatered, shrinks, and leaves a crack. This {{tells you that}} the mud was {{saturated}} with water and then exposed to air.

50|$|In dentistry, <b>syneresis</b> is the {{expulsion}} of water or other liquid molecules from dental impression materials (Alginate for example) after an impression has been taken.

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of cultured cream {{begins with}} the standardization of fat content, this step {{is to ensure that}} the desired or legal amount of milk fat is present in the food system. As previously mentioned the minimum amount of milk fat that must be present in sour cream is 18%. During this step in the manufacturing process other dry ingredients are added with the cream, additional grade A whey for example would be added at this time. Another type of dry product that is added during this processing step are a series of ingredients known as stabilizers. The common stabilizers that are added to sour cream are polysaccharides and gelatin. Recall the ingredients in sour cream include the following components that act as stabilizers; modified food starch, guar gum, and carrageenans. The reasoning behind the addition of stabilizers to fermented dairy products (sour cream, yoghurt, etc.) is provide smoothness in the body and texture of the product. The stabilizers also assist in the gel structure of the product and reduce whey <b>syneresis.</b> The formation of these gels structures, leaves less free water for whey <b>syneresis,</b> therefore extending the shelf life. Whey <b>syneresis</b> is the loss of moisture by the expulsion of whey. This expulsion of whey can occur during the transportation of containers holding the sour cream, due to the susceptibility to motion and agitation. The next step in the manufacturing process is the acidification of the cream. Organic acids such as citric acid or sodium citrate are added to the cream prior to homogenization in order to increase the metabolic activity of the starter culture. To prepare the mixture for homogenization, it is heated {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|Synchysis {{scintillans}} is a degenerative {{condition of}} the eye resulting in liquefied vitreous humor and the accumulation of cholesterol crystals within the vitreous. It {{is also known as}} cholesterolosis bulbi. The vitreous liquifies in a process known as <b>syneresis.</b> Synchysis scintillans appears as small white floaters that freely move in the posterior part of the eye, giving a snow globe effect. It is most commonly seen in eyes that have suffered from a degenerative disease and are end-stage.|$|E
5000|$|In baked goods, it {{increases}} dough yield, gives greater resiliency, and improves texture and shelf life; in pastry fillings, it prevents [...] "weeping" [...] (<b>syneresis)</b> {{of the water}} in the filling, keeping the pastry crust crisp. It is primarily used in hypoallergenic recipes that use different types of whole-grain flours. Because the consistency of these flours allows the escape of gas released by leavening, guar gum is needed to improve the thickness of these flours, allowing them to rise as a normal flour would.|$|E
5000|$|Over time, it {{is common}} for the {{vitreous}} within the human eye to liquify and collapse in processes known as <b>syneresis</b> and synchisis respectively. This creates fluid-filled areas that can combine to form pockets of vitreous gel that are mostly liquid with very small concentrations of collagen. If these liquid pockets are close enough to the interface between the vitreous gel and the retina, they can cause complete separation of the vitreous from the retina in a normally occurring process in older humans called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD in of itself is not dangerous and a natural process.|$|E
50|$|Starch becomes soluble {{in water}} when heated. The {{granules}} swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's viscosity. This process is called starch gelatinization. During cooking, the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity. During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste, the semi-crystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens, expelling water. This is mainly caused by retrogradation of the amylose. This process {{is responsible for the}} hardening of bread or staling, and for the water layer on top of a starch gel (<b>syneresis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Among {{possible}} examples, {{low scale}} {{observations of the}} structure done using reflectivity by the films between bubbles, of radiation, ponctual using laser or X rays beams, or more global using neutron scattering.A typical light scattering (or diffusion) optical technique, multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning, is {{the most widely used}} technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilization phenomena. It works on any concentrated dispersions without dilution, including foams. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the bubbles. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (drainage, <b>syneresis)</b> and global changes in size (ripening, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
50|$|Amylose {{is also an}} {{important}} thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, and gelling agent in both industrial and food-based contexts. Loose helical amylose chains have a hydrophobic interior that can bind to hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and aromatic compounds. The one problem with this is that, when it crystallizes or associates, it can lose some stability, often releasing water in the process (<b>syneresis).</b> When amylose concentration is increased, gel stickiness decreases but gel firmness increases. When other things including amylopectin bind to amylose, the viscosity can be affected, but incorporating κ-carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, or low-molecular-weight sugars can reduce the loss in stability. The ability to bind water can add substance to food, possibly serving as a fat replacement. For example, amylose is responsible for causing white sauce to thicken, but, upon cooling, some separation between the solid and the water will occur.|$|E

50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. <b>Syneresis</b> occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of silica is performed by mixing an inorganic, silicate-based precursor and an acid. Monomeric silicic acid forms and polymerizes to amorphous silica particles. Both further polymerization and agglomeration of the particles {{lead to a}} gel network. Since polymerization continues after gelation, the gel network consolidates. This rather slow process is known as “natural syneresis” and strongly influences the product properties (e. g., agglomerate size, porosity or internal surface). “Enforced syneresis” is the superposition of natural <b>syneresis</b> with a mechanical, external force. Enforced <b>syneresis</b> may be used either for analytical or preparative purposes. Hereby, two open key aspects are of particular interest. On the one hand, the question arises whether natural and enforced <b>syneresis</b> are analogous processes {{with respect to their}} dependence on the process parameters: pH, temperature and sample size. On the other hand, a method is desirable that allows for correlating natural and enforced <b>syneresis</b> behavior. We can show that the pH-, temperature- and sample size-dependency of natural and enforced <b>syneresis</b> are indeed analogous.

40|$|<b>Syneresis</b> is {{the process}} of whey {{separation}} induced by gel contraction resulting in rearranging or restructuring of casein matrix formed during enzymatic coagulation. Numerous factors can influence the process of <b>syneresis.</b> The influences of pH, calcium concentration, temperature of coagulation of milk and applied heat treatment on the <b>syneresis</b> induced by different intensity of centrifugal force have been investigated. Coagulated samples were centrifuged at 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm for 5 min, respectively. Reconstituted skim milk powder (control sample) and reconstituted non-fat milk heat treated at 87 ºC/ 10 min (experimental sample) are coagulated at temperatures of 30 ºC and 35 ºC, at pH value of 5. 8 and 6. 2, and with the addition of 100, 200 and 400 mg/l of CaCl 2, respectively. Centrifugation at 1000 rpm of both control and experimental samples didn’t recover any sera, regardless of the applied coagulation conditions.
