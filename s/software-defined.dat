He reported to then Juniper CEO Kevin Johnson, who (along with other Juniper staff) is also a former Microsoft executive. Muglia was hired to consolidate Juniper's software groups under a new division called Software Solutions. He also helped develop Juniper's <b>software-defined</b> networking (SDN) strategy.|$|E
5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core routers, {{which are used}} by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new <b>software-defined</b> networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF <b>software-defined</b> radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

The Electra communications package is a UHF <b>software-defined</b> radio (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large (...) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X-band frequencies at 8GHz, and it demonstrates the use of the [...] at 32GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band amplifiers (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs).|$|E
2500|$|As the {{smartphone}} industry boomed in 2007, Microsoft {{had struggled}} {{to keep up with}} its rivals Apple and Google in providing a modern smartphone operating system. As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry that had them working more closely with smartphone manufacturers, such as Nokia, and providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It used a new user interface design language, codenamed [...] "Metro", which prominently used simple shapes, typography and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft is {{a founding member of the}} Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a new cloud computing initiative called <b>Software-Defined</b> Networking. The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers and other networking areas.|$|E
2500|$|Communications: Curiosity is {{equipped}} with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite <b>software-defined</b> radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. [...] The X-band system has one radio, with a 15W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9W transmit power), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2Mbit/s and 256kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only {{able to communicate with}} Curiosity for about 8 minutes per day. [...] The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by Curiosity (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the communication infrastructure as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.|$|E
50|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>software-defined</b> in general, and <b>software-defined</b> data centers in particular, {{have been dismissed}} by some as “nonsense,” “marketecture,” and “software-defined hype.” Some critics believe that {{only a minority of}} companies with “completely homogeneous IT systems’” already in place, such as Yahoo! and Google, can transition to <b>software-defined</b> data centers.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{an analyst}} {{projected}} {{that at least}} some <b>software-defined</b> data center components would experience market growth.
