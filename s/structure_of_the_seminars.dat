40|$|Toward Authentic Assessment AND Instruction: A Framework for Educators is a {{handbook}} {{for teachers}} interested in developing more meaningful {{teaching and learning}} experiences in their classrooms. It was developed {{as part of a}} project entitled Authentic Pedagogy in the Social Studies (APSS), a collaborative effort between three Minnesota school districts (La-Crescent- Hokah, Minneapolis, and West St. Paul-Mendota Heights-Eagan Public School Districts) and the College of Education and Human Development at the University of Minnesota. The APSS Project, funded by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning, brought middle and high school social studies teachers from each of three districts together for monthly seminars during the 1998 - 99 academic year. The day- long seminars focused on how the principles of authentic pedagogy could be translated into classroom practice. Specifically, the goals were that teachers be able to: 1. Translate the theoretical framework that links the Minnesota High Standards, authentic assessment tasks, and authentic instruction into practice; 2. Create meaningful assessments and corresponding rubrics that address the Minnesota High Standards; and 3. Evaluate Minnesota High Standards performance packages and teacher-designed assessment tasks, student work, and one's own teaching in terms of authenticity. This guide describes the content and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seminars,</b> so that others may learn from our experiences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{research}} question I pose {{in this thesis}} is the following: which effect do the Nansen dialogue seminars have on interpersonal reconciliation, {{and what is the}} possible effect on reconciliation of the postconflict society in former Yugoslavia? The Balkan Dialogue Project is an initiative of the Nansen Academy in Lillehammer, Norway, and is intended to contribute to interethnic reconciliation and peacebuilding in former Yugoslavia. Are the dialogue seminars of the Balkan Dialogue Project a strategy for reconciliation? To see this clearly, I utilize theories from the field of social psychology, and investigate whether the structure of the dialogue seminars of the Balkan Dialogue Project is consistent with the specified conditions of the contact hypothesis, and whether the seminars contribute to changes in seminar members intergroup attitudes by processes of Decategorization and Recategorization. I find that the experimental findings of contact as a method of reducing intergroup prejudices are applicable to the real-world situation of dialogue seminars. The investigation demonstrates that the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seminars</b> of the Balkan Dialogue Project is consistent with the specifications of the contact hypothesis. The Nansen Dialogue methodology, focusing on creating a space for educational, physical, cultural and social activities, as well as opening up for cooperation between participants, reproduces the specified condition in its structure. As my second {{research question}} was whether changes at an interpersonal level in the contact setting will be able to influence the wider process of reconciliation of the postconflict society of former Yugoslavia, I also investigated problems related to generalization of the contact experience. The process of intergroup reconciliation has to be generalised to the whole out-group, not just the out-group members of the contact experience. The experiences also have to be generalized to the macro level. These are seen as some of the main problems concerning the idea that contact enables reconciliation and intergroup attitude change. After all, the ultimate goal of initiatives of this type is that of reconciliation, to enable former conflict societies to live together in the future...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel freshman advising seminar on digital electronics and chip design {{that has been}} taught at Harvey Mudd College for three semesters. <b>The</b> <b>seminar</b> seeks to combine the freshman advising process with a hands-on opportunity for freshmen to see what engineers "really do. " In this <b>seminar,</b> <b>the</b> advisor, six to eight freshman advisees, and a student associate advisor / lab assistant meet one evening a week. In the first five weeks, students learn to solder together a utility board and breadboard a series of combinational and sequential digital electronics projects. Once they are comfortable with <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> digital circuits, they learn about building logic gates from Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) CMOS transistors and laying out CMOS transistors. They use the Electric CAD tool to design schematics, layout their circuits, simulate, and verify the chip as a team before sending it to the MOSIS service for fabrication. The chips {{have been used as}} components in industry sponsored research projects carried out by senior engineering students. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design historically has been offered at the graduate or senior level, but has been simplified to the point that freshmen can develop working chips in the time available.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{describes}} the planning, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} a seminar course designed to facilitate discussion and understanding of cross-disciplinary concepts by first-year dental students. Dental and medical schools are implementing inte-grated curricula in which clinical courses are taught early in the curriculum and the clinical and basic sciences are taught not only concurrently, but in an integrated manner. This first-year course, Integration Seminar, was developed to cross traditional subject and departmental boundaries with <b>the</b> intent <b>of</b> fostering dental care providers who understand <b>the</b> interdependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major concepts within these areas. This report describes <b>the</b> development and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Integration <b>Seminar.</b> Furthermore, student perception of this course was determined by evaluating year-end course surveys, and student performance outcomes were mea-sured by comparing student scores on the National Board Dental Examination Part I (NBDE-I) prior to and after <b>the</b> inception <b>of</b> this course. We determined that a substantial majority <b>of</b> students recognized <b>the</b> integrated nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief report of an {{undergraduate}} course in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> physiology. A specific area, <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardiovascular system, was examined chronologically through primary readings and laboratory exercises. As an unusual approach to a frequently ignored but important subject, it may {{be of interest to}} those concerned with teaching <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> science. A new seminar course entitled "Models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heart: Aristotle to Starling " was first offered in Yale College during <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> 1977. <b>The</b> course, focusing primarily on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> cardiovascular physiology, was conceived as a thematic approach to <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> general physiology. In this paper we will discuss the aims, <b>structure,</b> and content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seminar,</b> focusing on those aspects which would be most useful for others interested in this approach to teaching <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> science. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> at least three factors contributed to <b>the</b> exceptional nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course: the instructors working in collaboration were a medical scientist and a medical historian; since only elementary biology was required, the students were a mix of science and non-science majors; and, most important, <b>the</b> <b>seminar</b> incorporated extensive readings drawn from primary sources with three laboratory exercise...|$|R
