50|$|The {{potato starch}} {{production}} supply chain varies significantly by region. For example, potato starch in Europe is produced from potatoes grown specifically for this purpose. However, in the US, potatoes are not grown for starch production and manufacturers must source raw material from food processor waste streams. The characteristics of these waste streams can vary significantly and require further processing by the US potato <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturer</b> {{to ensure the}} end-product functionality and specifications are acceptable.|$|E
50|$|The Colman Baronetcy, of Gatton Park in {{the parish}} of Gatton in the County of Surrey, {{was created in the}} Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 26 November 1907 for Jeremiah Colman. He was Chairman of J. & J. Colman Ltd, mustard, {{cornflour}} and <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> of Norwich and London, and also served as a Lieutenant of the City of London.|$|R
50|$|The name Avebe {{is derived}} from the Dutch words Aardappelmeel Verkoop Bureau (Potato Flour Sales Office) (AVB). The {{cooperative}} was founded in 1919 as a cooperative partnership between different potato <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturers</b> located in the province Groningen owned by potato farmers to ensure good market prices for their native starch. The farmer cooperatives successfully pushed the privately owned starch companies away from native starch into the production of starch derivatives. In 1948 the cooperation became one company and the name was changed to Avebe. In 1956, the first derivatives were produced. In 1978, after bankruptcy of Scholten, forward integration of the potato starch industry in the Groningen was finalized as Avebe took over {{a large part of the}} Scholten company. KSH was the last privately owned potato starch company left over in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|Food {{industry}} was well {{developed in the}} voivodeship. It was dominated by small businesses {{meeting the needs of}} the local population, with the major meat processing plant at Baranowicze. In 1934, there were 611 flour mills in the province, milling rye (65%), barley (13%), wheat (7%) and other cereals. There were 227 milk processing plants, 72 labels of soft drinks, 24 distilleries, 6 fruit drying plants, 5 wineries and honey packers, 4 vinegar factories, 4 <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> 3 industrial smoke-houses, 2 breweries, 2 spirit rectification plants as well as drying and processing plant with medicinal herbs. Metal {{industry was}} represented by 6 companies. In Lida there were 2 factories of agricultural machinery and a factory of wire and nails. The equipment for mills was produced by mechanical workshops in Baranowicze, with additional two repair shops. Glassworks [...] "Neman" [...] was the biggest industrial facility in Nowogródek and anywhere in the north-eastern part of Kresy. Also, there were 9 tile factories already in 1934, including 6 large ones, employing up to 70 workers in season. The 71 brick factories were mostly small, with 10 large ones, producing mainly for the local market, because rail transport was not profitable enough. Also, there were 36 concrete plants in the province in mid 1930s. Further economic development of Nowogródek Voivodeship was abruptly halted by the war.|$|R
50|$|Frederic Silva (1841-1926) {{bought the}} {{property}} and moved there with his wife, one son and two daughters. Frederic was born in 1841 in London. He {{was the son of}} John Joseph Silva, a wealthy merchant. In 1875, he married Anna, daughter of Richard Wheen. Silva became a <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The family lived at the Manor of Groves for about ten years and in about 1915 moved to Coram Tower in Lyme Regis. The property was bought by Henry Fowell Buxton.|$|E
50|$|After {{one year}} with the Pros (also known as the All-Stars), Halas moved to Decatur, Illinois to take a {{position}} with the A. E. Staley Company, a <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> He served as a company sales representative, an outfielder on the company-sponsored baseball team, and the player-coach of the company-sponsored football team the Decatur Staleys. Halas selected his alma mater's colors—orange and navy blue—for the team's uniforms. In 1920, Halas represented the Staleys at the meeting which formed the American Professional Football Association (which became the NFL in 1922) in Canton, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|Crawford {{was born}} in 1870 at Colebrook, New Hampshire. [...] He {{was the son of}} Francis B. Crawford, a <b>starch</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and state legislator, and Susan J. (Randall) Crawford. [...] He {{attended}} preparatory school at St. Johnsbury Academy in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. [...] He enrolled at Yale University, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1891. Sources are at odds over whether or not Crawford played football for the Yale Bulldogs football team. According to the University of Nebraska web site, Crawford was [...] "a member of the dominant Yale teams of the mid-1880s." [...] The Michigan Daily also reported that Crawford played football at Yale [...] "for several years." [...] However, the University of Michigan web site notes that [...] "Yale archivists found no evidence that he played varsity football" [...] and concludes that Crawford [...] "may have played some football while a Bulldog, but definitely did not win a varsity letter." ...|$|E
50|$|The area also {{houses a}} number of sago {{factories}} for the production starch. In Salem district, 34000 ha of land are devoted to cassava and 650 industrial units are engaged in tapioca processing. In 1981, the Salem <b>Starch</b> and Sago <b>Manufacturers</b> Service Industrial Co-operative Society (SAGOSERVE) was established to promote the sago industry and nearly 80 {{percent of the national}} demand for sago and starch is met by SAGOSERVE. In and around Salem cassava yields are 25-30 tons per hectare, one of the highest in the world; the national average is 19 tons per hectare, and the world average is 10 tons.|$|R

Nearly 80% of the national demand for Sago and Starch is being met by the Sagoserv.|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{the quality}} of New Zealand wheat and flour is ever ongoing. A further {{catalyst}} to interest in the topic was the announcement that New Zealand farmgate wheat prices would be directly linked with world prices as from the 1981 harvest. This greater exposure of the wheat industry to international market forces has caused wheat millers and flour bakers to advocate more forcefully for quality improvements. Quality is the set of attributes which the different sectors of the market look for in wheat based products. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the market quality demands with the existing quality supplies of New Zealand grown wheat and flour, in order to suggest management changes that would bring quality supplies closer to quality demands. The market for wheat and flour is segmented, and centres around that required for milling (300, 000 tonnes), animal foods (60, 000 tonnes) and seed (13, 000 tonnes). For every 100 tonnes of wheat milled approximately 78 tonnes of flour is extracted for human consumption and industrial use, whilst the remaining 22 tonnes becomes bran and pollard byproducts for animal use. The resultant flour is sold mainly to bakers for the production of bread. Other flour buyers include householders, <b>starch</b> and gluten <b>manufacturers,</b> biscuit makers, cake makers and pasta manufacturers. Wheat for milling needs to have a low screenings content, low moisture content, low sprout index, freedom from insect and bug damage, and heavy grain weight. Millers also require to know grain hardness, protein content and dough strength. Animal feed wheats need to have desirable nutritional qualities primarily in the form of high total energy yield. The seed wheat market requires varieties that are profitable to growers, and multiply into grain that meets the quality requirements of the market to which it is destined (i. e. milling grade or animal feed). Milling grade wheat products and associated quality requirements are varied. The breakfast cereal market often requires health promoting products that are high in both fibre and protein. Good bread flour comes from high protein, relatively hard wheats exhibiting strong dough characteristics. Other products requiring this flour type are cracker biscuits, fruit cakes and puff pastry. Biscuit flour needs a lower protein, softer wheat exhibiting weaker dough characteristics. Products requiring this flour type are sweet biscuits, plain cakes and short pastry. Pasta flour is best made from certain hard wheat varieties. Starch flour needs a high protein content and a high paste viscosity potential. Quality is affected by management applied at various points along the distribution chain. An organisation that exercises considerable control over this management is the New Zealand Wheat Board. Important quality management aspects include breeding, farm pricing and segregation. This latter topic includes the segregation of milling grade wheat, the segregation and blending of the resultant flour, plus the associated storage and transport. Suggestions that would bring existing standards closer to the qualities required in the market include the introduction of: (i) Milling grade protein payments to growers (ii) Animal feed contracts (iii) An industrial flour category (iv) A lower flour extraction rate (v) A minimum grain weight for defining milling grade wheat. The institution that has the power to implement and coordinate these suggestions is the New Zealand Wheat Board, because it is the single authority responsible for marketing New Zealand wheat and flour. Further research needed, to establish how best to implement some of these suggestions, is also discussed...|$|R
