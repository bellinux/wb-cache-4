5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution {{had a profound effect on}} both on population and urbanisation, as well as the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E

Over the course of the last 30years, a database has been compiled of life in early South Dunedin, focussing on the borough of Caversham. This database is unique in its size for a historical study within New Zealand or Australia, containing some 9.4 gigabytes of data, and has allowed for the examination and publication of details relating to the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> demographic mix of early Dunedin.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the newly}} formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English {{initiatives}} combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy {{paved the way for}} the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway—the Stockton and Darlington Railway—opened to the public.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We {{sought to}} assess the {{association}} between <b>socioeconomic</b> status <b>and</b> the risk of stroke among elderly women. Methods [...] The association between <b>socioeconomic</b> status <b>and</b> stroke emerged in cross-sectional and longitudinal data on 4274 female participants of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based, follow-up study in the Netherlands among older subjects. RESULTS: A history of stroke was more common among women in lower socioeconomic strata. The same trend was observed {{for the relationship between}} the lowest <b>socioeconomic</b> groups <b>and</b> the incidence of stroke. Risk factors for stroke were not related to socioeconomic status in a consistent manner. Smoking, history of cardiovascular diseases, and overweight were more common in lower socioeconomic groups. However, socioeconomic differences in hypertension, antihypertensive drug use, prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy were not observed. The complex of established risk factors could only partly explain the association between <b>socioeconomic</b> status <b>and</b> stroke. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association among elderly women between <b>socioeconomic</b> status <b>and</b> stroke. The association could only partly be explained by known risk factors. Our findings indicate that not only the actual risk profile but also risk factors earlier in life may be of importance...|$|R

25|$|In 2011, a {{quasi-experimental}} {{study was}} conducted that included homeschooled and traditional public students {{between the ages of}} 5 & 10 and it was discovered {{that the majority of the}} homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts (Chang, Gould, & Meuse, 2001). However, Martin-Chang also found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented homeschooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally schooled children on standardized tests (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> educational background).|$|E

However, women are disadvantaged due to social, cultural, political and economic factors that directly influence their health and impede their access to health-related information and care. In the 2008 World Health Report, the World Health Organization stressed that strategies to improve women’s health must take full account of the underlying determinants of health, particularly gender inequality. Additionally, specific <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>and</b> cultural barriers that hamper women in protecting and improving their health must also be addressed.|$|E
25|$|Historically, interracial {{marriage}} in the United States was of great public opposition (often a taboo), especially among whites.

The advantage {{of this study is that}} it offers a specific picture to describe the complex interrelationship between <b>socioeconomic</b> determinants <b>and</b> health, producing a network that is controlled by socio demographic factors such as gender and age.

40|$|This study {{examined}} institutional anomie {{theory in the}} context of transitional Russia. Methods. We employed an index of negative <b>socioeconomic</b> change <b>and</b> measures of family, education, and polity to test the hypothesis that institutional strength conditions the effects of poverty <b>and</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> change on homicide rates. Results. As expected, the results of models estimated using negative binomial regression show direct positive effects of poverty <b>and</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> change <b>and</b> direct negative effects of family strength and polity on regional homicide rates. There was no support, however, for the hypothesis that stronger social institutions reduce the effects of poverty <b>and</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> change on violence. Conclusions. We interpret these results in the Russia-specific setting, concluding that Russia is a rich laboratory for examining the effects of social change on crime and that empirical research in other nations is important when assessing the generalizability of theories developed to explain crime and violence in the United States...|$|R
