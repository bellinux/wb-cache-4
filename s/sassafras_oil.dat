The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied. <b>Sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the global supply {{shortage}} of <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil,</b> substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Fiona Measham, a criminologist at The University of Lancaster, {{thought the}} {{emergence}} of mephedrone was also related to the decreasing purity of ecstasy and cocaine on sale in the UK, a view reinforced in {{a report by the}} National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. The average cocaine purity fell from 60% in 1999 to 22% in 2009 and about half of ecstasy pills seized in 2009 contained no MDMA, and by June 2010 almost all ecstasy pills seized in the UK contained no MDMA. A similar pattern was observed in the Netherlands, with the number of ecstasy tablets containing no MDMA rising from 10% in mid-2008 to 60% by mid-2009, with mephedrone being detected in 20% of ecstasy tablets by mid-2009. The decrease of MDMA was thought to be partly due to the seizure of 33tonnes of <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil,</b> the precursor to MDMA, in Cambodia in June 2008, which could have been used to make 245 million doses of MDMA. According to John Ramsey, a toxicologist at St George's, University of London, {{the emergence of}} mephedrone was also related to the UK government banning the benzylpiperazine class of drugs in December 2009. gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL), another previously [...] "legal high", was also banned in August 2009 despite concerns it would be replaced by other drugs.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{ingredients}} of root beer was <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil,</b> a plant root extract used in beverages for its flavor and presumed medicinal properties. The medicinal properties of root beer are emphasized in the advertising slogan, [...] "Join Health and Cheer/Drink Hires Rootbeer." [...] Ironically, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> in 1960 because it contains the carcinogen and liver-damaging chemical safrol. However, a process was later discovered by which the harmful chemical could be removed from <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> while preserving the flavor.|$|E

5000|$|Safrole is a phenylpropene. It is a colorless or {{slightly}} yellow oily liquid typically {{extracted from the}} root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants {{in the form of}} <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> (although commercially available culinary <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> is usually devoid of safrole due to a rule passed by the FDA in 1960), or is synthesized from catechol or other related methylenedioxy compounds. It is the principal component of brown camphor oil, and is found in small amounts {{in a wide variety of}} plants, where it functions as a natural pesticide. Ocotea cymbarum oil made from Ocotea pretiosa, a plant growing in Brazil, and <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> made from Sassafras albidum, a tree growing in eastern North America, are the main natural sources for safrole. It has a characteristic [...] "sweet-shop" [...] aroma.|$|E
50|$|Steam {{distillation}} {{of dried}} root bark produces an essential oil {{which has a}} high safrole content, as well as significant amounts of varying other chemicals such as camphor, eugenol, 5-methoxyeugenol, asarone, and various sesquiterpenes. Many other trees contain similarly high percentages and their extracted oils are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil.,</b> which once was extensively used as a fragrance in perfumes and soaps, food and for aromatherapy. Safrole is a precursor for the clandestine manufacture of the drugs MDA and MDMA, and as such, sales and import of <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> (as a safrole containing mixture of above threshold concentration) are heavily restricted in the US.|$|E
5000|$|In modern times, the {{sassafras}} {{plant has}} been grown and harvested for {{the extraction of}} <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil.</b> It is used {{in a variety of}} commercial products or their syntheses, such as the insecticide synergistic compound piperonyl butoxide. [...] These plants are primarily harvested for commercial purposes in Asia and Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{sassafras}} {{roots and}} bark, the tree's leaves (from which filé is produced), {{do not contain}} a detectable amount of safrole. [...] This is significant because in 1960, the FDA banned the use of <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> and safrole in commercially mass-produced foods and drugs based on the animal studies and human case reports suggesting safrole is a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oils within the leaf {{are rich in}} safrole, a substance also found in sassafras, which {{has been shown to}} be carcinogenic in animals. In 1960, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned sassafras bark along with <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> and safrole as flavoring agents because of their carcinogenic properties and the Council of Europe imposed the same ban in 1974, although toxicological studies show that humans do not process safrole into its carcinogenic metabolite.|$|E
50|$|Various {{parts of}} trees {{are used as}} spices. These include {{cinnamon}}, made from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice, the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica). Nutmeg is a seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum). <b>Sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> is an important flavouring obtained from distilling bark from {{the roots of the}} white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
50|$|Safrole, the {{aromatic}} oil found in sassafras roots and bark that gave traditional root beer its distinctive flavour, was banned for commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or {{various types of}} cancer. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes substituted with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century it was {{reported}} that the formulation comprised 66% paraffin wax, 20% pale resin (colophony), and 14% eucalyptus oil, with small amounts of other ingredients. More recently, the composition was given as 5% eucalyptus oil, 1.8% camphor, 0.5% thyme oil, and 0.65% <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil.</b> A 1908 report published in The British Medical Journal estimated that the cost of ingredients for a standard 0.6 oz box was one farthing, yet its retail price was 1s 1½ d, resulting in a profit margin of more than 98%.|$|E
50|$|Safrole can be {{obtained}} through natural extraction from the Sassafras albidum and the Ocotea cymbarum. <b>Sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> for example is obtained by steam distillation of the root bark of the Sassafras tree. The resulting steam distilled product contains about 90% safrole by weight. The oil is dried by mixing it {{with a small amount}} of anhydrous calcium chloride. After filtering-off the calcium chloride, the oil is vacuum distilled at 100◦ C under a vacuum of 11 millimeters of mercury or frozen in (melting point of 11◦C) to crystallize the safrole out. This technique works with other oils in which safrole is present as well.|$|E
50|$|Heliotropin (also {{known as}} Piperonal), an extract of the Sassafras tree, {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of perfumes, soaps and body lotions. Natural Heliotropin is obtained from <b>Sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> which is extracted from the roots of the Sassafras tree, a species of deciduous trees in the family Lauraceae. The massive commercial felling of Sassafras forests has led to the danger of extinction of the species. It is estimated that around 5 million trees are cut down every year to meet the worldwide demand for Heliotropin.The Anthea Group through its in-house research developed a synthetic grade of Heliotropin having a high purity, and has set up manufacturing facilities in Group company, Crown Chemicals. Synthetic Piperonal manufactured in Crown Chemicals is widely used in Fragrance, Flavour and Pharmaceutical applications.|$|E
50|$|Sassafras {{roots are}} used to make {{traditional}} root beer, although they were banned for commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or <b>sassafras</b> <b>oil</b> that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or various types of cancer. In humans, liver damage can take years to develop {{and it may not}} have obvious signs. Along with commercially available Sarsaparilla, sassafras remains an ingredient in use among hobby or microbrew enthusiasts. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes substituted with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available. Most commercial root beers have replaced the sassafras extract with methyl salicylate, the ester found in wintergreen and black birch (Betula lenta) bark.|$|E

It can also be synthesized from catechol or other related methylenedioxy compounds. Safrole is also present in certain essentials oils and in brown camphor oil, which is in small amounts present in many plants and functions as a natural pesticide. Safrole {{is a member of the}} methylenedioxybenzene group, of which many compounds are used as insecticide synergists; for example, safrole is used as a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide piperonyl butoxide. Safrole is also used as a precursor in the synthesis of the drug N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy). Safrole can be found in anise, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper, and as an additive in root beer, chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps, and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Before safrole was banned by the FDA in 1960 for use in food, it was used as a food flavour for its characteristic ‘candy-shop’ aroma. Safrole has been shown to exhibit antibiotic and anti-angiogenic functions.|$|E

A brief historical review of the chemistry of the primary aliphatic terpene alcohols, namely, geraniol and citronellol, will be given. The attention attached to these compounds is largely due to their importance in the perfumery trade. Geraniol is a colourless liquid of sweet odour, recalling that of rose and pelargonium. It is found in the free state and also in the form of its esters in a large number of essential oils.
