50|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when and where}} the first amphitheaters were built. There are records attesting to temporary wooden amphitheaters built in the Forum Romanum for gladiatorial games from the second century BC onwards, and these may be {{the origin of the}} architectural form later expressed in stone. In his Historia Naturalis, Pliny the Elder claims that the amphitheater was invented during the spectacles of Gaius Scribonius Curio in 53 BC, where two wooden <b>semicircular</b> <b>theatres</b> were rotated towards each other to form one circular amphitheater, while spectators were still seated in the two halves. But while this may be the origin of the architectural term amphitheatrum, it cannot be the origin of the architectural concept, since earlier stone amphitheaters, known as spectacula or amphitheatera, have been found.|$|R

50|$|Ballad opera, {{a popular}} <b>theatre</b> <b>style</b> at the time, {{was the first}} style of musical to be {{performed}} in the American colonies. The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play {{never made it to}} production. Around the 1920s, <b>theatre</b> <b>styles</b> were beginning to be defined more clearly. For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs. When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.|$|R
50|$|Appeasing senior {{citizens}} by performing gigs {{at the nursing}} home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or <b>theatre</b> <b>styles</b> without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances {{come in the form of}} talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or <b>theatre</b> <b>styles</b> to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.|$|R
