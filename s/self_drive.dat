In 2002 the Company acquired 40% of Furgonetas de Alquiler SA, a Spanish vehicle rental business, and has since exercised an option to buy the remainder.

30|$|Despite {{the above}} {{mentioned}} historical definitions of CSR, {{the concept is}} still changing {{from country to country}} and organization to organization. Matten and Moon (2008) conceptualized CSR in a European context and differentiated between explicit and implicit CSR.

Implicitly CSR referred to the values, norms and rules which compel corporations to address issues stakeholders consider a proper obligation upon corporate actors. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, 1998) characterizes CSR as an ‘enduring word of honor by business to act morally and contribute to economic growth while improving {{the quality of life of}} the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large’.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{one kind}} of current driving sync rectifier capable of replacing diode rectifier in most power converter topology of obtaining low rectification loss. The present invention includes one low-loss switch, one transformer {{with at least one}} current detecting coil, one energy restore detecting coil and one drive coil connected to the lagging driver, which provides drive signaland power to the sync rectifier. One kind of lagging driver is described, which can reduce noise interference to the drive signal, increase work frequency range, avoid saturation in the current detecting transformer to provide more flexible transformer design. The sync rectifier is <b>self</b> <b>driven</b> and its driving signal is independent on the input voltage of the transformer, and this expands the its application range in wide input range converter.; The power converter can operate at high frequency in high efficiency. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|For the {{planning}} of large pedestrian facilities, the movement of pedestrians in various situations has to be modelled. Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use <b>self</b> <b>driven</b> pargticles (SDP), continuous in space and time. It is common experience that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors. They tend to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing {{the capacity of the}} facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two standard shortest distance based static floors on 90 and 180 degree bends with a newly defined one. For SDP, we demonstrate how variations in the modeling of the momentary destination of the agents influence trajectories and capacity.
