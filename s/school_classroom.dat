5|$|The log {{church was}} moved from its {{original}} location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill {{across the road from}} the brick church. It was used as a sexton's house for the church, and was a Sunday <b>school</b> <b>classroom</b> for about 30 years. In addition to religious instruction, the log building was a public schoolhouse. Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother, the judge Garnett Kerr Kump, received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse. By 1885, a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school. The log building succumbed to the elements, and no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her <b>school</b> <b>classroom</b> seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E

25|$|The wedge {{strategy}} details {{a simultaneous}} assault on state boards of education, {{state and federal}} legislatures and on the print and broadcast media. The Discovery Institute has carried out the strategy through {{its role in the}} intelligent design movement, where it aggressively promoted ID and its Teach the Controversy campaign to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Intelligent design proponents, through the Discovery Institute, have employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in their furtherance of their goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public <b>school</b> <b>classroom,</b> to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents.|$|E
500|$|In the 1998 {{legislative}} session, {{the state}} enjoyed a $200million budget surplus. Patton {{was able to}} distribute this surplus to legislative allies, giving him substantial leverage for his proposals. As one legislative leader opined, [...] "Money buys a lot of silence." [...] Legislators were also reluctant to oppose the administration for fear that Patton would be re-elected in 1999. Consequently, Patton was able to gain approval of a very ambitious legislative agenda in 1998, including tougher criminal laws, improved economic development, reform for Medicaid, and further reform of the higher-education system. Patton also used some of the budget surplus to provide computers for public classrooms; because of Patton's commitment to education, Kentucky was the first {{state in the nation}} to have every public <b>school</b> <b>classroom</b> wired to the Internet. Once this was accomplished, Patton charged his education secretary, Ed Ford, with developing the Kentucky Virtual High School, a system of distance education that would allow students in smaller high schools in Kentucky to have access to courses in foreign languages and other subjects offered only at larger high schools. The virtual high school was brought online in January 2000.|$|E

Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to [...] "silence or Sam Kinison", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of [...] "Old McDonald Had a Farm", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying [...] "Good morning, Vietna...shua!") The Princess Bride, Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures. Holly's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley, the nerdy character with a cowlick played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live.|$|E

2500|$|With {{administrative}} change occurring, the construction project progressed. The project ultimately {{resulted in a}} middle school wing, a middle school gymnasium, a renovated Instructional Media Center (library), new {{middle school and high}} school main offices, a 450-seat auditorium, a new front walkway and entrance, a renovated commons area, and high <b>school</b> <b>classroom</b> renovation. In addition to expansion of the building, in order to meet state fire codes, the construction also resulted in traditional, four-walled, closed classrooms. By removing wall-less classrooms, the new classroom setup left some interior rooms windowless. In addition, the Commons had its carpet removed and new, artistic walls were installed. These walls were often poked fun at and seemed very silly in the eyes of students, with statements of [...] "This is a school, not an art museum!" [...] pushing a backlash against the walls. Many wanted the walls removed, though that wouldn't happen until Blind Brook went through a second wave of construction. The new auditorium was also criticized as it was too small and could not fit the entire high school and its faculty in the facility at the same time. In addition, the end-of-the-year graduation would not be able to be held in the new facility as it lacked necessary seating for guests. Graduations are held in the gym as it can accommodate the larger number of guests.|$|E
2500|$|Tie-breakers {{are only}} done for {{students}} who tie, but {{did not get a}} perfect score. [...] They are sometimes used in the case for when money or prizes are being distributed to the winners of the competition, and a tie breaker will be used even if both students have a perfect score. [...] Tie-breakers are conducted according to the [...] "sudden death" [...] method. [...] For example, in a tie-breaker, if student A scored the same as student B, and each missed 1 question, the student who missed question #5 will win over the student who missed question #3; students who start missing questions last are ranked higher, given same scores. [...] If the sudden death method doesn't resolve the tie, in other words both students have exactly the same answers, then a tie-breaker question is made and the person to turn in the correct answer the fastest wins the tie. [...] If both get it wrong or if both turn in the correct answer at the same time then the process is repeated until the tie is resolved. [...] All students that get a perfect score are considered to place 1st. [...] Due to the large number of students, as compared to a typical high <b>school</b> <b>classroom,</b> who participate in competitions, scantrons are used as answer sheets; their main advantage is that they can be graded by a computer. [...] These are similar in type to the answer sheets used in standardized tests such as the SAT and the ACT.|$|E
