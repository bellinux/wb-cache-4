5|$|Begin Again premiered on September 7, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Weinstein Company {{acquired}} the U.S. distribution {{rights to the}} film for $7 million. It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song <b>Save</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> to Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} remember and it was often misquoted.|$|E

Don't let fear and {{frustration}} decide your vote. The rights {{we already have}} shouldn't be relinquished." [...] René Pérez, from Calle 13, also invited people to vote [...] "No" [...] to the amendments. Pérez wrote on his Facebook page [...] "You wouldn't amputate an arm or a leg, unless it was to <b>save</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> The same happens with freedom. The right for bail is part of it.

500|$|Director John Carney {{conceived}} the premise for Begin Again {{several years before}} he began to write the screenplay in 2010. The story was partly inspired by his own experiences as a musician in a band, and from his impression of the artists and repertoire (A) executives of record labels during the 1990s, which {{formed the basis of}} Dan's character. Carney wrote the script, which was initially titled Can a Song <b>Save</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?,</b> before he, Glen Hansard, and Gregg Alexander began writing the songs; he wanted [...] "to work the music around the story, instead of the other way around." [...] The script's style of featuring songs as a natural element of the story was inspired by the 1954 Judy Garland musical film A Star Is Born, and is also employed in Carney's earlier film Once (2007). Carney first pitched the film in 2010 to filmmaker Judd Apatow, who produced the film alongside Tobin Armbrust and Anthony Bregman whose production company Exclusive Media financed the film's US$8 million budget.|$|E
