40|$|Abstract: For the {{analysis}} of dynamic contact between an overhead wire and a pantograph of a high-speed train, a numerical technique for solving the equations of motion of the wire and pan-tograph subjected to contact condition is presented. The equations of motion of the wire and the pantograph are simultaneously time integrated with the strict application of the contact con-dition by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. The velocity and acceleration contact conditions {{as well as the}} displacement contact condition are imposed with special consider-ation of the high-velocity contact point moving on the deformed wire. Especially, it is shown that the Coriolis and centripetal accelerations of the contact point moving rapidly on the deformed wire play the crucial roles for the stability of the solution. And, the numerical simulations are performed with a practical model consisting of <b>suspension</b> <b>wire,</b> contact wire, droppers, and pantograph...|$|R

40|$|Overhead {{earth wire}} {{breakage}} accident may occur frequently, which can seriously affect the reliable {{operation of the}} power grid. The main reason of the earth wire breakage is the contact resistance inside the clamp as short-circuit current flows through it. To understand the mechanism of the earth wire breakage, this paper conducts the theoretical study on the skin effect and contact resistance of the <b>wire</b> <b>suspension</b> string with winding preformed armor rods. The temperature rise experiments using of the new and old earth <b>wire</b> <b>suspension</b> string are performed to verify the theoretical analysis. The {{results show that the}} hotspots locate in the fracture of the preformed armor rods and the inside the clamp when short-circuit current flows through the earth <b>wire</b> <b>suspension</b> string. The reason could be the increase of the contact resistances in these two locations due to rust of the suspension string.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{experimental}} method for {{the identification of}} rigid body inertia properties. The method’s central element is a mathematical model of a multi-wire suspension condition that unlike previous models accounts for all geometric stiffness ef-fects caused by the unknown gravity preload. The suspension model {{makes it possible to}} identify accurate rigid body properties from excitations and response measurements at a single frequency within the rigid body range. In this way, the suspension model enables a new identification method based on a sensorless single-rotor unbalance actuator that can be built at minimal cost. Unlike a conventional shaker or impulse actuator, the proposed actuator can be rigidly attached to the test structure, whereby accurate alignment is made relatively easy. A prototype of the actuator was applied to four different test structures. The experimental procedure was found to be straightforward, and the identified rigid body properties showed high accuracy.

40|$|The aim of videolaparo-cholecystectomy is {{to achieve}} a good results with minimal {{surgical}} trauma. Recently {{there has been an}} evolution of this technique toward the progressive reduction of trauma with an improvement of the results, also from the aesthetical point of view. In this article we describe our new videolaparo-cholecystectomy technique. Trans-umbilical videolaparo-cholecystectomy represents a variant of the traditional technique. This new method allows the operation to perform with only two trocars positioned in the peritoneum cavity through only one umbilical incision. The technical innovation of this method consists of the substitution of the others trocars, utilized in the traditional technique, with an equal number of trans-parietal <b>suspension</b> <b>wires.</b> Up to now, we have given 95 patients this kind of operation being successful in 67 % of the cases.

The best measured Q was 1. 1 × 106 for a 20 kg glass mass with metal clamps rigidly attached to it. The main factor that limits the pendulum Q is the dissipation in the wire–test mass attachment.

Measurement of changes in inclination of the <b>suspension</b> <b>wire</b> of a test mass, relative to a direction defined by a reference arm of long period of oscillation, makes it possible to carry this out over the frequency range of interest for earth-based gravitational radiation detectors.

Alternatively the signal corresponding to horizontal acceleration can be used to move the point from which the test mass is suspended in such a way as to reduce the effect of the seismic disturbance and also damp pendulum motions of the suspended test mass.
