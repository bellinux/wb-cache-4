500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E

500|$|Eden did {{suggest a}} counter-proposal on 1 July, {{but it was}} reduced, Bauer writes, to a ridiculous minimum. He told the American {{government}} that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1,500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland, 5,000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine, and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees. He did not <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would offer in return. On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{put an end to}} the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was [...] "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed," [...] and that there should be [...] "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: [...] "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character. I would not take it seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Frazer (2004) {{notes that}} while Adams shared many {{perspectives}} with deists, [...] "Adams clearly {{was not a}} deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists {{did not believe in}} miracles or God's providence....Adams, however, did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation." [...] Frazer further argues that Adams' [...] "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism." [...] By contrast, David L. Holmes has argued that Adams, beginning as a Congregationalist, ended his days as a Christian Unitarian, accepting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, but also accepting Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical account of his miracles as true. Like many of his Protestant contemporaries, Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Catholic Church. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, [...] "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will." ...|$|E

500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had said, what he had meant to <b>say,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E

2500|$|Deleuze's {{peculiar}} {{readings of}} the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. [...] "Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say." ...|$|E

As far as I know, {{he has never been}} put before a disciplinary panel and found guilty of any serious offence. The Nikita Miller I know is outspoken, and will stand up and <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes. There are times when he may rub authorities the wrong way with his willingness to speak up, but others have played far more often for the West Indies with far greater baggage on their resume." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Panufnik visited Soviet Union {{as part of}} a Polish {{delegation}} to study Soviet teaching methods. [...] He met Dmitri Shostakovich, whom he had befriended at previous conferences, and Aram Khachaturian. During conversations with lesser composers, Panufnik was pressed to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was working on. Having to say something acceptable, he casually mentioned that he had an idea for a Symphony of Peace. This was seized upon, and on returning to Poland he was granted a stay in quiet surroundings so that he could finish the piece (Panufnik interpreted this as an order to complete it). He wrote a three movement work, ending with a setting of words by his friend, the poet Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. Panufnik hoped to work his own conception of peace into the composition, rather than the official Soviet ideology. The piece was not a success with the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|The reunion {{between the}} Doctor and Rose in the 2008 episode [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] is stated by {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Confidential to be {{a parody of}} romantic film conventions, because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, [...] "Journey's End", Rose challenges the Doctor to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> didn't get to say before, to which he replies, [...] "Does it need saying?" [...] His half-human duplicate, however, does whisper it into Rose's ear, {{and the two of}} them kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the duplicate-Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in Confidential that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying [...] "I love you". David Tennant stated that Rose was the Doctor's girlfriend, though it was never explicitly stated on screen.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of manager Sam Allardyce, Keegan made a sensational, unexpected return to Newcastle United on 16 January 2008. Thousands of Newcastle United fans attended St James' Park to welcome the manager back to the club as he arrived to see the FA Cup third round replay against Stoke City alongside owner Mike Ashley and chairman Chris Mort. He managed his first game at the club since 1997 against Bolton Wanderers on 19 January 2008. He awarded the club captaincy to Michael Owen, stating, [...] "He's not scared to give his opinion when he's right, and he's not scared to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels. He's a tremendous professional, and he trains properly every day." [...] Keegan announced on 22 January that he and Alan Shearer held talks about the two linking up with Shearer as his assistant, but decided against the idea, leaving {{the door open for}} him to take other roles he was interested in.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, O'Neal reiterated {{his belief}} that Bryant {{deserved}} the MVP award. Bryant {{went on to win}} the award for the first time in his career that season. During the offseason, O'Neal was at a party, and got up to rap in front of the crowd. O'Neal mentioned Bryant multiple times in the rap, saying that [...] "Kobe couldn't do it without me", referring to Bryant and the Lakers loss in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics. He also rapped, [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes". During the rap, O'Neal also blamed his divorce on Bryant's comments to investigators in 2004 about O'Neal paying off women. Bryant commented that he [...] "didn't take (O'Neal's rap) any kind of way whatsoever." [...] O'Neal later said he was freestyling and that [...] "it was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever ... I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all."

2500|$|Piper espouses a {{brand of}} creationism known as [...] "Historical Creationism", and credits John Sailhamer's book Genesis Unbound to {{explaining}} the view. [...] "Historical Creationism" [...] states that God created the universe, planet Earth, and many creatures and things within Earth itself {{over the course of}} an indefinite time period before {{the first day of the}} week of Genesis 1, and that the days of the creation week were God changing a desolate piece of land into the blessed region of Eden, where God would bring Adam and Eve into existence and place them within it on the sixth day. [...] "In verse 1, [...] " [...] Piper said, [...] "'In the beginning he made the heavens and the earth,' he makes everything. And then you go day by day and he's preparing the land. He's not bringing new things into existence; he's preparing the land and causing things to grow and separating out water and earth. And then, when it's all set and prepared, he creates and puts man there." [...] Piper acknowledged, however, that although it is his interpretation of the text, he is not dogmatic about the issue and that [...] "every pastor should go ahead and <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes...I'm inclined to not draw that too narrowly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Noble had {{not done}} any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he {{appeared}} opposite Ian Smith as a gay lover in the Australian TV series [...] "It's a date", or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants without being influenced by a script or crew. Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly {{take the form of}} interviews and panel game participation. In the UK, he has appeared on BBC's Johnny Vaughan Tonight and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Noble has also made 16 appearances, the highest number of appearances of any guest, on BBC One's Have I Got News for You including the first show guest presented by Paul Merton. His most memorable appearance on the show saw him and Paul Merton answer all their questions wrong, and getting no points in the entire show. He was Paul Merton's guest on Room 101, where he wanted to consign to history the likes of Craig David, cartoon animals who wear clothes, people who look like cats, clipboards and [...] Christian rock music. He makes regular contributions to BBC Radio 4's Just a Minute and has also appeared on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and presented 4 At The Store. In July 2007, Ross featured, as part of his [...] "In The Company Of...", on the Colin Murray show on BBC Radio 1, and in August 2007 Noble appeared on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2.|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album.
