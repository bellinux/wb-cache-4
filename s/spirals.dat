5|$|This form of Cotes's <b>spirals</b> {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's <b>spirals</b> (Figure 8). The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity, which {{corresponds to}} values of μ greater than the positive number L12/m. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that L is not too large for the given μ.|$|E
5|$|In On <b>Spirals,</b> Archimedes {{describes}} the Archimedean spiral, a function whose radius {{depends on the}} angle. The Greek work, however, did not extend to a full coordinate system.|$|E
5|$|Other curves, {{including}} some infinite <b>spirals,</b> remain self-similar with more complicated motions including rotation or combinations of rotation, shrinking or expansion, and translation.|$|E
50|$|A {{hyperbolic}} <b>spiral</b> is a transcendental plane curve {{also known}} as a reciprocal <b>spiral.</b> A hyperbolic <b>spiral</b> is the opposite of an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> and is a type of Cotes' <b>spiral.</b>|$|R
50|$|In geometry, the <b>spiral</b> of Theodorus (also called {{square root}} <b>spiral,</b> Einstein <b>spiral</b> or Pythagorean <b>spiral)</b> is a <b>spiral</b> {{composed}} of contiguous right triangles. It was first constructed by Theodorus of Cyrene.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spiral</b> {{formed by}} {{parametric}} plot of [...] {{is known as}} Nielsen's <b>spiral.</b> It is {{also referred to as}} the Euler <b>spiral,</b> the Cornu <b>spiral,</b> a clothoid, or as a linear-curvature polynomial <b>spiral.</b>|$|R

5|$|Escher worked {{primarily}} in the media of lithographs and woodcuts, though the few mezzotints he made {{are considered to be}} masterpieces of the technique. In his graphic art, he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures and space. Integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones, spheres, cubes, rings and <b>spirals.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Spiral's</b> mind is {{apparently}} immune to possession. When Rogue attempted {{to use her}} power-and-psyche-stealing ability to steal <b>Spiral's</b> mind and powers, <b>Spiral</b> stole Rogue's instead, laughing that she had danced in many people's souls. Nocturne was fooled by <b>Spiral</b> into thinking <b>Spiral</b> had been possessed while <b>Spiral</b> remained in control.|$|R

50|$|Usually, most <b>spiral</b> galaxies contain two {{clearly defined}} <b>spiral</b> arms, or they contain only fuzzy {{filamentary}} <b>spiral</b> structures. Galaxies with three well-defined <b>spiral</b> arms are rare.|$|R
5|$|Important {{features}} {{incorporated in}} the line include four loops (<b>spirals)</b> and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for {{the replacement of the}} basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. <b>Spirals</b> located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E
5|$|Plant <b>spirals</b> {{can be seen}} in phyllotaxis, the {{arrangement}} of leaves on a stem, and in {{the arrangement}} (parastichy) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit, {{as well as in the}} pattern of scales in pine cones, where multiple <b>spirals</b> run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together. Phyllotaxis <b>spirals</b> can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In hazel the ratio is 1/3; in apricot it is 2/5; in pear it is 3/8; in almond it is 5/13. In disc phyllotaxis as in the sunflower and daisy, the florets are arranged in Fermat's spiral with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the golden angle, 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.|$|E
5|$|The HDF galaxies {{contained}} a considerably {{larger proportion of}} disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were {{more common in the}} young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant elliptical galaxies form when <b>spirals</b> and irregular galaxies collide.|$|E
5000|$|A {{logarithmic}} <b>spiral,</b> equiangular <b>spiral</b> or growth <b>spiral</b> is a self-similar <b>spiral</b> curve {{which often}} appears in nature. The logarithmic <b>spiral</b> was first described by Descartes and later extensively investigated by Jacob Bernoulli, who called it Spira mirabilis, [...] "the marvelous spiral".|$|R
5000|$|NGC 5713 is a peculiar, {{asymmetric}} {{galaxy in}} the constellation Virgo. Although classified as a <b>spiral</b> galaxy by most galaxy catalogs, NGC 5713 galaxy {{is very different from}} most normal <b>spiral</b> galaxies. While most <b>spiral</b> galaxies either have either two well-defined <b>spiral</b> arms or a filamentary spiral-like structure, this <b>spiral</b> galaxy has only one visible <b>spiral</b> arm in its disk. [...] This makes it a galaxy of the Magellanic type. Gravitational interactions with the nearby <b>spiral</b> galaxy NGC 5719 may be responsible for producing the disturbed, asymmetric structure including the single <b>spiral</b> arm.|$|R
50|$|In {{microwave}} systems, a <b>spiral</b> antenna {{is a type}} of RF antenna. It {{is shaped}} as a two-arm <b>spiral,</b> or more arms may be used. <b>Spiral</b> antennas were first described in 1956. <b>Spiral</b> antennas belong to the class of frequency independent antennas which operate over a wide range of frequencies. Polarization, radiation pattern and impedance of such antennas remain unchanged over large bandwidth. Such antennas are inherently circularly polarized with low gain. Array of <b>spiral</b> antennas can be used to increase the gain. <b>Spiral</b> antennas are reduced size antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure. Lossy cavities are usually placed at the back to eliminate back lobes because a unidirectional pattern is usually preferred in such antennas. <b>Spiral</b> antennas are classified into different types; archimedean <b>spiral,</b> square <b>spiral</b> and star <b>spiral</b> etc. Archimedean <b>spiral</b> is the most popular configuration.|$|R
5|$|The {{circle is}} the only simple closed curve that {{maintains}} its shape under the curve-shortening flow, but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape, including the grim reaper curve, an infinite curve that translates upwards, and <b>spirals</b> that rotate while remaining {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many <b>spirals</b> in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other <b>spirals</b> are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of <b>spirals,</b> ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E

50|$|A barred <b>spiral</b> {{galaxy is}} a <b>spiral</b> galaxy {{with a central}} bar-shaped {{structure}} composed of stars. Bars are found in approximately two-thirds of all <b>spiral</b> galaxies. Bars generally affect both the motions of stars and interstellar gas within <b>spiral</b> galaxies and can affect <b>spiral</b> arms as well. The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred <b>spiral</b> galaxy.|$|R
5|$|As {{the advance}} led by Gerhard Schöpfel {{made their way}} past the coast it spotted the vic-formation of RAF fighters. They were Hurricanes of 501 Squadron which were {{conducting}} wide <b>spirals</b> to gain height. Schöpfel bounced them and shot down four in two minutes killing one pilot and wounding three others. As he departed {{other members of his}} Geschwader (Wing) dived on the Squadron and an inconclusive dogfight ensued. Schöpfel's victims were Donald McKay and Pilot Officers J.W Bland, Kenneth Lee and F. Kozlowski. Bland was the only one killed.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, <b>spirals,</b> angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, <b>spirals,</b> and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E

50|$|The {{logarithmic}} <b>spiral</b> can {{be distinguished}} from the Archimedean <b>spiral</b> {{by the fact that}} the distances between the turnings of a logarithmic <b>spiral</b> increase in geometric progression, while in an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> these distances are constant.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, Vera Rubin {{uncovered}} a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that {{predicted by the}} visible mass of stars and gas.

5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as <b>spirals.</b> The globe was manufactured in great numbers {{but it was never}} updated.

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, <b>spirals,</b> meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> {{arms are}} regions of stars that extend {{from the center}} of <b>spiral</b> and barred <b>spiral</b> galaxies.

Sc and SBc galaxies, for instance, have very [...] "loose" [...] arms, whereas Sa and SBa galaxies have tightly wrapped arms (with reference to the Hubble sequence). Either way, <b>spiral</b> arms contain many young, blue stars (due to the high mass density and the high rate of star formation), which make the arms so bright.|$|R
