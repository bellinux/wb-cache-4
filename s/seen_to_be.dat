5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E

5|$|Long <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> within Igor's track, Bermuda {{was finally}} placed under a {{hurricane}} watch on September17 as the threat became imminent.

Following the passage of hurricane winds, the advisory was changed to a tropical storm warning early on September20 before being discontinued later that day.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely affected. The subfield CA1 is <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
