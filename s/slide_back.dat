5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> and forth to deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E

5000|$|Fixed back-band. In a four-wheeled vehicle, {{the shafts}} or pole {{must be allowed}} to hinge up and down, to allow the horse and vehicle to pass over {{hillocks}} and dips. Often the shafts are independently hinged, and on a side-slope these will each hinge to follow the horse, and a <b>sliding</b> <b>back</b> band is not needed. However, if a <b>sliding</b> <b>back</b> band was used with independent shafts it might allow one shaft to ride up higher than the other, and so for such shafts the back-band is normally fixed to the harness saddle. On other four-wheeled vehicles, the two shafts hinge together, and a <b>sliding</b> <b>back</b> band is needed as for two-wheeled vehicles.|$|R

5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E

25|$|In November 2000, Still became Barnet's {{director}} of football following the high-profile appointment of former England international Tony Cottee as player-manager. At the time, Barnet {{were sitting in}} tenth place in the league, but soon suffered a sharp loss of form and plunged down the table to the relegation zone. On 16 March 2001, Cottee left after losing 13 of his 19 league matches as manager and Still returned to lead the team {{for the remainder of}} the season. He was unable to prevent Barnet's <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> into the Football Conference, as a 3–2 defeat at home to Torquay United on the final day of the season saw them relegated and end a decade-long stay in the Football League. Still agreed to remain as both the club's manager and {{director of}} football until a replacement could be found, with Barnet intending to promote youth team coach and former Norwich City defender Ian Culverhouse to manager. However, Culverhouse left the club in January 2001 to become youth team coach at Leyton Orient and Still subsequently resigned as manager one month later. At the time, Barnet were 14th in the table, winless in seven league matches and had been knocked out of the FA Trophy.|$|E

This was to avoid a tendency by the He 111 to drop a wing, especially on the port side.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Cliff Wheatley gave All Hail the King a 9.4 out of 10. He {{said that}} it's [...] "a {{return to the}} loveable {{personality}} of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it’s the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines {{in the role of}} Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from Iron Man 3 in a sort of referential way, but it’s nothing too damaging."

500|$|Fuller made 36 league {{appearances}} for [...] "The Gills" [...] {{in their}} first season back in League One, however, once again {{the latter half of}} his season was blighted by injury. The 25-year-old Gillingham captain suffered a broken arm after taking a kick on the forearm in a 1–1 draw with Leyton Orient on 23 February 2010. A specialist subsequently confirmed that this injury would sideline him for approximately six weeks. By the time of his return the Gills were embroiled in a battle to avoid relegation and their fortunes took {{a turn for the worse}} when Fuller suffered a broken nose mere seconds after kick-off after a clash of heads with team-mate Darren Dennehy in what would go on to be a 3–2 win over Leeds United on 17 April 2010; he was substituted by Jack Payne in the fourth minute of play. Fuller was unable to prevent the Gills' relegation <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> into League Two after he was sidelined for the rest of the season, undergoing surgery on his broken nose a few days after the incident. In spite of this, however, he was offered a two-year contract extension, along with team-mate Garry Richards, by new Gills manager Andy Hessenthaler on 25 March 2010. He accepted the terms and on 4 June 2010 it was announced that he had signed a new contract along with striker Dennis Oli.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days morale began to sink when Bf 109s from 7./JG 26, led by Oberleutnant Joachim Müncheberg {{appeared}} over Malta and immediately took a toll of Hurricanes. The British fighter could not match the performance of the Bf 109. MacLachlan took a flight of them by surprise on the 11 February but the German pilots spotted them in time, climbed and dived. According to MacLachlan they [...] "left us standing"—in his diary he noted the poor morale of the squadron owing {{to the success of the}} Bf 109s and he recorded the desperation of pilots eager to shoot one down. On 16 February 1941 MacLachlan's Hurricane Mk. Ia (V7731) was again in battle with the Luftwaffe. In the morning his squadron engaged Bf 109s over Malta. After careful manoeuvring he managed to get onto the tail of a Bf 109 but neglected to check his own six o'clock position. He was hit by cannon fire which shattered his engine and cockpit. His left arm began bleeding profusely and ceased to function. He managed to remove his helmet and radio equipment and <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> the canopy and jump out. MacLachlan gave up trying to reach for his ripcord, assuming it must have been shot off. Later, MacLachlan said he had almost given up altogether when the thought of his mother reading the telegram informing her he had been killed in action spurred him on to try once again. He struggled and found the ripcord and deployed his parachute. Exhausted, he landed in a garden and lay there before being recovered.|$|E
2500|$|The foot pedals <b>slide</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth}} and also {{move up and down}} like {{accelerator}} pedals. Pointman uses these inputs to control the avatar's lower body. The translational sliding (apart then together) is mapped to control the separation of the avatar's legs, simulating stepping when the avatar is upright and crawling when the avatar is prone. This allows users to take precise, measured steps when moving around obstacles or cover, and to continuously vary their speed over a realistic range of walking, running and crawling gaits. [...] The up-down movement of the pedals is mapped to control the avatar's postural height via the flexing of the avatar's legs. [...] This allows the avatar to continuously transition from standing tall to a low crouch (or kneel when the legs are apart), and when prone from hands-and-knees to belly-on-the-ground. The ability to precisely control their avatar's postural height allows users to make better use of cover and concealment, and to look and shoot out from behind cover while minimizing their exposure.|$|E
